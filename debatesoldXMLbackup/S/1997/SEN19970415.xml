      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline the present position in relation to the application by Aeroflot airlines for fifth freedom rights from Shannon Airport to a number of US destinations.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mulcahy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide the necessary funding to enable the repair of the roof and the complete refurbishment of the toilets at the girls and boys primary and junior schools at Sperrin Road, Drimnagh, Dublin 12, given their unacceptable condition.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Manning of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The refusal of the Minister for Education to recognise, for incremental purposes, the teaching years of B.Ed. national school teachers at St. Michael's junior school, Ailesbury Road, Dublin 4.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her contract with the Dublin School of English and ensure payment of the £36,362 outstanding.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint a remedial teacher under the rural disadvantage scheme to St. Patrick's national school, Oram, Castleblayney, County Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator Taylor-Quinn's and Senator Mulcahy's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader for an update of the business to be conducted for the rest of the session.  It may be difficult for him to give an accurate account of the legislation the Government wants to enact before the end of session but I ask him to give details of next week's Business also.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Leader is as alarmed as anybody about the present meningitis scare.  I am also sure every constituency has been affected in some way by this tragedy.  My colleague, Deputy Cowen, called for the establishment of a national monitoring centre and I ask the Leader to use his good offices to ask the Minister for Health to do that as soon as possible and to embark on a proactive campaign of information for all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I subscribe to Senator Wright's point about the business for the next couple of weeks.  We all recognise that it looks as though the Government is preparing for an election which will be called on the last day of the month&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the first week of next month.  It is everybody's duty to co-operate in the passing of legislation where that is possible.  The Independent Senators want to co-operate but we would prefer to have the business and likely hours of sitting laid out for the next three or four weeks so that people can plan.  We should be prepared to co-operate with each other on that basis. If we have difficulty with sections or amendments to Bills, we will deal with them in the normal manner but the Leader can feel confident that he can indicate his plans to us and seek the maximum level of co-operation in trying to clear the decks.  Nobody wants to have legislation lying around which needs to be debated.  I also recognise that this House would continue anyway after the calling of an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never enter into matters of industrial relations because it is not helpful to do so but there is a genuine concern abroad about the precise position of the different Garda representative bodies. There is confusion even among those of us who <Col N="1451" /> would purport to understand industrial relations. It is necessary to clear the air.</P>
    <P>Senators sought to raise six matters on the Adjournment today and four or five of them relate to schools in need of attention.  If the Minister published a list of what was to be done, how it would be done and when on which we could depend it would save the House and the civil servants much time and would clear the air.  I ask the Leader that such a list be provided.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of how busy we are over the next number of weeks, I want to debate economic and monetary union and associated matters.  I have asked time and again to have such a debate and the Leader has agreed.  It is not a matter of embarrassing the Government as I have no interest in that and I am not talking about debating a motion which may cause difficulty.  Points must be made on this issue and we must be informed and educated about it.  A date for such a debate should be agreed in the next number of days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse calls for the Leader to clarify arrangements for the coming weeks, state the number of days the House will be sitting and indicate the proposed programme of legislation. Will he provide assurances that time motions will not be tabled or that the Committee Stage of any Bill will not be cut short?  The Leader has a good record in that respect and I am sure this will continue until the end of the session.</P>
      <P>Last week, by way of an emergency debate, I attempted to raise the current situation relating to agriculture.  The Leader is aware that, during the previous week, calls were made to deal with this matter which will be debated elsewhere this evening.  Senator Honan and I tabled a motion about the crisis in agriculture &mdash; item 30, motion No. 24 &mdash; and we would like clarification in respect of the Government's approach to European export funds, special beef premia and the reopening of third country markets for carcass beef and live exports.  We are also seeking clarification about an apparent contradiction in the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry's approach to national compensation.  At a major meeting of the Irish Farmers Association in the Davenport Hotel, the Minister stated that national compensation would be paid for losses suffered as a result of currency revaluations. However, in reply to a parliamentary question in the Dáil he stated there would be no compensation. It is important that the Minister's exact approach be clarified.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on economic and monetary union.  What will be our policy on this issue in the likely event that the United Kingdom remains outside European Monetary Union when Ireland joins?  What will be the implications of such a development for exporters, in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> My final point relates to Senator O'Toole's request for a resolution to the dispute involving Garda representative bodies.  It was unedifying to hear each side castigate the other on national radio this morning.  It is in everyone's interests to have the situation resolved.  In the circumstances, perhaps we should congratulate the Minister for Justice for fulfilling one promise in getting the gardaí back on to the streets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone agrees that the House should carry out as much productive legislative work as possible during the next number of weeks in case the session does not last much longer.  As far as I am aware, the Dáil has almost completed its deliberations on the Working Time Bill and the Youth Work Bill.  Are these likely to be introduced in the Seanad in the near future?</P>
      <P>The other matter I wish to raise involves the disturbing anti-child practices carried out in some créches and child care facilities, which were revealed in the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i>  I am aware that the vast majority of these facilities are well run, but I welcome the fact that this Pandora's box was opened and will be dealt with by the regulations provided for under section 7 of the Child Care Act.  A great deal of discussion has already taken place among those involved in child care in respect of the regulations but they are now being debated more widely.  I know the House will be obliged to use much of its available time to deal with legislation during the coming weeks. However, if time cannot be made available for a short debate on this issue, will the Department of Health issue public information advertisements or bulletins in newspapers so that people will understand what the regulations entail?  I believe the health boards intend to do so and to begin their work in the near future.  Fianna Fáil plans to issue proposals on child care at the end of this week and I would welcome it if these added to the debate on this matter.  This important matter must be discussed and understood more widely.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader indicate if we will have an opportunity in this session to discuss local authority funding?  I have raised this urgent matter on numerous occasions.  The Taoiseach's office wrote to local authorities sending them information from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of the Environment with regard to the establishment of community enterprise groups and the policy document &ldquo;Better Local Government&rdquo; which is a programme for change for local government.  We need to discuss this matter, which will have a fundamental effect on the House because the changes proposed will affect the people we represent.</P>
      <P>We are prevented from debating local authority funding while the Government is tinkering with it by removing water charges and providing funding from motor taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  Are we to drift into an election with the local authorities not knowing where they stand?  My local authority will be worse off by millions of pounds through the removal of water charges and their replacement with funds from motor tax.  How will the difference will be made up.  Where will my local authority get the funds to bridge the gap?  I appeal to the Leader to give me an opportunity to put questions to the Minister, especially given that the Taoiseach has written to the Minister for the Environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to give us an opportunity to discharge our responsibility to the House and to those who elected us.  I have raised this matter many times.  I am concerned about the problem and I wonder why the Leader wants to avoid it.  Is the Minister afraid to come to the House?  He is not afraid to discuss the matter on RTÉ.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the ongoing dispute at Irish Life which nobody seems prepared to discuss.  It is a semi-State body and the dispute has been going on for more than 11 weeks.  Is it possible to have information from the relevant Minister on the matter?  The dispute has gone on too long.  Irish Life is a semi-State body which must look to the future by involving itself in takeovers and ensuring its business is run properly. Will the Leader seek information on the matter for us?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Dardis in asking for an urgent debate on agriculture.  The agricultural sector is very important to our economy.  It impinges on about one quarter of our total GNP and cannot be seen as a sectional interest.  A Labour Party candidate expressed views about farming concerns in yesterday's newspapers when she said they represent strident, sectional demands and pre-election posturing by the farming sector. Is that the view of the Government parties on the interests of the hard pressed farmers?  We need to discuss agriculture calmly and fully.</P>
      <P>It is to be noted that the only EU Government which has not, as yet, given compensation from its own resources to farmers who have suffered from revaluation is the Irish Government.  The Germans and Dutch have done so but Ireland has not.  Perhaps that will be explained.  Is it because the Government's view is that this is just a strident sectional interest making posturing demands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second query relates to the Government's collective responsibility.  Could the Leader or any <Col N="1454" /> member on the Government side confirm the statement made on television by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, that he had no knowledge of and was not consulted on the Tánaiste's statement to the Labour Party conference?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The RUC should be congratulated on finding the gun apparently used by snipers in south Armagh.  I also wish to record my absolute deprecation of the burning of churches in the North of Ireland.  This is a new low.  We have seen the violation of a series of taboos recently by both sides: the targeting of a working mother by the IRA and the shooting up of a children's ward in a hospital.  Now we have the violation of another taboo which is an extraordinary level of barbarism to which both sides seem to have sunk, particularly the loyalists.  It is important that the House send a message that this behaviour is completely <Col N="1455" /> unacceptable.  I speak as a member of the Church of Ireland and what is being done in the name of religion in the North is not an expression of Protestantism or any kind of Christianity.  It is an expression of barbarism and savagery.  All civilised people should condemn the burning of churches of any religion.  I hope that the reformed religions in areas where churches have been burnt will offer the hospitality of their church premises so that Mass can continue to be celebrated for their fellow citizens.</P>
      <P>Time is very limited for a discussion on Luas but I am very concerned that we have not had a date for the public inquiry and the plans are apparently advancing.  It seems that the whole democratic process is being undermined by the Civil Service being allowed to create facts which can never subsequently be evaluated, no matter what evidence exists.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that a distinguished member of the British Labour Party, Dr. Mo Mowlam, who will certainly have a significant role to play regarding this country after the next election, was treated in a most dastardly fashion by the British press.  I am glad we have not sunk to that level in this country and we should be glad we have decent journalists. This woman was castigated for her appearance by certain sections of the press and was forced into explaining that she had been suffering from a brain tumour.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is irrelevant to Senator O'Kennedy's election campaign and perhaps a little less self interested, but it is important to put these concerns on record.  It is outrageous that somebody should be criticised for their personal appearance and be forced to make a statement that they had had radiation therapy which led to hair loss.  We are lucky to have a different type of press and I hope its standards will be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in seeking urgent clarification of the situation pertaining to the representative associations of the Garda Síochána.  I have repeatedly told the House that internal matters of the Garda Síochána, especially the pay dispute, should not form part of the law and order debate during the general election campaign.  People are interested in that debate but they are not interested in the internal wranglings of Garda representative associations, which ultimately might get in the way of achieving an efficient Garda force.  The Minister should come before the House as a matter of urgency and explain why there is such disquiet in Garda ranks and what her response will be.  What is her attitude <Col N="1456" /> to tomorrow's planned march on the Dáil by gardaí?  Is she doing anything to prevent it?</P>
      <P>There is widespread public disquiet about the allegation that somebody who committed manslaughter on more than one occasion was participating in a FÁS course in Cork.  The matter is being investigated by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, and it raises disquieting questions.  Did the Garda Síochána know about this one year ago and, if so, did the Garda bring it to the attention of the Minister for Justice?  If she knew about it, did she do anything about it?</P>

      <P>It is in so far as it might affect other criminals who might be employed on FÁS courses or other criminals who, having escaped justice in England, might be currently living in Ireland.  What are the procedures in the Department of Justice to monitor this?  When the Minister for Enterprise and Employment receives the report from FÁS the House should be made aware of it.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Senator Norris for raising the burning of churches in Northern Ireland.  All Members of the House deprecate and condemn such barbarous acts.</P>
      <P>I could not believe the television pictures, beamed from the so called &ldquo;peace line&rdquo; in Belfast, of Catholic families being burned out of their houses by loyalist thugs.  In some cases they carried their belongings in their hands, in others trailers and vans were used.  Many of the families had lived in those residences for several for several decades.  I thought such things happened in other countries or, to paraphrase former British Prime Minister Chamberlain when speaking about Czechoslovakia, in a faraway country of which we know little.  Sometimes people in the South tend to look on Northern Ireland as a faraway country of which they know or care little.</P>
      <P>This House has a responsibility to speak for the Nationalist people in Northern Ireland.  This is a Nationalist Parliament.  If we do not speak for them, who does?  The IRA?</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Independent Senators for clarifying that point, although they know what I meant.  If this Parliament does not speak for the people who have been driven out of their homes, the only people who will do so will be the so called defenders of the Nationalist <Col N="1457" /> people in Northern Ireland &mdash; the IRA.  Will the Leader convey the outrage of this House at what we witnessed last weekend and make the strongest representations, through the Maryfield Secretariat and Anglo-Irish Agreement, directly to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and, if necessary, to the Prime Minister, Mr. Major?  If we allow these incidents to pass unnoticed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must respond to Senator Mooney's comments on the displacement of Catholics from their homes in the Tiger's Bay and Limestone Road areas of Belfast.  This is one of the oldest problems.  It is not much good condemning those who carried clubs and drove those people out.  Sixty years ago, when I was only a young boy at school, my uncle, who was a Catholic and lived in the same area, was driven out of his home; 20 years ago, my brother, a Protestant, was driven out of a Catholic area by young men wielding hurley sticks.  We should not condemn the mobs who do this; we should do something concrete about the politicians who put the idea to carry out these acts into those people's heads. This is where inaction seems to exist.  What have politicians on both sides done by words and promises to stir up these people?  We should ease up on promises made that these people will be introduced to talks at short notice.  Lengthening the notice the Foreign Secretary gives them is one way the problem can be handled at source.</P>

      <P>Senators Wright, O'Toole, Dardis and others asked about the programme of legislation for the rest of the session.  I would like to be more specific but I cannot.  I am working on the assumption the election will be in October with the possibility of it being in June, so I must make provision for both possibilities.  Colleagues can be assured that, over the coming weeks, we will sit three days per week at least and maybe four.  I do not know when the election will be and I will have to work on the best guess available to me.</P>

    <P>I hope the legislation on the Order Paper will be dealt with in that period &mdash; the Equal Status Bill, the Universities Bill, the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, the Organisation of Working Time Bill and the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill.  Other Bills will be coming to us from the other House, &mdash; the Bail Bill, the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, <Col N="1458" /> Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, the Bill dealing with the replacement of water charges and a number of others.  We will not be dealing with the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>I will do my best, as I have during the past sessions, to keep colleagues abreast of the timetable. I am not completely in control of my destiny in this matter.  It will be my job to try and deal with as much legislation as possible.  In that context, I greatly welcome the offer of co-operation from Senator O'Toole and others in providing for the orderly conduct of business.  I assure Senator Dardis there will be no question of shortening any Committee Stage debates.</P>
    <P>Senator Wright asked about the meningitis scare.  I will refer that to the Minister for Health and will see if time can be made available for him to speak on it to the House.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and others raised the issue of the confusion caused by the continuing squabbling between the Garda representative bodies.  I do not know what anyone can do at this stage. There have been many initiatives, many people have tried to sort out this problem and people have still left some of the organisations.  The Minister has produced legislation but, if the people involved do not want to sort out the matter themselves, there is little anyone else can do. This is an unedifying scandal and a bad example to the rest of the community.  This morning's spectacle of the leaders of two major Garda organisations squabbling over the airwaves does no credit to anyone.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Finance said he is keen that we have a debate on economic and monetary union.  However, I have difficulty finding time for the debates already requested.  If possible I will make time available for a debate on agriculture.  The Minister is anxious to address the House.  However, legislation is my first priority.</P>
    <P>The Working Time Bill has been ordered for Second Stage and will take place soon.  We should not be alarmist about creches but there are questions to be answered and we may find a forum for such a debate.</P>
    <P>We had a debate on local authority funding within the last few weeks; it is on the Order Paper.  The Minister put the Government's policy on the record of the House.  I will continue this debate if I can find time.  Senator Cregan might raise the strike in Irish Life on the Adjournment. There are questions to be answered.  Senator O'Kennedy would not expect me to comment on the content of a late night television chat show and I will not do so.</P>
    <P>Some Senators referred to Northern Ireland.  I applaud the seizure of the deadly weapon of destruction by the RUC and the recent arms finds by the Garda Siochána.  The more of these weapons that are taken out of commission the better. The burning of churches is deeply sinister.  It is <Col N="1459" /> hard not to believe that there are evil forces at work whose intention it is to stir up inter-communal hatred to an even greater level.  This is one of the worst developments since the Troubles began.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney and Senator McAughtry were right; I do not agree with Senator McAughtry were that there is no point in condemning those who use weapons of terror to drive people from their homes.  I accept his point that deeper forces lie behind these events.  There is a vacuum in political leadership and political malice may also exist. Both sides of the House are close on this issue.</P>
    <P>I cannot give Senator Norris a date for a discussion of Luas.  Senator Mulcahy raised the issue of the individual apprehended in Cork yesterday. There is something disturbing about this but we should wait until the Minister establishes the facts and then hold a discussion.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Equal Status Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased and honoured to introduce this important measure which has the potential to improve the lives of many people in this country.</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill will, for the first time, provide protection against discrimination outside the field of employment.  It deals with discrimination on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community and gives those who are discriminated against a statutory means of redress.  It has a broad ranging scope covering provision of personal property and services, disposal of land and accommodation, education, partnerships and registered clubs.  This measure parallels and complements the Employment Equality Bill which prohibits discrimination on similar grounds in the workplace.</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill is about equality and it is about rights.  It is based on the principle that everyone has an equal right to participate in our society.  People should not be denied access to services, facilities or amenities just because of their skin colour, their disability or their membership of the travelling community.  Everyone, male or female, white or black, old or young, with or without disability, should be seen as being of equal worth and entitlement.  Each person should be treated on his or her own merits and not on the basis of a prejudice or stereotype.  We are all entitled not to be the victims of unjust discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary reason for bringing forward this measure is to provide protection against discrimination for those who up to now have had no <Col N="1460" /> statutory means of redress.  Unfortunately, for too many people, discrimination has been and continues to be an unacceptable reality.  Fr. Micheál MacGréil's recent book, <i>Prejudice in Ireland Revisited,</i> while showing an improvement in some areas, records a growing level of social prejudice against travellers together with marked prejudice against, and intolerance of, some religious groups, homosexuals and persons with certain disabilities, among others.  Such negative and hostile attitudes can, and do, manifest themselves in various forms of discrimination.</P>
    <P>At present there is no legal redress for the woman who cannot become a member of a local golf club simply because she is a woman, the person who is refused entry to a pub because he or she uses a wheelchair or the black person who is not given a flat simply because of his or her skin colour.  Such people want more than sympathy, they want the protection of the law.  I have received numerous letters describing the stress, embarrassment, frustration and sense of injustice and exclusion experienced by victims of discrimination. Groups representing persons who have experienced discrimination, be they women, travellers, gays, racial minorities or people with disabilities, have been pressing for legislation on these lines for some considerable time and are anxious to see this measure in place.</P>
    <P>In the absence of such legislation, Ireland cannot ratify the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  This convention has now been ratified by 155 countries, including all of our EU partners.  The enactment of the Equal Status Bill is also necessary to enable us to lift a reservation on the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  Legislation on the lines of this Bill is, in various forms, commonplace elsewhere in the EU and in many other democracies.</P>
    <P>There is now widespread acceptance of the principle of equal status legislation.  The enactment of an Equal Status Bill has been a fundamental element of the programmes of this and the previous Government.  It has been endorsed by the social partners in both the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and Partnership 2000. Recommendations relating to anti-discrimination legislation were contained in the Reports of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, the Task Force on the Travelling Community and the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that while anti-discrimination legislation of this type is new to Ireland it has existed in many other countries for years.  In developing this Bill I have drawn on the provisions of other countries, particularly the common law jurisdictions such as the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  Review and comparison of the legislation of other countries and detailed discussion with those involved in the <Col N="1461" /> implementation of such legislation have been an important element of the Bill's preparation.</P>
    <P>Senators may note that when anti-discrimination legislation was introduced in other countries there were fears of damage to business or of fraudulent claims similar to those which have been expressed about the present Bill.  Such fears were not in fact realised and anti-discrimination legislation works well and is accepted as a normal feature of life in other countries.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the Bill has also involved extensive consultation with interested parties. From the outset I decided that the views and proposals of all interested parties should be sought. In 1993 I circulated a consultative document to over 80 persons and groups.  Since then I have had discussions with and received submissions from numerous and varied interest groups.  Some groups have had discussions on several occasions with officials of my Department.  I have heard the views of those representative of vintners, traveller interests, retailers, the insurance industry, gays and lesbians, people with disabilities, racial minorities, property owners and those pressing for greater equality for women in golf, among many others.  All submissions received were carefully examined in the preparation of the legislation. Indeed, the process of consultation did not end there.  The Bill was significantly amended during its passage through the Dáil in response to the various comments and suggestions made in the House and elsewhere following its publication.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some general points about what the Bill does and does not do.  There has been much apprehension and considerable misunderstanding about the effect of the Bill on publicans and other commercial interests.  I want to make it clear that the Bill will outlaw discrimination only on specified grounds.  It will not require traders to admit all comers.  It will not prevent business people in the ordinary day-to-day running of their business from refusing service to someone because of misconduct, security concerns or lack of hygiene.  It will not give any protection whatsoever to trouble makers or anti-social elements.</P>
    <P>In response to concerns expressed by publicans and other traders, I invited proposals for safeguards to be included in the Bill which would meet such concerns.  A number of such proposals were made and having carefully considered them I have included important safeguards in the Bill which will meet these concerns without in any way diluting the Bill's basic objectives.  While I will discuss these at a later stage, I wish to draw Senators' attention, in particular, to sections 17 and 75 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators may have noticed that several of the cross references in Part III of the Bill and one in section 64 are incorrect.  There was a substantial amendment to Part III on Report Stage in the Dáil and because of a procedural oversight the appropriate cross references could not be included in the published version of the Bill as <Col N="1462" /> passed by Dáil Éireann.  I will be introducing some technical amendments to correct these cross references.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the specific provisions of the Bill.  Part I defines terms used in the Bill. Senators may wish to note the broad definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in section 2.  There is also a comprehensive definition of &ldquo;services&rdquo; which includes services and facilities of any nature including access to and use of any place, banking or insurance services, facilities for entertainment, recreation or refreshment, cultural activities, transport or travel and professional or trade services. It does not include services provided under a contract of service, services which are not generally available to the public or services covered by the Employment Equality Bill.</P>
    <P>The key element of this Part is section 3 which sets out what is meant by discrimination.  Discrimination occurs where, on discriminatory grounds that existed, exist, are believed to exist or are considered likely to come into existence, a person is treated less favourably than another person is, has been or would be treated.  It also occurs where an organisation &mdash; a gay and lesbian society, for example &mdash; is treated less favourably because of the nature of its membership or where a person is treated less favourably because of their association with a person or organisation to whom the discriminatory grounds apply.  A further form of discrimination occurs where a requirement to comply with a condition has a disproportionately adverse effect on a particular category of person and this requirement cannot be justified as being reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.  This form of discrimination is commonly known as &ldquo;indirect discrimination&rdquo; although the term does not appear in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The discriminatory grounds are gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race &mdash; covering race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origin &mdash; and membership of the travelling community.  Victimisation of a person because of their involvement in proceedings under this Bill is also treated as a discriminatory ground.  I cannot emphasise too strongly that the Bill deals with discrimination on these grounds alone and does not affect differences of treatment based on other grounds.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5, which contain particular provisions related to persons with disabilities, supplement the meaning of discrimination given in section 3.  The concept of &ldquo;undue difficulty&rdquo; is introduced in section 4 in recognition of the fact that, in some limited circumstances, it would be impractical or extremely difficult to meet the needs of persons with a disability.  Whether undue difficulty arises will depend on a number of factors, including whether catering for a person with a disability would entail difficulty, disruption or cost which is excessive by reference to the benefits accruing to all concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> Section 5 extends the meaning of discrimination to include refusal to do what is reasonably necessary to allow a person with a disability to avail satisfactorily of a service to which he or she would otherwise have access unless what is required would give rise to undue difficulty.  What is reasonably necessary may include special treatment or the provision of special facilities. Although the term &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; is not used, this is, in effect, the &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; provision which was sought by the various interest groups concerned.  Section 5 also provides that, subject to the &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; requirement, it will not be regarded as discrimination to refuse or limit a service to a person with a disability where, because of the disability, the person concerned cannot comply with conditions that reasonably apply to the provision of the service.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with discrimination in particular areas.  Discrimination in the provision of personal property and services is prohibited in section 6.  There are a number of exceptions for differences of treatment in certain circumstances in particular areas, such as insurance, sporting events and entertainment.  Among these exclusions are one-time dispositions other than in the course of a business or trade, for example, a private sale of a car.  Reasonable differences of treatment in the area of insurance and finance which are based on actuarial or similar data are exempt.  Examples of this would be the different treatment of persons under 25 in relation to motor insurance and the different treatment of persons on age grounds in relation to life assurance. Differences of treatment of persons on the grounds of gender, age, disability, nationality or national origin are permissible in relation to sporting facilities and events.  Thus, for example, the Bill recognises and allows for different events, such as women's or men's football teams, under-21 football teams or games for people with a disability. As these examples show, the various exceptions reflect what most people would regard as acceptable and necessary differences of treatment.</P>
    <P>Discrimination in land dispositions and provision of accommodation is also prohibited, subject to a number of exclusions.  Among the exemptions are disposals by will or gift, small premises where the accommodation provider continues to live on the premises, accommodation intended for use by persons of one gender and refuges and nursing homes.  Educational establishments may not discriminate against students in relation to matters such as admission or access to courses.  A number of exemptions are also provided for.</P>
    <P>Section 9 prohibits discrimination by firms of partners and so on in relation to the admission of partners or members, the status of partners or members and expulsion or other sanctions.  This <Col N="1464" /> provision has been included &mdash; in so far as gender, pregnancy and marital status are concerned &mdash; on foot of EU Directive 86/613 on the equal treatment of self-employed persons.  Similar provisions are to be found in anti-discrimination legislation in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The unjustified exclusion of women from equal participation in golf clubs and similar sporting or recreational clubs was highlighted by the Second Commission on the Status of Women which recommended legislative measures to deal with this.  I have no doubt that this is an issue on which many women, and indeed men, feel very strongly. While the number of discriminating clubs may be decreasing, unequal treatment continues to exist and I do not think equality in this area will be achieved by education and persuasion alone.</P>
    <P>The approach taken in relation to discriminating clubs in section 10, however, differs from that taken in other areas.  The Bill does not prohibit discrimination by clubs against members or potential members.  Instead, it seeks to discourage such discrimination by allowing a complainant to apply for a determination from the District Court that a registered club, that is, one which can sell intoxicating liquor, is a discriminating club.  If the club is determined by the District Court to be a discriminating club, it would not be entitled to renew its certificate of registration and would not be entitled to public funds or the use of publicly owned recreational facilities until it had rectified the situation.  However, I will be providing a six month lead-in time for this section and I hope clubs will put their house in order voluntarily and that this particular section will not have to be used.</P>
    <P>A number of exemptions are provided in section 11 in relation to registered clubs.  Clubs are not regarded as discriminating just because they cater for persons of a particular religion, age, nationality or ethnic origin.  It is also permissible for a club to provide separate, but equivalent, facilities for particular age groups or different sexes in certain circumstances.  Relevant and reasonably justifiable differences of treatment in relation to sporting facilities or events based on gender, age, disability, nationality or national origin are permissible.  Certain positive action measures designed to promote greater equality are also exempted.</P>
    <P>In section 13, sexual harassment or harassment based on any of the discriminatory grounds is prohibited in the areas covered by the Bill.  A person in authority in an educational establishment, an organisation or club or a partnership, a person providing services or accommodation or disposing of personal property or land may not sexually harass or harass a student, member, customer, etc., as the case may be.  Furthermore, a person who is responsible for the operation of an educational establishment or a place at which goods, services or accommodation facilities are offered to the public may not allow a student, customer, <Col N="1465" /> etc., to suffer sexual harassment or harassment there.  It will, however, be a defence for the person responsible to show that he or she took reasonably practicable steps to prevent such harassment.</P>
    <P>The definitions of sexual and other harassment were substantially amended in the Dáil following changes to the Employment Equality Bill.  The provisions of the two Bills are &mdash; in essence, if not in actual wording &mdash; the same.  Sexual harassment is defined as an act of physical intimacy, a request for sexual favours or an act or conduct with sexual connotations which is unwelcome and could reasonably be regarded as sexually offensive, humiliating or intimidating, or where a <i>quid pro quo</i> element is involved.  Harassment is defined as an offensive, humiliating or intimidating act or conduct based on any of the discriminatory grounds.</P>
    <P>Section 14 prohibits any form of advertising which indicates an intention to discriminate, to sexually harass or to harass.  Senators will note the comprehensive definition of advertisement which includes every form of advertisement, whether to the public or not, and whether in a newspaper or any other publication, on television or radio or by display of a notice or other means.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned some of the specific exemptions which apply to particular areas. There are also some exemptions of application in sections 16 and 17.  For example, actions which are required to be done by or under statute, court order or EU law are exempt, as are bona fide positive action measures.  A reasonable preferential charge for persons together with their children, married couples, persons in a specific age group or a person with a disability is permissible. Treating a person who has a disability differently to prevent that person causing harm is acceptable, as is differential treatment in the exercise of clinical judgment.</P>
    <P>Section 17 contains some important safeguards. The safeguard in subsection (1) makes it clear that a service provider or similar person is not required to serve a customer if the service provider has reasonable grounds, other than discriminatory grounds, for the belief that provision of the service would create a substantial risk of criminal or disorderly conduct or behaviour or cause damage to property.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) also provides that action taken in good faith for the sole purpose of complying with the Licensing Acts is not discrimination. These safeguards are intended to meet the legitimate concerns of vintners and other traders without interfering with the Bill's central thrust of outlawing discrimination.</P>
    <P>I regard sections 19 to 21 as a particularly important aspect of the Bill.  They make special provisions for the needs of persons with a disability in the area of transport accessibility and convenience in using public streets and pavements. They provide for regulations requiring <Col N="1466" /> that buses and trains, and bus and train stations, be readily accessible to persons with disabilities. In addition, road authorities must provide kerb ramps or similar features when constructing or altering public paths.  The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities laid particular emphasis on the right of persons with a disability to the same freedom that able bodied people have to get out and about.  The inclusion of these provisions recognises the importance of transport and ease of mobility in the lives of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the enforcement provisions under Part III of the Bill.  Claims of discrimination or harassment may be referred to the Director of Equality Investigations, an independent official operating under the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  This office will provide a simple, inexpensive and speedy means of redress for victims of discrimination.  I have already said that the decision on whether a club is a discriminating club is a matter for the District Court and I would emphasise that the Director of Equality Investigations will have no function in the matter of discriminating clubs.</P>
    <P>There will be an alternative avenue of redress for claims under section 9 to which the EU Directive on Self-Employed Activity is relevant &mdash; broadly speaking, gender, pregnancy or marital status based cases involving firms.  In such cases, there will be a right to take civil proceedings but the director will not investigate or decide on a case if such proceedings have commenced.</P>
    <P>Much of Part III, sections 23 to 41, is concerned with the procedures applicable to claims referred to the director.  Subject to certain modifications and exceptions, these enforcement procedures correspond to those applicable to cases referred to the director under the Employment Equality Bill.  Senators may wish to note the following aspects of the redress procedures.</P>
    <P>A claim referred to the director under this Bill must be preceded by an initial notification to the respondent within two months of the alleged discrimination, or of its most recent occurrence.  This requirement is intended to put the respondent on notice and give him or her the opportunity to take remedial action.  There is a six month limit for referral of claims to the director, which may be extended in exceptional circumstances to 12 months.  The director may at any time dismiss a claim in which the complainant has insufficient interest or which is made in bad faith or is trivial, vexatious or frivolous.  The director may investigate a claim or, alternatively, seek to resolve the matter by mediation.  Having investigated a claim, the director may award compensation and/or require that a particular course of action be taken.  Compensation is limited to the maximum that could be awarded in a civil case in contract, currently £5,000 &mdash; that is to say, the jurisdiction of the District Court for the time being.  The director will have strong investigative powers to <Col N="1467" /> enter premises, to obtain relevant information through interview or otherwise and to ensure the imposition of sanctions in the event of failure or refusal by persons to co-operate with an investigation.</P>
    <P>Decisions of the director may be appealed to the Circuit Court within 42 days.</P>
    <P>The Equality Authority will have the power under section 26 to refer cases to the director. Such cases could involve discrimination against a group of persons or a situation where the person concerned is not in a position to bring the case themselves.  The authority may also refer cases involving prohibited advertising, procurement of discrimination or failure to provide kerb ramps or to comply with regulations on transport accessibility.  It will also have the power to seek injunctions.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides for a restructured Equality Authority with an extended remit covering both employment and non-employment areas.  The Equality Authority, currently known as the Employment Equality Agency but to be renamed under the Employment Equality Bill, will have a new composition to reflect its altered mandate.  It will have 12 members, including a chairperson, of which at least five will be women and at least five men.  Of the ordinary members, two will be nominated by employer organisations and two by employee organisations.  The remainder of the ordinary members will be persons with knowledge or experience of matters relevant to the functions of the authority.</P>
    <P>The general functions of the authority, as outlined in section 54, include working towards the elimination of discrimination; promotion of equality of opportunity in matters relating to this Bill or the Employment Equality Bill; provision of information on, and review of, the Equal Status Bill, the Maternity Protection Act, the Adoptive Leave Act and the Employment Equality Bill and review of the equal treatment aspects of the Pensions Act, 1990.  The authority is also given specific functions under various provisions of both Bills.</P>
    <P>The authority is given a number of instruments with which to pursue its functions.  It may undertake research and information activities and charge for these.  It may also conduct investigations. If, arising from an investigation, the authority finds that a person is discriminating or is otherwise in breach of either the Employment Equality Bill or the Equal Status Bill, it may serve a non-discrimination notice requiring the person to take remedial action.  The High Court or the Circuit Court may, on the motion of the authority, grant an injunction for failure to comply with a non-discrimination notice.</P>
    <P>Another significant feature of the authority's remit is that it may give assistance in cases under both Bills where an important matter of principle is involved or where it would not be reasonable to <Col N="1468" /> expect the person concerned to present the case adequately without assistance.  It should be noted that assistance may be given by the authority not only at any stage in relation to references to the Director of Equality Investigations, the Labour Court or the District Court, as the case may be, but in relation to any proceedings arising from such references.</P>
    <P>Also noteworthy is the authority's power to prepare codes of practice aimed at the elimination of discrimination or the promotion of equality.  Following my approval, such codes are admissible as evidence in a court.</P>
    <P>Part V contains various general provisions.  I would draw attention to section 75, which provides that parties to an investigation by the Director of Equality Investigations, witnesses before the director or the authority, or persons required to supply information to the director or authority, will have the same immunities and privileges as a witness before the High Court.  This section will, I believe, allay any concerns that a person involved in proceedings under this legislation might find themselves sued for defamation.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious to Senators that there is a close relationship between this Bill and the Employment Equality Bill which the President has referred to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. The Equal Status Bill would be incomplete if the Employment Equality Bill is not also enacted.  I do not intend, therefore, to make any orders commencing the Equal Status Act at least until the Supreme Court gives its decision on the Employment Equality Bill.  If that decision upholds the constitutionality of the Bill, both measures can be given effect as appropriate in the ordinary way.  Otherwise, the whole subject will have to be revisited by the Government and the Oireachtas.  I am concerned, particularly in light of representations I have received from groups which will enjoy protection in the Equal Status Bill, to ensure that it becomes law as quickly as possible and, therefore, I am proceeding in this way instead of holding over further consideration of the Bill in this House until after the court's decision.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Bill has been a long time in gestation.  As it breaks new ground and covers a variety of categories and range of areas, its preparation has necessarily been a complex and difficult task.  It is part of a wide ranging programme of measures aimed at the promotion of greater equality and the full participation of all groups in the economic, social and cultural life of this country. Its provisions and those of the Employment Equality Bill would give Ireland a comprehensive anti-discrimination code.</P>
    <P>The equal status legislation will have a profound impact on Irish society.  I would hope not to see a multitude of cases under this legislation. Rather, my hope is that the existence of such legislation will inhibit would-be discriminators and reduce the incidence of discrimination.  While <Col N="1469" /> I recognise that legislation alone cannot change attitudes, I also hope that over time discrimination against persons simply because of factors such as their race, sexual orientation, disability or gender will become socially, as well as legally, unacceptable.  The activities of the Equality Authority in its expanded role will also contribute to this outcome.  The Equal Status Bill is a significant step towards a society of greater equality, mutual respect and tolerance.</P>
    <P>This Bill was the subject of positive debate in the Dáil and I hope to hear a similarly constructive debate in this House.  I look forward to contributions by Senators on this important legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister said this legislation, like the Employment Equality Bill, was the subject of widespread consultation.  He met a large number of people and groups with a specific interest in order to reach agreement on it.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the concerns of traders. I am grateful the Bill will not require traders to admit all comers, that it will not prevent business people in the day to day running of their business from refusing service to someone because of misconduct, security concerns or lack of hygiene and that it will not give any protection to troublemakers or to anti-social elements. People were concerned that known criminals could demand and have right of access to business premises or other establishments.  I will not deal with the concerns of vintners because my colleague, Senator Bohan, will discuss that aspect.</P>
      <P>I also welcome section 19 which deals with access for disabled persons to public transport and the need for public transport providers to ensure that new fleets are accessible to them. Two years ago members of the Centre for Independent Living protested outside the Houses of the Oireachtas and in the anteroom to this Chamber &mdash; they could not gain access to the Public Gallery &mdash; to highlight how their lives and prospects of employment were affected because they did not have access to public transport.  I welcome the fact that there will be an onus on public transport providers to ensure that new fleets are accessible to disabled people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 refers to the requirement of local authorities to provide dished footpaths, etc.  Local authorities have undertaken a programme to improve footpaths which is funded by the National Roads Authority.  However, local authorities must take into account the effect of road <Col N="1470" /> networks not just on disabled persons but also on able bodied people.  It is difficult, particularly in parts of Dublin, for able bodied people to cross roads in housing estates and it is almost impossible for those who are disabled to get across in safety because of their width and design.  Local authorities must ensure that road networks are safe for able bodied people and disabled persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a number of exceptions for differences of treatment in certain circumstances, particularly in the area of insurance, about which I am concerned.  Section 6(2) states:</P>

    <P>I am concerned that this could be misused by insurance companies or that BUPA could take it to mean it was allowed to offer insurance cover which is not community rated.  Perhaps he could clarify that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that educational establishments may not discriminate against students in relation to matters such as admissions or access to courses and that a number of exemptions are also provided for.  Perhaps he could clarify if school catchment areas are unlawful in this regard.</P>
    <P>Much attention has been given to the rights of the travelling community to have access to hotels and public houses.  Their entitlement to enjoy weddings or a social drink should be laid down in law.  An area which is of greater concern to the travelling community and me is the right of members of the travelling community to local authority housing, whether in halting sites or group housing scheme.  This is an area in which politicians must be courageous and they must not shy away from responsibility.  I am proud that the Fianna Fáil spokesperson, Deputy Flood, has taken his responsibilities seriously.  He has publicly supported proposed halting sites in the constituency he shares with the Minister when other elected members there were not willing to support the rights of the travelling community.  My position on this matter is clear.</P>
    <P>Section 7(6) states that a housing authority, pursuant to its functions under the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1992, may provide, in relation to housing accommodation, different treatment to persons based on family size, family status, marital status, <Col N="1471" /> disability, age or membership of the travelling community.  I am a little concerned about the mention of marital status in particular because it is my understanding, as a member of a local authority for 13 years, that local authorities do not take marital status into account in any way, shape or form in relation to the allocation of points or the provision of housing accommodation.  I am concerned that we are providing a right in law to a local authority to do so.</P>
    <P>Of equal concern to me is the fact that the Bill allows local authorities to discriminate on the basis of membership of the travelling community. That may mean that a specific group housing scheme could be constructed for travellers; that is positive discrimination but it also suggests that if a member of the travelling community applies for housing on Blackditch Road, for example, which is not a housing scheme specifically for travellers, he or she may not be considered for it and may only be considered for Avila Park, which is a group housing scheme for travellers.  I want the Minister to reassure me that this will not allow local authority members to create ghettos for the travelling community because many members of the travelling community do not want to live in halting sites or group housing schemes and have decided that they want to apply for a house from the normal housing list.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that women have been among the most discriminated groups in society, and we discussed this under the Employment Equality Bill.  They even had to fight for the right to vote.  Their right to equal pay must be enshrined in law.  During the passage of the Employment Equality Bill through this House I referred to the concept of a notional comparator. Since women earn slightly in excess of 60 per cent of what their male counterparts earn, there is a need to ensure that women are treated on an equal basis.  I am not sure if that can be done under this Bill but I want the matter to be addressed in any future legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has dealt in a most sensible way with clubs which discriminate.  Sanctions, such as the loss of licence or grants, are the most effective way of dealing with such groups.  I proposed to the Minister for Environment and to a previous Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment that local authorities which discriminate and do not live up to their responsibilities in terms of accommodation for the travelling community should be penalised through the withdrawal of grant assistance.  This did not receive unanimous support but the way the Minister is proposing to deal with clubs which discriminate with regard to membership on grounds of gender is the correct one.  Are the gentlemen's clubs on St. Stephen's Green still in existence?  Might we see them lose their licences in future?</P>

      <Col N="1472" /> The Minister stated that the Equal Status Bill is about equality and rights, and I agree.  This Bill probably goes as far as is possible within the legal framework but I want to put the reality of inequality in society on the record.  In Gallanstown, Ballyfermot, Dublin, ten houses have been boarded up for over two years yet decent people have had to live in appalling conditions for the past two and a half years when there is a housing crisis throughout the city and county.  Down the road in St Michael's estate, Inchicore, Dublin, there are between 50 and 60 flats boarded up. They may not be in great demand but people have come to me looking for accommodation in these areas.  This is not the environment in which other communities in Dublin and throughout Ireland have had to live.  This is a basic inequality and, for what it is worth, I bring it to the notice of the Minister.  When I contact the local authority, the staff tell me that this is unfortunate but there is no money for repairs.  No community living in private housing would tolerate the kind of conditions in which the people of Cherry Orchard or St. Michael's estate have had to live.  It represents a basic inequality in society.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, I have had meetings with Sr. Rita, the principal of Basin Lane school, who told me that she is now paying out of her own pocket to board up windows which have been vandalised to the extent that the Department can no longer repair them &mdash; and I am sure Senator O'Toole can add to this list.  She was delighted to be told by the Department that the school would be given a teacher for a special project to cope with children from dysfunctional families or difficult circumstances but she was later informed that the teacher would not be replaced and the school would have to pay for a replacement. In addition, St. Louis's school, Ballyfermot, which would be recognised as an area of disadvantage, is not included in the breaking the cycle scheme.  These representations were brought to me in the same week that the Government announced spending of £30 million on computers. A computer is a luxury which the teachers of Basin Lane cannot afford but they would be delighted to have the windows replaced and an additional remedial/resource teacher.</P>
    <P>The launch of the Ballyfermot partnership highlighted the fact that 1 per cent of young people from the area are likely to gain access to third level education.  That is a basic inequality which suggests equal status is not available in this city.</P>
    <P>In the health area, there is a five year waiting list for orthodontic treatment for a teenager.  If a person has money, he or she can receive immediate orthodontic treatment for his or her son or daughter.  Otherwise, one must sit and wait.  An ex-Labour Party colleague of the Minister highlighted on the front page of a newspaper the fact that a constituent spent 28 hours on a trolley in St. James's Hospital.  A drug abuser who has a <Col N="1473" /> medical card told me that his GP has decided not to prescribe methadone so he must rise at 5 o'clock to attend an alternative doctor who will prescribe methadone outside surgery hours but not on the medical card.  As a result, this constituent pays £50 per week for his methadone maintenance programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to crime, syringes are found strewn around housing estates and women have informed me that they must take their children to school <i>via</i> circuitous routes because they are afraid to pass areas with major drug problems where bag snatching occurs.  I know the Minister is aware of these problems but it must be put on record that, as good as it is, equal status legislation does not tackle these inequalities in society.</P>
    <P>I attended the launch of the Vincentian partnership's &ldquo;A Programme for Voter Education&rdquo; last week which was enlightening.  In the Dublin West by-election the voter turnout in a particular area was 12 per cent.  The Vincentian partnership's programme informs people who experience deprivation and marginalisation in the areas to which I referred that they have been abandoned by politicians and they have decided not to vote because there is nothing in it for them and the cycle will continue because politicians ignore their communities.  From what I witnessed at the launch of that programme, the religious communities are empowering people to take control of their lives and make it clear to political parties and politicians that their votes are important and that they will determine the composition of future Governments.  If politicians continue to ignore these people, they do so at their peril.</P>
    <P>There was no need for the launch of a voter education programme to highlight the fact that the gap between those who have and those who have not has widened considerably during the past ten years and that the number of people living in poverty has increased substantially.  I recognise the Minister's sincerity and he is doing everything possible within his area of responsibility. However, he and the Government elected to power following the general election must be made aware that, unless inequalities are removed from society, any legislation passed by these Houses will mean nothing to those who believe that we, as politicians, have forgotten and abandoned them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and I will be supporting it.  However, the areas I highlighted require positive and immediate action to put flesh on the bones of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this legislation.  I agree with the final part of Senator McGennis' contribution where she identified areas where profound inequalities exist.  It is very important that the Government and politicians address the situation developing in our inner cities and provincial towns, where social exclusion has reached the stage that people have withdrawn <Col N="1474" /> from the system and involvement in the political process.  These people do not believe the State responds to their needs or helps them tackle the difficulties they face.  We must work towards the inclusion of all sections of the community in society.  In that context perhaps we should consider what society delivers to discover why certain groups feel excluded.</P>
      <P>A discussion on this issue took place in my constituency yesterday.  Large sections of society feel that the education system, as it is delivered, does not respond to their needs and they do not see any relevance in it.  We must consider this issue in terms of equality to ensure that education services relate to those who feel they are socially excluded and believe that the political process either does not respond to their needs or is irrelevant.</P>
      <P>It is important that everyone responds to the final part of Senator McGennis's very relevant contribution, not only by way of lip service but also by way of action in attempting to address the problems she highlighted.  This area is not exclusively the responsibility of the Minister; there is an onus on a range of other Ministers to take action. We must consider this problem, respond to it and learn from the disastrous situation that has developed in other countries where total social exclusion and total non-involvement in society exist and people have little or no cognisance of political events.  We are in a position to ensure that this does not occur in Ireland and we must do so.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Equal Status Bill which had a long gestation period and I hope it will be passed as quickly as possible.  I agree with the Minister that it will have a profound impact on Irish society.  However, it is important to emphasise that a change of mindset is needed in many areas to ensure that discrimination against persons on the basis of factors such as race, sexual orientation, disability or gender becomes socially and legally unacceptable.  The Oireachtas can make discrimination legally unacceptable but it must also become socially unacceptable and people must be treated as equals, regardless of their race, colour or creed.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides protection against discrimination outside the context of employment.  This is the first occasion on which a Minister has considered this situation.  Since the early 1970s, various forms of legislation to protect people from discrimination in employment have been introduced and have proven to be relatively successful. Reference was made to discrimination in respect of equal pay, which still exists to some extent. However, marvellous strides have been made in this area and one need only recall the situation which existed prior to 1974, when equal pay legislation came into force, for evidence of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also makes it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, <Col N="1475" /> race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin or membership of the travelling community. Senator McGennis made particular reference to discrimination against the travelling community. On previous occasions I placed on record details of a community which does not discriminate against the travelling community and <i>vice versa,</i> although tensions do sometimes occur.  I represent a town in County Limerick of which 45 per cent of the population are travellers and 55 per cent are members of the settled community. Three weeks ago a new development of 11 houses, in addition to the four already in existence, was opened for the exclusive use of the travelling community.  Both communities in the area believe there is a need for this housing.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arise when people from the outside, who are often referred to as &ldquo;not our travellers&rdquo;, cause disruption.  It is a fact of life that travellers from outside a community cause difficulties when they visit to attend weddings or other family or celebratory occasions.  These problems are controlled and minimised at present but they have occurred in the past.  The travelling community must recognise the norms and values of the settled community whose members have a right to live their lives as they please.  When discussing the values and rights of the travelling community, there is an obligation to ensure non-discrimination against travellers who, in turn, have a responsibility to respect the norms, values and behavioural patterns of the settled community. To a large extent, this is happening in the town I represent which provides an excellent working model of how two groups with different norms and values can co-exist.  I accept that there is tension but there is also a high level of tolerance and understanding between the communities.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces the principle that everyone is equal.  Such a principle is overdue for being enshrined in legislation.  It is welcome, however, because it is a basic human right.  Religious instruction tells us that everybody is equal under God and we should also hold the principle that everybody should be equal under human institutions. The Minister is legislating for that principle. It is unfortunate that one should have to legislate for it but, as I said, hopefully legislation will not be necessary in the future as discrimination becomes socially unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is not to Ireland's credit that it has not ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  It is ironic that this is the only EU country which has not done so because as a race we were discriminated against in many parts of the world over the centuries. We have all read of the notices which were common in America in the last century and early this century which read &ldquo;No Blacks or Irish Need Apply&rdquo;.  As a race which has suffered discrimination abroad and at home during the period of colonisation, when we could not practice our <Col N="1476" /> religion, obtain education or speak our language, it is ironic that it is among the last states to ratify the UN convention against discrimination.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill which will facilitate the ratification of the convention.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the consultative process on the Bill.  He consulted all interested parties, including, at one stage, the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  He listened to the concerns of the Fine Gael Members about some of the expected provisions, many of which did not materialise, perhaps as a result of the consultation with others.  The Minister also heard the views of the vintners, traveller interests, retailers, the insurance industry, gays and lesbians, people with disabilities, racial minorities, property owners and those seeking greater equality for women in golf clubs, among many other groups.  One could not have had a much broader consultative process. As a result, the Bill was highly controversial during its gestation and discussion but is now largely accepted by all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the licensed vintners.  Senator Bohan and Senator Howard are among their champions.  There is no doubt that the information feeding system, that is, strong lobbying, was never more effective from any group as from the licensed vintners on this issue.  The Minister was as good as his promise to listen closely to their concerns and to respond to them.  He has made it clear that the Bill outlaws discrimination on specified grounds only, will not require traders to admit all comers or prevent business people in the day to day running of their businesses from refusing service to somebody because of misconduct, security concerns or lack of hygiene and will not give protection to troublemakers or anti-social elements.</P>
    <P>In response to the licensed vintners and other traders, including the jewellers who felt vulnerable on this issue and from whom we had many representations, the Minister has ensured that proposals to safeguard them would be included in the Bill and that their concerns would be met. Section 17 makes it clear that a service provider or a similar person is not required to serve a customer if the service provider has reasonable grounds to believe that the provision of the service would create a substantial risk of criminal or disorderly conduct or damage to property.  It safeguards the legitimate concerns of vintners and other traders without interfering with the central thrust of the Bill which is to outlaw discrimination.</P>
    <P>Section 75 also assists in this regard.  Concerns were expressed about legal difficulties which could arise if witness evidence was given to support accusations of misconduct.  People felt that they might be sued for making such information available in good faith.  Section 75 deals with this concern.  It is important because it ensures that traders who refuse people service can express <Col N="1477" /> their concerns to the Director of Equality Investigations without the risk of litigation.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for discrimination in certain sporting and other events.  This is a sensible approach to achieving a welcome balance.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to its assisting in eliminating discrimination, promoting equality of opportunity in a range of areas in conjunction with the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, and the review of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995.  The Bill is the start of a process of ensuring that people are treated as equals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why I have so many differences of opinion with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  He is one of the most progressive Ministers in the history of the State and he has brought forward impressive and welcome legislation.  This Bill will be seen in most of its provisions as such.  However, I believe section 8 is unconstitutional and the Bill will follow the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, to the Supreme Court.  Section 8(3) purports to give schools the right to refuse to admit pupils on the grounds of denomination.  This flies in the face of the right of parents to choose the ethos of their children's education and is without doubt unconstitutional. It does not bear argument.</P>
      <P>Article 42 of the Constitution states that parents are the primary educators of their children. They can choose to educate their children themselves or they can choose a school.  There is no restriction, nor can there be, or confining of them to schools of the same denomination as their parents. There is a constitutional imperative on parents to make the correct choice regarding their children's education.  That is not a choice but an imperative.  If Catholic parents decided that a Protestant education would be best for their children and they select such a school, that is more than their entitlement: it is their imperative.  The State cannot introduce law that restricts that right.</P>
      <P>Article 42º2 of the Constitution is clear and unambiguous.  It states that:</P>
      <P>Parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes or in private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State.</P>
      <P>In no way can this be restricted by religious affiliation. That goes completely contrary to what was intended by the Constitution in spirit and wording. To reinforce this, article 42º3 goes on to state:</P>
      <P>The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither can the State prevent parents, in legislation, from selecting schools of their choice. Despite all this, the State now proposes to restrict parental choice, in certain cases, to schools of the parents' denomination.  Once again, the Churches <Col N="1478" /> and the State are interfering with the constitutional rights of citizens and they expect us to accept that the enrolment of four year old children of different denominations would undermine the ethos of a school.  The Church line that somehow the ethos of a school would be undermined by introducing children of a different faith to a school is particularly offensive.  The Constitution, in other cases, and rules of national schools make it absolutely clear that children have the right not to attend religious instruction if that is the parents' wish.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Bill is even more obviously unconstitutional than the Employment Equality Bill.  It is impossible to believe that the constitutional lawyers advising the Government approved this section, which is not only unconstitutional but also inequitable and fundamentally wrong.  Four year old children cannot and will not be used in the argument to protect ethos.</P>
    <P>The Minister agrees with my views on this issue in his heart of hearts.  Any time I have heard him discuss these matters he has made the same points.  Whatever people think of the Constitution, it is clear and unambiguous and I want the relevant sections of the Constitution on the record.</P>
    <P>Article 42 states:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary ... educator of the child is the family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral ... education of their children.</P>
    <P>It is more than a right; it is the duty of parents to make the right choice.  Parents would not be discharging their responsibilities to their children if they did not see it as their duty to make the right choice.  Article 42 goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes or in private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State.</P>
    <P>Many parents have educated their children at home but we are talking here of schools recognised by the State.  There are four choices &mdash; education can be provided at home, in private schools, in schools recognised by the State or schools established by the State.  The next section is even more important:</P>
    <P>The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State or to any particular type of school designated by the State.</P>
    <P>One might say that there is a constitutional preference here, though it is not as clear as previous sections.  If the Constitution lays it down that a parent cannot be obliged to send a child to a particular type of school designated by the State, then the Minister will agree that there is an equal and opposite constitutional right: neither can the <Col N="1479" /> State, in violation of the parents' lawful preference, oblige them not to send their child to a particular school designated by the State.</P>
    <P>Article 44.2º of the Constitution reads:</P>
    <P>....</P>
    <P>2º The State guarantees not to endow any religion.</P>
    <P>3º The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, section 8 of the Bill states that:</P>
    <P>An educational establishment does not discriminate under subsection (2) by reason only that ... it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination, and, in the case of a refusal, where it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</P>
    <P>Anyone can see that that is discriminating on the ground of religious belief.  Apart from that, if the section I quoted was not in the Constitution, what kind of model of society are we putting together? On the Order of Business, we criticise those who act in a polarised, sectarian way in the North by chasing people out of their homes or by burning homes and places of worship.  On the other hand, we are bringing in legislation which separates people from a very young age.  Surely people's ethos can be respected and promoted as well as children's education being progressed in the same building without having to discriminate against or separate children.</P>
    <P>There is a serious difficulty here and I do not know what kind of agenda is in the State at present.  The Employment Equality Bill will deprive people of their right to a private life and discriminates against those working in religious institutions &mdash; which may be endowed &mdash; and will be seen to do so.  The Equal Status Bill purports to discriminate against four year old children who may not, under certain circumstances, be enrolled in a school on the basis of their religion, despite at least four sections of the Constitution which appear to rule this out.  Tomorrow we will deal with the Universities Bill which claims to be liberalising areas on one hand and yet repeals a section of the 1909 Act which does not allow a religious test that would enable a university to discriminate against a potential employee on the grounds of religion.  We are moving backwards to a fundamentalist approach to society which we will rue someday.</P>
    <P>It has been put to me that this legislation is important in the light of the declining numbers in religious communities.  We are now setting up a structure which will contain certain protections and demands.  When there are no longer any religious to run these schools, the vacuum created by their absence will be filled by fundamentalists, a situation we have encountered already.  Communities, <Col N="1480" /> teachers and those running schools should be trusted to protect the ethos of their schools.  We not only have a duty to do so but a constitutional imperative to respect the ethos of homes and children.  In this comprehensive legislation which gives due right and regard to people of various backgrounds such as travellers, people with disabilities, people with different sexual orientation and people with different marital status, why is this provision necessary?  It is unconstitutional and moves in a direction which cannot be good for society.  It also gives credence to the view that a school cannot maintain its ethos if some of the children are of a different religious denomination.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to remove that part of section 8.  There are circumstances in which preference can be given to a coreligionist.  If, for example, one place were available in a school and two children, one of whom practised the same religion as that of the school, were seeking admission, it would be in order to take that fact into consideration in making the choice.  That would not be unconstitutional.  However, to say we have enough or we do not have enough or we have too many of a particular religion in a school and for that reason, although we have space, we will not admit a child and to assert that it is necessary to refuse admission to a four year old child in order to &ldquo;maintain the ethos of the school&rdquo; defies belief.  Where did that originate?  The Minister must be as uncomfortable with the provision as I. His views on these matters are well known.</P>
    <P>In the history of this State we have been required, correctly, to protect the ethos, beliefs and culture of various groups.  That should continue to be the case.  However, section 8 does not go about achieving that properly.  Instead it raises a huge problem.  I appeal to the Minister to remove that subsection of an otherwise extraordinarily good Bill and to make appropriate changes to section 8 to ensure the Bill does not fall by the wayside.  A Constitution which provides that one may not discriminate on the grounds of religious belief, profession or status and a Bill which provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate if it refuses admission to a person who is not of its denomination, where that refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school, are incompatible.  I would welcome an opportunity to see the legal advice which states otherwise.</P>
    <P>This is a serious and difficult issue that must be addressed.  The legislation is being put at risk by the inclusion of this provision.  Neither the Constitution nor the people will be comfortable with a Bill which discriminates against children on the spurious grounds that their admission to a school might undermine the ethos of the school.  That is not the case and I do not believe it will happen. It is wrong to consider it possible.</P>
    <P>This Bill is incompatible with the Constitution. The Constitution provides that one may not discriminate <Col N="1481" /> on the grounds of religious belief and that parents are entitled to make appropriate choices for their children's education.  That includes the right of Catholic parents to select Protestant or other denominational schools for their children if that is their wish.  That is incompatible with a Bill which provides that children may be refused admission to a school on the grounds of denomination, particularly if that proves necessary to protect the ethos of the school.  I appeal to the Minister to sanitise the Bill immediately and render it constitutional.  He must change section 8 to ensure we will feel comfortable with what is otherwise a superbly progressive, comprehensive and welcome Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the consideration he extended to the licensed vintners whom I represent in the Seanad.  I am concerned with the sections of the Bill which affect the Licensed Vintner's Association.  The Minister was available to the association at all times and we had many meetings with him.  Initially, the Bill was not attractive from the association's point of view but the Minister listened to our concerns and made the necessary changes, with which the association is reasonably happy.  I will not oppose the Bill.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister announced his intention to introduce this Bill two years ago, I and my colleagues in the Licensed Vintners' Association have found the Minister accessible, prepared to listen with care and attention to the valid concerns of the Dublin licensed trade and willing to do everything in his power to ensure that, having regard to the constraints in the nature of the legislation, those concerns were addressed.  In the real sense of that much abused term, the Minister is a gentleman and I wish him and his wife happiness during his well earned retirement.</P>
      <P>The introduction of legislation which might adversely affect the publican's well established right to refuse service was naturally a matter of anxiety for the association.  The power to refuse service is a cornerstone in the maintenance of order in a licensed premises.  Any legal limitation of this power would lead to a serious breakdown of the discipline which underpins the orderly management of a public house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power to refuse service is not used by publicans as a means of discrimination.  It is a tool of management which is essential to the good order and safety of those who work in and frequent licensed premises.  Publicans, as ordinary sensible people, are primarily interested in building up their businesses and not in turning business away. During the period preceding the publication of this Bill, the Licensed Vintners' Association conducted a study of refusals in the Dublin licensed trade.  The survey was designed in questionnaire form and was completed by over 40 per cent of the association's members, a measure of the <Col N="1482" /> importance they attach to the power to refuse service.</P>
    <P>Two of the findings of the survey were illuminating. The first was that, contrary to the perceived view, people are not discriminated against in licensed premises solely on the grounds of their being members of minorities.  Second, and regrettably a measure of the times in which we live, violence is frequently an accompaniment to refusal.  In circumstances where this power was reduced or removed, chaos would ensue.  For that reason I welcome section 17(2) of the Bill which states:</P>
    <P>Action taken in good faith by or on behalf of the holder of a licence or other authorisation which permits the sale of intoxicating liquor, for the sole purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1995, shall not constitute discrimination.</P>
    <P>This is the key provision of the Bill for the licensed trade.  The Minister struck a fair balance in providing protection for the publican and his or her staff while safeguarding the rights of minorities who are prepared to behave in an orderly way on licensed premises.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses other concerns expressed to the Minister on the numerous occasions deputations from the Licensed Vintners Federation met him over the past two years.  Section 25(b) gives the Director of Equality Investigations the power to dismiss a claim at any stage in an investigation where he is of the opinion it has been made in bad faith, is frivolous, vexatious or relates to a trivial matter.  I hope the director will make full use of his power.  All sectors of the retail trade are aware of the regular abuse by some sections of the community in pursuit of their so-called rights, whether it be through the courts or before other statutory bodies.  One has only to witness the scandal of public liability claims to find a more than adequate endorsement of my argument.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 75, which provides parties to an investigation by the Director of Equality Investigations with the same immunities and privileges as a witness before the High Court. The question of privileged information is one of great importance, especially in circumstances where a refusal was based, not on the minority status of the customer, but on other confidential knowledge &mdash; for example, the customer being refused on the grounds that he or she was a known but unconvicted drug pusher.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to section 23(2)(a) and (b) which state that the director will not investigate a claim unless he is satisfied that:</P>
    <P>(a)  the complainant has, within two months after the prohibited conduct is alleged to have occurred, or where more than one incident of prohibited conduct is alleged to have occurred, within two months after the last such occurrence, in writing notified the respondent of the <Col N="1483" /> nature of the allegation, the remedy sought by the complainant in respect thereof and the complainant's intention to refer the matter to the Director if the complainant is not satisfied with the respondent's response to the allegation, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the respondent has not, within a reasonable time after the notification referred to in paragraph (a), responded to the complainant to the satisfaction of the complainant.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider reducing the two month's deadline to a considerably shorter period of two to three weeks.  If an incident occurs in a busy public house on a Saturday night involving a half dozen people and they make a complaint, it is next to impossible for a member of staff to remember after two months who caused the trouble.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider shortening the deadline.  If someone has a complaint I see no reason why they cannot return the following week and make it.  Whoever refused them service would then be in a position to remember what happened.  It is not a major problem but it is something I ask the Minister to examine.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the comprehensive research the LVA included in its submission on this Bill to the Minister.  One of the findings of this research was that in a large number of Dublin public houses refusals ran from hundreds of incidents to thousands each year.  Such numbers of refusals occurred not only in traditionally difficult areas but also in areas which have a large passing trade through business, tourism and recreational activities or where the customer is normally unknown to the publican or bar staff.  The potential for litigation in such circumstances becomes enormous, especially since it would be almost impossible for the publican or his staff to have an exact recollection of events surrounding each and every refusal.  The Minister should reconsider the two months deadline not only in the interests of the trade but in the successful administration of the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Overall, this Bill is to be welcomed and I congratulate the Minister and his staff in drafting this understandable form of what is complicated legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Minister's forthcoming retirement.  The Oireachtas will be a poor place in his absence.  I have known the Minister, Deputy Taylor, since he was a young solicitor in the late Herman Good's office and that is a number of years ago.  He was a gentleman then and has remained so.  I am very sorry to see him leave because he will be a loss not only to the Labour Party but to the nation.  He has been an excellent Minister and one of the finest I have seen in this House.  That is not just speaking from the experience of the past ten years I have been a Senator but from the years before that when I frequently <Col N="1484" /> visited the Oireachtas and dealt with many Ministers of all parties.  The Minister has been excellent in his job and I am sorry to see him leave.  I wish him and his wife luck, happiness and good health for the future.</P>
    <P>My association and the people I represent are reasonably happy with the Bill now it is amended to give protection to publicans and their staff. One reads every day in the papers of barmen being attacked by thugs, of which we unfortunately have too many.  This legislation gives a measure of protection to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this badly needed legislation because, although we have made many improvements and progress in society, there are still areas of discrimination and I am glad these are recognised in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Bohan, I too wish the Minister well in his retirement and congratulate him on the excellent work he has done, especially as Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  He will have a monument to his memory in the legislation he has steered through with determination.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It protects against discrimination in a range of areas outside employment such as housing, service in shops, pubs, hotels and guest houses, access to education, sale of land, registered clubs and access to transport such as trains and buses.  There are a number of areas in which discrimination will not be allowed on the grounds of sex, family status, marital status, membership of the travelling community, sexual orientation, religion, ethnic background, nationality, age, disability and skin colour.  The issue of skin colour is topical.  I watched Tiger Woods win the US Masters at the weekend.  It was said that seven years ago he would not have been allowed to play golf on the course where he won.  It is not just in this country where we are overcoming discrimination problems.  The Bill also addresses harassment based on these grounds and provides a method of redress.</P>
      <P>Much focus was placed on publicans' problems with the Bill and on the issue of travellers.  It is interesting that the publicans seemed to disappear like melted snow as soon as their problems were solved.  They sent letters to us, phoned us and frequently visited our offices for a number of months.  I presume they are now satisfied with the Bill because I have not heard a word from them for a while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the obstacles have been removed.  I welcome the points made by Senators McGennis and Neville in relation to the broad issues of social exclusion and equality. They are not dealt with in this Bill but it is important that they are raised.  Senator McGennis outlined the problems which are increasingly faced by many communities.  There is a need for <Col N="1485" /> societal and attitudinal changes in addition to legislative changes to deal with the rights of those excluded from aspects of our society.  In some cases this is due to inadequate income.  However, there is now legislation in place to deal with discrimination.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we do not discriminate in broad areas. However, there is still a level of discrimination and exclusive attitudes which we might not even recognise.  The NIMBY syndrome is a good example.  People express liberal views on issues such as travellers; however, if a halting site is proposed in their own backyard many will object. They may find legitimate reasons to oppose the halting site but there is often an undertone of discrimination. We must all examine our attitudes.</P>
      <P>Schools have a role to play in changing attitudes. I do not know if there are specific school programmes dealing with inherited attitudes. Some programmes have been introduced dealing with issues which are more social than academic, such as drugs.  Perhaps we need to consider a programme dealing with discriminatory attitudes. This might be included in teaching training modules.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that sexual harassment is dealt with in the Bill.  I also welcome the inclusion of access to public transport for the disabled. These are the practical problems which the disabled confront and they often feel they are not addressed, particularly in smaller stations and on shorter routes.  One often sees changes in facilities used by a large number of people.  These changes should be implemented in the less used facilities where there is an equal need for access.</P>
      <P>The Director of Equality Investigations is an important post.  The Minister stated that the director could use the mediation mechanism in addition to the heavy hand of the law.  This may prove to be a useful mechanism.  Most people will wish to cooperate with this legislation.  If breaches are pointed out to people they will want to cooperate with the Bill and the mediation mechanism may prove most useful for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about section 8 of the Bill.  None of us is particularly happy with that section.  I do not know whether anything can be done at this stage.  Section 8 deals with the refusal of a school to admit an individual of a different denomination on the grounds that this is necessary to support its ethos.  I do not know if this section will be used very much.</P>
      <P>How will this Bill affect the Private Rented Dwellings Act?  Two years ago a gay man, whose partner had died, lost a case in which he was seeking to stay in a house which had been his home for 30 years.  The house was in his late partner's name.  If the couple had been a man and woman there would have been no problem.  Will this legislation provide protection for people in such circumstances?  This is an example of discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> How will this legislation interact with the Employment Equality Bill?  We cannot address this properly today in light of the referral of the latter Bill to the Supreme Court.  However, the two Bills are somewhat interdependent.  This is particularly the case in relation to the post of Director of Equality Investigations, which is established under the Employment Equality Bill.</P>
    <P>Two months ago I suggested to the Cathaoirleach that some of us might challenge his position on the Oireachtas rugby team when this legislation came into force.  From reading this legislation I find that this will not be the case.  There are exemptions and it will be possible to form all male or all female teams.  I am glad that I will not have to rise to that challenge.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  It has been requested for a long time by the various groups involved.  I have had representations on behalf of travellers, and they need this legislation.  Sometimes we are discriminatory without intending to be or realising that we are being so.  People confuse rights and responsibilities.  One must give people rights. Only then can one talk about responsibilities and work out how they should be exercised between various groups.  The important point is that all sectors of society should have equal rights and our legislation should leave no doubt that this is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their interesting and generally constructive contributions to this debate.  The significance of this measure is that, for the first time, it gives legal protection to those who are discriminated against outside the workplace. Legislation on these lines has been sought for a considerable time by groups representing people who have experienced discrimination, including women, travellers, gays, lesbians, people with disabilities and racial minorities. Many of these have written or spoken to me about the vital importance they attach to the enactment of equal status legislation.</P>
      <P>I received a letter recently from Mr. Christopher Robson, on behalf of the Equality Campaign, a broad coalition of interests who have been pressing for equality legislation.  The relevant section of the letter reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our campaign includes people who have been fighting for the Equal Status Bill for nearly ten years and who have been hugely encouraged at the progress that has been made in the last two months towards its enactment. We are writing now to urge you and the Government that the Oireachtas should pass all Stages of this Bill as rapidly as possible.  We appreciate that the reference to the Supreme Court of the Employment Equality Bill may also have implications for the Equal Status Bill. But if the Equal Status Bill is now completed <Col N="1487" /> there is a very good chance it may be passed into law either directly upon its enactment or in some weeks time if the Employment Equality Bill is judged constitutional (as you may know though some groups in our campaign still had reservations about the modified section 37, there was strong agreement that the Bill as a whole contained the most powerful and essential protections.)  If, however, the Equal Status Bill is not passed now, then there is a very much greater chance that all that painstaking work by so many people may be set at nought.  This Bill should and most probably will instead stand as a proper tribute to your own work as you prepare to leave office.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Bohan and others for their kind personal remarks which I appreciate.  I found Senator Bohan and his vintner colleagues constructive in the many discussions we had on this Bill.  Senator Bohan suggested the two month notification period might be reduced to two weeks.  A period of two months strikes an appropriate balance between giving the complainant enough time to make the notification and not having so long a period that the publican or other respondent would have forgotten about the particular incident.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis was concerned that the exception in section (6)(2)(e) might affect the community rating principle in health insurance.  It does not.  This is governed by other legislation which requires providers of such insurance to apply community rating.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that the reference in this subsection to what is reasonable and relevant will in no way let insurance companies off the hook.  The question of what is relevant or reasonable will not depend just on the word of the company alone, but will be determined in each individual case by the Director of Equality Investigations.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis raised the right to equal pay and referred to the notion of a hypothetical comparitor. This Bill does not deal with employment matters, which are dealt with in the Employment Equality Bill.  The Senator also asked about provisions for housings and details of the rationale of the various exemptions allowing bodies to provide different treatment to persons based on family size, status, etc.  There is a need for local authorities and approved voluntary housing organisations such as social housing landlords to be reasonably flexible in allocating dwellings in order to ensure that purpose built and designated dwellings &mdash; for example, elderly persons' dwellings and accommodation for travellers, etc. &mdash; continue to be used for their original purpose.  To ensure an appropriate social mix in their housing estates, flexibility is necessary in the following circumstances: family size &mdash; statutory schemes affording additional priority to larger families; family status &mdash; in order to promote adequate <Col N="1488" /> social mix, local authorities and voluntary bodies may have to ensure a particular type of family does not predominate in one estate; and age &mdash; it would not be reasonable to allocate supported elderly persons' accommodation to families.  This degree of flexibility by way of this enabling provision has to be there as I hope Senator McGennis will agree.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis also asked about the catchment areas in education.  This is a matter for the Minister of Education.  The Bill deals with discrimination on specified grounds only and the area of residence of a particular family is not one of those grounds.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole queried the provisions of section 8(3)(b) and their compatibility with the Constitution.  Section 8(3)(b)(i) was drafted following careful examination by the Attorney General of all the issues involved.  The section gives a denominational school the right to refuse to admit someone who is not of that denomination where this is essential to maintain the ethos of that school.  This right of refusal is intended to cover the situation where a minority school, although taking in all the small number of applicants from its own religion, would lose its character as a denominational school if it accepted all the other applicants for which it had, or could, make places.  I am satisfied the wording of the section is constitutionally sound and strikes an appropriate balance between the rights of parents and those of denominational schools.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to the entitlement of Catholic parents to send their child to a Protestant school.  I do not know how the Senator would expect a Protestant school to keep its denominational character if it was obliged to take pupils without regard to their religious affiliation. Should such schools be swamped by those who are not co-religionists?  How could a school be regarded as Protestant if 60, 70 or 90 per cent of its pupils are not of that religion?</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to various articles of the Constitution in support of his arguments.  I do not accept this selected use of the Constitution. Following careful examination of this issue, I was advised that the provisions as worded not only do not conflict with the Constitution but, on the contrary, are necessary to ensure compliance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This Bill never had the objective of the dismantling of denominational education.  However, it requires denominational schools to justify particular instances of discrimination or exclusion and the school's reasons will be reviewed by the Director of Equality Investigations.  This in no way changes the <i>status quo</i> or gives any extra rights to schools.  It requires schools to justify themselves in any given case.</P>
    <P>I was particularly intrigued by the lack of opposition or comment from Senator O'Toole to section 8(3)(b)(ii) which has a virtually identical <Col N="1489" /> exception regarding schools catering for persons of a particular nationality.  Is he saying it is in order to have a Japanese or German school but not a Protestant school?</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole's reference to Northern Ireland was particularly misconceived.  If we took the course outlined by him and, in effect, brought about the end of schools catering for minority denominations we would send a very negative sign to people in Northern Ireland where Catholic schools exist with substantial though not full state funding.  We would be giving a clear message that we reject diversity and aimed to assimilate minorities.  I do not agree with this course and I believe the House does not agree to it.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  A number of detailed comments on particular issues were made and I took forward to discussing these issues on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleách for affording me the opportunity of raising the important matter of extending fifth freedom rights to Aeroflot to allow them to pick up passengers in Shannon Airport and transport them to New York.</P>
      <P>Aeroflot International has been a valued customer in Shannon Airport for over 20 years and, as a result of Aeroflot deciding to land at Shannon for refuelling purposes, much employment has been provided in the airport and indirectly in the region in general.  When the Soviet Union split up, the Aeroflot airline was somewhat diminished in size.  However, it continued to do business at Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aviation world is rapidly changing and it is important that the Minister, the Government and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications recognise this and, operate to take a proactive position now rather than a reactionary position at a later stage when certain decisions have been taken at international level. I compliment Minister Dukes for the fact that he has visited Shannon on a number of occasions to meet with interested parties, namely Signal, Aer <Col N="1490" /> Rianta and the marketing committee of the RDO in the mid-west region.  The fact that the Minister came to Shannon to consult with these groups is extremely important.  It was unfortunate that a certain Member of the Opposition jumped on the fact that the Minister had visited the region and used it in a negative and destructive fashion. Since Shannon lost its sole transatlantic status, this was the first time any politician in the mid-west used a situation to his or her own political advantage.  That has been very negative for the region and I assure the Minister that the views expressed by the said Member of the Lower House do not generally reflect the views held by public representatives in the mid-west region.  It is widely recognised that the Minister, even prior to becoming Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, always had a very positive view in relation to Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to look at the application which is before him and to treat it in a positive fashion.  It is important that the Minister recognises that Aeroflot business is fundamental to the international status of Shannon Airport.  I believe that they should be allowed to pick up passengers at Shannon and take them to New York.  During the summer season in particular, Aer Lingus is unable to meet demand.  It is imperative that the consumer is given a choice. By allowing Aeroflot to pick up passengers, the Minister would be giving the customer such an opportunity.  It is important to recognise that the CIS states are going from strength to strength, with constant improvement in their economies. We should respond to that by co-operating and improving our contacts with them and by accommodating Aeroflot at this stage of its development.</P>
    <P>Since the removal of Shannon Airport's sole transatlantic status some years ago by the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, we have witnessed a dramatic expansion of traffic through Dublin. There is no corresponding increase in Shannon. The increase in traffic through Dublin does not come through the United States and the argument which was put forward for the removal of transatlantic status from Shannon has not been substantiated at all.  The traffic increase in Dublin comes primarily from Europe and the UK.  Perhaps that is a matter which should be discussed on another occasion.  Hopefully, the Minister will impress on the national airline the need to provide better services to Dublin, into the UK and mainland Europe from Shannon.  Aer Lingus are very remiss in that matter and many in the mid-west believe that they only come to the mid-west to cream off good business in the height of summer. Aside from that, they do not seem to be interested in providing serious services into the UK and mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>It is important that there is balanced economic and social development throughout the regions <Col N="1491" /> but particularly in the mid-west region.  Granting fifth freedom rights to Aeroflot will assist in bringing some balance to the region.  Aer Rianta and the various representative organisations in Clare and the mid-west region fully support the application.  I would again like to take the opportunity to thank the Minister for the meetings he has had in the area and for listening to people's concerns about the future of Shannon.  I urge the Minister to consider granting fifth freedom rights to Aeroflot as soon as possible.  We are now facing into a summer season where much traffic goes through Shannon, and Aer Lingus is unable to meet the demands on the transatlantic route.  It is important that Aeroflot be given the opportunity to provide transport into New York from Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for providing me with my first opportunity to address this House in my current function and my first opportunity to address it in over ten years.</P>
      <P>Successive Irish Governments have consistently encouraged, developed and supported Aeroflot's valuable contribution to Shannon Airport. This co-operation between Shannon Airport and Aeroflot has yielded benefits to both sides both in terms of traffic for Shannon and of job creation in the region.  In financial terms the airline's contribution to the Shannon region has been estimated at £12 million a year.  Employment in the region, between direct and indirect jobs, generated by the airline's presence at Shannon is estimated at 200.  Aeroflot's co-operation with Shannon Airport began with its use as an important transit point, but this co-operation has grown and developed over the years.  It is the Government's desire and objective that this co-operation should continue to grow and develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, as the Senator is of course aware, Aeroflot already has extensive rights at Shannon Airport.  Under the Ireland/Russia Air Agreement they have full fifth freedom traffic rights at Shannon, that is the right to pick up all transfer and local traffic, for flights to all points in Central and South America and for Washington and Miami in the US.  They were also granted similar rights on a temporary basis to Chicago.  In addition, they were granted rights by my Department in 1994 to transfer passengers at Shannon from airlines of the former USSR onto Aeroflot services to all points in the US including New York.  This allowed Aeroflot to establish their transatlantic hub at Shannon in 1995.  In <Col N="1492" /> 1995 and 1996 Aeroflot connected passengers westbound to New York, Chicago, Washington and Miami.  Passengers connecting at Shannon originate not only in Russia but also in Slovakia and Belarus.  Currently Aeroflot are operating to New York direct from Moscow.</P>
    <P>What Aeroflot have now sought is full fifth freedom traffic rights between Shannon and New York, that is the right to also carry local traffic.  I am at present considering this application and am investigating in depth all of the pros and cons and all of the possible implications of a decision either way.  The issue is most definitely not a black and white one.  It is much more complex and the possible implications must be carefully weighed.</P>
    <P>One of the most important issues to be considered is the effect on existing long-standing Irish and US services to the US and, in particular, Aer Lingus and Delta scheduled services.  That is not to say that it is part of aviation policy to protect Aer Lingus or any other airline for that matter. On the contrary, I seek to encourage competition in the aviation sector.  However, this must be balanced against ensuring the long-term viability of strategic airline connections.  On the other hand, I must also consider the possible benefits for Shannon and the region in the context of additional traffic, jobs, the long-term commitment of Aeroflot to Shannon and the desire to continue to nurture that commitment.  I am, of course, fully conscious of the importance of the fact that Aeroflot now have the capability to fly direct from Moscow to the US and the desirability of maintaining an Aeroflot hub operation in Shannon.</P>
    <P>As part of my examination of the application I have had extensive consultations.  I have met and discussed the matter with the Russian Federal Aviation Ministry and with Aeroflot in Moscow. I discussed the matter at length with the chairmen and chief executives of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  As the Senator said, I went to Shannon Airport last month to discuss this and the more general issue of continued growth activity at Shannon Airport with the Shannon Airport marketing consultative committee and with SIGNAL. I subsequently discussed the Aeroflot application with Shannon Airport management.  Having had these consultations, I am now in the process of finalising my conclusions and I assure the Senator I will make a decision on the matter shortly.  If I decide in favour of the application I do not expect services to begin this summer.  I have been informed by Aeroflot that it would not be in a position to begin operations on the basis of this application until around September.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record the Government's commitment to traffic growth at Shannon.  As I said earlier, I went to Shannon last month to discuss with the Shannon Airport marketing consultative committee and with SIGNAL the type of action we could take to ensure continued <Col N="1493" /> growth activity at Shannon Airport and the continued development of the airport as an important driver of the economy of the mid-west region.  I am glad to say that in many respects the Senator's views and those of SIGNAL coincide with mine.</P>
    <P>I, too, regret that a Member of the Opposition tried to make a little political capital from straightforward political common sense. However, after the rebuttal of his more silly remarks in the <i>Clare Champion</i> of last week, he may think twice before making such wild statements again.  Both of the groups I met in Shannon and the other interests with whom I discussed the matter are in agreement that Shannon Airport needs better links with Dublin, the UK and the Continent.  I assured everyone, as I have the Senator this evening, that I would be happy to help develop matters along those lines.</P>

      <P>The matter I raise may not ordinarily be raised in the Seanad but it is important to the parents of the boys and girls attending the primary schools at Sperrin Road, Drimnagh.  The school building, which houses a girls' and a boys' primary school and a junior school at Sperrin Road, was built in the 1950s and several hundred pupils attend this school.  It is a large building which also houses a mixed secondary school.  Several hundred pupils attend the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited the school on Monday morning.  There are large gaping holes in the roof through which a large amount of water leaks into the school and it badly needs repair.  The toilets are out of date and are in an unsanitary condition.  While I accept many schools seek funding to update facilities, would the Minister for Education be satisfied if her children attended this school?  I suggest she <Col N="1494" /> would not.  It is deplorable to see such antiquated toilet facilities for young boys and girls and it is not a healthy environment for pupils or teachers.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the water leaking into the building from the roof will destroy the fabric of the building and will lead to wet rot and subsequently dry rot.  There are circumstances where urgent applications of funding can be provided.  It is in the economic interest of the Department to provide that funding at this stage because if this problem is not resolved, total refurbishment costs will be in excess of what is required now.</P>
    <P>Costings for the repair of the roof are in the region of £60,000 to £80,000 and have been agreed with the Department.  Other than bureaucracy, what is standing in the way of repairing the roof?  I ask for a quick decision and allocation of funds.  The summer would be an ideal time to carry out such work when the school is vacant.  I hope the school children will not face another winter with rain coming through the roof.</P>
    <P>A representative of the INTO inspected the toilets and agreed with parents that their condition is deplorable, unsanitary and unsatisfactory, not only for the children but also for the teachers.  I ask that we get through bureaucracy as quickly as possible for the sake of the boys, girls and teachers in the Sperrin Road schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Senator is referring to Our Lady of Good Counsel Primary Schools at Mourne Road, Drimnagh, Dublin 12.</P>
      <P>I would like to outline to this House the Department of Education's current position regarding repairs to the roof and the refurbishment of the toilets at the girls' and boys' primary and junior schools at Drimnagh.  The Minister for Education is aware that there are three primary schools on the Mourne Road campus. Collectively, they have a staffing of three principals and 28 assistant teachers.  The three schools had a combined enrolment of 636 pupils on 30 September 1996.</P>
      <P>The three schools are housed in a building on a large campus which also accommodates a secondary school.  Originally these primary school building catered for up to 4,000 pupils.  In 1994 the Department provided in the region of £250,000 grant-aid towards the cost of a new heating system for the schools.  I understand this has added greatly to the comfort of the buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has received an application from the schools for grant-aid towards the cost of various improvement works at the schools, including roof repairs and refurbishment of the toilets.  An official from the Department visited the campus recently to see at first hand the conditions at the schools.  The officials has reported that the problems with the roof are causing particular concern for the schools' management authorities.  It is accepted that the roof of the <Col N="1495" /> building needs attention and some refurbishment work will be required to the toilet blocks.</P>
    <P>A preliminary cost estimate has been received in respect of the roof repair.  Costings are currently being prepared in respect of the work to the toilets.  When these costings have been received the project will be considered for grant assistance.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that a decision on <Col N="1496" /> the provision of funding for the proposed works must be taken in the light of existing contractual commitments and the funds available this year.  I would like to assure the Senator and the House that every effort will be made by the Department to ensure that the proposed project is progressed as quickly as possible.  I thank him again for the opportunity to outline the current position.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 April 1997.</P>
