      <P>I have notice from Senator Haughey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to explain the reasons for the ban on the export of bovine heads to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have also notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts , Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to resolve the industrial dispute at the National Museum, Collins Barracks, Dublin 7.</P>
      <P>I have also notice from Senator Caffrey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the reasons after three years of negotiations between Meiteal Mhaigheo, the IPTA and FÁS, no definite answer has yet been given by FÁS in relation to the establishment of the national auto training centre for Ballina, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Haughey and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Caffrey on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Labour Party and all the Members of the House in expressing our sympathy on the death of Deputy Jim Kemmy.</P>
      <P>It was obvious from the many tributes paid to Jim Kemmy over the past week that he was a very popular Member of the Oireachtas and that he was respected by all sides.  This respect was earned by his many years of service in the House, as a trade unionist, as a member of Limerick Corporation where he proudly served as major and in his life in Limerick in general.</P>
      <P>He stood for the real men and women of Limerick and worked ceaselessly for their causes.  He spoke for those who were voiceless and was never afraid to go it alone for the sake of what, in his eyes, was right and just.  Whether as an Independent, a member of his Democratic Socialist Party or as a high profile member and chairman of the Labour Party, Jim Kemmy's voice could not be stilled.  Nobody could ever doubt his sincerity and integrity, his love for life or his belief that people have the right to live their lives as free people in a just society.</P>
      <P>Our sympathy goes to his companion, Patsy, his brother, Joe, his two sisters, Maureen and Joan, and all his colleagues and friends in the Labour Party.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and, as Leader in this House, I wish to express our gratitude to his colleagues and friends for his dedication and hard work over the years as a Member of the Oireachtas.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I extend our sympathy to the Members of the Labour Party and particularly to the people of Limerick who still miss him so much.  I extend our sympathy to his lifelong companion, Patsy, the immediate members of this family, his two sisters, Joan and Maureen, his brother, Joe, and his nephew.</P>
      <P>He was a prophet honoured in his own city. We did not have to wait until Jim was dead to appreciate his popularity.  We miss his ambling gait as he walked up and down on the streets of Limerick, stopping to chat or to discuss his anthology or articles for his Limerick journal, always ready to listen.</P>
      <P>We, from Limerick, miss him because he was a father figure.  He was a liberal voice when it was not popular to be so.  He worked among the disadvantaged.  He attended every public meeting where sometimes he was criticised for his very definite stand on issues but he did not flinch.  He often said, &ldquo;Mary, politics will be there after us&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a man who had a great sense of life and <Col N="151" /> honesty.  His funeral epitomised the kind of man he was.  It was simple, dignified and ordinary.  The hearse passed his favourite haunts and stopped for a moment.  It was poignant, when walking away from the graveyard that very warm midday, that the only sound which could be heard after he was buried was that of a member of his trade, a stonemason, simply chipping away at a monument.  That is exactly as he would have liked it. He was Limerick's father and we still miss him very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent Senators, I want to be closely associated with the tributes paid to the late Deputy Jim Kemmy.  All his political life he was seen to take a stand on issues that were often unpopular.  We saw him time and time again standing on his own preparing to be the lonely voice.  He is the man who proved beyond all else that one person with courage is a majority on his own.  We saw him prepared to put his Dáil seat and his political career at risk voting against the budget on one famous occasion.  We saw him some years later being hounded out of office &mdash; or, if he was not hounded out of office, the right-wing forces of the Church in Limerick ensured that he was not returned by the electorate, but he still fought on. He never whinged.  He was a public representative; he was always a fighter.  At the last meeting I had with him during the summer, when I was lobbying him on some issue, he did not agree with me, which was typical of him, and argued like he always did.</P>
      <P>He proved something hugely important &mdash; that to be a patriot is something which is learned.  His love of his native city, his extraordinary pride when he was its mayor, and the fact he was never afraid to show and share that pride and love was something of which we were all well aware.  His commitment to this country was seen in many varied aspects of his life on which I do not have time to elaborate.</P>
      <P>I make one substantial point and in the knowledge that I am elected to this House by graduates of a number of universities.  Jim Kemmy proved one did not have to be a graduate, did not need university education or to go through years of education to be an extraordinarily effective and clear thinking public representative.  He proved one did not have to have a degree to be an extraordinary historian and that an ordinary person could make a huge contribution.  At a time when the community and society do not put great store by commitment to public life, it is important for us, his colleagues, to point to him as an example and role model for young people and others who seek to serve this country.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent Senators, I draw attention to his commitment to public service and to his extraordinary energy as a public representative and offer our condolences and sympathy to his family, friends and partner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House for giving time for tributes to be paid today.  We are particularly gratified by their tone and the fine things which have been said about our colleague, Jim Kemmy, chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party and long time Deputy for Limerick.  The Oireachtas is a poorer place for his untimely death.  Many Members were aware our colleague was seven weeks ill in St. James's Hospital, an illness he bore stoically with courage and fortitude.</P>
      <P>I was fortunate enough to visit him on Thursday, 25 September.  I was coming from an inaugural meeting of the Law Society in UCD at which the motion was &ldquo;Politics is the last refuge of the scoundrel&rdquo;.  I arrived at St. James's Hospital at 10.45 p.m. and was present with his family and friends when he died at 11.05 p.m. I thought how utterly offensive the assertion in that motion was to a politician like Jim Kemmy who graced politics all his life with high principles, courage, conviction and care for the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the many tributes paid to Jim over the past few days that he was a popular Member of the Oireachtas, was respected by all sides and that that respect was earned by his many years of service as a politician, trade unionist, member of Limerick Corporation, where he was proud to serve as mayor on two occasions, and his contribution to life in Limerick in general.</P>
      <P>Many have described Jim Kemmy as a big man on the landscape, and that he was.  He was born in Limerick in 1936 and understood well the harshness of life for many in his native city, particularly during the 1930s and 1940s.  He experienced the trauma of exile when he went to England in the 1950s.  On his return in 1960, he became an active trade unionist, particularly in the stonemasons' and bricklayers' unions, while working as a stonemason himself.  He had an extremely active life as a politician for over 30 years, most of which is well known.  Some of it was spent outside the Labour Party when he led the Democratic Socialist Party.  My colleagues and I in the Labour Party were especially glad that he recently rejoined after the merger of the two parties.  The high esteem in which he was held by our party was evidenced by the fact that he went on to become vice-chairman and subsequently chairman, a position he held until he died.</P>
      <P>Jim Kemmy had another life outside politics which was equally important to him.  By and large, he was self-educated, widely read and the proud editor of the <i>Old Limerick Journal</i> for many years.  He was a great supporter of the arts in his native city and throughout the country.  His fine work <i>The Limerick Anthology</i> was published last year.  Many people are aware that he was looking forward to the publication of the compendium of Limerick literature in November and I understand the publication will be dedicated to his memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> Jim Kemmy's politics were influenced by strong views on poverty, personal freedom and the national question.  He voiced his views without fear or favour over the years and on many occasions when it was neither fashionable nor profitable.  If anyone doubted his stature and standing in the city he loved, they will have been left in no doubt by the scenes on the streets of Limerick during his funeral procession.  The people of Limerick lined the streets to say farewell to one of their favourite sons.  His companion Patsy, brother Joe, sisters Maureen and Joan and their families, all of whom are rightly proud of Jim and his achievements, will mourn his passing and they have our sincere sympathy on this sad occasion.</P>
    <P>Jim was a man of the people in the true sense of that expression &mdash; as a stonemason, trade unionist, politician, local historian or friend of many Members of this and the other House.  We all mourn his untimely passing.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the Seanad should mark the passing of Deputy Kemmy.  He was a great politician, Irishman and patriot.  He served as an excellent role model for anyone considering entering public life in that he was the epitome of what a good public representative and constituency person should be.  He was also a great survivor.  That is a tribute to his resilience and the fact that he fought causes which, at times, seemed unpopular.  However, he fought them in a principled manner.  He was deeply committed to the underprivileged.  With the passing of time issues which were unpopular when he first stood for them proved to be vindicated as was he by the success of some of those causes.</P>
      <P>Jim Kemmy was a fearless man with a great heart.  What one saw was what one got; that was the mark of the man.  His great love of Limerick has been referred to and was manifest in the fact that he was self-taught and none the worse for it. He was learned and there lies a lesson for those who presume themselves more learned than others by virtue of academic training or education.  Deputy Kemmy put the lie to that.  He was an emigrant and experienced what that did to people.  I am sure this informed many of the political battles he fought.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I extend our sympathy to his companion, family and friends and his colleagues in the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is item Nos. 1, 2 and 5.  Item 5 is the Fine Gael Party's Private Members motion on the live export trade for cattle.  Item 1 deals with the establishment of the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills.  This is a procedural motion which I propose to take without debate.  Item No. 2 concerns the <Col N="154" /> motion establishing a tribunal of inquiry into planning matters.  I propose a time limit of 15 minutes for spokespersons and 12 minutes for other Senators.  Senators may share time.  Item 5 will be taken from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader a number of questions regarding future legislation.  He kindly supplied me with a list of legislation which the Government proposes to introduce in the near future.  However, there are 90 items on the list and, given that there are only eight or nine sitting weeks between now and Christmas, I am not sure if all items, or which, or any of them, will be taken during that period.  It would facilitate the work of Members on all sides if the Leader could let us know today or next week which items will be taken in this session.  At present we do not know what business will be taken by the House.</P>
      <P>I wish to stress the importance of ensuring that as much legislation as possible is initiated in this House.  Both I and Senator Wright as Leaders of the House made a real effort to ensure that as much Government legislation as possible was initiated in this House.  Certain Bills in particular are appropriate to this House and I hope the Leader will make this point strongly to the Government and that we will again get good notice of Bills which will begin their life in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It was promised that a number of items would be restored to the Order Paper as a matter of urgency.  I note in the list supplied by the Leader that it is the Government's intention to restore Adoptions (No. 2) Bill and the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill.  What is the reason for the delay?  We are anxious to take the Adoptions (No. 2) Bill as soon as possible.  We were told there was great urgency about it last May and four months have elapsed.  We will make every effort to facilitate the Government in reintroducing that Bill on Report Stage.  We would be similarly supportive of legislation regarding the legislation dealing with the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the passage of which was hindered by certain electoral considerations. However, those considerations have now passed.</P>
      <P>When the workload in terms of legislation is light there is a good opportunity to debate a number of important motions.  A promise has been made for a debate on EMU.  I would also like an early debate on Northern Ireland.  This House has an important contribution to make to that debate and such debates in the past have always been very responsible.  Will the Leader inform the House when he intends to facilitate a debate on Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> It is vital that we have a debate on developments in the EU with special reference to the new treaty which we will be asked to discuss over the coming months.  A debate on a major European issue in this House, away from the pressures of the other House, would be helpful.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to draw the attention of the Leader to the desperately unsatisfactory state of office accommodation and secretarial help which I highlighted on the last occasion we sat.  Could the Leader ensure that an early and urgent meeting of Committee on Procedure and Privileges is convened to resolve these matters?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I previously raised the issue of support for Members in terms of salaries, allowances, expenses and office accommodation.  Both sides of the House have a similar objective on these issues and they should come together and make it clear to the Government that the Constitution requires that we are adequately supported in carrying out our work.  Members who are not getting that level of support should insist on it.</P>
      <P>I raised with the Leader previously the possibility of a debate on EMU.  This would fit in with the points made by Senator Manning about developments in the European Union as they are two sides of the same coin.  There is a need for elected public representatives to be informed and to be in a position to discuss with others the EMU and its likely impact on the economy in terms of interest rates, inflation, trade and industry, etc.</P>
      <P>On the last sitting day in May I was given a clear commitment by the then Leader of the House, Senator Manning, and the then leader of the main Opposition party, Senator Wright, that the Adoption Bill, which is important to people who have adopted South American children, would be taken as soon as the House resumed. We should show our commitment to it by taking it immediately.  There is no need for the Leader or anyone else to cause a delay.  Political expediency can create a problem.</P>
      <P>Six months ago we passed a resolution of support for the four people in County Louth who are taking a case against British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  The representative of the then Government also gave a commitment to support them.  During the election campaign both main parties expressed the same commitment.  This House should ensure the Government does what we previously asked it to do.</P>
      <P>I am glad no commitment was given to reintroduce the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill.  Many people in west Clare would be unhappy if that happened.  I would also be unhappy if those articulate and committed people in Fianna Fáil, not to mention the Progressive Democrats, who spoke against that Bill decided, for reasons of political expediency, to do an about turn on it.  These matters are important in terms of credibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate Senator Manning's point that it is no use outlining the programme for Government <Col N="156" /> when we want the programme of legislation for the next couple of months.  I would like to know what will be dealt with between now and Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We are satisfied with the Order of Business.  It is important to outline the programme of work between now and Christmas.  We do not want to depend on the Dáil or to do our work on a weekly basis.  We should have our own programme of work, particularly in relation to legislation.  A number of Members mentioned EMU, Sellafield and the Adoption Bill.  These should be discussed in the House.  Perhaps the Leader could outline the draft programme of work between now and Christmas.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges must meet urgently to discuss accommodation and services in the House.  At present, I am in an office without a secretary because no phone has been installed.  We are also unable to get furniture because of a disagreement between the Whips.  We need to resolve this issue as soon as possible or we will not be able to do our work satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Item 5, motion 7 refers to the OECD report on adult literacy which reveals that 500,000 Irish people, not 100,000 as was previously suggested, have serious literacy problems.  A new Minister with specific responsibility in this area has been appointed and he is anxious to open the debate on the issue of adult literacy.  I suggest that the Leader make time available to debate this matter at an early stage.  I know the Minister will be more than willing to become involved and listen to the views of Members on the matter.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago I raised the possibility of the House debating economic and monetary union.  Will the Leader arrange to debate this matter and the single currency as soon as possible?  I support the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition that such a debate could embrace areas including the Amsterdam Treaty, objective 1 status and the mid-term view. The House could consider the impact of economic and monetary union on industry, agriculture and the services industry.  Will the Leader afford the House the soonest possible opportunity to engage in a two hour debate on this important matter?</P>

      <P>Will the Leader confirm whether the Geneva Convention Bill will be included on the list of legislation to be dealt with in the near future?  If it is included, will he ensure that it is placed as high as possible on the list?  This Bill was published in May and will permit Ireland to ratify the 1977 Protocols to the Geneva Convention.  As 20 years have passed since the publication of those Protocols, it is timely that we should ratify them.</P>

      <P>I hope it is appropriate to raise this matter on the Order of Business and I trust the Cathaoirleach will allow me to do so.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate in the near future on a matter which concerns families, communities and particularly pre-teen children, namely, the inclusion in daily and Sunday newspapers of advertisements pertaining to sex chat lines?  The phrase &ldquo;aural sex&rdquo; could be coined to describe these services.  The content of such sex chat lines is shocking, the cost of using them is outrageous &mdash; £1.58 per minute &mdash; and the print used in advertisements promoting them is illegible.  The idea behind such services is salacious, disgraceful, anti-family, anti-women and anti-children.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on funding from the National Roads Authority?  Members are aware that I raised this issue on numerous occasions.  If I lost the battle to have it debated in the House I would throw my hat in the air.  At present, 73 per cent of all National Roads Authority funding is being given to Dublin and Cork.  Therefore, 27 per cent of that funding is spent on roads in rural areas.  I find it difficult when driving to Stillorgan, to see flowers being replaced on the island in the centre of the road and notice that the boundary walls of the road are made from cut stone while when driving to my home in the north west I must negotiate roads with dangerous corners and bad surfaces which have fallen into disrepair.  I have received no satisfaction in trying to resolve this problem, other than obtaining the address of the secretary of a person working for the National Roads Authority whom I am informed I should contact.</P>
      <P>If we have transferred financial resources and responsibility for a service to an authority which is untouchable or uncontactable, it is time we placed our feet back on the ground.  Senator Manning supported my calls for a debate on this issue on previous occasions and I hope the Leader will make arrangements in that regard.  This matter is of concern to those who elected many Members to this House.  Local authority members are crying out for an answer and they elected us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At the beginning of this new session, I ask that the conduct of the press in the approach to the Seanad election be investigated; there was disgraceful reportage of the election and the results.  I am not speaking against the dedicated daily reporting of the Seanad but the editorial staff of newspapers, radio and television who have treated the Seanad as if does not exist. They eulogise other public figures but always run down the role of the Seanad and Senators.</P>
      <P>I ask editorial staff to conduct an in-depth examination of the reportage of this important House of the Oireachtas.  I ask the reporters who are here daily, to add their voices and to try to get an adequate response to the reportage of the Seanad.  If we do nothing else in the next few weeks but address this problem, this House will be enhanced.</P>
      <P>There are dedicated members of the press here daily who are being shafted by their so-called subeditors.  This matter needs to be addressed on the basis of public relations.  During the election, no one could find out who had been elected or what was happening.  This is not the fault of the staff of the House, the Cathaoirleach or the Members. It is the fault of the very people who are trying to play down the importance of this House.</P>
      <P>There are a number of urgent items I wish to raise but I shall leave them until next week as they cannot be addressed today.  I support what Senator McGowan said about the National Roads Authority.  On many occasions I have raised the problem of the daily gridlock in the south east.  It takes an hour and a half for people to travel from Tipperary, Kilkenny and Carlow to the regional hospital in Waterford because they cannot get across the bridge.  In 1956 I owned a Prinz 2 car and could reach Waterford in half an hour.</P>

      <P>Under Papers laid before the Seanad on Order Paper, item 38 reads: &ldquo;.Statement regarding guarantees of borrowing by Bord na Móna.&rdquo;. I ask the Leader to confirm with the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance when the remainder of the agreed amount of investment to replace the commercial borrowings of Bord na Móna will be sanctioned by the Government.  Last year a package was agreed by the then Government and the first instalment of investment was paid last December. I am glad the Government paid a further instalment in recent weeks.  However, I expected that the remainder would be paid.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the fishing industry?  It is a neglected industry and the issues which need to be <Col N="159" /> addressed include the policing of the coastline, the conservation of stocks, the pollution of rivers and the proper development of aquaculture and mariculture.  Such a debate is long overdue because the problems of the fishing industry have rarely had an airing in the Oireachtas.  We need to ensure the future of the industry and of our fish stocks.  We should bear in mind that we have almost 25 per cent of European fishing waters but less than 4 per cent of the fishing quota.</P>

It has been debated in the past.  It has important consequences for jobs in the regional airports and at Dublin airport.  The Minister for Finance should come to the House to update Members on the issue.</P>

      <P>I am glad to find Members in a good working mood.  I will not disappoint them. Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello asked about the legislation which will come before the House between now and Christmas.  It is envisaged that 21 Bills will come before the House.  I assure Members that I will do my utmost to have as much legislation as possible initiated in the Seanad.  At yesterday's Government meeting I was appointed to the joint legislative committee which meets weekly and that will be useful in trying to have legislation initiated in the House.  In the light of the voting strength in the Dáil it might be easier now to have legislation come before the House than in the past.  Senator Lanigan, a former distinguished Leader of the House, made the point that press interest in our proceedings would increase if more legislation were to be initiated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated, 21 items of legislation will come before the House.  They include the Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) (Amendment) Bill; Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers, Functions and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill; Education (No. 2) Bill; Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill; Local Government Funding Bill, which will be of interest to Senator McGowan; Taxes Consolidation Bill, which I understand is a large item of legislation; Appropriation Bill; Adoption (No. 2) Bill; Children (Juvenile Justice) Bill; Children Bill, which lapsed on the dissolution of the last Dáil; Criminal Justice Bill; Child Pornography Bill, which relates to the point made by Senator Ridge; Courts Service Bill; International Commercial Arbitration Bill; War Crimes Tribunal Bill; Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgements Bill; Merchant <Col N="160" /> Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill; Merchant Shipping (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; Air Navigation and Transport Bill and the Turf Development Bill and the points raised by Senator Gallagher might be accommodated. Those are the Bills we know of and I am sure more legislation will come on stream to take us up to 24 December.</P>
    <P>The adoption Bill has been referred to the new Attorney General and we await his advice in the matter.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will meet with the Paraguayan children and parents before the end of October.  I envisage that we will receive the Bill by mid-November.  The Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill will be ready within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole, Manning, Costello and Finneran were anxious to have a debate on EMU.  I propose to take Statements on EMU on Thursday, 16 October.  This debate will be open ended so that every Member will have an opportunity to participate, and I would encourage Members to do so.  I propose that the matter be debated over a number of days because this important event will benefit the country enormously.</P>
    <P>I will meet the Leaders following the Order of Business to see when it might be appropriate to have a debate on Northern Ireland.  I am also in favour of a full debate on Europe.</P>
    <P>I met with the Government Chief Whip and the Assistant Chief Whip and put the various concerns of Members to them regarding the lack of services in this House.  I understand the Department of Finance will come back to us on this on Friday next.  Additional money was sought to bring the services up to the required standard.  I will liaise with the Leaders and the Whips following the meeting on Friday.  This is an urgent matter and Members are seriously concerned about it.  New Members are totally disillusioned in this regard.  I had hoped to have the matter concluded by today but, because of events in the other House, this was not possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry requested information relating to the Geneva Convention.  I will seek the information the Senator requires and come back to her on the matter.  I agree fully with Senator Ridge's request; that matter may be discussed during the debate on the Bills that will be coming before us in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senators McGowan, Lanigan and others asked for a debate on the National Roads Authority. The National Roads Authority has a fine record under all Governments but there are areas where it can be improved.  I know the localities mentioned by Senators McGowan and Lanigan.  I was there recently, as were most Members of this House.  A debate on this matter would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>I will seek a reply to Senator O'Dowd's proposal and discuss the matter with him later this evening.  Senator Gallagher mentioned Bord na Móna.  I understand a Bill will be before us in the <Col N="161" /> next couple of weeks.  Coming from the midlands, I understand how important the peat industry is in that area and I fully support the Senator's views.  I wholeheartedly support Senator O'Donovan's call for a debate on the importance of the fishing industry and I will see what I can do to facilitate his request.  In relation to Senator Seán Ryan, I have a vested interest in regard to duty free.  I support the Senator's request and will communicate with him, possibly tomorrow afternoon, to see how his proposal can be progressed.</P>

    <P>1.  The identification of the lands stated to be 726 acres in extent, referred to in the letter dated 8th June, 1989 from Mr. Michael Bailey to Mr. James Gogarty (reproduced in the Schedule herewith) and the establishment of the beneficial ownership of the lands at that date and changes in the beneficial ownership of the lands since the 8th June, 1989 prior to their development;</P>

    <P>6.  And that the Tribunal be requested to make recommendations in relation to such amendments to Planning, Local Government and Ethics in Public Office and any other relevant legislation as the Tribunal considers appropriate having regard to its findings.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;payment&rsquo; includes money and any benefit in kind and the payment to any person includes a payment to a connected person within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.</P>

    <P>(ii) To inquire fully into all matters referred to above in relation to which such evidence may be found to exist, dealing in the first instance with the acknowledged monetary donation debated in Dáil Éireann on the 10th September 1997 Dáil Debates Columns 616-638 and to report to the Clerk of the Dáil thereupon,</P>
    <P>(iii) To seek discovery of all relevant documents, files and papers in the possession, power or procurement of said Mr. Michael Bailey, Mr. James Gogarty and Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly Solicitors,</P>
    <P>(iv) In relation to any matters where the Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry, to report that fact to the Clerk of the Dáil and to report in such a manner as the Tribunal thinks appropriate, on the steps taken by the Tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed, and the Clerk of the Dáil shall thereupon communicate the Tribunal's report in full to the Dáil,</P>
    <P>(v) To report on an interim basis not later than one month from the date of establishment of the Tribunal or the tenth day of any oral hearing, whichever shall <Col N="165" /> first occur, to the Clerk of the Dáil on the following matters:</P>
    <P>the numbers of parties then represented before the Tribunal;</P>

    <P>C. And that the person or persons selected to conduct the Inquiry should be informed that it is the desire of the House that-</P>
    <P>(a) the Inquiry be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it, and, in respect to the matters referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 above, if possible, not later than the 31st December 1997, and</P>
    <P>(b) all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the Inquiry should, so far as is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals.</P>
    <P>D. And that the Clerk of the Dáil shall on receipt of any Report from the Tribunal arrange to have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas immediately on its receipt.</P>

    <P>As an alternative to the outright purchase proposal above I am prepared to deal with Lots 1-5 (inclusive) above on the basis that I would be given a 50% share in the ownership of the said lands in exchange for procuring Planning Permission and Building Bye Law Approval.

    <P>A period of 2 years within which to procure a buildable Planning Permission and Building Bye Laws Approval for mixed development including housing, industrial and commercial.</P>

    <P>Expenditure</P>
    <P>In considering the above proposals the following points of information should be borne in mind by all parties:-</P>
    <P>1.  From the point of view of obtaining Planning Permission the entire lands (lots 1 to 6 inclusive) have the following shortcoming:-</P>
    <P>NO zoning for development purposes</P>
    <P>NO services</P>
    <P>NO proposal in current draft development plans (City and County) for the zoning of the lands or any part thereof for development purposes.</P>
    <P>2.  We face a very severe uphill battle to arrange for the availability of services and for the ultimate procurement of Planning Permission.</P>
    <P>3.  The steps to be taken on the way to procuring a buildable Planning Permission and Building Bye Laws Approval are notoriously difficult, time-consuming and expensive. Material Contravention Orders must be obtained and this involves the procurement of a majority vote at 2 full Council Meetings at which 78 Council Members must be present and it also involves satisfactory compliance with extensive requirements and pre-conditions of the Planning Authority and the inevitable dealing with protracted Appeals to an Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>4.  It is essential that the Planning Application should be brought in the name of an active housebuilding company which enjoys good standing and good working relationship with the Planners and the Council Members and in this regard I confirm that in the event of our reaching agreement regarding the within proposals that all Planning Applications would be made by one of my Companies which meets the said requirements.</P>
    <P>5.  In the case of all of the lands the applications will be highly sensitive and controversial and we can realistically expect strenuous opposition from private, political and planning sectors. One of my active companies will have to take the limelight in such applications and withstand the objections and protests which will inevitably confront it.  Apart from the anticipated financial expenditure as outlined above it <Col N="168" /> should be borne in mind that I will personally have to give extensively of my time and efforts over the entire period of the applications including the necessary preliminary negotiations in regard to services and zoning.  It must be borne in mind that I will have to abandon other projects which would be open to myself and my companies in order to give proper attention to this project.  If I am successful in changing your lands from their present status of agricultural lands with very limited potential even for agricultural use into highly valuable building lands I would have to be rewarded with a minimum 50% stake in the ownership of the lands.  Our advisers would have to work out the details as to how this can be effected in the most tax-efficient manner.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing from you in relation to the above proposals.  In the case of the first proposal which relates to the outright purchase of the lands (excluding Lot 6) I would not be adverse to a proposal which would involve the vendors retaining a participation stake of up to 20% in the purchasing company if you felt that an ongoing interest in the future development of the lands would be more acceptable to the present owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government I am asking the Seanad to approve the resolution passed by the Dáil yesterday providing for the establishment of a tribunal, under the Tribunal of Inquiries Acts, 1921 to 1979, and to investigate, in particular, the planning history of certain lands and, more generally, any instances of possible corruption of the planning system that come to its attention.  The lands in question, which are the primary focus of the inquiry, comprise six parcels, 726 acres in extent, in North Dublin and were the subject of the letter which is attached to the motion circulated to Senators.  In view of the fact that this letter was widely interpreted as raising questions about the integrity of the planning system by referring to the procurement of planning permission, services and by-law approval, the Government decided at its meeting on Tuesday of last week to move a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas establishing a tribunal of inquiry to deal authoritatively and conclusively with the <Col N="169" /> public concerns to which that letter and other allegations in the planning area are giving rise.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of reference, included in this motion, the tribunal will examine in full detail the planning history of all the lands which were the subject of Mr. Bailey's letter together with the associated servicing and by-law approval relating to these lands.  Additionally, it will consider any matters of which it becomes aware suggesting corruption or other abuses of the planning system even if not directly connected to the lands in question.  It is the earnest desire of the Government, and I am sure of the Seanad, that this tribunal will do much to eradicate the public cynicism which has been eroding public confidence in, not just the planning system itself, but indeed in our democratic institutions.</P>
      <P>The people value our democratic system of government very highly.  The democratic institutions &mdash; local and national &mdash; and the public representatives who serve in them are vital to the operation of our democracy.  For democracy to flourish the public must have confidence in the workings of our democratic institutions and the integrity of the people who serve in them.  It follows that anything that undermines public confidence in either the workings of the institutions or public representatives cannot be viewed by anybody who prizes democracy except with the utmost concern.  Of course, confidence can be undermined by wrongdoing or misconduct on the part of politicians or officials who serve in our institutions.  It can also, though, be undermined just as seriously, and more insidiously, by allegations of malpractice, innuendo and rumour, even if these have little basis in fact or are malicious in intent.</P>
      <P>I am certain that there is no Member of the Oireachtas who does not feel some unease about the continued emergence of allegations and innuendo in relation to the operation of the physical planning system and the involvement of public representatives.  A number of these allegations go back some time.  It is not clear whether they stem from disapproval on environmental grounds of some of the decisions taken by councils and the suspicion that they are only explicable by unworthy motives of corrupt financial gain, or whether there really are, in fact, very serious grounds for concern.  The Government is now convinced that effective and conclusive action must be taken to put a halt to the corrosive effects of these allegations on the body politic. We believe that the tribunal of inquiry to be set up with the proposed terms of reference will do that very effectively and vindicate the integrity of those who serve our political institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effective and efficient physical planning system is essential to economic and social development as well as to the protection of our environment and the quality of life generally.  The planning process must operate in a fair, open and transparent manner and must be seen to do so. People with legitimate interests or concerns must be given a fair hearing, whether in the making of <Col N="170" /> the development plans or in individual applications for planning permission.</P>
    <P>It does not serve the process well if lingering doubts persist in relation to its honesty, nor is it fair to the vast majority of elected representatives and public officials who do a difficult job to their upmost ability if their honesty and integrity is being systematically impugned by malicious and unjustified rumour.  We need to be sure that when councillors take decisions for the benefit of their constituents &mdash; even where those constituents are landowners, builders and developers &mdash; they are not doing so for personal pecuniary gain.</P>
    <P>Many people have interpreted Mr. Bailey's letter as raising doubts about the integrity of the planning process in relation to the treatment of the rather extensive lands referred to.  The proper interpretation of the letter must be clearly established, as it is not in the public interest that such suspicions should be allowed to persist.  The Government has decieded to bring forward an inclusivemotion which will allow us, once and for all, to deal conclusively with the allegations currently dogging the planning system.</P>
    <P>The Government is convinced that only a fullinvestigation by a tribunal of inquiry will allow us to arrive at the truth of these allegations and restore public confidence.  That is why the terms of reference before us enable the tribunal to deal with all of the issues arising in connection with the planning history of the lands referred to in the letter and will also allow the tribunal to deal with any acts during the period in question which, in its opinion, amount to corruption or other perversions of the planning process and which come to its notice during its investigations.  To give any less scope to the tribunal would be to fail all the elected members, officials and members of the public who operate the planning system fairly and honestly.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the highest standards apply in the operation of the planning system.  The system must be fair and it must be seen to be fair. Above all, the public must have confidence in the integrity of the officials and councillors who carry out the planning functions of local authorities.  It must be clear that the decisions taken by councillors and officials alike are in the common good and not for personal gain.</P>
    <P>Planning makes a very important contribution to the quality of life in this country and underpins our endeavours to achieve the social, economic and environmental sustainability of development. Proper professional standards must be applied to all planning issues whether at the strategic level of the development plan or the operational level of development control.  Planning is a professional discipline, the operation and practice of which require that a wide range of factors and considerations be taken into account and balanced in the interests of the common good.  This process must be done in a completely open manner; the rationale for all decisions reached must be clearly set out and available to all interested parties.  Professional standards must not only be <Col N="171" /> applied but be seen to be applied.  This holds true for decisions of councillors and officials alike.</P>
    <P>Local authority and An Bord Pleanála files on individual planning applications are available for inspection by the public.  There may be a case for more stringent requirements for local authorities to provide a fuller justification for decisions taken in relation to rezoning or material contravention. This is something that can be looked at in the context of the current review of the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>To safeguard public confidence, the Planning Acts require extensive declarations of interest on the part of councillors and planning officials of local authorities.  However, these requirements have not always prevented public cynicism about the operation of the planning system.  I believe, therefore, that there is a further obligation on both councillors and officials to ensure that their actions are not open to misinterpretation or do not give grounds for suspicion.  Of all the responsibilities and functions of local authorities, planning, through its very nature, is the most demanding in this regard.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that all decisions in development planning which are the responsibility of elected councillors must necessarily agree on all accounts with the official advice, or that councillors are there to rubber stamp official recommendations.  Planning is a complex process involving balancing many issues and that is why the law gives responsibility to people who are fully accountable to the electorate.  However, where councillors decide to zone land against official advice, they must be sure that it is properly justified.</P>
    <P>It is important that we bear in mind the purpose of this tribunal.  It is to inquire into whether improper payments or other inducements were offered to elected representatives or officials in order to secure rezoning of land, planning permission, servicing of land and so on.</P>
    <P>This inquiry is not about bad planning decisions or about incompetence in planning matters.  All of us have disagreed at some stage or other with the decision of a planning authority in relation to the zoning of land or their decision on an application for planning permission.  That is not to say that we considered such decisions tainted by corruption.  Therefore, we must be sure that we stay focused on the purpose of this inquiry; that is decisions achieved by corrupt means as opposed to decisions of doubtful planning merit.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons that the difficult situation arose in relation to the zoning of land in County Dublin was due to a failure of the then council to meet its statutory obligations under the Planning and Development Act, 1963.  This provides that a local planning authority must review its development plan at least every five years.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the 1993 Dublin county development plan was adopted ten years after the adoption of the previous plan.  Indeed, the Fingal <Col N="172" /> County Manager's report, which will be presented to the tribunal, points out that it was not surprising that the land use strategy in north County Dublin needed significant review resulting in extensive rezonings given the major industrial, commercial and residential development which was taking place in the area.</P>
    <P>This requirement to review development plans every five years was designed to ensure that planning would operate on the basis of up-to-date development plans which would provide a relevant context for planning control decisions.  The five year delay in completing the review of the Dublin county development plan meant that planning decisions on development proposals were not being taken with the benefit of a strategic context for the development of the county which an up-to-date development plan would have provided.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the absence of such a plan contributed to the planning problems in County Dublin in the period we are talking about.  There is a clear lesson that steps must be taken to ensure that in the future local authorities keep their development plans up-to-date and relevant to current planning decisions.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme recognises that we must update our planning laws to meet the needs of the future and this Government is committed to a wide ranging review of present planning laws.  The basic principles of the planning system were laid down 34 years ago with the introduction of the 1963 Act.  The system as operated under this Act, and subsequent amendments, has generally served us well.  However, much has changed since 1963 in regard to planning, protection and awareness of the environment and people's expectations regarding participation in the decision making processes that affect their lives, whether at national or local level.</P>
    <P>Much of the doubt and suspicion regarding the development plan review process arises out of the impression from some quarters that local interests are always at a disadvantage compared to business interests when it comes to drawing up the development plan.  While this view can often be mistaken, the Government believes that by making the development plan more inclusive many of these doubts can be overcome.</P>
    <P>A more proactive approach to consultation at an earlier stage of the review process would help achieve more widespread agreement among all the interests on the basic principles of the development plan.  This should make the latter stage of the review less contentious when the actual details are being decided upon.</P>
    <P>The Government has already taken action on its commitment and has initiated a comprehensive review of planning legislation.  The Department is at present in the course of consulting widely with the general public, all the local planning authorities in the State and a wide range of interest groups who are affected in one way or another by the operation of the planning system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> Those who wish to make observations have been asked to do so by 10 October.  When all the observations and ideas have been considered, it is planned to hold a convention before the end of the year to debate the various issues which the review gives rise to.</P>
    <P>Preparations are advanced for drawing up strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which can play an important role in drawing up development plans.  These guidelines are to be drawn up by consultants in consultation with local and regional authorities in the Dublin and mid-east regions.  It is intended that the guidelines, which will be drawn up over 12 months with a 12 year horizon, will put in place a broad planning framework &mdash; an overall strategic context within which the subsequent development plan reviews of the constituent planning authorities in the Dublin and mid-east regional authority areas would be undertaken.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the guidelines would be accepted by the local and regional authorities involved as setting the general direction in which development should evolve in their areas over the next 12 years or so.  The Government intends to introduce legislation to ensure that all local authorities, in reviewing their development plans, will have regard to strategic planning guidelines relevant to their areas.</P>
    <P>I will now turn in more detail to the terms of reference that are before the House.  In the first place, these require the tribunal to investigate the circumstances of the letter sent by Mr. Bailey to Mr. Gogarty in June 1989.  It will first identify and then investigate the planning history of all the lands detailed in that letter.  The tribunal will inquire into all councillors, Oireachtas Members and officials who had any hand, act or part in any matters relating to the development of those lands.</P>
    <P>In addition to the actual consideration of zoning the lands in question, the terms of reference also propose that the tribunal investigates applications for planning permission in relation to those lands since June 1985, which is the date of the last preceding local authority elections.</P>
    <P>The zoning of the lands for development is very closely related to the provision of water, sewerage and other services, and the servicing of the lands is among the matters mentioned in the letter. Therefore, it is appropriate that the tribunal should consider the question of servicing these lands and whether any improper attempt was made to influence the provision of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Building by-law approval was required for all new buildings constructed in the Dublin area prior to June 1992 and fire safety certificates have been required since that date in respect of certain types of building.  The procurement of building by-law approval was also referred to in the letter and the tribunal is being asked to investigate whether there was anything untoward regarding the grant of either by-law approval or fire safety certificates in respect of buildings built on the land in question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> The Government recognises that enterprise areas have an important role to play in creating employment in areas where special incentives are needed to create jobs.  However, such designation of land for tax purposes confers major benefits on landowners and has implications for the zoning of land.  It must be carried out in a transparent manner and in a way that will inspire public confidence.  That is why this issue is being included in the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to paragraphs 4 and 5 of the terms of reference which, this House will agree, are pivotal.  Under these provisions, the tribunal will inquire into all payments made by Mr. Bailey and Mr. Gogarty to public representatives, political parties and officials since June 1985.  The tribunal must then find out the circumstances and motives for any such payments, and if there was any attempt to improperly influence the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>On a broader level, the tribunal will be able to investigate allegations of corruption in the planning system which come to its attention.  Where the tribunal believes it has found evidence of corruption or an attempt to improperly influence the process, it will be obliged to follow up on that evidence, report on it and make whatever recommendations it considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>I should also stress that the remit of the tribunal does not extend solely to the actions of elected representatives.  If there has been any impropriety on the part of an official in the performance of their functions in relation to the planning process, the tribunal will also investigate it.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference make provision for the tribunal to seek relevant documents from Mr. Bailey, Mr. Gogarty and Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly, Solicitors.  As Mr. Bailey's letter to Mr. Gogarty is central to the inquiry, it is obvious that the tribunal should be in a position to discover relevant documents.  Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly, Solicitors, have recently written to party leaders about the terms of reference and referring to information in their possession.  Clearly it is desirable that whatever information they have be made available to the tribunal.  The solicitors have frequently said that their, so far unnamed, clients were motivated by a desire to have a public inquiry into allegations of land rezoning corruption in County Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the firm of solicitors in question is based beyond the jurisdiction of this State and that, for this reason, the enforcement of the powers of discovery in the terms of reference may give rise to legal complexities.  However, we have gone as far as it is legally within our powers to go in this respect.  It would be astonishing given the background if it becomes necessary for the tribunal to have recourse to these powers.</P>
    <P>It was clear from the debate in the other House yesterday that it would be completely unacceptable for this firm of solicitors, their clients and complainants to do anything other than put before the tribunal all documents and <Col N="175" /> information in their possession in relation to any possible improprieties in the planning system.  I am sure the same message will go out clearly from this House.</P>
    <P>If the tribunal points up deficiencies in the Planning Acts, or other relevant legislation such as the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, or where wrongdoing is identified, the Government is committed to ensuring that such issues are properly addressed.  Any recommendations with regard to the Planning Acts arising from the tribunal's report will be addressed as part of the planning review I mentioned earlier.  In addition, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce provisions similar to those in the Ethics in Public Office Act for local authorities and any relevant recommendations of the tribunal will be taken on board in this process.</P>
    <P>No one can deny that the Government has been very open about the terms of reference and very accommodating of the reservations and observations put forward by the Opposition parties.  As a result of the prolonged and detailed discussions we have rather lengthy and complex draft terms of reference that contrast somewhat with the more broad brush style of the earlier drafts, but so be it.</P>
    <P>We have now a set of terms of reference that are acceptable to all the Oireachtas parties and I wish to thank the Opposition parties for their efforts and co-operation in working out mutually acceptable terms for the tribunal.  The fact that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government accepted, for all practical purposes, all seven amendments tabled by Deputy Dukes, the Fine Gael spokesman, in the Dáil is further evidence of the level of co-operation and agreement that now exists in the matter.</P>
    <P>Senators can be assured that this investigation will be thorough and will cover any aspect of the lands in question that might give rise to public concern.  We have all seen the benefits of tribunals with focused terms of reference and I am sure we all want this tribunal to be as focused as possible.  Nevertheless the terms of reference will enable the tribunal to investigate any other serious allegations relating to planning decisions in the period in question that are brought, or come to, its attention.  None of us wants to see a situation where issues of concern that come to light during its deliberations cannot be followed up because the terms of reference are too narrow or that such issues are left unresolved leading to calls for yet another inquiry.  Subject to this there is an obligation on the tribunal to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible and to expedite its investigations.</P>
    <P>As in the case of other recent tribunals, the terms of reference require an interim report to inform the House of early progress and to give a general indication of the likely extent and duration of proceedings.</P>
    <P>The procedural part of the terms of reference also requires the tribunal to deal in the first <Col N="176" /> instance with the acknowledged political contribution to former Minister Burke and to report on it to the Dáil.  There is also an obligation to report, if possible, on this matter, the planning history of the land and any related payments before the end of this year.  It is acknowledged that the investigation of any broader allegations of corruption may take longer depending on the number and nature of them as will the matter of making recommendations regarding legislative change.</P>
    <P>As I have said, our democratic institutions in general, and the planning system in particular, are much too important to tolerate any hint of corruption or impropriety.  Corruption, constant suspicion of corruption or innuendo could destroy the morale and reputation of both.</P>
    <P>The good reputation of many elected representatives and officials who work the planning process honestly and diligently demands that confidence in the system is restored and maintained. Accordingly, I commend this motion and the terms of reference to the House.</P>

      <P>Before calling Senator Doyle I would like to acknowledge that this is the Minister's first visit to the Seanad since he was appointed.  I welcome him to this House and congratulate him on his appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur and welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that I find it regrettable this debate is taking place in the aftermath of the resignation from Cabinet and Dáil Éireann of Raphael Burke.  In my opinion his resignation and this debate would have been unnecessary if the Government parties had grasped the opportunities given them in the Dáil by the Opposition parties and had had this issue examined by the Moriarty tribunal.  Under its terms of reference the tribunal will examine in detail the planning history of the six parcels of land referred to in the letter of 8 June 1989 from Mr. Michael Bailey to Mr. James Gogarty.  I am pleased to note that under the terms of reference, paragraph 5, if the tribunal becomes aware of other issues suggesting corruption in the planning system, even if they were not directly connected to the lands in question, it will have the power and right to consider these issues.  That is important.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the tribunal for two reasons: first, it will provide a mechanism for Mr. Burke to vindicate his good name and reputation and it will enable those who have made accusations against him to do so under oath, under cross-examination and without the fear or threat of libel; second, I hope the findings of the tribunal will lift the cloud that hangs over the heads of all the members of the former Dublin County Council and will succeed in setting to rest all the unfounded allegations and innuendoes which have been levelled from time to time against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> The Minister's speech said that, of all the responsibilities and functions of local authorities, planning through its very nature is the most demanding.  Planning is a very important function of local authority members.  There are a number of avenues open to local authority members when they are discussing planning applications.  Once a planning authority has passed its development plan, then all the planning decisions have to relate to that plan and very often local authorities, having adopted a development plan, find it has before it an excellent planning application, but unfortunately it cannot give it permission because it would be contrary to the development plan.  Then the council, if it so wishes, will consider the planning application as a material contravention to the development plan, even though the planning application would be contrary to it and would breach its own official plan.  The material contravention plan is an accepted part of a planning application.  If the council agrees, then the development will go ahead subject to the approval of An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>Another planning avenue open to councillors is the making of a variation.  This involves the same process as the drawing up of a new plan in that the application has to be voted on twice.  In reality a variation only involves a changing or zoning a parcel of land.  Recently Dublin City Council, of which I am a member and chairman of its planning committee, had to make a variation to its development plan in order to provide for the tunnel from Marino to the port.  There were extensive discussions on those variations and consultations with the public before the decision was made.</P>
    <P>Finally and most importantly, there is a local authority's function in reviewing its development plan every five years.  In an area such as County Dublin, councillors reviewing the development plan were required to rezone parcels of land so as to provide more land for building and industrial purposes.  It seems that one of the real problems was that, instead of reviewing the plan every five years, ten years would elapse before the plan was reviewed.  As the Minister pointed out, the manager of Fingal County Council stated in his report that there had been significant requirements for major industrial, commercial and residential development in that particular area and councillors had to address that need.  In doing so, I am sure they had to act responsibly in the rezoning they agreed.</P>
    <P>Responsible zoning is a lawful function of local authority members.  I put great emphasis on the word &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; because rezoning can only be considered when it is in accordance with the good planning and development of an area.  Councillors, in making their decisions, must take into account the advice they receive from the planning officials.  However, as the Minister said, councillors can still make a good and responsible zoning decision even if they do not accept the advice given, and I would concur with that view.  There would be little function in having councillors if <Col N="178" /> they were to rubber stamp every decision which officials put to them.</P>
    <P>I was not a member of Dublin County Council so I cannot say that irresponsible zoning decisions were made or that members received inducements or rewards for making such decisions.  That is a matter for the tribunal to decide.  As a member of a local authority who has been involved in planning over a long number of years, I have been deeply shocked by the allegations and innuendo which has been made in the press concerning rezoning by members of former Dublin County Council.  It now appears that in 1995 individuals concerned about the continuing rezoning of lands by councillors against professional planning advice and reports of alleged corruption decided to take action.  These anonymous individuals &mdash; it is the first time I heard that people who cared for the environment wanted to remain anonymous &mdash; are not really anonymous because an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last week stated that the names of these individuals were known to the journalist.  These individuals working through Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly Solicitors offered £10,000 for information leading to convictions for corruption and I understand that firm now has 50 or so reports on these issues.  I am pleased that under its terms of reference this tribunal has powers to seek discovery of the relevant documents, files and papers in the possession of this firm.</P>
    <P>Over a long period of time there has been a constant drip, drip in the media about allegations in relation to planning decisions, zoning, etc.  A number of newspaper articles have stated that if it were not for the fear of libel they would name individuals.  I hope the tribunal will examine a series of articles published in <i>The Irish Times</i> in July 1993, one of which, dated 13 July 1993, stated that the journalist met a business man in the property world who told the journalist that he had personally handed a white envelope containing £2,500 to a named councillor in a successful effort to persuade him to change his vote on a key zoning decision.  I hope the authors of these articles will co-operate fully with the tribunal. Now is the time for them and people like them to speak up or shut up.</P>
    <P>A firm regulation should be introduced to ensure that each local authority reviews its development plan every five years.  The lack of such a provision resulted in some of Dublin County Council's difficulties.</P>
    <P>There should also be a system of dovetailing the development plan of one county with that of another.  Some progress has been made on this issue with the regional authorities.  I am a member of Dublin Regional Authority and I would like to see it dovetail the development plans of the four local authorities in the greater Dublin area.  Unfortunately, the difficulty is that each local authority reviews its development plan at different times so it is very difficult to dovetail them.  One way of overcoming this would be to have local authorities throughout the country <Col N="179" /> review their development plans on fixed dates.  If that were the case, not alone could there be co-ordination within a region but there could be a national plan for the whole country.</P>
    <P>Local authority members have grave responsibilities in relation to planning matters.  Members who are involved in these decisions should receive sufficient expenses to carry out their functions.  As far as I am aware, Dublin councillors have fallen way behind councillors in the rest of the country under the new system of expenses for councillors and that should be examined.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, accepted the amendments tabled by the Fine Gael Party to the terms of reference of the tribunal and I do not intend to ask the House to consider any amendments today.  The Minister said that the important issue in relation to this tribunal of inquiry is that it will be effective in its workings and vindicate the integrity of those who serve our political institutions.  That is its main function and I hope that will be its final result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Molloy, to the House.  Having regard to the fact that one of the prime objectives of this tribunal was to get to the bottom of allegations against the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, it would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to Ray Burke for his long and dedicated service to the other House and, more particularly, north Dublin and the country, especially vis-a -vis his excellent performance during the current peace negotiations.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on all politicians, whether members of local authorities or Members of this or the other House, that without due process of law a person can be forced from office because of ongoing allegations or innuendo.  There is a basic principle in law that one is innocent until proven guilty.  It is regrettable people did not wait until this tribunal was over to ascertain if any guilt, impropriety or wrongdoing was attributable to Mr. Burke.  This politician has been hounded out of office purely on allegations and I wish that this be stressed now that the media are present.  I am not criticising them, however, as there were other political motives involved.  Raphael Burke has not alone resigned his position as Minister for Foreign Affairs but has also retired from the Dáil.  If this is the way the political system is to evolve, I have grave concerns for its future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was led to believe in my legal studies that every person is entitled to his integrity and to be considered innocent until proven otherwise.  Allegations in letters emanating from outside the State not substantiated under oath, by affirmation, or by way of statutory declaration, and published in a particular paper, have been the downfall of a particular politician.  That said, I welcome the tribunal which, although it may have been sought by Opposition parties with a view <Col N="180" /> to upsetting the applecart as far as Mr. Burke is concerned, has a wider remit which I welcome.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is mainly concerned with six parcels of land in Dublin constituting 726 acres, the planning applications surrounding them and various allegations of corruption, malpractice and bribery.  It has broad implications which will affect everyone.  If it succeeds in establishing that such malpractice occurred in the greater Dublin area, it will have a knock-on effect and open the floodgates for every council throughout the country.  Whether we like it or not, politicians are unfortunately held in contempt and there is huge apathy among the public for all politicians.  I have been a member of the local authority in County Cork for the past 12 years and sinister allegations of bribery and corruption have been made at meetings.  As a former chairman of that august body and in my 12 years as a member, I have nothing but the highest regard for the various managers and planning officers in the county. Although the system might not be perfect, it works reasonably well.</P>
    <P>Everyone, including the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and all parties in both Houses, should hold the view that this tribunal will clear the air completely.  I hope it does but I have grave reservations about that in so far as there is a public perception that planning, be it in Cork, Dublin or Mayo, is corrupt. That is an unfair allegation, not alone against politicians who are used to it, but against the fair, decent and honourable men working in county councils and planning offices at managerial level who are doing an excellent job but are tainted by these allegations.  That is unfair because they are entitled to their honour, dignity and professionalism.  It is unfair that everyone is tarred with the same brush.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act was mentioned.  This was passed in 1963 and came into effect on 1 January 1965, approximately 30 years ago.  The thrust of that Act was not evident until the mid-1970s. Planning was very liberal in the 1950s and 1960s. Even after the inception of the Act, one could obtain planning permission in Bere Island or Cape Clear, for example, which would last forever.  Subsequent regulations were introduced to limit that to seven years and now it is five.</P>
    <P>Councillors in the various local authorities are responsible for the compilation of the development plan.  I agree with what previous speakers, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said yesterday, that the compilation of the development plan takes too long.  It took ten years for Dublin when it was expected to be five.  That is a scandal and is something which should be examined whatever the outcome of the tribunal.  In our county, it took eight years instead of five.  People have an impression that something fishy is going on, but in my local authority the delays occurred because the planning officers wished to visit the various <Col N="181" /> areas of the county and canvass the opinions of groups such as An Taisce, other environmental lobby groups and councillors so as to tease out a plan acceptable to all.</P>
    <P>Although that plan is now in effect, many councillors believe it should soon be reviewed because one result of the huge economic boom, more prevalent in Dublin than in rural Ireland, is that the demand for land has completely outgrown the expectations of four or five years ago.  That applies in rural Ireland, in towns such as Skib-bereen and Bantry in west Cork, where lands for rezoning are unavailable.  In the next six to nine months we must see if other lands can be rezoned to ensure the proper development of the towns. The situation in Dublin is so severe that the amount of land available for development is inadequate to meet the demands of the housing industry.  I am unsure where it will stop.</P>
    <P>Many allegations have been made, mostly centering on the greater Dublin area.  Allegations permeate through the entire local authority system and I would be concerned that some of the allegations made through a solicitor's office outside the State can and will pose severe difficulties for this tribunal.  Will the solicitors Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly make available every document they have concerning the allegations made, whether they be against Mr. Burke or others unnamed &mdash; officials, planning officers, council members?  Will the complainants and the authors of these letters come before the tribunal to give evidence under oath about the allegations and identify the people alleged to have corrupted the system by accepting or giving bribes?  That is one of the most important facets of this tribunal.  The Minister said there will be severe difficulties discovering information if it is not volunteered by solicitors or found in letters which it is alleged exist.  I endorse that view.  Can we compel discovery? Documents exist outside the State and there would be a big international legal wrangle involved in compelling solicitors or clients to volunteer information.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will run its course, and that may be a good development.  However, I hope it gets to the root of some of the allegations.  It might, once and for all, clear the air as regards allegations concerning planning in Dublin and elsewhere, but I have reservations.  I welcome the Government's commitment expressed by Ministers Molloy and Dempsey that, if allegations are found to be true by the tribunal, speedy and effective action will be taken against those who have corrupted the system or are guilty of impropriety.</P>
    <P>If the system established by the Planning Development Act, 1963, and amended by the 1976 Act needs changing, I would welcome that. Our system is slow and cumbersome and the majority of complaints I receive in my local authority concern undue delays in processing simple, single dwelling applications.  We are told a decision is made within two months but my experience is that it takes nine or ten months.  If <Col N="182" /> the applicant does not agree with the decision they can appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  This is also a slow process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tribunal and the fact that it may kill off the allegations and innuendoes.  However, if these allegations are found to be true, then let no holds be barred in bringing these people to justice in the criminal courts or elsewhere.  As a member of a local authority I believe that our system is working reasonably well.  It is not Utopian or perfect but if changes can be introduced by legislation or other means I would welcome that. It is unfair to public representatives, whether councillors, Members of this House or Ministers, that unfounded allegations can be made under the veil of protection of another jurisdiction.  I regret this development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a discussion about the planning tribunal or what is fair or unfair.  If we were to judge our standards by what is fair and unfair we would be very busy today.  Just because life is a little unfair on politicians does not mean that we can whinge our way out of here.  This debate is about standards in democracy and high places.  More than anything else it is about trust and confidence in the system of Government and in the people who elect Members to this and the other House and to county councils.</P>
      <P>This debate concerns who is going to govern Ireland in the future.  It is a debate which shows the utter confusion of elected, public representatives about their role, how they should discharge it and, if I may say so, when they are right and wrong.  I have rarely seen such confusion as the number of people around this House in the past few weeks who do not know right from wrong because no one ever told them how to do their job.  It is about time we had a serious look at this issue and a serious sense of conviction about changing the system.</P>
      <P>As an Independent Member I see people from all parties in both Houses who are of the highest honour and integrity and who work very hard, some more competently than others.  There are no fewer incompetent politicians than incompetent journalists, teachers, lawyers or any other profession.  Politicians are no different from the rest of the community.  However, they differ in the sense of expectation they draw upon themselves and the total lack of a frame of reference on which to do their job.  We had a classic example today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I heard politicians complaining about media coverage, this afternoon I heard Members of this House talking about more media coverage.  Politicians do not know what they want.  They want to say &ldquo;give us coverage when we want it&rdquo;.  If this House does not receive coverage it is because it is not discussing topical matters or is not discussing them in an interesting or attractive way.  We are the people who need to change, not those in the media.  People will turn on the radio station which gives them the best news.  If it is a sense of public service then the <Col N="183" /> parties in this House who made sure that public service broadcasting had to deal with the private sector &mdash; I do not object to that &mdash; should have kept this in mind at that stage.  This is not a communist or Stalinist state where the Houses of the Oireachtas can demand a certain type of coverage.</P>
    <P>As an Independent politician for more than ten years I have seen things which bothered me.  I have not seen a sense of consistency.  If I am critical of parties it is only because of this lack of consistency of approach.  As one who does not put much value on consistency as a virtue, it is not for that reason that I raise this matter but because politicians do not know right from wrong.  I do not know why Deputy McDaid never became a Minister.  Was it because he walked out of court and celebrated with a member of his constituency who had been found not guilty?  It has nothing to do with being guilty or not guilty.  He was with someone who had been found not guilty and was sharing that person's joy.  In the light of our political non-standards, that made him incapable of being accepted into political life.  His party walked away from him because being in Government was more important than standing by something which was honourable.  I am not making a defence of Deputy McDaid but I could go through other cases.</P>
    <P>I do not know why former Deputy Lenihan had to pull out of Government.  Was it because he shot the breeze with a young student in a debate? Deputy Reynolds pulled out of Government because he misjudged the public mood on paedophilia and took responsibility for what officials did on his behalf.  Deputy Hogan resigned because, apparently, someone in his office gave information to the press 90 minutes before it was due to be sent out.  Deputy Coveney pulled out of Government because he continued to do in Government what he had always done in business.  No one ever told him otherwise, and even when he discovered this, he still found it difficult to understand that what he did was wrong.</P>
    <P>Mr. Burke is out of office without being tried or found guilty of anything; he is out of office on the basis of allegations which may be proven true or untrue but that is irrelevant to what has happened to him.  The real issue is that no one on either side of either House was able to say he should not resign because. or he should resign because. This applies equally to all parties and groups.  I have deliberately left out Deputy Lowry and Charlie Haughey because they are far more complicated cases.  The fact is that we have never understood what is right or wrong for a politician to do.  Are there different rights or wrongs in terms of standards for politicians than for the public?  What is guilt or innocence is irrelevant. The question is can one sustain the media's support when everyone is saying one has done wrong?</P>
    <P>It is not a question of what is fair and unfair. People should not be allowed to use those words <Col N="184" /> in this debate.  It is unfair for the woman forced by her husband to beg in O'Connell Street, it is unfair for the woman put in jail for not being able to pay for her washing machine but we did nothing about that.  We see unfair things every day.  It is sickening to see parties feed off each other in and out of Government.  It is sickening to hear people calling for heads and threatening to leave Government unless a sacrificial lamb or Minister or Deputy is provided.  It sickens me to have to listen to pious platitudes from a party in Opposition which in Government mindlessly defends the indefensible if required.  This happens because people do what they think they are supposed to do whether in Government or Opposition.  They do not know what is the correct approach.  We have managed to leave the public utterly confused, uncertain and untrusting.  The real issue is that we have lost their trust and confidence.  There is no point in blaming the media for this and it should not be allowed.  They cover what they find and if they cover something in a particular way it is because we have failed to give them our spin, to explain ourselves or because we are wrong.</P>
    <P>I do not want my comments interpreted as meaning that I am in any way better than people who are members of political parties.  I hold my colleagues who belong to political parties in the same regard as my Independent colleagues. People make brave choices.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of decades we have seen different people setting standards.  Not so long ago it was the bishops who set the standards of behaviour.  They upheld the Constitution and kept the Government in order.  They told parties what to do.  There are many examples of this &mdash; to the mother and child scheme, constitutional matters and so on.  It still happens.  However, the situation has changed and the high priests of moral standards are now in the media.  This will also change.  However, it does not matter who sets the standards because there is a lacuna in that nobody has worked out how we should be doing our job, be responsible to the public or set standards.  As public representatives we should take control of our profession.  We should look at the job we are required to do, define and set standards and enforce them.  This should be done by us.  My worry is that over the next six months some bright member of Government will try to gain public kudos by setting up an independent outside commission or ethics committee to set the standards for politicians.  Politicians must set those standards if the political system is to win the confidence of the people.  They must be seen to be courageous about setting and enforcing them.  We need to take control of the valuable and dignified profession of public representation and in doing so we need to set the standards and be prepared to root out people of all parties, and those who do not belong to any.  Having set standards and shown a willingness to implement them, we must look at the system of implementation whether it be investigatory or based on <Col N="185" /> enforcement or redress.  We must insist, as I would in the case of any member of the INTO, that the principles of natural justice are applied in the way the standards are enforced.  Ministers and politicians have as much right to the protection of rules on issues such as unfair or constructive dismissal as anybody else.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if this debate had taken place at a time other than the day after the resignation of a Government Minister because it is too close to the bone.  It is time we looked at these issues in a broad and clear manner.  It is time we set and published the standards and sold them to the media.  We should set up a cross-party or inter-House body to implement the standards and ensure the system works.</P>
    <P>Having defined and implemented standards we need to write a job description in everyday terms for Deputies, Senators, Ministers of State, Ministers and other office holders of the Houses.  The same should be done in the case of county councillors.  I recall a row in this House six years ago about whether the Cathaoirleach was acting in a party political manner outside the House.  As an Independent I found this row to be ludicrous.  I expect a person who is a member of a political party and with a loyalty to that party to act in an impartial manner in this House but I do not expect them to act according to a false and artificial set of standards outside the House when everybody knows they are committed to the philosophy of their political party.  There is nothing wrong with this so long as they do their job properly.  Similarly, I would not expect a teacher who is a member of Fianna Fáil to act as a Fianna Fáil teacher rather than a professional teacher.  People can do their job without having regard to an artificial set of standards.  We set the standards and we should deal with them.  We should give ourselves a frame of reference for proper behaviour, acceptable procedures and for protection as well as due representation.  When people see us do this they are will be more likely to have a sense of trust and confidence in public representatives.</P>
    <P>This means public representatives should not be afraid to answer questions about their salaries, expenses, allowances or any other matter relating to their job.  It is time people said we do a difficult job well and that we are not paid enough.  Those of us who do this for a living have no difficulty with such an approach and could help others with it.  I have a clear line in my dealings with people. I would not send those who cannot look after their own job or negotiate a good salary for themselves to buy fish at the pier in Dingle or buy cattle at the mart.  I certainly would not let them run the country.</P>
    <P>The debate about transparency has outlined the confusion that exists, with certain people thinking it is about being simple.  Transparency is about being open, accountable and responsible and this is what we must be.</P>
    <P>If time permitted I could continue at some length on these matters.  This is not a debate about a tribunal because when the tribunal <Col N="186" /> reports another matter will arise in the future and we will debate the issues again.  There should be a way of dealing with allegations and of processing complaints against politicians just as there is in other walks of life.  We must grasp this nettle and be prepared to establish such a process on a cross-party basis.  We need to be courageous and open.  The issue needs to be addressed.  It should not be a matter of whose head is it this week and whether it can be balanced with a head from another party when the Government changes. What is happening at present is pathetic and wrong.  This is not a judgment on former Deputy Burke or any of those I mentioned earlier.  People can be investigated and found innocent or guilty. We should set our own standards, implement them, give everybody the protection of the principles of natural justice and ensure we act with dignity and win the trust and confidence of those who elect us.  We will know we have been successful when we see young people in school aspiring towards a political career.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some comments on the establishment of this tribunal as a newly elected Senator and as an elected member of a local authority.  I have experience of working in the auctioneering end of the property business. The responsibilities of a professional, of an elected representative and of one who wishes to serve the best interests of the public are difficult. We are all imperfect and we all try to fit the job description we set out for ourselves.  In our experiences in life and in our efforts to be straight in our dealings with people in a professional capacity, there can be situations as local authority and planning issues develop where people who are disappointed feel on occasion that injustices have been done.</P>
      <P>This tribunal will be important if it achieves what it sets out to do, namely, to give a sense of clarity to the public regarding the business affairs of local authorities.  I sympathise with former Deputy Ray Burke on his retirement from the Cabinet and the Dáil.  I regret that things have turned out this way and I hope he gets over the turbulence of the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>We are setting up tribunals against a background of blood letting between the main political parties.  Where will it stop?  The public realises things are out of control.  The purpose of the tribunal is to clarify the situation in relation to the lands set out in the detailed terms of reference and to examine the receipt of money for planning applications.  I hope it satisfies the public's demands for clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to update county development plans so people are aware of the conditions involved.  There is nothing worse than adopting a county development plan only to discover that many people are not satisfied with its conditions. Some of the conditions in Mayo's county development plan were obtrusive, particularly in relation to development in coastal areas. However, they were included to protect the coastline <Col N="187" /> along the western seaboard.  A number of planning permissions were refused by An Bord Pleanála because of certain conditions and this led to third party appeals.  It is important that each county reviews its county development plan so that people are familiar with it.</P>
    <P>It is important that political parties set out a code of ethics for public representatives.  Problems arise in the planning area when substantial amounts of money are involved.  The level of payment to local authority members, who are committed to their work, is deplorable.  I know several local authority members who have difficulty maintaining their family homes, small farms or businesses.  People who are elected should be treated fairly in an age where we expect high standards so that temptation and the potential for abuse are removed.  Political parties must have a code of ethics for councillors in the same way the banks and building societies have codes of ethics to protect their workers.  This would be good for the body politic.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the tribunal which I hope will remove any uncertainty.  Irish politics is not unlike Italian politics with the number of resignations and the sad way people have been taken out of office in recent years.  The main political parties must do something to ease the national unrest.  I hope the tribunal helps to improve the situation in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the tribunal.  The media coverage and innuendo over the past three to four weeks have led to an obfuscation of the issues.  The tribunal is being set up to &ldquo;ascertain the identity of any members of the Oireachtas, past or present, and/or members of the relevant local authorities who .. received payments from any of the persons or companies referred to .. and to ascertain the identity of all public officials who considered, made recommendations or decisions on any such matters&rdquo;. The terms of reference also state &ldquo;whether any of the persons referred to .. were influenced directly or indirectly by the offer or receipt of any such payments or benefits&rdquo;.  Paragraph 5 states that if the tribunal becomes aware of any &ldquo;acts associated with the planning process committed on or after the 20th June 1985 which may in its opinion amount to corruption, .. it shall report on such acts&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference are comprehensive and are not confined to the lands mentioned in the letter from Mr. Bailey to Mr. Gogarty.  It is appropriate that Mr. Bailey's letter and the issues involved in it are investigated.  There is also a request that the inquiry be completed in &ldquo;as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest date consistent with fair examination of the matters referred to it .. and that all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the Inquiry should, so far as is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals&rdquo;. <Col N="188" />  That is appropriate given that Members of the Oireachtas who made allegations failed to properly substantiate them at past tribunals.  This cost the taxpayer a lot of money and this should be unacceptable in our democracy.</P>
    <P>For many years there has been a lot of controversy surrounding the rezoning of land in Dublin. With large amounts of money at stake, it is obvious that such controversy would arise.  Part of the reason for some rezonings &mdash; this has been acknowledged in the media &mdash; was the failure of the county council to review its development plan.  At present, a major review of the planning process is being carried out.  During discussions at Wexford County Council it was suggested that there should be an onus on local authorities to review their development plans at five yearly intervals.  Failure to comply would lead to a fine or sanction on the local authority which would provide the onus that this should happen.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the process must be transparent and fair and must be seen to be so. As Senator Doyle stated, any hint of corruption directed at local government is grossly unfair to the vast majority of councillors and others who give selflessly of their time and effort in promoting their areas.  These people approach all decisions which come before them in a conscientious and judicious manner.  I welcome the tribunal because it will provide the opportunity to deal, once and for all, with the innuendo and rumours that have abounded for many years.</P>
    <P>As other Members stated, it is important that the highest standards prevail in the discharge of public duties.  In fact, it is important that such standards prevail in all aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, they were not evident in recent weeks if we consider the manner in which Ray Burke was hounded from office.  It is a matter of some regret that Mr. Burke resigned, given that he and his father gave approximately 54 years service to the State.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to comment on the issue to be determined by the tribunal.  However, for that matter to be dealt with in the way it was, particularly at a time when Mr. Burke faced great difficulty in coping with family illness and bereavement, leads me to believe that many of those pursuing it were out of touch with the basic common human decency which permeates our society.  It is ironic that a man who served in Government after 1987, when the foundations for the economic benefits enjoyed by everyone today were laid, was hounded by those who were the architects of the profligacy of State operations and apparatus during the period 1982-87.  That is regrettable and it is worth placing on record.</P>
    <P>In the cut and thrust of politics, it is completely understandable that a person who loses office will make every effort to regain it, particularly if it is the office of Taoiseach.  However, there seemed to be a concerted effort in the case to which I referred to destroy the reputation of an individual in a way that manipulated public opinion.  I do not believe people, whether they are involved in <Col N="189" /> politics or not, should accept that as proper behaviour.</P>
    <P>Given the publicity this matter received in recent weeks, it is worth noting that, in respect of the passport issue, the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, yesterday in the Dáil stated:</P>
    <P>I was concerned to ascertain from the interim report if there was any evidence of corruption.  I want to make it clear that there was no evidence in the report of corruption or wrongdoing by anyone involved.</P>
    <P>I commend her for making that statement. However, in view of the weekend's controversy, we must ask why was it not made earlier.  That question is more pertinent when one considers that she was referring to a constituency colleague with whose personal family difficulties she would have been familiar.</P>
    <P>I wish to take issue with a number of Senator O'Toole's comments.  I agree with him that the tribunal is, to a large extent, about trust and confidence in the entire process.  Equally, I agree that it is not about whinging.  However, the Senator stated that the tribunal was not about planning and I strongly disagree with him in that regard.  I must inform Senator O'Toole that there is an innate sense of fair play in the Irish psyche.  If he were in the House he would probably acknowledge that teachers are particularly aware of that sense of fair play.  If we leave our humanity outside this House, we deserve the public odium that will befall us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tribunal and its terms of reference.  This is a sad and sorry episode from which, hopefully, some good will emerge with the vindication of the planning process and those who are charged with the responsibility to oversee it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to establish a tribunal to investigate the matters listed in the extensive terms of reference and recommendations given to it.  This matter is extremely important, given that during our first sitting we discussed the deliberations of another tribunal.</P>
      <P>Everyone acknowledges that a serious problem exists in respect of confidence in the political process.  At present, the profession of the politician is not the most admired in Ireland.  It is extremely important that we put our house in order before others intervene to make us do so.  We now have the opportunity to ensure that we put proper structures and mechanisms in place to regulate our profession.  It must be remembered that politics should be treated as a profession.  Politics is one, if not the, most important professions in this country and it is our responsibility to legislate in respect of the quality of life and the livelihood of our citizens.  For that reason, we should not react to media criticism as though we are being hounded or believe we are above suspicion.  We must ensure that we are above suspicion, by the media or anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we have a greater duty than any other profession, with, perhaps, the exception of <Col N="190" /> the church, to ensure that our standards are above reproach.  We witnessed the problems which befell the church in recent years in respect of the Fr. Brendan Smith case and other scandals when the entire nation was shocked that the standards being preached were breached by those who professed them.  It was a case of &ldquo;You do what we say but we will act differently&rdquo;.  As a result, the Catholic Church also faces a crisis of confidence and trust.  I place politics on a par with the church in this regard.  In the past, there was virtually no criticism of either profession by the media or the public in general.  However, in the 1980s and 1990s both have fallen under the spotlight in the same manner as other public bodies or private individuals.  We must expect more of the same because it will become hotter in the kitchen in the future.  As those charged with running this country and moulding the structures within which people live, politicians have a particular responsibility to show that we are not abusing the system in any way, act or form.  That is the challenge we face.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, the new tribunal is a specific mechanism designed to deal with one series of allegations and revelations rather than the holistic matter we must consider in terms of our profession and the way in which we must restore to politics the trust of those who elected us to represent them.  The terms of reference of the tribunal are the most extensive, farreaching and specific of their kind.  I congratulate the Government and the Minister on their good work in putting those terms of reference in place.  In acknowledging and taking on board a number of the recommendations made by the Opposition parties in the Lower House, the Government has improved those terms of reference.  The issue of the 726 acres of land in north County Dublin, its planning history, rezoning and tax designation, and other areas which can give rise to abuse, should be examined, as well as any material benefit which accrued to any person as a result.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 (a) deals with the identity of all recipients of payments from Mr. Gogarty or Mr. Bailey since 1985.  Such provisions are important. Paragraph 5 allows for the tribunal to go further and examine any acts associated with the planning process committed since 1985.  This important paragraph leaves scope for further examination beyond a specific allegation and gives the tribunal a greater degree of flexibility if it uncovers matters needing investigation.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 provides for a concise tripartite timescale for the reports &mdash; preliminary, interim and final reports.  The preliminary report will immediately discover whether matters need a full investigation, the interim report will be published within a month and the final report is expected in an &ldquo;economical&rdquo; fashion before 31 December. Having read the McCracken report I recommend this report should not consist of more than 100 pages.  I have also tried to plough through an earlier tribunal report; brevity is a virtue in matters of this nature.  Much will also depend on the <Col N="191" /> strength of the recommendations and the clarity of the report.  All these are important matters and I refer to them because this tribunal may be a model for the future.  It is important to get it right this time around because the tribunal is an effective mechanism for investigating these matters.</P>
    <P>I regret the former Minister of Foreign Affairs' resignation from his portfolio and his Dáil seat. The Labour Party never requested either.  We said that in terms of the delicacy of the Foreign Affairs brief, and particularly in the context of the important peace talks, he should have stepped aside and the Taoiseach should have passed the brief to another Minister.  The former Deputy Burke could have operated another portfolio.  It was not a question of trying the man before the hearing took place, but ensuring he did not maintain such a delicate portfolio.  Resignation was a different matter and I regret the former Deputy's departure from the other House.  I applaud his statement that he will co-operate fully with the tribunal.  He will have the opportunity to clear his name which has been sullied by allegations and revelations.  Hopefully he will return to the Dáil if that is the case.</P>
    <P>What do we do about the crisis of confidence in politics?  We have endeavoured to deal with it in the past number of years.  The Government which fell in 1992 did not go out in a blaze of glory but amid the deba cle of the Goodman affair and the beef tribunal.  Over a four and a half year period, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party between them produced two sets of manifestos.  A large body of legislation had to be introduced to put trust back into politics.  Now two new tribunals have been established and allegations of corruption have overtaken us.  Some good procedures have been implemented and hopefully these will help to regulate the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act, 1997, provided the public with access to information on public bodies and Departments.  The Electoral Act, 1997, relates to the disclosure of donations by political parties, payments to political parties and candidates and the regulation of electoral expenditure.  The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, provides for the disclosure of Members' interests.  On 30 October the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality will allow further access to Cabinet discussions.  These measures, and the tribunal, will provide a regulatory structure to allow the political system to operate and deal with allegations of abuse.</P>
    <P>It is important we have a specific mechanism to pursue an allegation when it arises and a permanent structure is available without us going into a tizzy every time there is an allegation of abuse or corruption relating to a Member.  There should be sufficient regulatory legislation to deal with disclosures, donations and any other matters which constitute a breach of trust.</P>

      <Col N="192" /> I was worried by the Taoiseach's reference to the &ldquo;misdemeanours&rdquo; of his predecessor, Mr. Haughey, who held the position of Taoiseach on three occasions.  What Mr. Haughey did could not be legally or popularly termed as a &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo;.  I have heard the Taoiseach use this term on three occasions.  I hope he recognises that the term &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo; is much less offensive than the nature of the allegations which surfaced in the McCracken tribunal.</P>
    <P>I support this motion and welcome its provisions.  The Labour Senators will support it.</P>

      <P>I was a member of Dublin County Council and I wish to address Senator O'Donovan's point about the ten year period for the adoption of a plan.  The council had 78 members and received in excess of 290,000 representations from the public.  Each member was allowed to speak for three minutes under the standing orders.  Such arrangements in that forum gave great cause for frustration and annoyance.  The knock-on effect was apparent in the county manager's report on the final adoption of the plan with a number of what would appear to have been rushed motions at the end.  I do not think that a process which took ten years can be considered to have been rushed.</P>
      <P>With regard to not voting with the manager, I defend the right of councillors to consider that, like them, the manager is not always right.  The decisions made by management in the late 1960s and early 1970s ruined the villages of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.  In most cases the people who decided the fate of native Dubliners had not lived in these areas nor ever lived with the consequences of the social ills caused.  I refer in particular to places where there are 5,000 local authority houses in one area the inhabitants of which have not come from a cohesive background.</P>
      <P>Dublin has a burgeoning population.  I have heard it suggested that Dubliners should be housed in Kinnegad.  With no disrespect to County Westmeath it is a case of &ldquo;to hell or to Kinnegad&rdquo; and constitutes a silly proposition from a traffic perspective alone.  To expect people from Dublin to relocate from their native areas without their families and social supports to please the anti-rezoning lobby is as unjust as unjust rezoning.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Doyle's proposal for a regional authority approach but that may be difficult to achieve as each local authority treasures its independence.  However, with a large proportion of the population living within a 20 mile radius of Dublin a joint approach to solving the needs of people employed in the area must be found.  We cannot close the shutters on Dublin and exclude people when they have employment there.  Some of the solutions being proposed are unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In areas such as Dublin councillors are damned if they rezone and damned if they do not.  Councillors experienced persistent lobbying from the <Col N="193" /> construction industry to rezone land.  We were blamed for the high cost of ordinary houses to first time buyers.  A three bedroomed semidetached house on the fringes of Dublin can cost up to £95,000.  There have been queues of young couples to buy houses at that price.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that if I found an oil well in my garden I would be entitled to benefit from such a find.  I have always held the view that when land value is enhanced by the direct action of an outside agency &mdash; a local authority in this case &mdash; it is not unconstitutional that a proportion of the wealth gained by such an action should go to the agency which is the cause of the enhanced land value.  I see nothing unconstitutional in that because it has not happened as the result of an act of God or nature, rather it is the direct act of a council.  What are the councils to do?  Are they to cease rezoning because of allegations and innuendo? I would welcome any commission that would come down on the side of reality and take on board the fact that we have a growing population, two-thirds of which is in the greater Dublin area.  I support proposals which will obviate the need for any future tribunals, such as that proposed by this motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to the House.  An element of the recent events which caused Mr. Ray Burke great distress and about which he spoke at length in his statement of 10 September to the Dáil, may not be dealt with by the tribunal.  Perhaps the Minister of State would clarify the matter.</P>
      <P>When Mr. Burke spoke in the Dáil it was obvious that one of the greatest causes of distress to him and to his family was the insinuation made that his father, the late Paddy Burke, who was a psychiatric nurse in St. Ita's Hospital had somehow used his position there with regard to the sale of land belonging to a patient there, Mr. Joseph Coleman, and on which Mr. Burke's house &ldquo;Briargate&rdquo; was built.  Mr. Burke as reported at columns 636 and 637 of the Official Report of the Dáil of 10 September 1997:</P>
      <P>I was amazed at some of the appalling things that were being said about me and my father.  I appeal to Members to bear with me so that I can clarify a matter that deserves clarification. My father was a Member of the House from 1944 until 1973.  He served the House loyally for 29 years.  I still meet people all over the country who admired, respected and had great affection for him.  He served in this House with many current Members or their fathers.  In Cork last Sunday, at the Liam Lynch memorial, I met many people who spoke kindly of him. On 18 February 1996 <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> featured an article about me, written by Mr. Frank Connolly in his usual complimentary terms.  I mention this article because I was asked why I did not go back to the media.  Mr. Connolly wrote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> The land on which his house is built was originally purchased by Burke's father Paddy, who bought it from an inmate of the mental hospital in Portrane, Co.  Dublin.</P>
    <P>My father worked as a nurse in the hospital in Portrane until the mid-1950s.  He had come from a humble background in the west of Ireland &mdash; I am proud of his background as I am proud of mine.  The assertion in that article was a complete and utter lie.  I did not take an action against the newspaper because I have never taken one since I entered this House despite the things they have said about me.  I have with me the Land Registry documentation relating to my home which clearly shows that, far from being bought from a hospital patient under his care, the house and site was transferred to me and I bought it in a normal commercial transaction from Oakpark Developments Limited.  The house was built in the normal commercial manner.  I was doing business with that company.  That transaction, along with others, was the subject of a Garda investigation in 1974.  I did not so much resent the attacks on myself &mdash; in this business one learns to live with them although they do not get easier.  However, I am glad to have the opportunity on behalf of my family and my father, who died in 1985, to clarify the record in that regard.</P>
    <P>Despite this there was a further article in <i>The Sunday Post</i> on 29 September 1997, which stated:</P>
    <P>In 1974, [Joseph] Coleman was a long term patient in the mental hospital at Portrane, where Burke's father Paddy worked for many years.  Coleman died some years ago in St. Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital.</P>
    <P>Coleman is described as a ward of court in the land registry documents which refer to him as full owner of the lands at Malahide and Swords.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All dealings with the property are inhibited except with the consent of the general solicitor for the wards of court,&rdquo; the document states.</P>
    <P>I hope Mr. Burke, who says he wants to co-operate fully with this tribunal, will be in a position to scotch the further innuendo being made against his father's name.  This is very important.  The fact that Mr. Coleman was a ward of court may, in fact, be coincidental.  There are patients within psychiatric hospitals who have the mental capacity to undertake commercial transactions. Mr. Coleman may have been such a patient. Indeed, transfer of ownership may take place in a situation such as this where a solicitor may be brought in by a member of the family and the transfer of ownership can be addressed, perhaps within a ward setting.  Psychiatric nurses, in particular, are very conscious of the additional care they must take to ensure extra pressure is not put on patients in such a situation.  It is most important for the Burke family that this tribunal <Col N="195" /> allows clarification of the matter which is obviously causing considerable distress to the family and I can understand why.  If the Office of the Wards of Court were involved in the transaction, and suppose the person did not have the mental capacity to undertake a transaction, there should be a file somewhere and it should be possible to look up the case.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this be clarified, not just for the Burke family, but because it is important for those who look after mentally incapacitated patients.  It is very serious to make allegations against someone that they used their professional position to influence something for their own personal gain.  I would be glad if the Minister could tell me if Mr. Burke will be allowed clarify this matter in the tribunal, because what he said in the Dáil does not appear to be accepted by some members of the media.</P>

      <P>I welcome the new inquiry which is very important.  The people of Ireland are deeply concerned about the quality and integrity of the planning process.  As someone who has been a councillor for in excess of 20 years, I have great respect for all the people involved in the planning process, in particular, the officials and elected representatives who give of their time to work for the public.  The public have their tribunal of judgment on public representatives when they vote during election time.  However, there are issues which need to be examined by this tribunal. One matter that could be improved within the planning process would be total transparency in terms of meetings and representations made by either applicants for planning permission, members of the public or public representatives. I feel that when one goes into a local authority to examine a planning file, some information is not on the file.  We ought to insist that if there is a meeting between a planning official such as a county manager and a builder, for example, a note be taken at the meeting and that the date and content of the discussion be recorded in the public file.  This would lead to much greater credibility within the system.  At the moment it is the decision that is recorded and any letters are put on the file.  This would be a welcome change and would lead to greater transparency and an understanding of how decisions are reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems occur in places such as Drogheda. This is a growing town and there is a lot of land on the outskirts of town which is zoned for agricultural purposes.  Obviously the push for development will have to lead to the rezoning of significant portions of agricultural land in many <Col N="196" /> east coast towns.  The way in which this is dealt with is very important.  I take Senator Ridge's point, which is a very important one, that is, it is a misunderstanding to say that if one is for rezoning there is something wrong.  Rezoning is essential in areas where there is fast growth and expansion. Development plans are reviewed every five or six years.  Perhaps the time and manner in which they are reviewed ought to be changed.  We need a cast iron procedure for rezoning.  This might involve the referral of the decision to a third party who would not be an official of a local authority.  I do not necessarily think An Bord Pleanála is the best body to do this.</P>
    <P>While I know there is tremendous integrity and commitment within An Bord Pleanála, nevertheless, its decisions on rezoning and so on have shocked me at times and I know they have shocked my fellow councillors.  We need to make it clear to the public that if rezoning takes place, it is because it is essential and necessary.  That is what must be done in Drogheda.</P>
    <P>Like the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I have been a councillor for many years and I know hundreds of councillors.  I know they are hardworking, committed and dedicated to public service.  We are all diminished by these allegations, and it is essential that the tribunal discovers all the facts.  I know from personal experience that the majority of councillors are totally dedicated and are true and proper servants of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this inquiry and trust that it will deal satisfactorily with the matter referred to it.  There has been so much adverse criticism regarding all of the matters involved that this course is imperative for the good of our democracy and the body politic.  There is an obvious need to deal comprehensively and expeditiously with all of the various allegations. It would perhaps have been preferable, not least from a cost point of view, to have these matters dealt with by the Moriarty tribunal.  The Taoiseach, however, had very firmly set his face against proceeding in such a manner for his own reasons.  I believe this to have been a bad mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main item to be inquired into relates to the 726 acres referred to in the much publicised letter of 8 June 1989 from Mr. Michael Bailey to Mr. James Gogarty.  This is undoubtedly a startling letter in which the writer proposes being granted a 50 per cent share in ownership of the lands in exchange for procuring planning permission and building by-law approval.  He sets out the severe uphill battle that would be involved in this procurement, that it would be time consuming and expensive.  He explained that material contravention orders would have to be obtained involving a majority vote at two full council meetings of the 78 members.  He further points out that the applications would be highly sensitive and controversial and that it would be essential that any applications should be in the name of an active housebuilding company enjoying good <Col N="197" /> standing and a good working relationship with the planners and council members.</P>
    <P>This sounds disturbing and is obviously deserving of investigation.  It is equally important that the tribunal has the powers conferred by virtue of section 5 of its terms should it become aware of any acts associated with the planning process committed on or after 20 June 1985, which may in its opinion amount to corruption or which involves attempts to influence by threats or deception, or otherwise, to compromise the disinterested performance of public duties.  It shall report on such acts and should, in particular, make recommendations as to the effectiveness and improvement of existing legislation governing corruption in the light of its inquiries.</P>
    <P>There is a belief abroad that a Garda investigation into alleged corruption in the planning process floundered for two reasons &mdash; the failure to guarantee immunity to those making allegations of corruption and because no legislation has been enacted in this area since the foundation of the State.  All that were available to the Garda were the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1906, which is totally outmoded and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1916, which dealt specifically with bribery in relation to public contracts and were of no assistance.  There is an obvious glaring need for updated legislation in this area.  It is proper also that the tribunal is given authority to obtain all relevant documents, files and papers from Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly, Solicitors, so that the 52 allegations made to them may be examined.  They have stated that many seem <i>prima facie</i> to give cause for concern and apparently three were made by former county councillors.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach had been most anxious to include the Newry solicitors' material within the terms of reference, and properly so.  However, he steadfastly refused to permit the Moriarty tribunal to investigate the notorious Ansbacher accounts.  This is amazing.  In the view of the McCracken tribunal, these accounts are dubious offshore accounts and it is extremely disturbing that the Taoiseach has chosen not to allow an investigation of them.  An image has been projected of the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern as Mr. Clean &mdash; someone determined to ensure there is no corruption in public life, an able politician whose judgment is sound and a steady hand on the tiller.</P>
    <P>Whatever commitment the Taoiseach may have had to political transparency and the maintenance of the highest ethical standards in public life, I am afraid it has been severely dented in recent times by his dithering, reluctance and vacillation.  My namesake's opening paragraph in last Saturday's <i>Irish Times</i> comes to mind where he wrote &ldquo;Caution and cunning are important qualities of political leadership and the Taoiseach is well endowed in both departments.  But he has failed to prove himself in terms of courage, standards and vision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> Maybe the Taoiseach does not have such a safe pair of hands after all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the comments of an earlier speaker pertaining to the actions of a patient who was a ward of court.  As somebody who has worked in the psychiatric profession for 30 years I find it amazing since people who are wards of courts in psychiatric hospitals are not empowered to sign any documents which would devolve property to a third party.  As their property, estate or affairs are administered by a committee set up by the High Court I find that a little strange.</P>
      <P>On the concept of planning and rezoning there is a view abroad that if there is rezoning by a local authority there is some obscure reason for it.  As a member of a local authority for 18 years most of the rezonings in my local authority, and indeed in others, are on recommendations from management and 99.5 per cent of them have a great deal of merit.  Members and managers are not always right nor are they always wrong.  The present system, for all its pitfalls, works well.</P>
      <P>I refer to Senator Ridge's comment about people from Dublin having to live in Kinnegad; I can assure her they would be most welcome there.  Westmeath has an all-embracing community and the Government should address the issue of decentralisation.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to the Catholic Church.  What he said is partly correct but I wish to put on record my appreciation of all the priests and religious persons about whom we hear so little.  It is right to condemn out of hand those people, irrespective of whether they wear clerical cloth, but for those who are the rule and not the exception this House should be grateful to them for the great service they render to our community.</P>
      <P>I welcome the tribunal.  I should have said at the outset that I welcome the Minister to the House.  I hope that, in the fullness of time, society will appreciate the convenient amnesia that Deputy Nora Owen suffered when she timed her comments to coincide with the resignation from office of former Deputy Burke.  It is pathetic that the former Minister did not see fit to inform the House of the facts.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful for Senators' contributions to this debate.  We have shown our concern about the integrity of the planning system and our wider political institutions must be vindicated.  This has been a useful opportunity for us to air our views.  I thank Senators for the objective debate.  The well being of a planning system is not a party political issue. Professor Bannon of the planning school in UCD, in a letter published in today's <i>Irish Times,</i> made a very valid point that the tribunal is being set up to investigate abuse in the planning system, and he is right.  It is not being set up to inquire into bad planning decisions.  Many of us disagreed with various planning decisions but that is not to say that we thought corruption was involved in arriving at that decision.  The terms of reference of the tribunal to investigate the planning system &mdash; and where there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of corruption &mdash; the allegations, innuendo and rumours which have beset the planning system over recent years, have scant regard to the good names and reputations of those who serve in public authorities whether as elected members or officers and particularly those involved in decision making.  If people are guilty of impropriety that will be established by the tribunal and they must face the consequences of their actions.  If, on the other hand, people who have been fingered are proven innocent then it is more important that their good names are vindicated.</P>
      <P>I am confident the tribunal will be good for the planning system, that it will result in committed and enthusiastic people continuing to participate in local government as elected members or as people working in the system.  The tribunal will help by dispelling the cynicism that frequently affects planning and will point out lessons that can be learned and where legislation can be strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment contained in the Programme for Government to improve the operation of the planning system will yield positive results.  In accordance with the programme agreed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, the Government is committed to carrying out a complete review of planning laws including the manner in which they relate to local authority development.  It is committed to increasing public participation in the planning process, introducing seven year development plans &mdash; a time limit which must be adhered to, providing more qualified planners at local authority level, introducing <Col N="200" /> similar provisions to those contained in the Ethics in Public Office Act in relation to local authorities and introducing conservation legislation to protect and enhance our built environment.</P>
    <P>The review of the planning system is well underway and Members of the House will be glad to know that the drafting of a Bill to improve the protection of our architectural heritage is at an advanced stage.  Submissions have been invited from the general public, specifically from groups or organisations which have a special interest in planning, in relation to the planning review. Clearly many Members of the Seanad have views on our planning system and I invite them to make submissions which could be taken on board from an early stage in the review process.  Any recommendations made by the tribunal will also be given careful consideration by the Government as part of the review.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment in both Houses on the tribunal's ability to inquire into other allegations of wrongdoing in the planning system which are unrelated to the issues raised in the Bailey letter.  I assure the House that paragraph 5 will allow the tribunal to deal with all allegations of corruption or other wrongdoing within the planning system.  However, we must be realistic as regards the tribunal's remit; it must satisfy itself that there is some <i>prima facie</i> case to be made in relation to any other matters which may brought before it.  There is no doubt that a certain number of people will expect the tribunal to inquire into decisions with which they disagreed.  There may be a number of trivial or vexatious matters brought to the attention of the tribunal.  It is not intended that the tribunal waste its time dealing with such matters.  However, where the tribunal comes across any act associated with the planning process which, in its opinion, amounts to corruption or other wrongdoing it will be obliged to investigate those matters completely and make recommendations in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Many Senators called for the inclusion of a number of specific planning controversies in the terms of reference.  The Government is satisfied that the terms of reference are adequate to deal with any allegations of wrongdoing associated with the planning system.  Furthermore, there would be a danger that the inclusion of significant numbers of specific planning controversies would not only delay the workings of the tribunal but would hinder its ability to deal with the particular instances of alleged corruption brought to its attention.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised the issue of co-ordinating neighbouring development plans and suggested that if all development plans were adopted at the same time, many of the difficulties regarding zoning could be overcome.  The Government believes there is a need to have an overall view of development plans which cover the same region and is committed to introducing strategic planning guidelines &mdash; initially in the greater Dublin area &mdash; whereby all local authorities within the <Col N="201" /> region must have regard to an overall planning framework for it.  The guidelines for the Dublin area are to be drawn up by consultants and are due to commence early next year in consultation with the local and regional authorities in the Dublin and mid-east regions.  These guidelines are intended to lay down a 12 year broad planning strategy within which all subsequent development plans will be reviewed.  This is a more realistic approach to the co-ordination of development plans than requiring all local authorities to review their development plans at the same time.  That could be a difficult and bureaucratic exercise which might not bring the necessary benefits which overall strategic guidelines will bring to the development plan review process.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle queried the need for a new tribunal when another tribunal, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Moriarty, had recently been set up and suggested that the issue we are now dealing with could be brought within its remit.  While I agree that tribunals should not be set up lightly and duplication of effort should be avoided, there are a number of compelling reasons a separate inquiry is necessary in this instance.  First, the Moriarty tribunal follows on very specifically from an earlier tribunal and is concerned solely with the affairs of persons found guilty of wrongdoing by it.  To include Mr. Burke or anybody else named in the present context in that tribunal's remit would, whatever about legal niceties, be bound to imply some degree of guilt by association in the public mind.  It would be grossly unfair to the persons involved and would reflect badly on the fair-mindedness of Members of this House.  It is now beyond doubt that the acknowledged political donation made to Mr. Burke will be considered by the proposed tribunal.  There are also other reasons a separate tribunal is needed.  There are other allegations in circulation in regard to other planning matters and if it were to be shown that these merited investigation, the Moriarty tribunal would not be able to follow up that trail.  Controversy over planning decisions is an entirely separate issue which is important in its own right; that deserves a close focus and should not be subsumed into a more general inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty tribunal already has the task of looking into matters of considerable detail and complexity and may not be in a position to give the questions we are discussing the degree of urgent attention which is necessary if we are to clear these up within the shortest possible time &mdash; an aim that is clearly reflected in the terms of reference before the House.  The terms of reference make provision for the tribunal to seek relevant documents from Mr. Bailey, Mr. Gogarty and the solicitors' firm, Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly.  Senators referred to the fact that the firm Donnelly, Neary and Donnelly is based beyond the jurisdiction of the State and that, for this reason, the importance of the powers of discovery in the terms of reference may give rise to legal complexities.  The Government has gone as <Col N="202" /> far as is legally within its power in this respect; in any event it would be astonishing, given the background to this case, if it became necessary for the tribunal to exercise those powers.  The truth of the matter is that it is now time for that firm of solicitors and their unnamed clients to put up or shut up.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about the need to have a clear set of standards which would be generally accepted and would set out criteria by which all politicians would be judged.  As the Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions, and as recently as this afternoon in the Dáil, the Government proposes to set up a permanent ethics commission. That will go a long way to meeting the points raised by Senator O'Toole and others in relation to having a body in existence to which matters of concern to the public could be referred for examination as they arose.  That would be preferable to the current situation where something has been allowed to simmer and has been fed to newspapers thereby raising doubts in the public mind; the State eventually had to take measures to prove or disprove things said in the media.  In many cases very little specific or <i>prima facie</i> evidence existed to substantiate some of the allegations made in spite of the fact that people's names were being associated with wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge spoke about the need for the State to recoup part of the gains made through the tax system.  I am surprised the Senator is not aware that this facility already exists.  This argument was made many years ago and resulted in the introduction of the capital gains tax.  It may be that some developers have an incentive to acquire green field property and subsequently lobby for the land to be rezoned for commercial or residential development.  The gains from rezoning can, as has been shown, be very substantial.  That has led to the belief that developers have been tempted to interfere with the zoning process.  There have been suggestions that such windfall gains should be severely taxed.  The sale of development land is subject to capital gains tax at 40 per cent and it should be noted that the provisions regarding roll-over relief do not apply to the sale of development land.  The introduction of increased capital gains or local authority charges on development land could, in itself, bring problems. A penal tax regime for development land could lead to a restriction in the supply of land if landowners deferred disposals until the tax position became more favourable.  Increased taxation of development land could push house prices up even further and the cost of providing premises for industry and business could also rise.</P>
    <P>Under section 26, contributions to the development levies can be, and are, imposed by local authorities on the planning system.  This allows local authorities to attach conditions to planning permissions requiring a contribution towards the costs of works carried out by the local authority or proposed works facilitating development.  Contribution conditions, like all other conditions <Col N="203" /> attached to a planning permission, can of course be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  These contributions are used to provide infrastructural services, including roads, water and parks.  In 1995 the amount received in planning contributions by all planning authorities was estimated at over £22 million &mdash; up from £10.5 million in 1990.  The whole issue of how development contributions are levied and used is one of the areas being focused upon in the review of the planning process.</P>
    <P>While most schemes for the provision of water and sewerage services attract 100 per cent capital grants from the Department, it has been made quite clear that the Department will not consider funding for schemes for the servicing of land zoned in excess of the objective needs of a local authority.  Therefore, should a local authority wish to see such areas serviced, it will have to be financed from a local authority's own resources or by contributions attached to a planning permission.  That is something that will be more vigorously enforced.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Senator Henry is not really relevant to this inquiry.  She raised questions about wards of court arising from former Deputy Burke's contribution in the Dáil some weeks ago. This is not a planning issue and is not really a matter for this tribunal.</P>
    <P>Some Senators argued that action should have been taken on this matter before now and that it should have been referred to the Moriarty tribunal but I have explained why that would not have been practical.  The Senators said that a tribunal of some kind should have inquired into it before now arising out of the statement in the Dáil by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, with regard to a £30,000 contribution.  There seems to be a concerted effort on the part of the Fine Gael Party to turn the spotlight away from its own role in this matter and to undermine the stability of the Government and the authority of the Taoiseach by questioning his decision-making capacity and leadership qualities.  I do not think such an effort will succeed because it is an out and out political ploy on the part of the Fine Gael Party, in particular.</P>
    <P>It was only when the Bailey letter came into the public arena that it was clear there was an inevitable need for an inquiry into the matters referred to earlier by former Deputy Burke.  That evidence was certainly not available to any member of my party nor, as far as I know, to any member of the other Government party.  When the implications of that letter became known, people made a clear association because of the timing of the meetings and the handing over of money.  The terms in which that gentleman wrote that letter were quite extraordinary and, from that point forward, it was inevitable there would have to be a full inquiry into the whole matter.  However, the implication that some action should have been taken before the Bailey letter came into the public arena is being made purely from a political motivation.  It will not <Col N="204" /> succeed in achieving its objective of undermining the Government in any way.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record the position as regards officials and other persons operating in the system with regard to the legislation on corruption with which they have to comply.  The Corruption Acts of 1889 to 1916, and the Ethics Act, 1996, apply to elected Members and officials of local authorities in carrying out their duties.  The provisions of these Acts were significantly reformed and the penalties under them increased by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.  The new penalties for corruption on summary conviction under the Acts are a fine of up to £1,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months and, on conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding £50,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years.</P>
    <P>At the international level there have been important developments in the fight against corruption with a European Union convention on corruption involving public officials, which was signed earlier this year.  There have also been two additional conventions on corruption, one in the Council of Europe and the other in the OECD, which are currently under negotiation.  Arising out of Ireland's participation in the negotiation of these international instruments, our law on corruption is under review.</P>
    <P>Earlier in my speech I mentioned that the Dublin county development plan had not been reviewed within the statutory period of five years. This was confirmed by Senators from the Dublin area.  This has led to many of the difficulties and pressures that have arisen in Dublin.  Because of population growth and the lack of suitable development land zoned in the county's development plans, there was pressure for rezoning outside the normal review of the development plans. I am concerned that such a long delay should have taken place.  Senators mentioned the number of representations made at the time of the review.  It was extraordinary.  It involved a mammoth task and provides some justification for the delay that occurred.  The review was ongoing for a period of three years.</P>
    <P>The five year period is too short and it is now proposed to extend it to seven years.  However, it is necessary for the Department to ensure that local authority officials comply with the requirements of whatever legislation exists.  Recognising the difficulties that existed in Dublin at the time, but also accepting that there has been a change since with the establishment of new local authorities in the Dublin area, there should now be a much greater capacity within those local authorities.</P>
    <P>In future, persons who deal with planning matters arising during the course of their consideration of a review of a development plan, will relate more to the area in which they live and for which they are elected than previously when when there was one huge authority for a very big area.  At that time, councillors from areas far removed from the area under discussion were <Col N="205" /> involved in the decision making and that removed the decision making process a bit too far from local communities.</P>
    <P>The change in the Dublin authorities structure will be helpful in ensuring that reviews can take place more regularly in future.  That is not to say there will not be delays, but everything possible must be done at official level to ensure that development plans are reviewed within the statutory term.</P>
    <P>The results of a recent check by the Department on all 123 planning authorities may be of interest to Senators.  The check revealed that 63 per cent of authorities reviewed their development plan in less than five years, 12 per cent in less than six years, 9 per cent in less than seven years and 16 per cent exceeded seven years.  So, the situation is not very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I hope the review of the planning process and the recommendations which, hopefully, emerge from this tribunal, will result in major improvements being undertaken in all these matters so that we can restore the community's full confidence in the planning process.  I appeal to anyone who feels they have matters of serious concern, and evidence to substantiate their claims, to come forward and have their complaints aired at the tribunal when it is formally established.  If they do so, they will be performing an important public service and will restore people's confidence in the planning process in a major way.</P>
    <P>In fairness, all those outstanding officials who work under great pressure in planning offices around the country and in An Bord Pleanála are entitled to have their work recognised and appreciated.  No clouds should be cast on their integrity when they are performing their duties in the best interests of the State and in the most honest and professional way they can.  We owe that to all those people.  If there are some rotten apples in the barrel, then hopefully this tribunal will expose them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to open up the live export trade for cattle as promised by its spokesperson in opposition and as part of its election manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I beg indulgence as this is the first time I have spoken in the House.  I welcome Minister of State Davern to the House as a constituency colleague. I am delighted he is here as I move my first motion as spokesman on agriculture.  I want this debate to be constructive and useful.  I hope the Minister will take on board the points I have to make. <Col N="206" /></P>
    <P>Agriculture is the backbone of the economy and, despite the dwindling number of farmers will continue to be into the next millennium.  There are approximately 140,000 people dependent on the land for a living, and thousands more working in related industries.  I am sorry to say that Minister Walsh has taken very little interest in the Egyptian market, our single greatest market for live cattle.  Deputy Yates had got an agreement in principle to reopen the Egyptian market, but Minister Walsh has completely failed to follow up and finalise the deal.  What happened then?  The Egyptians demanded £5 million from Ireland to build an abattoir to remove specified risk material when slaughtering Irish cattle.  When the Opposition and the farm organisations raised a number of issues about the failure to open the live export trade, Minister Walsh belatedly took steps to do something about it.  The Egyptians only agreed to take a trial load of Irish cattle. Furthermore I understand the planned shipment of 2,000 cattle is unlikely to go ahead.  This is just another example of PR tactics.  Farmers should not be deceived by such antics.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government stands condemned for its failure to date to reopen the vital outlets for live cattle to third countries and European markets.  The live shipping trade is crucial to the survival of many thousands of farmers.  As a store cattle producer myself, nobody knows better how crucial this sector of farming is to Irish farmers. Many farmers do not have the option of wintering cattle and depend on the autumn sales for the major part of their income.  This year that appears to be in tatters with the current price of roughly 83 pence being paid by factories in most of the country.  There is a complete contrast between the very easy going approach of Deputy Walsh as Minister for Agriculture and Food and his approach when in Opposition, where his statements could easily have been described as bullish. The delay is costing farmers and the economy money.  The autumn disposal of cattle needs all market outlets to be operational.  The lack of competition is leading to a slow drop in the price of cattle.  We are an exporting economy and 80 per cent of agricultural output must find a market outside of Ireland.  It is unacceptable live exports to fellow member states of the EU are not taking place.  Furthermore the risk of overrunning our premier quota for ten and 22 months cattle underlines the urgency of supplying high Irish price EU markets with live cattle, particularly in the weaning trade which is so vital to many of our smaller farmers at this time of the year . There is always weak buying when there is lack of competition.  Most people will agree with that.  The Egyptian market for Irish cattle is vital for the trade at the moment.  However, the failure by Minister Walsh to speedily conclude arrangements for live exports to Egypt is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on a high profile visit to Cairo, accompanied by the Department secretary and the Chief Veterinary Officer.  This exercise failed to open the market and was clearly undertaken <Col N="207" /> for the optics.  If the Egyptian market alone were open we could export 100,000 live cattle that could be sold between now and the end of the year.  There are 700,000 cattle to be disposed of between now and December 31.  The only market is the meal factory.</P>
    <P>Through tough negotiation, Deputy Yates secured £75 million for Irish livestock farmers to cushion the blow of 1996.  What is Minister Walsh doing to cushion the blow of this year's price disaster? I would like to know, indeed demand, that Minister Walsh, or Minister of State Davern on his behalf, commits himself in this House by getting at least £80 million from the EU for the coming year on top of the existing subsidies to compensate for the price disaster that exists, especially in view of the failure to open up the live cattle trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the £50 per head?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish farmers are unique in Europe at present, and for the wrong reasons. Cattle farmers are getting 12 to 15 pence per pound less for their finished cattle than our EU partners.  So much for the single market.  The need to secure changes in intervention buying and the reversal of export refund cuts must be given immediate and serious attention by the Minister, otherwise we will continue to have disastrous cattle prices.</P>
      <P>In an autumn where cattle farmers are suffering a severe drop in income there has also been a serious income crisis on our tillage farms.  Very low grain yield and a very poor harvest will put many under pressure in meeting loan repayments and tax bills.  There is a need for banks to look at each case sympathetically and to take the longer term rather than the short term view.  Similarly the Revenue Commissioners must be alerted to the real situation and difficulties on our farms, and the data collected by Teagasc on the tillage losses, which the Minister for Agriculture and Food requested, should be made available to back up the bona fides of those farmers.  At the Ploughing Championship last week the Minister of State gave a commitment that the area aid payment would be made by the middle of this month. It is important that it is made speedily and that it is not held up.  I welcome this payment and compliment the Minister on it.</P>
      <P>The other day I spoke to a tillage farmer from Cashel, County Tipperary, which Minister Davern knows well.  He had 55 acres of corn.  He bought all his fertilisers, grain and sprays from the local co-operative and, though he had a reasonably good harvest, his total cheque less deductions amounted to £1,800.  How could anybody live on that?  This underlines the importance of issuing area aid payments and I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good government is about leadership and this autumn we need to see some of this from the Minister, Deputy Walsh.  There are great signals of growth from other sectors of the economy.  The <Col N="208" /> low level of Exchequer borrowing together with employment growth are attributable to the prudent management of the economy by this and previous Governments.  Agriculture must be the target of Government initiatives to reinstil confidence.</P>
    <P>Installation aid for younger farmers is a classic example of this, but for Fianna Fáil to promise to retain young farmers' installation aid while in Opposition and to abolish it less than three months in office is not the way to go.  Everybody would agree that if one gives young people responsibility, they will respond.  No hurdles should be put in the way of encouraging people to stay on the farm and installation aid is one way of helping young farmers.</P>
    <P>A sum of £17 million is due to farmers because of currency devaluations.  There are many other issues I could raise, but I will to finish by asking the Minister the following questions.  When will the Egyptian trade reopen?  What will be done for the hard pressed tillage farmers both at EU and national levels?  What about installation aid?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and wish him well in his new portfolio.  The problems mentioned by Senator Hayes differ considerably from those I encounter in the west. As the Minister will be aware, we have a small farming hinterland and the live export trade is essential for small farmers, especially at this time of the year.  They rely specifically on it to pay their bills, to pay for manure and to pay their cooperatives.  This is a catastrophe especially for the farmers of the west.  I exhort the Government and the Minister to do everything in their power to get the live export market reopened.  Farmers on the western seaboard, most importantly, and elsewhere are depending on it.</P>
      <P>At present there are roughly 1,000 people per year leaving County Mayo and most of them are small farmers.  If that drain continues, County Mayo, the west and the farm sector in general will be so depleted that there will be no way back.  It is incumbent on everyone to try to restore this trade.  If it cannot be restored in the short term, compensatory measures should be introduced to help alleviate the problem.</P>
      <P>Some Senators may never have heard of Erris, County Mayo, but it is a remote, scenic region of considerable size.  A natural disaster in August resulted in severe flooding.  The farmers of the area have been exhorting the Government and the different Departments for immediate assistance.  I introduce that as an aside to this motion because it is important that they receive compensation to tide them over the winter period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The export of live cattle to Europe and third countries is an indispensable part of the overall livestock trade.  At this time of year in particular it is an essential element in the maintenance of a viable and stable price regime for livestock farmers.  At present live cattle exports, both weanlings and heavier cattle, to the EU are being frustrated <Col N="209" /> by the unavailability of ships to move cattle in an efficient and humane manner.  As the only EU member state without a land link to the continent, this is an intolerable constraint on trade from Ireland and it is incumbent on the Government to act to remove this constraint.  I welcome the Minister's announcement last week of the provision of up to £1 million to subsidise a direct ferry service to the continent to try to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>On the subject of third country exports, which are crucially important, I note that the Minister is travelling to Egypt later this month to try to reopen trade with that country but this measure comes late in the day.  When the Minister assumed office some months ago the reopening of the livestock trade was one of his priorities. His Leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, said that a Fianna Fáil led Government would do a better job and be far tougher in negotiations and that, as leader of such a Government, he would give the highest priority to the reopening of third country markets which are vital to healthy competition.  Such talk is fine in Opposition but when they arrive in Government nothing happens. Indeed, they have reneged on most of their promises in relation to the live export trade.  It is crucially important that this trade be reopened.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks I have met farmers who have taken a drop of up to £70 per head on cattle on the price they were getting this time last year. When one adds that up, it comes to a huge sum of money.  Most of the farmers cannot sustain such losses and continue in business.  I ask the Minister to bring back to his Department a sense of urgency about the need to ensure that this live trade is reopened forthwith.</P>
    <P>In the west especially and elsewhere store cattle was the backbone of the local economy, it was the sheet anchor of the economy but this position has been slowly eroded.  We are coming to the stage where, because of a lack of industrial employment and adequate compensation to farmers, young people are leaving the land and coming to Dublin.  In Dublin there are traffic jams and every kind of congestion while in the west there are wide open spaces and a population which is willing to work if it could receive the monetary compensation to stay.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann approves the continued efforts of the Government (a) to remove BSE related trade restrictions affecting live cattle exports from Ireland and (b) to secure alternative transport arrangements for live exports to the continent.&rdquo;<Col N="210" /></P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate the Opposition speakers.  I apologise to Senator Hayes for interrupting his first speech, but I do not agree with him or the seconder of this motion. We were in Opposition when Deputy Yates was Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  An example of the best he could do during his tenure of office was the launch of a charter of rights in a blaze of publicity.  We now have a Minister who does not seek this.  Deputy Yates thought the best thing for him to do as a Minister when abroad was to be photographed, but he did nothing for farmers in trouble.</P>
    <P>The price of cattle and winter finishing cattle was referred to.  Cattle prices have decreased from this time last year by about £50 to £60 per head.  However, they decreased during the previous Minister's term of office.  Cattle fetched a higher price last November than they did in February this year.  Thus those with winter fatteners dependent on the slaughtering scheme for adequate compensation for wintering cattle were not compensated.  I moved a motion last year asking the then Minister, Deputy Yates, to ensure prices would be maintained.  They were not and those poor farmers paid the penalty as a result of the inaction of the Minister at the time.</P>
    <P>The export of live cattle to Egypt was banned in early January last year.  The then Minister, Deputy Yates, went to Egypt in May and stated the Egyptian authorities informed him exports would recommence immediately, but that never happened.  It is coincidental the former Minister went to Egypt in May.  What was he doing from January until then?  The general election was in June and he announced prior to it that exports would recommence.  This never happened; it was an election gimmick.</P>
    <P>The former Minister also announced there would be a £50 subsidy for any cattle killed between last April and June.  He did so in the Red Cow Inn &mdash; a place I know well, it being owned by a Limerick man &mdash; but did not receive any clearance from Brussels.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, has been successful in obtaining clearance for a £17 million top-up for this £50 per animal subsidy, but it is another example of Deputy Yates' election gimmicks to fool the electorate.  He fooled the farmers and that is well known.</P>
    <P>The national beef assurance scheme to deal with traceability was announced prematurely last May.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has had to set up a special division within the Department to ensure the scheme can be put in place.  This was another premature announcement by the former Minister and another election gimmick to ensure the rainbow Government would be returned. Deputy Yates' record in Government has been one of false promises and letting down the farming community.  It is well known.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates said he had to accept the Russian ban on beef from certain counties.  It was very disappointing for the beef industry and beef farmers when such a ban was placed initially on beef <Col N="211" /> from three counties and then extended.  The former Minister told the nation on television a gun had been put to his head on this issue at Dublin Airport.  However, it was established he was not there at all but in a pub in Enniscorthy.  He lied to the nation, but our Minister is doing his best, without telling lies, to ensure the export of live cattle will be recommenced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I read last week in the <i>Irish Independent</i> that the only thing the former Minister could do was to try to establish a market for live cattle in Gambia through Michael Keating and Peter Bolger, who were involved with a firm called Eringold, and are now suspected of laundering money from drug trafficking.  It is a disgrace that the former Minister had to depend&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Senator Hayes on his motion.  This is an important issue which does not lend itself to the political slanging in which some elements appear to indulge.  Certain rural communities are in crisis and members of those communities will not thank us for indulging in slanging matches and political ping pong rather than engaging the serious issues at hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we like it, this is a political issue with a political background.  Those who stood for election attended meetings organised by the IFA in which this was only one of a number of issues pressed and the word &ldquo;demand&rdquo; was constantly used.  I come to this issue as someone from an agricultural background.  I am a farmer's daughter <Col N="212" /> but I am also a consumer.  I represent North Tipperary, a constituency in which agriculture is the dominant industry.  I am here to represent that industry and that constituency.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the decline of rural communities.  This cannot be simply attributed to the live exports issue.  There have been huge changes in agriculture in the past few years and this crisis is only now facing us.  There are underlying issues which concern all Members, particularly those from rural communities.  However, Members from urban communities should also be concerned by these issues.</P>
    <P>Coming after their screaming and shouting in the run up to the general election, there is no doubt that the reaction of the Minister and the Government to the reopening of the live export markets has been desultory, to say the least.  I am not going to indulge in a political slanging match but I note the manner in which Deputy Spring was criticised and vilified nationwide by Members of the Government parties for allegedly not doing enough to reopen the live export markets.  I am sure the current Minister knows it is not as simple as getting on an aeroplane and flying to Egypt to get the market reopened.  He has been 100 days in office and the problem has still not been solved.  I know every effort is being made as was the case with the previous Government.  However, the situation is urgent.</P>
    <P>The cynicism in relation to this issue will not go down well in rural communities.  Agriculture is central to the health of both rural and urban Ireland.  As Senator Caffrey stated, the Celtic tiger is roaring in the cities and towns but it is barely mewing in parts of rural Ireland.  I do not have to state the importance of agriculture.  The agriculture, food and forestry sectors account for, approximately, 14 per cent of our gross domestic product.  There are 175,000 jobs directly involved in these sectors and many more indirectly.  They account for 18 per cent of all exports and 40 per cent of our net foreign exchange earnings.</P>
    <P>Live exports have become a thorny and divisive issue and we have not heard the last of it.  I am worried that it has become an urban/rural issue and part of the growing urban/rural divide.  If one is from the city one is against live exports; if one is from the country one is in favour.  It has become an argument between those who are implacably opposed to it versus those who consider it right to have access to third country markets.  There has to be a reconciliation between these two views but there is no indication of it yet.  This should not be such a divisive issue.  I am not saying that the anti live export lobby does not have a right to its point of view.  We live in a society in which every view should be respected. I support the concern for the welfare of animals and I hope others do likewise.  I do not know any farmer who does not respect the welfare of animals and it annoys me to hear allegations that farmers to not care about this issue.</P>
    <P>The live exports issue has been largely dealt with by new EU regulations which were anticipated <Col N="213" /> by the previous Minister, Deputy Yates. These regulations address animal welfare, particularly in transit, in relation to rest periods, journey times, watering requirements and so on.  It has been contended that our regulations are among the most stringent in Europe.  We should have nothing to worry about as long as these regulations are strictly enforced.</P>
    <P>It is not realistic to ban live exports.  We are an island and we need to get the animals off the island.  Beef is 11 times more important to our economy than to the overall EU economy.  While we know these facts, they may need to be restated.  Almost nine out of every ten animals produced here must be exported.  We consume only 12 per cent of the beef we produce.  Unless we suddenly decide to eat far more beef we will have to increase our exports.  Ireland has a particularly high dependency on exports compared to non-EU countries.  We account for almost 25 per cent of EU beef exports and are the largest net exporter of beef to third country markets.  We cannot afford to be without live exports.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I accept the need to develop as much value-added as possible to our primary products at processing level creating much needed jobs.  We often hear it said that, instead of exporting cattle on the hoof, we should process them here and send them abroad in plastic bags.  However, this is no easy solution for producers.  Would it be constructive to have a purely processing industry?  This would reduce competition in the beef sector and have long-term detrimental effects.</P>
    <P>There are other factors to be taken into account, for instance, the specific demand in many third countries for live beef which can be slaughtered domestically.  This demand has been heightened by the BSE crisis.  I am sure the Minister and his Department are working hard on this issue but we, in Opposition, wish to again bring to his attention the current crisis, the urgency of the demand and the need to increase his efforts and tell us more of the steps he is taking.  He must live up to the promises he made and the expectation he created in the run up to the last election that, once back in Government, a magic wand would be waved and everything would be fixed. We know it is not that simple.</P>

      <P>It is my pleasure to call on the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, who is responsible for areas such as organic farming and cattle breeding.  I welcome him to the House on his first visit since his appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Hayes on his maiden speech, even though he is no maiden at speech making.  I also congratulate Senator Caffrey.  It is his first time on the Agriculture Panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes was selective in his comments. It was on 5 June that Deputy Yates made his promise &mdash; it had no relation to the general election <Col N="214" /> that the Egyptian market was going to reopen.  Since taking office it has been a priority of this Government to ensure that BSE related restrictions on our export of live cattle and beef are removed.  As regards live cattle, Egypt and Libya are the two markets of importance which have imposed bans on imports from Ireland.  A ban was imposed by Egypt in January 1997.  A commitment in principle to reopen the market for Irish cattle was communicated on 4 June to the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  However, that agreement in principle was subject to certain conditions.  In the first instance, discussions at a technical level on the conditions for the resumption of trade were necessary.  These culminated in the visit by two delegations from the Department to Egypt in August.  Many of the veterinary requirements for the resumption of trade were agreed and a package of proposals was offered including assistance for the removal of specified risk material.  The latter was of importance in terms of allowing the Egyptian authorities to provide the same type of health guarantees as are available to European consumers.</P>
    <P>Final agreement on reopening the market was delayed mainly due to increased concerns in Egypt relating to food imports in general.  In view of this delay my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, contacted the Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Wally, and met him in Cairo on 28 September.  He also met the Minister for Trade and Supply, Dr. Goweily.  As a result of these meetings the Egyptian authorities agreed to consider accepting a trial shipment subject to certain conditions.  A detailed proposal for such a shipment is at present being formulated by my Department in conjunction with the Live Cattle Exporters Association for consideration by the Egyptian authorities.  We hope that a trial shipment, properly controlled, will convince the Egyptian authorities to reopen the market fully to Irish cattle imports.</P>
    <P>It should also be recognised that Egypt is now one of our most important markets for frozen beef with exports having increased substantially this year.  The quantity of frozen beef exported in the first half of the year, estimated at 30,000 tonnes or equivalent to almost 100,000 cattle, exceeds the total for 1996.  At present a ship destined for Egypt is being loaded at Foynes.  This shows increasing acceptance by Egypt not only of the quality of Irish beef but of the controls on its production.  The increased demand for frozen beef is, of course, to be welcomed.  It represents an adjustment in the type of demand from Egypt and as such is a factor which obviously influences the continuing negotiations in relation to this market.  This does not, of course, diminish our resolve to have the restrictions on live cattle removed.</P>
    <P>Libya is another important market for live cattle.  A ban was imposed on imports from Ireland in March 1996.  Shortly after returning to office, the Minister for Agriculture and Food <Col N="215" /> made contact with his Libyan counterpart as a follow-up to the visit to Ireland of a technical delegation from Libya earlier this year.  Since then contact continues at diplomatic level and the Minister intends to visit Libya as soon as the appropriate arrangements can be made.</P>
    <P>It should be well understood by now that the restrictions were imposed by these countries because of BSE related concerns.  A decision to remove these restrictions is a matter for the authorities in the countries concerned.  Our job is to convince the authorities of the safety of our product and the strength of our controls.  The Government will spare no effort in carrying out this task.</P>
    <P>The traditional markets on the continent for live cattle as well as for sheep and pigs have long provided a valuable outlet for our livestock as well as playing an important role in securing adequate returns for Irish farmers.  The decision of the principal provider of ferry services to the continent to refuse to carry live animals with effect from 1 August last could, therefore, have posed a very substantial threat to the entire livestock sector in Ireland.  I note Senator Hayes did not make reference to the promise by Pandoro that they would continue forever to export, an agreement broken within a short period of the new situation arising.  Animals for the continental market have normally been supplied from Ireland by animal transporters on board roll-on/roll-off ferries and it is clear that an alternative ferry service committed to carrying all categories of livestock was immediately required to fill the gap created in the animal transport sector.  Indeed, the denial of access by Irish livestock producers to virtually the whole of the EU market which would have resulted but for the Government action which has now been taken, runs wholly contrary to the principles of the EU Single Market.</P>
    <P>This Government assistance for the provision of an alternative ferry service has now been made available and a suitable ship, the <i>MV Purbeck,</i> has already been inspected and passed by departmental officials together with independent marine consultants.  The Minister has also received a number of business plans from interested parties for the provision of this service and has already decided in favour of a particular proposal.  Subject to clearance by the EU Commission of the State aid involved, I am confident that trade in live animals to the continent of whatever category will be able to resume in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Live cattle cannot, of course, be considered in isolation from the development of our beef trade. I should, therefore, mention the successful conclusion of recent negotiations between the Minister for Agriculture and Food and a Russian delegation led by the Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Scherbak.  This resulted in the conclusion of a new Protocol providing for the first easing of the restrictions imposed in November 1996.  Russia is a most important market for beef and it is hoped that the process of lifting <Col N="216" /> the restrictions will continue when, as agreed, the Protocol comes up for review again next January. A veterinary agreement was also signed which provides for increased co-operation between the veterinary services of both countries thus representing a strengthening of relations which should be of significant benefit in furthering agricultural trade.</P>
    <P>There has been an overall improvement in cattle prices compared with this time last year, although prices still remain below those prevailing before the BSE crisis.  Improvement in the balance in the EU beef market combined with an effective intervention system offer good grounds for optimism that cattle prices should at least be maintained for the short term with a mediumterm outlook for gradual improvement.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that both the live cattle and beef trade can develop to their full potential to maximise the returns to Irish farmers.  This House should compliment the Minister on his achievement in getting a separate roll-on/roll-off service for the continental market from which we were totally cut off by companies which refused to carry live animals.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes also raised the question of area aid.  Payments under area aid will commence on 16 October amounting to £90 million.  In addition, Teagasc is gathering information for the Department relating to the losses in the cereal sector. This will be assessed and the Minister will make a decision pending the full report from Teagasc regarding not only the grain but the whole horticultural area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator O'Meara said an urban/rural divide appeared to be opening in relation to the live cattle trade.  This is most unfortunate because I know farmers care more for their animals than anybody else.  However, this issue has to be addressed.  I am glad the Minister said the live cattle trade cannot be looked at in isolation but as part of the whole beef industry which is incredibly important to the country.  Pandoro is most unlikely to start shipping live cattle from Ireland because of the protests which have taken place elsewhere.  They are cognisant of the rest of their business which they do not wish to damage.</P>
      <P>As somebody outside the agricultural industry, it appears that the live cattle trade is a type of safety valve to prevent the exploitation of beef farmers.  I do not wish to suggest that there is price fixing in meat factories.  The Minister began to address this at the Ploughing Championships. In a television interview he gave the impression that he was about to address this problem.  I do not think many people know that we have the lowest beef prices in Europe.  This is a reality for our farmers and I do not think people here fully understand this.  The live cattle trade is very important to farmers and this should be made known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One problem about suggesting subsidised ferries for the export of cattle is that urban dwellers <Col N="217" /> will say they do not receive such subsidies for any other exports and they will ask why subsidies should be provided for the beef trade.  It is possible to understand the lack of sympathy in the context of Irish Ferries which will close from the end of this month until next spring or summer, laying off a considerable amount of employees and it will be said that people, never mind live cattle, are not being exported to the continent.</P>
    <P>The beef trade is of prime importance as is the added-value aspect.  The economics of the issue have to be addressed and I am glad the Minister raised this matter.  The international regulations from the World Trade Association will come into play by the year 2002.  Beef farmers have an enormous number of problems to deal with on the international scene.  I will probably be contradicted but beef farmers pay approximately £150 for calves which can be bought for £50 in Australia and New Zealand.  It must be extraordinarily difficult to compete with that difference in price for raw material on the international market.  As Senator Rory Kiely said, there is also the cost of keeping an animal for two and a half years without, perhaps, making a profit.  I understand why people keep talking about the reason the live trade must be opened up.  There is also the additional cost of transport because of our location.  It costs approximately 5p a kilo to export beef to England and 12p a kilo to export it to Italy.  The Swedish market has been opened up and I have no idea what it costs to export beef there.  It is a serious problem when trying to compete with other countries.  This aspect of the beef industry has not been publicised so the people are not as concerned about it as they should be.</P>
    <P>An enormous amount of steer beef is being produced which is being put into intervention, although everyone is looking for heifer beef.  I presume artificial insemination has not been able to separate sperm so that only heifer calves are produced.</P>
    <P>It would be great if we could deal with the Herod scheme which has upset many people. Well established vets have discussed the state of calves going to some factories in early spring.  I remember one vet talking about calves that looked terrible as they came out of a lorry.  He examined their stomachs and found they had not been given any milk or food.  He suggested that these calves were bought from farmers for the premium and then sold to factories.  That causes enormous emotional upset.  The policing of such schemes is important.</P>
    <P>It would be good if an explanation was given as to why the live cattle trade is considered so important by farmers.  The structure of the beef industry makes it difficult for farmers to make a living.  Everyone mentioned the importance of added value to the beef industry.  Towns where factories work a three day week at the height of the season face serious difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and the <Col N="218" /> Department on their continuous efforts to reopen our live markets abroad, especially in Egypt and third countries.  However, this has not yet been successful for farmers who continue to accept low prices for their cattle.  This is of particular concern as we head into the peak killing period.  Beef farmers are once again facing another year of reduced incomes.  We must be concerned about our beef farms because they are facing difficult times.</P>
      <P>We export beef to over 60 markets world-wide so it is an important industry.  The refusal to renew contracts because of BSE is extremely harsh.  Many countries are ill-informed about the number of incidents of BSE, which is low, and about the success of our strict controls since 1989. I ask the Minister to continue to emphasise this to our international buyers so that the restrictions on the purchase of Irish beef can be removed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The euphoria surrounding the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, on 4 June was seen as an election gimmick and hopes built up then have since been dashed. It is unfortunate that our international beef exports have been dealt with in this way.  Senator Hayes said the former Minister did a good job in May and June.  He may have done so then but he did not follow it up.  He took his eye off the ball which has left us in this predicament.  Had the Minister continued his efforts at that time, it would be a different ball game today.  That is the reason the Egyptian market was not reopened.  It is not fair to play politics with this serious issue.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the <i>MV Purbeck</i> has been inspected by Department officials and independent marine consultants.  I hope this leads to the reopening of our export markets.</P>
      <P>Export refunds on live cattle were cut by 55 per cent in the past three years.  It is important that the EU recognises this serious drop in export refunds.  I hope the proposed agreement by the Minister during his recent visit to Cairo leads to a resumption of our live cattle trade and an increase in our beef exports.</P>

      <P>Molaim an rún seo.  Déanaim comhgairdeas leis an Seanadóir Mac Aodh as ucht an rún mar is rud an-tábhachtach é don tír agus go mórmhór do fheirmeoirí na tíre.</P>
      <P>This is an important motion about which there is consensus in the House.  We all agree that the thousands of people involved in farming have a difficult time.  They work hard and borrow a lot of money to invest in their farms.  They are not like people in other businesses who are guaranteed a return.  Farmers in County Louth regularly get letters from the banks if the money is not available to meet their loans.  A good farmer is one who borrows and a productive farmer is one who increases his production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beef farmers have no market guarantee. Therefore, we are attempting to prove that we have a commodity which is clean in terms of health and BSE and that we have introduced the <Col N="219" /> strictest regulations in the world to protect our food.  Everyone agrees that we must do more and the actions of the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in this regard were excellent.  I hope that will continue.</P>
    <P>From my own point of view, I am here to listen and learn.  I come from an urban background and I do not know very much about agriculture, other than the information I gleaned when attending farmers' meetings in my county.  It is important that experts have been elected to the Seanad by local authorities who are in a position to discuss this matter.  Senator Hayes' motion is excellent and the contributions from the Government side have been informative.  The more often issues of this sort can be placed on the agenda the better in order that we can exert pressure for greater and increased action from public representatives who hold ministerial office.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the re-opening of the live cattle trade to the countries referred to earlier.  I also look forward to increased attention being paid to the needs of farmers by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, congratulate him on his appointment and wish him a lengthy period in office.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that any Member under-estimates the importance of this issue and the degree of anxiety experienced by the rural community and farmers in general, particularly the degree to which people are concerned about the re-opening of live export markets for our cattle.  For competition to operate, it is essential that this happens otherwise people who operate beef factories will take commercial advantage wherever possible.  I do not condone the fact that they do so but their motives are understandable.</P>
      <P>Why is this debate taking place?  Several speakers stated that we should not politicise this matter.  We are becoming diffident about being politicians.  Nevertheless, this House is a political institution and I see nothing wrong with engaging in political argy-bargy on this matter.  In that context, I wish to draw attention to the 130th press release in 1997 from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry which was issued on 6 June.  The first thing to remark upon in connection with this press release is that the press officer in the Department must have been very busy because he issued 130 such releases in the space of approximately 180 days.  The date on which it was issued will not be lost on Members as it was the day on which the general election took place. This official press release issued by the Government's information services stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Mr Ivan Yates, today announced that he had received written confirmation from Dr. MYoussuf Wally, the Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture, that the Egyptian authorities had agreed to allow imports of Irish cattle ready for slaughter. <Col N="220" /></P>
    <P>Imports of live cattle to that market from Ireland have been banned since January of this year.</P>
    <P>Details of the implementation of the decision, viz, veterinary certification, will be finalised between the veterinary authorities of the two countries.  This will be done as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Minister Yates said that he was very pleased at the outcome of the concerted political, diplomatic and technical efforts made to re-open the market.  &ldquo;Egypt is a highly significant Market for live cattle, worth over £120 million per annum.  The decision to re-open the market will give a major boost to the Irish cattle and beef sector in the period ahead, especially in regard to the seasonal autumn supplies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What the press release does not state is that it would give a significant boost to the former Minister's party in the election held on the same day. However, that is probably coincidental and I should not draw such conclusions.</P>
    <P>There is a significant difference between the statement highlighted in that press release and the remarks made by the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, this evening.  The Minister of State entered a very important caveat into the debate when he stated that these matters were &ldquo;Subject to clearance by the EU Commission&rdquo;. During the term of office of the previous Administration, many debates took place in this House in respect of this issue and I do not recall hearing it said that action was subject to clearance by the EU Commission.  We can live or die by the hype but the current Minister, the Minister of State and the Government will be judged by their actions not the hype.</P>
    <P>On 2 October 1997, no less an authority than the <i>Farmers' Journal</i>&mdash; I must declare an interest in that I work for that publication from time to time but I did not write the article to which I am about to refer &mdash; printed an article entitled &ldquo;Ivan's promises unravelling&rdquo;.  The article began by stating that the then Minister claimed he had received a commitment from Pandoro to ship all Irish cattle, except young cattle, to the continent. I and several other public representatives attended a meeting in the Red Cow Inn on 23 April, which was also attended by hundreds of farmers.  A special debate took place in the Dáil on the same day during which the Minister came under pressure.  He informed those present at the meeting that he had obtained £17 million in national aid for winter beef finishers.  However, the important words to which the Minister of State referred earlier &ldquo;Subject to clearance by the EU Commission&rdquo; were not used.  I understand that seeking such clearance from the EU Commission is delaying a resolution of this matter.  We hope that the said clearance will arrive and finishers will obtain something approaching £50 per head.</P>
    <P>The third issue to which the article referred involved the Minister's displeasure with the factories and his commitment to refer the matter to <Col N="221" /> the Competition Authority to resolve the situation.  The Minister had every right to write to that authority to ask it to do what he thought it should do but he was not empowered to instruct it in respect of what it should do.  As far as I am aware, the Competition Authority falls under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is an independent body.  The article goes on to deal with the national beef quality assurance scheme which, it states, was &ldquo;the latest to run into the sands&rdquo;.  It further states that:</P>
    <P>After the June farm council the Minister said he had won a commitment from the EU Commission that it would look favourably at easing intervention arrangements for the autumn.</P>
    <P>The final matter to which the article refers is the press release I read into the record earlier.  I return to my point that it is a question of how one acts.  I would prefer the understated action of the current Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, to a press release and public hyperbole.</P>
    <P>I was one of the young, enthusiastic and misguided individuals who erected a static cattle shed in 1973.  It was one of the first such sheds in County Kildare and I thank God that it has lain idle for the past number of years.  I would hate to think how much I would need my Seanad salary as my alternative enterprise were it not for that fact that the shed is lying idle.  I agree with Senator Hayes in respect of area aid and the person with 50 acres who received £1,800 from his merchant or co-op at the end of the harvest.  That individual was fortunate because in many cases people actually owe money to their merchants or co-ops.  The Senator is correct &mdash; that is the significance of area aid and why we want it put in place as soon as possible.  I thank the Minister of State for sending me the first instalment of my oil seed rape area aid during the past week.  That is something good to report.</P>

      <P>In the near future, apart from the need to re-open live shipping and trade with Egypt, Libya and Russia, we must concentrate on Agenda 2000 and the world trade agreement which will require major adjustments on the part of the industry.  We must remind ourselves that we are dealing with a consumer market.  I had believed BSE taught us that lesson but I am not so sure.  I believe we continue to regard intervention as the market and that would be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standards on ships travelling to the continent must be of the highest order because we operate in a consumer market and that is what people demand.  If an accident took place which provided a photo opportunity in respect of compassion in world farming, that is not the issue.  What is important is our status as an exporting country. In that context, it is regrettable that scientific work on beet breeding carried out in County Carlow, <Col N="222" /> which was authorised by the Environmental Protection Agency, was sabotaged.  If we are to discover the significance of that type of work, we will only do so by conducting experiments of that nature.  Such sabotage must be decried.  The press referred to Roundup herbicide as a pesticide. Technically, the LD 50, the dose required to kill a certain number of rats, is less than the LD 50 of common salt.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to the House and I wish him well in his portfolio.</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone wants to politicise this issue.  I congratulate Senator Hayes on putting this motion before the House and giving us an opportunity to debate it.  I accept the points made by Senators, particularly Senator Dardis, when he referred to the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.  However, this Government has been in power since 6 June, which is nearly five months ago, and the live export trade has still not been opened.  Tonight's motion is intended to put pressure on the Government and authorities to open trade.</P>
      <P>In an ideal world we would not be discussing this matter as all beef leaving this country would be fully processed, so we could benefit in terms of jobs.  However, as the beef trade is controlled by so few people, to survive, farmers have no alternative but to get what they can from the live export trade and improve prices.</P>
      <P>In the west, the livelihood of the vast majority of farmers depends on the live export cattle trade. It increases the value of beef and the smaller stock and is the basis on which they farm.  This is why I support Senator Hayes' motion.  Whatever pressure can be exerted on institutions, it is important the live export trade to Libya and Egypt is opened.  Whoever wrote the press release to which Senator Dardis referred should be brought to task over why nothing has happened in relation to the Egyptian market.</P>

I welcome the Minister's announcement about the <i>MV Purbeck</i> which has been inspected and passed for operation by the Department's officials.  I hope it will be in operation as soon as possible.  It is important that the Minister and the Government take whatever steps are necessary to solve this problem.  If the Minister has to go to Libya in the morning, he should do so.  We are approaching the winter and cattle are being taken from the land.  Since farmers' incomes could be seriously affected as we approach the Christmas period, it is important the matter be dealt with immediately.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I oppose the motion on the basis of the information supplied by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his Minister of State, Deputy Davern; first, on the efforts made by this Government to procure the Libyan and Egyptian markets and, second, on its work in the provision of transportation for the live export trade.</P>
      <P>When I was unexpectedly appointed to the Seanad one of the first matters I was asked to do something about was the live export trade.  This is important to the people of the west as 60 per cent of farmers there have cow suckler herds and they depend on the live export trade for that type of unfinished cattle.</P>
      <P>I welcome the efforts made by the Government in providing money, subject to the sanction of the European Commission, and its genuine interest in setting up a transportation system for the live export trade.  I hope the Minister of State's visit to the House will allay some of the fears of those who have invested hugely in the modernisation of the transportation area of this industry and are dependent on it.</P>
      <P>We are all part of the Common Agricultural Policy and the GATT negotiations affect us all. It is not a matter of town versus country.  In the past, there was criticism of, and tribunals relating to, the development of the meat industry and the procurement of the maximum number of jobs in it.  However, an attempt was also made to reduce the maximum number of live export killings in the State.  It has been proven that lack of competition between factories in the live export trade results in a considerable reduction of the value of the animal being exported and in the income of the family farm.</P>
      <P>Whatever decisions are made in this House, what matters is the price of the animal which carries the farmer's costs.  At present, cattle are roughly £1 a kilo and perhaps up to £30 a head over that.  It is important this base be sustained and strengthened.  A change is taking place in the agricultural sector, on which many families depend.  While we are setting out our future position on the development of agriculture and the environment, it is important the live export trade is developed.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister and the Minister for State in their work.  While there is an element of uncertainty in farming, it is important we sustain the family farms dependent on the live export and I welcome the Government's support of that.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  No one owes us a living.  We are trying to sell to a market which does not want our product because of a sustained attack on us from inside and outside the cattle trade.  It has also come from our competitors <Col N="224" /> in the Egyptian market &mdash; Australia, Argentina and Britain.  Every time statistics appear stating how many incidences of BSE occur in various counties, the British, Australian and Argentinian embassies, who represent our competitors, will have the statistics on the Egyptian market within 12 hours, long before we read them.</P>
      <P>We can deal with this matter by trying to eliminate the BSE problem.  We must communicate our efforts to the Egyptians and our other customers.  The Government is being condemned but what is at issue is the customers who want to buy our beef.  The Egyptians like the taste of Irish beef but Egyptian veterinarians are not yet satisfied fully with our product and the industry.</P>
      <P>The Government is doing its best.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, went to Egypt and got a commitment that once the Egyptian technical officials are satisfied we can resume exports.  Senator Tom Hayes should not try to flog this horse because he might die in the attempt.</P>

      <P>There would be merit in giving copies of debates on this issue to Members when they change sides of the House.  On the last occasion we had a similar debate it was on a motion condemning Deputy Yates, the then Minister.  I will not support a motion condemning the present Minister.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am aware of his commitment to the sector.  I was also aware of the commitment shown by Deputy Yates, Deputy Walsh in his previous term as Minister and before him Ray MacSharry.  Each time they took decisions as Ministers they were criticised by the parties in Opposition at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members should consider this trade realistically.  I could argue against re-opening the live trade because the people who inform me talk mainly about job losses.  However, I agree with the point made by Senator Chambers and others that we need competition in the beef trade.  I opposed the abattoirs legislation several years ago in this House.  That legislation moved us on from being able to go to the local butcher to buy meat which was slaughtered and sold by the butcher.  People knew where the cattle came from and who had reared them.  Nowadays there are <Col N="225" /> committees in Europe which have been set up to find systems to trace the origin of beef.  We would do well to step back.</P>
    <P>We should examine what has happened to the live beef trade in Ireland.  We should ask why Kerry plc got out of the red meat sector two years ago.  We should ask why the IFA issued a statement calling for more investment incentives for farmers.  There is a disincentive to farmers to invest because a person can buy beef on the hoof and sell it to a factory in Egypt in competition with a factory in Kerry, for example, and get a better price.</P>
    <P>How has a company like Tara Meats in Kilbeggan, County Westmeath managed to make a success of its operation given the state of the industry? The level of subsidies in the beef trade is impossible to understand and does not make any sense.  Farmers are being misled.  We have created another monopoly in the beef industry having moved away from it five or six years ago.  There is only one buyer of beef in Ireland.  It cost us £36 million recently to find out why that should be the case but we are back at that point again.</P>
    <P>It is cheap and unnecessary to have a go at the Minister.  It is not the Minister's fault and if the Government were to change tomorrow and the Members opposite were back on this side of the House I would make the same point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody must be honest enough to explain this simple theory to the farmers &mdash; working in a commercial environment is about making a profit.  It is not about selling at the highest price but selling at the lowest price. The farmers are being misled and used by all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the small farm is crucial but we are taking steps to make sure it cannot survive. <Col N="226" />  The Abattoirs Act is a classic example and if I had the time I could give more examples.  I recently met a person who deals with most of the imports of Irish meat in Alexandria, Egypt.  Farmers in Ireland are working hard to produce meat but there is no competition.  The parties on the Government side have often and correctly stressed the importance of competition, but there is no competition in farming at present.  That is not a reflection on the farmers who are hardworking and decent.</P>
    <P>The subsidy on live cattle for export is about 100 per cent.  The motion, however, proposes in effect that we open a market which doubles the price of beef.  I agree with Senators on both sides of the House and I agree with the IFA about the importance of the live beef trade in terms of competition &mdash; a matter on which I have changed my mind over the past couple of years.  However, there must also be internal competition, which is not the case at present.  We need to have a broader look at the issues, a full and detailed discussion on the beef sector and how farmers are being used and abused.</P>
    <P>The last time we discussed this issue the debate focused on the primacy of the consumer and meeting the consumer's needs.  The needs of the consumer, the live export trade and the world beef price all boil down to the same issue.  Within six months, one year or three years of this discussion the price of beef in Ireland will also be the world price.  It is dishonest not to tell that to farmers.  I know that will happen and I am not involved in farming.  I have no vested interest but I support farmers making a decent living.  I support the people who say let us decide what is a viable size but I will also ask questions.  Should we support a farmer who is trying to make a living or should we support people according to the number of acres or on the number of cattle they have? The farming industry is vitally important to this country.  When I started school agriculture was the predominant industry.  This is not the case anymore, even though the IFA would make a very strong case that it is.  Whatever the arguments for and against, it is clear that it is a precious industry on which a huge amount of our social infrastructure is based.  It is crucial that the small farmer in the west, or the large farmer in Leinster, can conduct their business in a way that provides them with a future.</P>
    <P>There are Members on the Minister's side of the House who agree with the motion.  We need to have a very open debate.  It is not a matter of criticising the Minister but of working out where this industry will be in five years time.  I want to put on the record that the price of beef in this country will also be the world price.  There will be a number of difficult years and the people who will lose out will be in the production area.  They are the people who will need support.  We should invest in those people and give them any subsidy they need to meet the shock of change.  The beef industry took two hard hits last year and the year before.  Those people need support because they <Col N="227" /> are providing an important service.  They are important to all aspects of our industry but they should be told where we will be in five years time. We need to look at this again and people must be very open and honest with each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support the amendment and to be associated with the words of welcome to the Minister of State, Deputy Davern.  This is my first time speaking in this House. May I express appreciation to the last speaker for the sympathy and understanding he has shown to us farmers and for the clarity with which he spoke?  We would do well to reflect on his presentation; I think he meant it and I compliment him.</P>
      <P>This amendment is specific and I intend to be likewise.  I recall the evening I was elected to the Seanad.  I remember saying to an official in the House that I had better get back to my harvesting quickly while the weather was dry.  I spent six weeks waiting for fine weather and we did the harvesting on two Sundays in between the bad weather.  This is one of the disadvantages from which we suffer but we must contend with this and overcome it.  While the beef industry is our biggest single industry, the difficulty is that we now have two disadvantages to overcome.  Condemning the Minister will not achieve anything. Recognising the efforts of the Minister, Minister of State and officials might achieve something for us.</P>
      <P>The beef industry has come through a very difficult 18 months &mdash; since the announcement about BSE on 20 March 1996 in the House of Commons.  That was when our problem began. Virtually all the problems which have beset the industry since emanated from that announcement.  It led to a dramatic fall in beef consumption in the European Union and to the closure of important markets in third countries.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, the situation has improved gradually, particularly in recent months.  Beef consumption has returned to close to normal levels in most member states.  There is also growing evidence that beef production is beginning to decline in EU member states.  Might I refer to what Members said about the urban/rural divide?  We do not have an urban/rural divide when it comes to the production and consumption of food.  It is up to farmers to produce good quality food and to make sure that our best market is the Irish market.  Let us not damage the best industry we have by negative comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a significant window of opportunity opening for the Irish beef industry.  The major priority for our beef industry is to expand and strengthen our presence in the European market.  The second beneficial effect of the improved balance in the EU beef markets is that it will relieve pressure on third country markets. Reference has been made to the next round of the World Trade Organisation discussions.  They will impact severely on the markets into third countries.  It is important that we recognise that <Col N="228" /> our best market is into Europe; let us develop that market.</P>
    <P>While competition in these markets remains strong, there are indications that it is becoming less severe.  This is evidenced by a gradual increase in third country prices.  I understand, for example, that prices in Russia have increased in recent months.  The intervention system will continue to play an important role in supporting a market, temporary though it should be.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission has extended the current intervention arrangements to the last quarter of the year.  This will permit cattle under the 360 kg weight limit with the important 04 grade to be taken, thus allowing for up to 50 per cent of steers to be eligible for intervention.  Trade is continuing normally to a wide range of our international markets, although a number of countries, such as Egypt, have imposed BSE related restrictions on live cattle.  I will not deal with the previous Minister's activities.  They were adjudicated upon by the electorate in June.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, visited Egypt on 28 September and met the Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Wally, in Cairo and the Minister for Trade and Supply, Dr. Goweily.  It should be recognised that Egypt is now one of our most important markets for frozen beef with exports having increased substantially this year.  The quantity of frozen beef exported in the first half of the year, estimated at 30,000 tonnes, equivalent to 100,000 cattle, exceeds the total for last year.  Russia remains our most important beef market, although trade was subject to restrictions since November 1996.  The recent negotiations with a Russian delegation resulted in the conclusion of a new protocol providing for the first easing of these restrictions.</P>
    <P>No restrictions should be applied to the export of livestock from Ireland to the continent.  The export of live cattle should be allowed unhindered to EU destinations provided it complies with the strict animal welfare conditions applicable to Ireland, as well as appropriate EU animal health conditions.  Government assistance for the provision of an alternative ferry service has now been provided, which is the strongest possible way in which we can show our support for this trade.  Those are the words of the Minister and the Minister of State.  A vessel suitable for the carriage of livestock has also been inspected and passed by officials of the Department together with independent marine surveyors.  Subject to clearance by the EU Commission of the State aid involved, this clears the way for the resumption of this trade.  This is a fact and it must be realised that the truth is being told.  There is no propaganda; this is the truth and the industry would be better served if our remarks were made in that context.</P>
    <P>Under EU regulations it is necessary to obtain the Commission's prior approval for all schemes for agri-monetary compensation whether the funding comes from the EU budget or the national Exchequer.  This approval had not been <Col N="229" /> obtained by the then Minister prior to his announcement of the scheme.  No effort has been spared by the Minister in pressing this issue and good progress had been made in recent discussions with the EU.  As a result of consultations which Minister Walsh has had with Commissioner Fischler, I am hopeful of a satisfactory outcome to this issue in the near future.</P>
    <P>The opportunity was taken by the mover of the motion, Senator Hayes, to refer to the serious harvest difficulties.  I, too, wish to highlight the matter because of my involvement.  I welcome the commitment from the Minister that he will issue area aid payments to farmers commencing on 16 October.  I hope that red tape or the innocent incorrect filling of forms or maps will not deprive farmers of the aid they sorely need this year.</P>
    <P>A Member of the House thanked Minister of State, Deputy Davern, for ensuring aid was paid to one sector but those in parts of the southern counties suffered the worst in regard to the harvest problem.  We are in the greatest need and let nobody say otherwise.  Let nobody pretend, or any farming organisation or otherwise say that the problem was national.  It was not.  It is worst in the southern counties and I appeal to the Minister to issue those payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>One might ask why a representative of Dublin Central has spoken on an agricultural Bill.  I have no doubt that when the history of agriculture in the late 20th century has been written the Minister's name will acquire a prominent place.  I know his heart is in the welfare of people living on the land and the agricultural sector of society.</P>
      <P>Agriculture, particularly when speaking publicly, is far too important an issue to be bandied around or with which to play party politics although we are in a political business.  When one thinks of the number of people both in rural and urban Ireland who depend on the good name of Irish produce and the thousands of people whose jobs depend on it we must be careful about what we say and where and how we say it.  It was mentioned earlier that we are now fighting in a very difficult world for Irish products.  When East Germany joined West Germany some years ago the huge ranches that existed remained intact.  They have been privatised and have been converted into huge agricultural production combines.  We have to deal with them and fight with them on their economies of scale.  Ireland is synonymous abroad with well produced food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall some years ago purchasing what I thought was Kerrygold butter and a litre of milk in the Canary Islands.  It was only when I examined the containers I realised there was a German combine in Munster in Germany exporting milk and butter to southern Spain and the Canaries.  It plagiarised Irish Kerrygold and other Irish logos. They were as near as possible as to be almost indistinguishable.  They were cashing in on our good name for well produced food.  Anybody who puts our good name in danger, whether they are <Col N="230" /> using growth promoters or whatever, not only put the industry in grave danger but also the livelihoods of farming families and people working in meat factories.  I welcome the recent attitude of the courts on this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not be considered sexist or ageist but in the past when a girl was getting married she was told to make a friend of her butcher, the insinuation being that if you had a good local butcher you would not be sold tough meat, but those days are gone.  At present a buyer or consumer is king or queen.  In Dublin the day of the family butcher is almost gone.  The majority of meat products are now sold through supermarkets and consumers will leave behind what does not appeal to them and the products in which they have no quality assurance.  It is no accident that this week Marks &amp; Spencer's changed to free range eggs.  The days of the battery hen are numbered.  These huge supermarket chains have their ears to the ground and know what consumers want and need and are in business to supply them.  As I said earlier, Ireland is synonymous with good food, we must guard our good name and we must take steps to see that our good name, which is in the interests of all producers, is well looked after.  In that respect I welcome the Minister to the House to give the assurance that the needs of our producers will be attended to by safeguarding the needs and desires of consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have listened to such an extremely good debate and delighted with the contributions from both sides of the House and the interest shown.  Agriculture is our biggest industry and employer and it is important to have debates on issues concerning it.  Some points made by Senators and by the Minister need clarification.  In particular, Senator Kiely referred to the charter of rights which was introduced by Deputy Yates in a blaze of glory and which everybody in the farming organisations welcomed.  Everybody associated with agriculture accepts the charter was implemented in full and I challenge him to tell me what aspect of it was not implemented.  Statements were made that cattle are the same price this year as last year.  I heard tonight that cattle were making £1 per kilo.  I was in Cashel at a mart yesterday, I was in Thurles on Monday and Tipperary town on Friday and I know that cattle are not making the prices they used to.  The price of heifers has been reduced by £30 to £40 a head and bullocks, in some cases, up to £50.  In the past few weeks it was difficult to find buyers for some of the plainer Friesian bullocks.  Those are the cattle I had in mind when I tabled this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers who speak to me at the marts are constantly asking when the live cattle trade will open up.  Senator Chambers said that was one of the first questions he was asked on becoming a Senator.  Everybody is concerned that this trade be opened up in order to bring competition back into the industry.  This country is receiving 15 per cent less for its beef than any of its European <Col N="231" /> counterparts because of the existence of monopolies.  Factories will continue to have a monopoly until such time as the live cattle trade opens up.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister of State to convey a message to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh; I know he will do that as he is as interested as anybody else in opening this market.  Will the Minister again travel to Egypt as the 2,000 cattle deal he has secured could be sold in any big mart in the south of Ireland in one day's sale?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the fact that the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, had secured agreement in principle from the Egyptians.  Everybody <Col N="232" /> knows that if one gets agreement in principle, one is on the verge of securing the deal.  That is the reality.  However, there has been a stalemate since then as the current Minister did not maintain the contacts which were made.  That is why the beef trade has not opened up and why farmers are worried.  If the Minister fails to travel to Egypt the Taoiseach himself should go; somebody must secure that market for the future, not alone of farmers and those involved in agriculture but of rural Ireland in general.  I am delighted to have received such a high level of support for my motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
      <P>The issue I am raising relates to the industrial dispute at the new headquarters of the National Museum in Collins Barracks, Dublin 7.  The official opening took place on 18 September but it was unfortunate that the IMPACT union felt obliged to have a one day strike that day to protest against any meaningful action to resolve the dispute that has been going on for a considerable period.</P>
      <P>The result of that one day strike was that, while the opening took place in the Taoiseach's constituency, he could not attend because he felt unable to pass the picket.  Consequently, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, was left in the unenviable position of having to pass a picket to perform the opening on the Taoiseach's behalf.  I am sure that caused considerable embarrassment to the Minister, although she spoke to the strikers outside and made a commitment to do all in her power to resolve the dispute at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>Approximately 2,500 guests were invited to the launch but only 500 attended.  Many more people were outside the museum with the pickets than were inside at the opening ceremony.  Some £70,000 was spent on the launch, but it was a severe embarrassment to everybody and the whole day was marred by the industrial dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is particularly serious considering the new museum was an initiative of the Labour-Fianna Fáil Government of 1992-94.  It was one of the flagships of development with literally tens of millions of pounds being invested in this enormous <Col N="233" /> development of the old Collins Barracks. At that time it was the oldest military barracks still in use in Europe.  Now it is to be put to this heritage use where, for the first time, we would be in a position to put on display the many treasures in the National Museum which, because of lack of space, we were unable to exhibit.  The intention was that at last we would have sufficient space to bring these treasures out of the dungeons, dust them down and put them on display. Unfortunately none of that work has taken place because of long standing industrial action, and the few people who visit the museum at present are going into largely open, empty exhibition areas. That is a disaster.  I am raising the issue as it is one of concern in my constituency.  Many people are employed by the National Museum and many others are affected directly by it.  As I understand it over the last 15 years there have been no normal promotions and approximately half of the curatorial staff are in acting positions or in lieu of that they are on part time contracts.  That is totally unsatisfactory for a national museum in terms of personnel and resources.  It is a festering sore the matter has been ongoing for some time.  I understand Minister de Valera met the union in the last week or so and she has already indicated she will do her utmost to resolve the matter.  I also understand there were some difficulties with the Minister for Finance and I am not sure to what extent she has been able to bring her persuasive powers to bear on him in this affair.</P>
    <P>The point of raising this matter on the Adjournment is to draw the attention of the Government to a serious issue that has been going on for a considerable period of time.  It is sad that it should take place in this context with dedicated staff who do not feel that they are being properly recognised, when they are not being given the managerial and promotional structures they would have expected, leading to their union, IMPACT, taking industrial action. Various forms of industrial action have taken place in terms of non co-operation in the preparation of exhibitions for the museum and this is the first strike that took place.  They are not telling people not to go into the museum, they are encouraging them to go in but they explain to them the reason they are will see so little in the museum is due to the industrial dispute.  I urge the Minister to look into the matter and to bring to his colleague the concerns that have been expressed locally and by the union in question, and see if we can get an early resolution of the dispute.</P>

      <P>I share Senator Costello's view that there is a compelling need to resolve the present industrial dispute involving members of the professional and technical staff in the National Museum.  The National Museum is at a key point in its development with the recent opening to the public of phase one of the Collins Barracks project.  It is my earnest wish that a practical resolution of the dispute is reached in order that the National Museum is in a strong position to tackle the many challenges that lie ahead at this key time in its development.</P>
      <P>The very fact that this is such an important time in the museum's evolution makes it all the more unfortunate that when at last we are endeavouring to ensure that it achieves the high regard it truly warrants as one of our foremost cultural institutions, we are faced with industrial action.  Despite this, however, I know the Minister is personally committed to the achievement of that status for the National Museum.  I know that is also the aim of the museum management and staff, as well as the officials in my Department and also the dedicated members of the caretaker board under their able chairperson Barbara Nugent who have worked unrelentingly on the museum's behalf.</P>
      <P>I must stress that the present industrial action in the National Museum was inherited by the present Minister.  Its origins go back over many years, however, to posts lost due to voluntary early retirement schemes in the late 1980s for example, which decreased the number of promotion outlets within the National Museum.  In what might be considered a small staffing pool such as the National Museum, the effect of these lost posts was magnified and resulted in a lack of promotions for many years and a consequent build up of frustration amongst the professional and technical staff.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind, however, that the staff in dispute at present are generally members of grades unique to the National Museum, recruited specifically for the National Museum who, unlike their general administrative and clerical colleagues also serving in the museum, have not traditionally enjoyed access either to promotions or lateral movement to positions in other Departments, thus emphasising further their comparative lack of career development opportunities. Under the recent PCW agreement with IMPACT, however, from which the professional grades in the National Museum amongst others benefited significantly, the position of professional staff with long service in their grade without promotion was especially recognised by the awarding of additional long service increments to those on the maximum points of the scales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the practice in my Department to <Col N="235" /> recognise staff who, temporarily or for an indefinite period, are carrying out additional or higher duties by way of &ldquo;ex-gratia&rdquo; or &ldquo;higher-duties&rdquo; payments, and a number of those involved in the dispute have benefited from such an arrangement. Therefore, despite the negative picture being portrayed, there have been improvements in conditions for the members of professional grades in the National Museum in recent times, all of which have been negotiated through the normal channels and without recourse to industrial action.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of staff with skills in particular disciplines such as conservation, marketing, information technology, skills which are essential in a modern museum, but had not been provided previously in the National Museum, was a particularly positive move which will benefit considerably both the National Museum and its visitors, and will help the museum to achieve its full potential.  I regret that as part of their industrial action the staff are not co-operating with these new staff members whose skills have been sought for so long in the National Museum.</P>
    <P>The number of visitors to the new facility at Collins Barracks is a clear indication of the huge level of public interest in the preservation and the display of our national cultural heritage, which serves only to emphasise the need to resolve this dispute.  The popularity of the exhibitions in Collins Barracks thus far, even in their incomplete state, demonstrates the outstanding ability of the professional and technical staff of the museum to present our cultural heritage in a way that is both visually appealing and informative to <Col N="236" /> the public.  The success of the museum at Collins Barracks thus far, even under the cloud of an industrial dispute, is a clear indication of the enormous potential of the National Museum which I aspire to help it reach.  Anybody who was there on the day the museum opened would have the utmost admiration for what has been achieved by the staff.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the staff involved in the dispute, who have given excellent service to the National Museum over the years, have no wish to prolong this dispute, but every Minister is compelled to consider all claims for promotions and additional staff within their Department &mdash; even what might be perceived to be a minor claim &mdash; in the context of the wider public sector pay and staff numbers policy.</P>
    <P>Ainneoin na bhfíordheachrachtaí a bhaineann leis an aighneas seo, tá sé dearbhaithe ag an Aire d'fhoireann an Ard-Mhúsaeim &mdash; agus, mar a dúirt an Teachta, chas an tAire leis an bhfoireann &mdash; agus dearbhaím féin don Teach tráthnóna inniú go bhfuil gach uile iarracht á dhéanamh le teacht ar réiteach i dtreo is go mbeimíd in ann an fuinneamh atá ginte ag an bhforbairt éachtach seo i mBeairic Uí Choileáin a choinneáil ar siúl agus go mbeimíd in ann a chinntiú go neartóidh an tArd-Mhúsaem a ionad lárnach san oidhreacht chultúrtha s'againne.  Bheadh súil agam ar deireadh go dtiocfar ar réiteach ar an aighneas seo go luath.  Tá gach uile duine ag su il le go mbeifear in ann dul ar aghaidh leis an obair iontach atá ar bun san Ard-Mhúsaem.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 2.30 on Wednesday, 15 October 1997.</P>
