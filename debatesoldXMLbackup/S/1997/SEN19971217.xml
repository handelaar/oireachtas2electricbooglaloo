      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to promote the testing of pregnant women for HIV on a routine basis, in view of the fact that recent advances in medical treatment reduces the transmission rate of HIV from the pregnant woman to her unborn child.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Environment and Local Government to allow local authorities discretion in relation to members' non-attendance at council meetings due to illness.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that maintenance grants are made available to the thousands of students attending post-leaving certificate courses on terms similar to those prevailing in the rest of the higher education sector.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to examine the huge potential for job creation in Tipperary town and its hinterland by Tipperary Co-op in a proposed joint venture and if she will sanction the necessary grant assistance from Forbairt to enable this project to proceed in the light of the recent major job losses in Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Henry and Burke as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Costello and Tom Hayes may give notice on another day of the matters they wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The proposed Order of Business is items 1, 1<i>a</i> on the Supplementary Order Paper, 7, 2, 3 and 12, motion 11.  Items 1 and 1<i>a</i> on the Supplementary Order Paper and 7 will be taken without debate.  All Stages of item 2 will be taken today and if proceedings thereon have not previously concluded, they will resume at 8 p.m. The contributions of spokespersons on item 2 will not exceed 20 minutes while other Senators will have 15 minutes.  Item 3 will be taken without debate at the conclusion of item 2.  Item 12, motion 11, will be taken at 6 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the discussion on asylum and racism, on which I will have much to say.  In the meantime, will the Leader refer, as a matter of urgency, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the case of a person from an Africian country who was unceremoniously taken off a bus on which he was travelling to the mosque at 11.30 a.m. yesterday?  His identity papers were demanded from him, he was interrogated as to his identity and disbelief was expressed that he was the person holding these papers.  A squad car was summoned into which he was bundled.  He was taken away and I understand some strip searching occurred at Pearse Street police station.  He was forced to sign a document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This appears to be a matter appropriate to the Adjournment and not the Order of Business.  I have given the Senator much latitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader will understand the nature of my concern that this type of thing should happen in a police station in this country.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader say when it is likely that the universities Bill proposed by Deputy Spring will come before the House?  Deputy Spring made a balls of the general election and the presidential election.  Now it appears he wishes to make a balls of university representation in the Seanad, something which will be strongly resisted.  I look forward to the opportunity of placing on the record of the House the precise reasons how and why this will occur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is.  Does the Leader share my concern about the enormous amount of publicity, particularly in one newspaper, regarding what was widely described this morning as a paedophile ring in Galway?  It seems that, as a result of this publicity, it will be impossible for those who may be charged to have anything approximating to a fair trial in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris has been a Member of the House for a long time and is aware of what is in order on the Order of Business. I would not like Members to be under the impression that the Order of Business is a free for all during which matters of no relevance to it can be raised.  I ask Members to confine their comments on the Order of Business to matters relevant to the business of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Cathaoirleach made that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just sour grapes.  I can understand Senator Norris's attitude because he is about to lose his privileged position as a representative of a very small section of the third level electorate; I also understand his attitude to Deputy Spring because he did not choose the Senator as a presidential candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason was that the two people who nominated me worked in my university.  Perhaps the same childish spite is in operation on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a bigger bowl of sour grapes than I thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There are plenty more and I will be happy to fire them at the Senator all afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader facilitate a debate on the task force report on drug abuse early in the new year?  I was alarmed by the disclosure in the Dáil yesterday that the original commitment of £20 million to the youth services development fund has been whittled down to £1.25 million.  I was at a meeting yesterday of a project, now without funding, which had been developed in the belief that that commitment would be honoured.  I am sure there are dozens of projects in a similar situation.  We should have a debate on this matter to elucidate the position of the Minister and the Government regarding this extremely important area of policy which should be properly funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the House find a way to honour the outgoing President of the ANC and of South Africa who yesterday stepped down as president of the <Col N="336" /> ANC?  The President was given the freedom of the City of Dublin and he honoured us with his presence.  He is an outstanding democrat, an opposer of apartheid and fully supportive of activities against racial discrimination.  This has a particular relevance to us in the context of refugee and asylum issues, remarks made by a Deputy in the Dáil and the dismantling of the 1996 refugee legislation.  Nelson Mandela has made a tremendous contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Costello could draft an appropriately worded motion which could be put on the Order Paper for debate in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach is too charitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader will examine a means of honouring Nelson Mandela and raise the issue at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader assure us that the Government will have nothing to do with the Bill on the universities published by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs as it is a gross interference in the affairs of this House?  Perhaps Senator Costello would remind Deputy Spring that he is a graduate of one of those colleges and that we expect more from a former Minister for Foreign Affairs than to meddle in the internal affairs of this House as the first legacy of his retirement.  It would not be worthy of Deputy Spring to come into this House, for what appear to be purely vindictive reasons, to seek to meddle in the seats which are the most democratically elected in the Seanad.  He should go off and solve problems in Bosnia where he is far better equipped to use his great energies and talents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of today's incredible revelations of an alleged major paedophile ring operating in the west, when will the Child Pornography Bill come before the House?  There is an absolute need for this legislation and it should be introduced as soon as possible.  I condemn this alleged operation &mdash; if it exists &mdash; and I hope and pray the offenders will be brought to justice immediately.  The men involved in this contemptible practice are sick, perverted and disgusting and I believe imprisonment is too good for them. I abhor the hurt and damage they cause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate the matter at this stage.  The Senator has asked for a debate on the matter and I have allowed her to make a case for such a debate.  Matters cannot be debated at length on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Costello's comments on President Mandela.  Will the Leader, directly or via the Minister for Foreign Affairs, convey our good wishes to him?  I can think of nobody in history who has been more consistent and effective in the pursuit of his ideals.  His most important contribution of all was to help to heal wounds and divisions in a post-struggle era.  Ireland saw fit to honour President Mandela who, in turn, facilitated a very important conference with a view to helping us resolve our divisions in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago I questioned the appropriateness of a committee being called an Oireachtas committee when it had not been set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I refer to the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution.  If I missed a reply on the issue, I apologise.  I am not aware of any resolution having been passed by this House to set up such a committee.  I asked the Cathaoirleach to investigate the matter and I reiterate that request now.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what my colleagues from Dublin University are getting so worked up about.  I find it extraordinary that a university with 30,000 graduates should have three seats in this House when a university with 94,000 graduates has the same number.  That is a bad start to democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should check the voting rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really bothered about what the former leader of the Labour Party does. He has certainly succeeded in getting a lot of publicity for his proposal.</P>
      <P>I would like to have a debate on waste.  We are now getting to the stage where waste is piling up outside the headquarters of political parties to be scrutinised by the entire nation.  This is a problem of great proportions which must be dealt with quickly.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would like Members of the House to consider some form of appropriate action to express our regret at the attempted intimidation of our President by senior members of the Roman Catholic Church in recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>This is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea that the Archbishop of Dublin would describe the President's behaviour as a sham is outrageous and I say that as a church going Catholic.  I am extremely angry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in order on the Order of Business.  If the Senator wishes to make that statement elsewhere I have no objection, but it is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader once again to put the refugee issue on the Order Paper?   Some weeks ago we had a debate which was a sham because the representative of the Minister for Justice told us nothing, answered none of our <Col N="338" /> questions and then proposed to do a series of things, none of which was announced in this House a fortnight previously.  We need to return in detail to the issue of refugees for, among other reasons, the one Senator Norris gave earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get back to Senator Ryan on the first issue he raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the extension of Seanad voting rights to third level institutions.  As a member of the governing authority of the University of Limerick I will make it a matter of priority for that body to push for that extension. Members need not feel that it is just a single party issue.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Cox is most important and has to be dealt with.  It should not be pushed aside as if it were irrelevant.  Paedophilia must be stamped out in society.  The problem of the alleged paedophilia ring must be addressed instantly.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste should come to the House for a debate on IDA policy regarding jobs.  I raise that matter in the light of the problems associated with a major company in my area, AST.  I shudder to think what will happen to the families working there.  At this moment there are husbands and wives with huge mortgages who are not looking forward to a happy Christmas.  These are very relevant issues and we have no forum, other than the Order of Business, in which to raise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Senator Jackman was not suggesting that I pushed aside the matter raised by Senator Cox as irrelevant.  I asked Senator Cox to conclude her contribution on the Order of Business because there are ways of raising matters in the House under Standing Orders. I would prefer if Members used the appropriate Standing Orders of the House to raise matters on the Adjournment or by way of motion, but not without notice on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to inject a note of prudishness into the proceedings, but it is in relation to the comments made earlier by my good friend and colleague, Senator Norris, and his use of language.  I am curious to know if there is, under Standing Orders, a list of acceptable or non-acceptable words that can be used in the course of debate, as there is in other parliaments. I am not raising this matter in order to have a go at Senator Norris&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who knows I have the highest of motives.  However, I feel there should be a certain decorum in this House.  As the senior legislative assembly we are supposed to provide a lead.  I am concerned about it not just in this House but elsewhere.  For example, there is an increasing use of questionable language by the leading characters in &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;, which is the <Col N="339" /> most popular soap opera on television.  It is not a good example to the youth of this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context I am asking you, a Chathaoirligh, if there is such a list.  I do not want to go into detail because the Cathaoirlach would rule me out of order, so I am making the point in general terms.  I am not a prude, but I object to the specific words Senator Norris used earlier.</P>

      <P>Before the conclusion of business in this session at the end of the week, will the Leader arrange for a full and proper debate in this House, with the Minster for Health and Children in attendance, on the situation regarding the risks of CJD infection in the blood supply?   I raised the matter on the Adjournment on 19 November when the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children admitted that risks or potential risks were associated with all blood products.  We have been led to believe over the past few days that the Irish Medicines Board was, at that time, in possession of some information relating to the current difficulty, but that was not transmitted here.  If, as the Minister of State has admitted, there are risks, they should be fully assessed by the Department.  The matter should be dealt with in a full, forthright and open fashion.  No matter how small the risk, people should not continue to hear over the public airwaves, on a case by case or problem by problem basis, that they may have been infected.  The proper way to do it is by way of a full risk assessment and I believe this House could appropriately seek an emergency debate with the Minister on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on waste management which is of major concern to both the Government and local authorities.  It is an issue which will be costly to address in the future.</P>
      <P>Given the British Prime Minister's comments last week that neither he nor his Government could be expected to be persuaders for a united Ireland, will the Leader consider having a debate very soon on Northern Ireland?  We have had such debates before and it would be greatly appreciated if we could have this one early in the new term.  I hope it would add to the ongoing debate on the most important issue facing our country.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader have a debate as early as possible in the new year on the most important issue in this country, Northern Ireland?   I raised this issue two weeks ago, but a new situation has developed over the weekend with the breakdown of progress in the talks and disturbances and riots in Derry.  It is a city we in the north-west cherish deeply and which has built itself up over the past number of years.  Marches are allowed through it on a regular basis, with three or four during the year, and a solution to the problem would be to stop all these marches immediately.  Will the Leader put the matter on the agenda for discussion as early as possible because it is a very important issue for the people of the north-west?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past number of years two Garda operations have been put in place: Operation Freeflow, which has been put in place again this year, and Operation Shannon.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform what is the up to date position on the latter?  It should be put in place over Christmas week and the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to examine the safety regulations applying to marine farming along the seas and the west coast in the interests of public safety?  The tragic death of a young man involved in this area occurred two days ago, so there is a need for the Department to apply strict safety codes to such operations. There has been loss of life over the years in this area and a little more care might be better in the long term.</P>

      <P>I remind the Leader he agreed that, in the pornography Bill, the infamous sex chat lines would be removed from major newspaper conglomerates who lecture us on propriety and who also publish the numbers of these lines. As the Fine Gael spokesperson on the family and the community, I am concerned about shops in this capital which are openly trading in hard core videos.  Is anyone capable of stopping this flood of filth?  Will the Leader refer the matter to the relevant Minister to see if action can be taken now to remove this material?  Three shops in one street are now openly trading in specially imported hard core videos.</P>

      <P>I will pass on Senator Norris's views and concerns to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Norris, Ross and Jackman requested a debate on the university panels, the various proposals for them and an overall review of the Seanad.  I will have a debate as early as possible in the next session to facilitate the Senators. <Col N="341" /> Senators Costello and Ó Murchú expressed sentiments on the retirement of Nelson Mandela as leader of the ANC.  I concur with their views and I will pass them on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs so that he may convey them to Mr. Mandela.</P>
    <P>I will arrange for a debate requested by Senator Costello on the task force on drugs.  That would be a worthwhile debate and, hopefully, we will have it in the second or third week of the next session. Senators Cox, Jackman and Ridge called for the introduction of the Child Pornography Bill. This Bill will be before the House in February.  It is long overdue and many calls have been made for it to be introduced in this session.</P>
    <P>I will agree to the calls from Senators Ryan and Walsh for a debate on waste.  If one of the groups wishes to introduce that Bill in Private Members' time in February I would be only too pleased to discuss it.  As a former member of the committee in charge of this issue in the last Government, I know it is a major problem for local authorities; it is far bigger and more costly than many people realise.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman called for a debate on IDA policy making and its past achievements.  I will liaise with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to see when this debate can be taken.  We will take it at the earliest opportunity. I note Senator Mooney's concerns and I am sure that you, a Chathaoirligh, will bear them in mind. Senator Gallagher called for a debate on health. I will contact the Minister's office to see how I can progress this request.</P>
    <P>Senators Walsh and Bonner called for a debate on Northern Ireland.  We have been keeping this matter under review and we will have such a debate at the earliest opportunity.  I deplore the events in Derry last weekend.  They do nothing but harm to the nation and that part of our country. It is not helpful to the peace talks.  I will contact the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform about points made by Senator Burke. Those Ministers are responsible for Operation Freeflow and Operation Shannon respectively. Both operations have been an enormous success and I concur with the Senator's wishes.</P>
    <P>Senator Chambers expressed concerns on marine safety codes.  I will pass on these views to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. Senator Ridge expressed concerns which I will pass on to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to see if anything can be done.  I will come back to the Senator at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

    <Title>Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this Bill is that in the tribunal of inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice McCracken, on 28 October 1997, two issues arose in relation to the matter of costs.  The first question was whether the tribunal had power, of its own motion, to order costs to be paid to persons before it by any other person; the second question was whether <Col N="343" /> the tribunal had power to award costs to itself against any person where the tribunal had incurred costs because of the non-co-operation of a person before it.</P>
      <P>Section 6(1) of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, gives a tribunal of inquiry power to order that the whole or part of the costs of any person appearing before it be paid to that person by any other person named in the order, including the Minister for Finance.  The tribunal must be of the opinion that, having regard to its findings and all other relevant matters, there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to make such order.  The costs which may be ordered are those as taxed by the Master of the High Court.</P>
      <P>Judge McCracken indicated that, on the basis of the provisions of section 6 of the 1979 Act, he was satisfied that the only persons who can get costs are those persons who have been given representation and are represented by solicitor or counsel before the tribunal.  He concluded that he had no power to order a person to pay the cost of any of the tribunal's expenses as such under the Act of 1979.</P>
      <P>The solicitor on behalf of the public interest before the tribunal had sought counsel's opinion in the matter and, on the basis of the advice that was given, decided not to proceed with an application to have any person pay some or all of the costs of the tribunal.  Judge McCracken indicated his concurrence with this approach.  It was also established in the McCracken tribunal that costs could only be awarded by the tribunal on the application of a person appearing before the tribunal and that in the absence of such an application the tribunal had no power of its own motion to award costs to any person.</P>
      <P>The Bill takes those findings in the McCracken tribunal into account and strengthens the power of tribunals of inquiry in relation to costs.  In framing the Bill, I have also taken into account that two important tribunals, one under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Moriarty and the other under Mr. Justice Flood, have recently been established under resolution of both Houses and the orders governing the work of both those tribunals include reference to the desire of the Oireachtas that:</P>
      <P>all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the inquiry should, as far as is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals.</P>
      <P>The Bill also amends and significantly strengthens the power of a tribunal of inquiry to have its orders enforced and it provides for immunity from suit of persons who supply written statements or documents to such a tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the main provisions in the Bill. These are section 2, which deals with the certain immunities I have mentioned, section 3, which deals with the matters in relation to costs, and <Col N="344" /> section 4 which deals with the enforcement generally of orders made by a tribunal.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands in section 1(3) of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, a witness before a tribunal is entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court.  However, the Act makes no reference to the position of persons who produce or send documents to a tribunal pursuant to an order of the tribunal.  I am, therefore, proposing in section 2 of the Bill to amend section 1 of the Act of 1921 by the insertion of a new subsection (4) which provides that a person who produces or sends a document to a tribunal pursuant to an order of that tribunal shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill substitutes a new subsection (1) in section 6 of the 1979 Act in relation to costs.  The new subsection repeats the substance of the existing subsection but provides, in addition, that a tribunal may recover its own expenses and, in making such order, may take into account the terms of the resolution passed by both Houses relating to the establishment of the tribunal or any failure to co-operate with or provide assistance to it, or knowingly to give false or misleading information to the tribunal.  I have provided also that the tribunal may, of its own motion, order that the costs of any person coming before it be paid by any other person named in the order.  Section 3 will apply to costs incurred after the Bill comes into effect.  The section 3 provisions will, therefore, apply to both the Moriarty and Flood tribunals as soon as the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is designed to strengthen the position of tribunals of inquiry to ensure that their orders can be enforced.  The section provides that where a person fails or refuses to comply with, or disobeys, an order of a tribunal of inquiry, the High Court may, on application to it in a summary manner in that regard by the tribunal, order the person to comply with the order and to make such other order as it considers necessary and just to enable the order to have full effect.  In framing section 4, I have taken into account section 3 of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, which provides that where a person disobeys a direction of a committee, the committee may seek an order of the High Court to have the direction met.  Section 4 is a significant advance on the current law in that a tribunal may itself apply to the High Court to have its orders enforced.  The current law does not enable a tribunal to apply direct to the High Court in that way.  It merely provides that the actions of a person before a tribunal may constitute an offence.  The prosecution of that offence may result in delay for a tribunal.  Section 4 as now framed will obviate unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill is confined to amending the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts of 1921 and 1979.  The provisions are mainly technical but nonetheless they are an important development <Col N="345" /> of the law in relation to tribunals of inquiry at this time.  I thank Senators for agreeing to take all Stages of the Bill today so that it can proceed expeditiously onto the Statute Book.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This side welcomes the Bill.  Its purpose is to close off a loophole which was uncovered by the recent McCracken tribunal when an aspect gave rise to enormous costs on the part of the tribunal in terms of its investigation, but it had no power to levy those costs against the person involved.  My regret about the Bill is that it will not apply retrospectively and the person who committed that offence at the McCracken tribunal will get off scot-free.</P>
      <P>Taxpayers will have to pick up the tab for the costs involved in the tribunal team having to travel to the Cayman Islands, London and elsewhere to investigate accounts, particularly the Ansbacher account, to follow Mr. Haughey's notorious money trail.  This was a result of his lack of co-operation and denials of having ever received the funds which were placed in the accounts for his benefit.  The tribunal was forced to expend an enormous amount of time and travel great distances to investigate the matter.  If the Minister has the figure, I ask him to tell the House the exact cost to the tribunal of undertaking those tasks and that travel.  The Minister and his officials are shaking their heads, but that is not good enough.  The House and the public are entitled to know the amount of money the tribunal had to expend.  This amount must be voted by the Houses of the Oireachtas and will be paid ultimately by taxpayers.  It is in the public interest to know exactly what is involved.  It is a pity that this legislation is not retrospective.  Then those who caused this problem could have the costs levied against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law covering tribunals of inquiry stems from a Westminster Act of 1921 and the Tribunal of Inquiry (Amendment) Act, 1979.  Experience has shown us that we need to look closely at section 5 of the 1979 Act, which gives immunity to those giving evidence to such a tribunal.  It is like the Fifth Amendment to the American Constitution, which allows one the freedom not to incriminate oneself.  Evidence given by a person to a tribunal of inquiry cannot be used in criminal proceedings against that person.  Serious evidence of criminal activity was heard at the beef tribunal. There were huge breaches of EU and Department of Agriculture regulations as well as tax evasion.  That was proven at the beef tribunal, yet because of section 5 of the 1979 Act it could be used to bring Mr. Larry Goodman and his cohorts to justice.  There was serious public disquiet about that matter, as people could not understand that this hugely expensive inquiry brought forward clear evidence of wrongdoing and crime, yet nobody was brought to book, apart from some minor protagonists in Mr. Goodman's meat factories. Those persons were found guilty of breaches of the animal disease regulations or <Col N="346" /> other minor offences.  None of the main protagonists were brought to book.</P>
    <P>I recognise people's civil right not to incriminate themselves.  Nevertheless, this matter must be looked at very closely.  I will seek to amend this legislation on Committee Stage in order that this problem can be addressed, and I hope the Minister will be sympathetic to my amendments.</P>
    <P>This sordid affair arises from Mr. Haughey's lack of co-operation with the McCracken tribunal. He repeatedly denied that he received funds from Mr. Dunne, although Mr. Dunne told the tribunal in evidence that he had paid £1.3 million to Mr. Haughey in three instalments.  Mr. Haughey denied this and refused to co-operate with the tribunal, trying to suggest that Mr. Dunne was not of sound mind.  Finally, Mr. Haughey tried to subvert and overthrow Mr. Justice McCracken and his tribunal by attempting to show that Mr. Justice McCracken was guilty of a conflict of interest as he had, while a barrister, acted for another party involved in the tribunal. That was like the last throw of a scoundrel.</P>
    <P>Out of all of that we have come to this sorry pass.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government because this is not what might have happened in times past.  A serious loophole in terms of the cost of the tribunal &mdash; costs caused by the lack of co-operation of one the chief actors in the Tribunal &mdash; has been closed under this legislation. I congratulate the Minister on that.  I am delighted to hear his assurance that this legislation will apply to the Moriarty and Flood Tribunals. Nevertheless, there remain unanswered questions about the Ansbacher accounts in the Guinness &amp; Mahon bank.  The Government decided that the tribunal would not investigate the legal standing of the ownership of those accounts.</P>
    <P>I read recently a series of articles by Denis Coghlan on this issue.  It would appear that, arising from comments in the McCracken Report, the Minister for Finance sought a report from the Central Bank on possible breaches of exchange controls in the operation of the Ansbacher accounts in the Guinness &amp; Mahon bank.  The terms of reference of the Moriarty Tribunal, which is about to sit, require it to make broad recommendations for enhancing the role of the Central Bank as the regulator of the commercial banks and of the financial services in general. What exactly does this mean?  If the Moriarty Tribunal is to have any effect it must be able to examine the way in which the Central Bank operates its regulatory controls.  It must be able to look at the way the Central Bank related itself to Guinness &amp; Mahon and, in particular, to the Ansbacher accounts.  The Central Bank has an overseeing and regulatory role in the financial sector.  Every bank must report to the Central Bank as to the conduct of its affairs on at least an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has very wide powers to look into the affairs of any bank.  It must have had sight of the Ansbacher accounts in Guinness &amp; <Col N="347" /> Mahon if it was exercising its proper regulatory function.  Did the Central Bank uncover any breaches of exchange control regulations?  Some years ago it was forbidden to export money without the permission of the Central Bank.  This was, clearly, happening on a regular basis in the case of the Ansbacher accounts.  Did the Central Bank find any breach of exchange control regulations?   Did it report them to the Minister for Finance?   Can this House and the public be told of the relationship between the Central Bank, Guinness &amp; Mahon and the Ansbacher accounts?  Central Bank regulations lay down that no more than 15 per cent of its deposits can constitute the liabilities of any bank yet the auditor for Guinness &amp; Mahon, in 1989 when this account was particularly active and Mr. Traynor was in control of it, was alarmed to note that the Ansbacher account constituted 35 per cent of the value of the deposits at Guinness &amp; Mahon, in other words it constituted 35 per cent of its liabilities.  That was a serious breach &mdash; by more than 20 per cent &mdash; of the regulation of 15 per cent laid down by law and which must be operated by the Central Bank in its role as overall supervisor of the commercial banking sector.</P>
    <P>It may be some time before either House revisits tribunals of inquiry legislation.  The base legislation was enacted in 1921 and was not amended until 1979; 19 years later it is being amended again.  Everything should be done to make the legislation as comprehensive and relevant as possible to the needs of today.</P>
    <P>In view of this, it is a pity that the beef tribunal cannot be revisited.  There continues to be disquiet at the enormous cost &mdash; between £35 million and £38 million &mdash; of that tribunal and at all the wrongdoing which was uncovered going unpunished.  The Minister should amend this legislation to provide that the costs of that tribunal are levied against those whose actions necessitated its establishment.  It was disgraceful that Mr. Larry Goodman was not only awarded his legal costs but was also awarded his costs for consultants, for paying spin doctors to put a spin on the version of the story he wanted the public to hear.  It is a pity that this legislation does not provide that the funding that had to be disbursed would be reimbursed to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I was present when the Dáil debated the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry. The Minister was one of the most aggressive defenders of the then Government.  While he was not Minister for Justice at the time he attempted to justify what had been uncovered by the tribunal. I invite him to comment and, now that he is Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to revise some of his remarks on that occasion. In the Official Report, September 1994, vol.  445, column 800 he stated:</P>
    <P>The late 1980s will go down in Irish political history for one remarkable reason.  It was the time of the business scandals when politicians came into this House and did everything they <Col N="348" /> possibly could to ascribe the scandals in the business world to the then Leader of Fianna Fáil, Charles Haughey.  It mattered little that he had no involvement in Telecom Éireann, Greencore or the other events of that time which indeed, subsequent inquiries established. All that really mattered was that it was imperative to bring him down and in doing so it was possible to damage Fianna Fáil as much as possible.  Allegations became the order of the day, innuendo was the way to proceed, rumour became fact and misrepresentation and character assassination was the way to proceed with political life in this country.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister would not say that today.  I know we all have the benefit of hindsight but the Minister should comment on that broad, veiled defence of what the beef tribunal uncovered about Mr. Haughey.  He tried to put the sole blame on Members of the Opposition for making wild accusations and spreading innuendo without addressing the issues raised by Mr. Justice Hamilton, although we now know that report was not the best in the world.  On that day the Minister and the present Minister for Health, Deputy Cowen, were the most aggressive defenders of what had taken place.  Note should be taken of that in this debate.</P>
    <P>We welcome this necessary legislation which will govern tribunals of inquiry.  We have had a number of such tribunals in recent years and we have learned something from each of them. Regrettably, there is no doubt we will have many more tribunals of inquiry into other scandals and issues of public concern where the courts and these Houses cannot get at the truth.  It is important to equip such tribunals with the wherewithal to comprehensively and properly carry out their inquiries.  It is also important that the costs which arise out of the non co-operation of any witness are levied against that person and that the full rigours of the law should be applied to people who breach the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on his courage and commitment in bringing this legislation before the House. There are three main planks in the Bill: the immunity of witnesses and those who provide statements before the tribunal; the issue of costs, which my colleague on the other side addressed in some detail; and the question of enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time I have been critical of the overall benefit of tribunals.  One of our first major tribunals occurred as a result of an incident near my home town, the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster in Bantry Bay on 8 January 1979, in which 50 lives, seven locals and 43 French sailors, were lost as the result of a tanker explosion.  That tribunal cost the State about £2 million.  I concur with my colleague in this regard in that the main culprit was the company, Gulf Oil/Chevron, which was running the storage depot and port facilities at Whiddy; it was not held responsible and the taxpayer bore the brunt of the cost of the inquiry. <Col N="349" /> Judge Costello who chaired that inquiry produced a voluminous and detailed report after several months and many hearings in west Cork, Bantry and Dublin.  Regrettably, most of the recommendations of that report have never been implemented.  The oil storage depot in Bantry was somewhat mothballed for a while but was subsequently reactivated.</P>
    <P>The next major tribunal was the Stardust tribunal, which also arose out an incident in which there was huge loss of life.  It was probably the tribunal with the greatest impact and results relative to the amount of money spent on it.  As a result, every fire officer was instructed to ensure that public places such as cinemas, public houses and hotels were made safe.  It was regrettable that it took the Stardust disaster to bring about this approach but that tribunal gave an important return to the citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connor referred in great detail to the Goodman tribunal.  Several years ago I said on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; that the cost of that tribunal to the taxpayer would be in the region of £40 million to £45 million.  He said to me that he thought £3 million or £4 million would cover the cost.  We now know that the direct cost to the taxpayer was in the region of £50 million.  The indirect cost to the beef industry ran to billions of pounds.  I am not defending Larry Goodman or any of his agents or employees, but that tribunal was unsuccessful.  All the costs were met by the taxpayer and those who were found guilty did not have to pay anything.</P>
    <P>In my view, not as a party politician but as a lawyer, there should be another method to investigate such matters which would be as effective as tribunals but much less costly to taxpayers.  In other jurisdictions a senior inspector is given strong powers to investigate such allegations.  It might be possible to second a High Court judge to such a role.</P>
    <P>In any of the tribunals since the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster, a select set of lawyers &mdash; although I might be condemning my own profession in this regard - almost became millionaires.  The Whiddy and Goodman tribunals certainly did not have the desired effect.  It remains to be seen whether the two current tribunals, in relation to which the Minister had the courage to introduce these amendments, will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers need to know how their money is spent.  I am not defending the wrongdoings which emerged in some tribunals.  A huge amount of money was badly spent at the Goodman tribunal. There were also indirect losses as a result of damage to the beef industry.  An inspectorate could be set up by the European Commission which could carry out an independent, less costly and successful examination.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the point raised by Senator Connor on immunity for those who give evidence to a tribunal of inquiry.  The system of immunity has worked invaluably to the benefit of justice, fair play and equity.  We are giving powers to tribunals of inquiry that already exist in the High <Col N="350" /> Court.  The established doctrine of vicarious responsibility gives immunity to an employee, agent or servant of a particular person.  In the case of the Goodman tribunal, as mentioned by Senator Connor, there would be major conflict if employees, agents and servants of the company were compelled to give evidence under this doctrine. That is why the provision of immunity is important and welcome and should be included in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, I could envisage a difficulty where servants, agents or civil servants who could make a valuable factual and honest contribution by making a statement or giving <i>viva voce</i> evidence before a tribunal are not protected.  These people need and deserve protection, unlike the main players.  There should be immunity for those who are compelled to come before a tribunal and are forced to make a statement and give facts about bank accounts, etc.  If there was no provision of immunity there would be difficulty getting people to give evidence.</P>
    <P>Another central feature of this legislation is the question of costs.  I compliment Deputy Quinn, the Leader of the Labour Party, who made a special contribution in this regard.  This is the most important aspect of this legislation.  Up to now, any tribunal of inquiry was unable to award costs against someone who caused delay or obstruction in the setting up of the tribunal.  This was a serious defect in the legislation.  Senator Connor asked whether this provision could be made retrospective.  There would be major constitutional difficulty in doing this.  However, the Minister, the Government and the Taoiseach acted quickly and responsibly in ensuring the implementation of this legislation.  I am glad my colleagues in Opposition accept the thrust of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the legislation is enforcement. There is no point in the chairman of a tribunal awarding costs against someone if the decision cannot be enforced.  The new provision under section 4 enables the tribunal to seek an order from the High Court if there is a problem with enforcement.  This is an important facet of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this legislation so quickly.  I compliment the Opposition for consenting to deal with it expeditiously as there are two outstanding tribunals.  It is important legislation but I have misgivings about the economic benefits of tribunals.  Given the spiralling costs of tribunals, an alternative method should be looked at.  If one asks Joe Soap about this matter he will say the greatest benefactors of the tribunals are lawyers.  There is much apathy towards, and criticism of, the value of tribunals.</P>
    <P>The only tribunal which had a successful conclusion was that on the Stardust disaster.  As a result, every public house, dance hall and cinema improved their fire exits and made their premises safer for the public to visit.  This was an indirect benefit of that disaster.  We should distinguish between tribunals dealing with disasters such as <Col N="351" /> the Whiddy Island and Stardust disasters where 50 and 27 lives, respectively, were lost and those dealing with other matters.  In these human tragedies, the public, whether in Dublin or West Cork, demanded answers.  In the Whiddy Island disaster tribunal which I attended, despite several months work and a report by Mr. Justice Costello, very few of the recommendations were implemented and despite speculation, the true cause of that disaster in Bantry Bay on 8 January 1979 was never ascertained.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and trust my colleagues will see the importance of its implementation as soon as possible due to the two tribunals which must sit soon.  I welcome the provisions on immunity, costs and the enforcement of any decision of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned to me today that so far in this term the Government has introduced 26 or 27 legislative measures which is tremendous work by this Minister.  This should be compared to the first term of the previous Government when nine legislative measures were introduced.  The Minister dealt with four Bills last week which were initiated in this House.  As Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I hope he takes it easier in the new year because I am worked off my feet.  He is working to a Government and personal agenda to introduce a great deal of legislation and this is welcome.  Hitherto, this House has been neglected.  As late as today, the Taoiseach told our group he welcomed this initiative and would like to see more legislation initiated in this House in the future.  We have an important role to play and should not play it down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short practical Bill that refines the focus of tribunals, which is welcome. It was introduced in a short practical speech by the Minister.  I also intend to be brief because I do not need to go further than the few pages the Minister read into the record.  The Bill clearly refines the focus and meets some of the concerns expressed during the tribunal.</P>
      <P>While I listened to the debate on the monitor, I noticed an opportunity was taken to attack a former politician who has recently been in difficulty. I am not sure this was the appropriate place to do so.  If there is a tribunal of inquiry investigating the practices of that person or any other named individual, that is the place in which to do so.  It is a pity that the Houses of the Oireachtas should be so adversarial and that anybody should seek to score advantage from the discomfiture of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians are unique among the professions. We will not find lawyers attacking each other. There is good reason the public should be a little sceptical of the legal profession.  Enormous costs are placed on the backs of taxpayers by the legal profession whose eyes light up with any possibility of a tribunal and a little bit of compensation <Col N="352" /> which might spread through the total deafness of the entire Army, Navy and Air Corps.</P>
    <P>In the old days the legal profession pretended to be gentlemanly and it was not regarded as such to tout for business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Senator is; he is almost too gentlemanly.  When I made a scrotum of myself on today's Order of Business &mdash; I refuse to employ the other word &mdash; had I said &ldquo;bags&rdquo;, people would have noted that bags occasionally contain balls as well so I would have been in considerably worse trouble.</P>
      <P>The serious question is the iniquitous costs borne by the taxpayer.  I remember a Member of this House, who is a distinguished financial journalist, raised this question in a newspaper and referred to a person who claimed for every day, including Christmas Day, and used the word &ldquo;buccaneering&rdquo;.  I believe the person concerned got £0.5 million, £1 million or some vast amount of money &mdash; I cannot count beyond 20 so it is a mystery to me &mdash; and promptly sued the newspaper for libel and got another £70,000 tax free. We should bear this in mind.  We will not find lawyers attacking each other and will rarely find doctors doing so.  However, we find politicians trashing each other at every available opportunity. This is terribly dangerous because it invites the contempt of the public in which I regret the noble and honourable profession of politics is held.  It will be a pity if there are too many of these attacks.</P>
      <P>I am glad the costs which are ordered are those as taxed by the Taxing Master of the High Court. Traditionally, honourable people have been in this role.  Does the Minister believe it is a little unusual to have a member of the legal profession deciding on what is appropriate?  Would it be better to remove this and have an independent person look at this matter to let us know if we are getting good value for money, for example?  One person had a bill taxed and reduced from £30,000 to £15,000.  Obviously, people will chance their arm if we put in a fee on the basis that it will be reduced.  People are worried about expenses.  It would be unfortunate if the public was induced to believe that tribunals were a bad idea because of the unnecessary expense involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted that some of my colleagues mentioned the question of expenses and suggested, for example, that the beef tribunal was a waste of money.  If it was a waste of money, it was that the Houses of the Oireachtas, in framing the terms of reference of the tribunal, were perhaps less exact than they should have been.  Many will have noticed that Mr. Goodman, whose operation was found to be in default by the tribunal on a number of occasions, was able to claim back taxpayers' money on behalf of that operation.  It would seem quite absurd to people that somebody could claim expenses for having been found guilty.  As a lay person I may have oversimplified <Col N="353" /> this and if so, I apologise.  I speak about the public perception as well as everything else.</P>
    <P>We are also dealing with the question of immunity from suit of persons who supply written statements or documents to such a tribunal and, specifically, people who produce such documents pursuant to an order of the tribunal.  It is perfectly reasonable that if a tribunal orders a person to produce a document they should be immune because they have been instructed to do so.  It would be monstrous to penalise somebody for doing what they were told by a respected legal institution of the State.  My only concern about immunity is that persons sometimes make allegations or statements for a variety of reasons which require a defence by a third party.  This happens in other areas.  I know of situations where people have had to go to court to defend themselves and who have engaged in considerable outlay to do so.  Immunity from libel must be matched by the other power in the Bill to direct the State or a witness to pay the costs of a third party.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the opportunity to talk about the question of tax costs, which the Minister might bear in mind.  A matter that those of us who are addicted to litigation and who are naturally litigious run up against is the difference between costs where one may get an award for costs but may face a bill because the person acting on one's behalf believes they would have got more if one was paying them privately as a client. The Minister should do something about that phrase contained in the Bill.  If the State believes costs as taxed by the Taxing Master are appropriate, they should stand as such and should be held to be enough for the legal person involved.  It is wrong that costs should be awarded and then usually about 35 per cent is added on because the amount for which the taxpayer is held liable is not considered enough by the legal person involved.  I welcome the Bill which will make tribunals more efficient.  We have seen this happen, particularly with the McCracken tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and appreciate the time he is spending in the House. I welcome the fact he has largely taken on board what was a Labour Party move to close off a loophole identified during the operations of the McCracken tribunal.  This Bill is a replica of one produced by my party so I naturally welcome it and thank the Minister for accepting it.</P>
      <P>As others have outlined, the Bill builds on and updates the law on tribunals.  The last two decades appear to have been the era of tribunals. When we find it necessary to strengthen the law, it is our duty as legislators to do so.  Tribunals in the past did not have to deal with the complex relationships between financial institutions, money trails, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary for our democracy to have a mechanism whereby matters of major public interest and concern and which directly relate to the working of our democracy are investigated in <Col N="354" /> a public and thorough manner and that subsequent reports are presented in a particular light. The House discussed the report of the McCracken tribunal, with almost every speaker congratulating its author for its clarity and brevity. However, there are more tribunals, and the Moriarty tribunal is starting its work in the near future.</P>
    <P>This is a clear and constructive Bill.  My party will be tabling a few amendments designed to strengthen its provisions and ensure a number of matters of public concern are dealt with, in particular the workings of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>We seem to be living in an era of tribunals, something that may appear strange to the public. However, tribunals are an essential part of modernising our democracy and the reforms initiated in the last number of years, many at the behest of my colleagues who were Ministers in the previous Government, including the ethics in public office and freedom of information legislation and the electoral Acts which continue to be developed. We are opening our democracy and changing the relationship between the public and the Oireachtas in a manner which brings us into line with a modern European style.  This is to be welcomed. There will be hiccups along the way but we need to change our culture.</P>
    <P>The resistance of and concerns expressed by Members when the Ethics in Public Office Act was passing through the House and on occasion the fears expressed by public representatives regarding the implications of publicly declaring their interests, are symptoms of the changes necessary in our political thinking and culture which defines the relationship between public representatives and the public.  We are here to serve the public, not ourselves, and we must have a basic recognition of this fact in modernising our democracy.</P>
    <P>There must also be a basic recognition of the need for accountability, openness and transparency, matters which are at the heart of a democracy which functions well and which commands the respect of the people it attempts to serve.  The current phase we are passing through, which may last for 20 years and which necessitates tribunals of inquiry, will help build a democracy which is solid in its foundations and which is marked by good relationships between Members of the Oireachtas and the public we serve.  It will also result in a democracy in which our institutions work well; where openness, accountability and transparency are taken for granted and where the institutions of State, including the Civil Service and the public service, serve the public rather than themselves.</P>
    <P>It might take ten years before the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, which apply from next April, are fully operational, but I welcome the changes.  I also welcome the tribunals, painful as they have been and will continue to be, because they open facets of our democracy and its workings to the public and expose to public <Col N="355" /> view matters which should be in the public domain.  Such matters include the manner in which the Central Bank has conducted its public duty and how the Revenue Commissioners have served the public and conducted their statutory duties given it by the Oireachtas.  If tribunals discover that such institutions have not performed appropriately on behalf of the public and subsequently correct the problems, they will have done a good day's work.  The McCracken tribunal, in particular, did a good day's work and I look forward to the Moriarty tribunal conducting itself in a similarly concise and efficient manner, communicating with the public it serves in a comprehensible way.</P>
    <P>We are seeing a chapter of unfinished business in the necessary growing up of our democracy but we still have a long way to go in this regard. Specifically, there is unfinished business in relation to the McCracken tribunal concerning the Ansbacher accounts, which will be taken up by the Moriarty tribunal.  The McCracken tribunal identified £38 million held in the Guinness &amp; Mahon bank, ownership of which has only been partly ascribed.</P>
    <P>There is a huge resistance at political, and not just Government, level to examining the Ansbacher accounts.  The longer that resistance continues the greater will be the public demand to know what is in those accounts.  It might take ten years &mdash; I hope it does not take so long &mdash; but the public will find out.  I am convinced that the day will come when the full details of the Ansbacher accounts will come into the public domain because there is a huge demand among the public to know the circumstances in which the Ansbacher accounts were established.  We are foolish if we try to resist the irresistible.  The information must come into the public domain and those who resist such a move will not be thanked.</P>
    <P>There is other unfinished business regarding the operation of the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank with which the Moriarty tribunal will deal.  Yesterday's editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> referred to the Dáil debate on this legislation correctly pointing out that that debate and the Government's response have done nothing to reassure the public in relation to its concerns about the role of the Central Bank in the Ansbacher accounts and the enforcement of exchange controls.  Institutions such as the Central Bank have a responsibility to enforce the laws passed by these Houses.  <i>The Irish Times</i> in its editorial pointed out that last month's response from the Central Bank to the Minister for Finance, who rightly expressed his concern that the bank may have failed in its supervisory role, was dismal.  I do not know how long this situation will continue but the Central Bank must be under no illusion.  The public will not tolerate an institution such as this failing to carry out its statutory functions given it in the public interest and will not accept excuses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> I have no doubt we will be returning to this unfinished business.  This legislation concerns unfinished business in relation to the McCracken tribunal.  The era of tribunals will continue into the next century as long as the Ansbacher accounts, the role of the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners and other matters hang like clouds over the political system.  If that is how it must be, so be it.  The emergence of the truth is ultimately unstoppable.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and look forward to Committee Stage.  We have tabled some amendments in which we are attempting to strengthen and improve the provisions of the Bill and ensure that future tribunals of inquiry have the necessary powers to do the work required of them in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this debate.  I appreciate their comments and their general welcome for the legislation.</P>
      <P>I indicated at the outset that this Bill concerned strengthening the powers of tribunals of inquiry. Its purpose is threefold.  First, it provides for immunity from suit of persons who supply written statements or documentation to a tribunal. Second, it provides that a tribunal may order the costs incurred by it to be paid by any person named in the order and that a tribunal may, of its own motion, order the costs of any person appearing before it to be paid by any person named in the order.  Third, it gives powers to a tribunal to apply to the High Court to have its orders enforced.</P>
      <P>This Bill is just one of a number of measures which the Government is taking on foot of the findings of the McCracken tribunal.  The Government is also giving consideration to extending the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to include the functions of monitoring and investigating possible breaches of the Ethics in Public Office Act.  This would involve extending his powers to enable him to carry out investigations by making certain forms of orders, such as orders for the discovery of documents and possibly by allowing him to have recourse to the courts to seek letters of requests to courts in other jurisdictions to enable witnesses to be examined or documents to be produced in such jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is examining the recommendations concerning the extension of the powers of the Ombudsman to carry out investigations for breaches of ethics in public office.  Government considerations will include reconciling the tribunal recommendation with the recommendation of the all party committee on the Constitution in relation to the establishment of an electoral and ethics commission.  As the all party committee states in its first report, a single commission, incorporating the public offices commission, the constituency commission and the proposed independent referendum commission, under the Constitution would guarantee the independence and <Col N="357" /> impartiality of the commission.  It would generate greater confidence in public life, create greater transparency in public institutions and provide an independent source of advice and information in the areas of ethics in public life and electoral law reform.</P>
    <P>On the question of making it mandatory for any candidate for either House of the Oireachtas to produce a tax inspector's certificate to the Clerk of the Dáil or the Seanad to the effect that his or her tax affairs are in order and are accompanied by a statutory declaration to that effect, the Government's action programme outlines its support for such a proposal and the matter is currently being examined.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised about the Government's commitment to the introduction of legislation which would provide that any person found guilty of an offence under the Ethics in Public Office Act would be ineligible to become a Member of either House in the future either for a limited period or permanently.  The necessary amendments to the Ethics in Public Office Act which would implement the McCracken tribunal's recommendation in regard to the creation of a criminal offence for breaches of the legislation and the consequent barring of a convicted person from standing for subsequent election are being prepared.</P>
    <P>Any decisions which will arise from Government consideration of these matters will not prevent existing authorities, such as the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Revenue Commissioners and the Comptroller and Auditor General, from exercising their statutory powers as they deem necessary.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has stated publicly that the proceedings of the tribunal had been monitored closely by the Revenue Commissioners and that all appropriate action would be taken.  The Minister for Finance has also indicated that any additional investigative powers required by the Revenue Commissioners can be introduced.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate certain matters were raised by Senator Connor and others.  I could, if I so wished, reply specifically to certain points made by the Senator but I consider it best not to do so at this stage.  The reason for this is that, as Senator Norris pointed out, investigation of certain matters which have arisen in recent times is clearly a matter for the established tribunals to investigate.  This is not the appropriate forum in which to do that.  The purpose of this particular legislation is quite specific and, accordingly, I do not want to reopen either the debate on the McCracken tribunal or to traverse well worn ground.  However, there are other matters which deserve an appropriate response in this House.</P>
    <P>The issue of the Ansbacher accounts was raised by a number of Senators, in particular by Senators Connor and O'Meara.  There has been a continuing debate on the Ansbacher accounts and the need to have them investigated.  It is <Col N="358" /> important to point out that Mr. Justice McCracken found that the Ansbacher accounts certainly did hold funds for the benefit of some Irish residents.  He also pointed to the fact &mdash; a fact which is often missed &mdash; that the holding of such accounts was not, of itself, <i>prima facie</i> evidence that any law had been broken.  A difficult legal question then arises which may not satisfy many; nonetheless, it is a question which legitimately arises.  On what basis could one establish a tribunal to inquire into a matter in respect of which there is no <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrongdoing?   That may be an unpalatable question for some but it is an extremely important legal question which must be asked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Mr. Justice McCracken did refer to the fact that the Ansbacher accounts, which have not, as yet, been investigated, could be used for tax evasion purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that there is a considerable amount of concern in relation to this matter and I want to make it clear that I share that concern.  However, that does not mask the fact that a very serious legal question must be faced.  I have outlined as best I could precisely what the question is although people may want to avoid it or may find it unpalatable.</P>
      <P>The issue of exchange controls was raised by Senators Connor and O'Meara.  A number of questions have arisen in relation to exchange controls arising out of the McCracken report itself. While I admit that these are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to deal with, I feel I should outline for Members the current position on this important matter.  On the publication of the McCracken tribunal report on 25 August 1997, the Department of Finance wrote to the Central Bank and asked it to instigate a detailed investigation of the issues raised by the references in the report to exchange controls and to report the outcome to it.  A response was received by the Department of Finance on Friday, 17 October 1997.  An addendum to this response was received by the Department on 23 October 1997.  The response and the addendum have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his consideration and any action he considers necessary.  These documents have also been referred to the Revenue Commissioners for investigation and any necessary action under the Customs and Taxes Acts.  The documents have also been referred to the tribunal of inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Moriarty.  Having consulted the Attorney General, the Minister for Finance has asked the Director of Public Prosecutions for his view as to whether communicating the response of the Central Bank and the addendum thereto to the Houses of the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> Oireachtas might prejudice consideration and possible prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In this respect a response is awaited from the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance also asked the Central Bank to clarify a number of matters included in the Central Bank response and the addendum thereto.  If the clarification from the bank provides additional relevant material in relation to possible exchange control breaches, the Minister will refer the material for consideration to the Director of Public Prosecutions and, if appropriate, to the Revenue Commissioners and to the Moriarty tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance also wrote separately to the Governor of the Central Bank regarding the general supervisory issues arising from the McCracken tribunal of inquiry.  He asked the Governor to report to him on these issues and, in particular, if the board of the bank is satisfied that the bank has the necessary legal powers for the effective execution of its regulatory role, that the procedures and practices necessary to effectively exercise these powers are in place and that these procedures and practices are being implemented effectively.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question on 19 November 1997, the Minister for Finance indicated that he had been advised that, while bank staff engaged in supervision are primarily concerned with prudential matters, there is no barrier on their reporting alleged breaches of exchange controls to their colleagues in the exchange control division of the bank.  However, I have been further advised that it is the recollection of officers in the two functions when exchange controls were in force that exchange control issues did not arise from banking supervision.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank &mdash; by virtue of section 31 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, replaced by section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, and subsequently amended by section 52 of the Central Bank Act, 1997 &mdash; is prohibited from disclosing information to the authorities.  The situation was modified by the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  This Act has placed an obligation on the bank to report to the Garda any suspicion of a criminal act, such as tax evasion or money laundering by a bank.</P>
    <P>To date the bank has had no occasion to make such a report to the Garda.  There is no authority for the Central Bank to report on matters to the Revenue Commissioners.  Given these circumstances, the Minister for Finance asked the Governor to report separately to him on the supervisory issues and, in particular, if the board of the bank is satisfied that the bank has the necessary legal powers for the effective execution of its regulatory role, that the procedures and practices necessary to effectively exercise these powers are in place and that these procedures and practices are being implemented effectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> A reply has been received from the Governor of the Central Bank which states, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>On the matter relating to the control and management of G &amp; M, there is no record in the bank that it was informed of the matters in the internal auditor's report carried out by Guinness, Mahon &amp; Company Limited on G &amp; M in Dublin in 1989.  It emerged in the Tribunal report that these matters related essentially to inadequate internal controls and possible exposure to fraud relating to a large percentage of G &amp; M's deposits.  There is no record that the Bank had discovered the system for operating the Ansbacher accounts during its inspections and review meetings.  Prior to publication of the Tribunal report, the Central Bank had no knowledge of the existence of the &ldquo;Ansbacher Deposits&rdquo; referred to during the Tribunal hearing or of the role played by G &amp; M in the management of those deposits.  I should stress that only in the 1990s has it become standard practice both in Ireland and elsewhere for supervisors to seek all material internal audit reports.</P>

      <P>The reply continues:</P>
      <P>Supervision has three main elements; authorisation of new entities; ongoing supervision of existing entities; and policy developments. Entities supervised by the bank are required to submit a regular flow of detailed financial data which represent the basis for assessment of institutions by the bank.  Regular reviews and on-site inspections of entities are also undertaken. The reviews are usually on a half-yearly basis.  There is a programme in place for the inspection of supervised entities on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the Board is satisfied with its legal powers which are generally adequate to enable the bank to discharge, satisfactorily, its statutory functions.</P>

      <P>The reply continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory position in Ireland follows mainstream European law in the area of prudential supervision and all EU Banking and Investment Directives have been transposed into Irish law and have been brought into force. In relation to credit institutions I would mention that the latest review of legislation was undertaken in 1996 and amendments to legislation were introduced in 1997 to take account of that review.  In relation to the supervision of investment intermediaries, the Bank is currently in negotiations with the Departments of Finance and of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with a view to amending the governing <Col N="361" /> legislation i.e. the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  Several of these amendments are necessary to facilitate the transfer earlier this year of supervisory responsibility for retail intermediaries from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the bank.  The Bank is anxious to take advantage of this amending legislation to put forward certain changes to the 1995 Act which would enhance its ongoing implementation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the supervision of recently transferred investment intermediaries I would like to take this opportunity to highlight what the Bank perceives as a distinct lack of compliance culture among the retail end of this sector. Significant efforts on the part of the Bank will be required to address this problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to supervisory procedures and practices, the Board keeps under review the Bank's supervisory practices and its approach to supervision.  It endeavours to ensure that these are in line with international best practice and are subject to continuous modernisation and adaptation to meet the needs of a changing global environment.</P>
    <P>I can also confirm that the Board is satisfied that the supervisory procedures and practices are being effectively implemented by the Bank. The Board is briefed on all matters of supervisory significance, on a monthly basis.  It receives a comprehensive report, on a half-yearly basis, on work undertaken over the previous six months and on significant issues outstanding or likely to arise in the future.  All significant proposals are subject to approval by the Board on a case by case basis &mdash; e.g. authorisation of banks, acquisition of/by banks and refusal to authorise investment intermediaries.  Papers on various topics relating to supervision are circulated regularly to the Board and a significant part of Board meetings is usually concerned with supervisory matters.</P>
    <P>That indicates the feeling of the bank in the matter as comprehensively as I can put it.</P>

      <P>The confusion was reflected in a portion of <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial to which Senator O'Meara referred.  It stated:</P>
      <P>Now the Central Bank Act may inhibit an in-depth investigation into how the operations of individual licensed banks were regulated, unless those bodies voluntarily agreed to such disclosures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> This is not, in fact, correct.  The Central Bank Act relates to the Central Bank.  In so far as banks generally are concerned, I wish it to be noted that, with regard to the disclosure of information, banks have no specific privilege and as such are required to comply with an order of a tribunal to disclose such information.  Failure to do so constitutes an offence.  The fact that a tribunal has such powers actually contributed to the McCracken tribunal.</P>
    <P>In so far as I could deal with the concerns of the Senators in relation to the matters raised, I have done so in as comprehensive a manner as I could.  It may be that some of the answers I have given are unpalatable.  Many of the matters raised concern me as much as they do Members. However, it is of considerable importance nonetheless that the facts as they exist and the law as it stands be put forward without fear or favour so that everyone knows the precise position and why it has been taken.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 18, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or request&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to assist the tribunal in its informal work.  All Members of the Oireachtas are aware that the Moriarty tribunal is at the stage of conducting informal work, such as sending out letters seeking information, etc.  I understand that before it reaches its public stage a tribunal carries out such informal work.  This amendment, which inserts the words &ldquo;or request&rdquo;, is designed to assist a tribunal in such work.  Under the Bill, persons who send or produce documents pursuant to an order of the tribunal are given the same immunity as witnesses before the High Court.  We suggest in this amendment that similar immunity should be extended to people who send documents to the tribunal arising from an informal request, presumably by way of a letter, phone call, etc.  The letters we received from the Moriarty tribunal in the past weeks would be an example.</P>

      <P>Section 2 provides that a person who produces or sends a document to the tribunal pursuant to an order of the tribunal shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges <Col N="363" /> as if he or she were a witness before the High Court.  It is proposed under Senator O'Meara's amendment that the words &ldquo;or request&rdquo; be inserted after &ldquo;order&rdquo; so that a person who produces or sends a document to a tribunal pursuant to an order or request of that tribunal shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court.  The amendment is only of a drafting nature. All directions by a tribunal to persons to furnish documents are on foot of an order of the tribunal.  In those circumstances, inclusion of the words &ldquo;or request&rdquo; is unnecessary.  I consulted the parliamentary draftsman on this amendment and he agrees it is unnecessary and that what the Senator seeks to do has already been achieved by the wording set out in the legislation.  In those circumstances, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1) Section 5 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, is hereby amended by the substitution for section 5 of the following section:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Where during the course of a Tribunal of Inquiry evidence is adduced of criminal activity such evidence shall be referred to in the Report of the Chairperson of the Tribunal and subsequently referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment as a continuation of my argument on Second Stage.  Evidence can be adduced or can be brought forward at a tribunal of inquiry which reveals criminal activity or a breach of the law.  I refer specifically to the beef tribunal where a range of infringements of EU regulations on beef intervention, a range of serious tax offences and a range of serious offences regarding the weight of consignments of beef for intervention or the open market were revealed, were not denied and were clearly proven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tribunal of inquiry is not a court of law, but these offences were established as having taken place and the people who committed them were identified.  Certain people were clearly responsible, including the head of one of the leading meat processing firms in this country, Mr. Larry Goodman.  Not one of these offences could be levelled against him in a court of law because no one had the responsibility to send these files to the Director of Public Prosecutions, to whatever <Col N="364" /> other appropriate public authority might handle further investigations or even to the Garda.</P>
    <P>I am attempting by way of this amendment to ensure that, if such evidence is brought forward in any future tribunal and it is clearly proven, it will be placed in the hands of an appropriate authority for further investigation.  If someone is guilty of a serious breach of the law, be it EU regulations, planning law or tax law, they should be brought to task and that is what I argue for in this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply that section 5 of the 1979 Act was inserted to protect people who come forward to give evidence at tribunals of inquiry and that it acts as an incentive to come forward.  It is difficult to argue against that. Everyone has a right to protect themselves from self-incrimination.  That is a recognised principle of law.  However, it is of far greater importance that, where criminality has been exposed, procedures are in place by which that can be pursued. I have no problem if the Minister wishes to protect section 5 of the 1979 Act, but only as long as he can assure me that such revelations of criminality can be reported to the appropriate authority and that someone has the responsibility to do so, even if it means the Minister tabling his own amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1921 Act had no provision corresponding to section 5 of the 1979 Act. Senator Connor is correct in pre-empting me by stating I would mention that section.  However, I am sure the Senator accepts that, in its absence, a witness would not have to give evidence to a tribunal of inquiry which implicated him or her in a criminal offence.  The Senator acknowledged it would seriously hinder a tribunal in its task of uncovering all the relevant facts.</P>
      <P>Section 5 effectively removes the possibility of such a serious hindrance by providing that a statement of admission made by a person before the tribunal shall not be admissible in evidence against them in any general proceedings other than those under the 1921 Act for giving false evidence to a tribunal.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I cannot support the Deputy's proposal is that it would seriously prevent a tribunal from carrying out its functions of inquiry.</P>
      <P>As regards the new proposed section, the question of whether there is sufficient evidence on which to bring a prosecution against any individual is clearly a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who is and must of necessity be independent in the exercise of his functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone would accept that it is not the function of a tribunal of inquiry to determine what does or does not constitute criminal activity.  Tribunals have always had the power to forward reports to the Director of Public Prosecutions. This has happened on a number of occasions. Deputy Connor is giving the impression that a matter cannot be referred to the DPP because the section is not law.  That is not correct.  A tribunal is at liberty to refer any report to the DPP.  What <Col N="365" /> it may not do is adjudicate on what does or does not constitute criminal activity.  It cannot assume any of the independent functions of the DPP.  It is a matter for the DPP to examine a report and assemble his own evidence on which to base a prosecution.</P>
    <P>The DPP can also examine the findings of any tribunal of inquiry independently, whether or not the tribunal refers it to him.  This amendment would compel a tribunal to report to the Director of Public Prosecutions where it finds clear evidence of criminal activity.  That is objectionable as it would require the tribunal to take a view as to what constitutes criminal activity.  That is not its function under law.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor would appreciate that section 1(2) of the Act of 1921, as amended by the Act of 1979, already provides that, if a person by act or omission obstructs or hinders the tribunal in the performance of its functions, that person shall be guilty of an offence.  Under those provisions, a tribunal has the power to send papers to the DPP when it considers that circumstances warrant such action.  Having regard to the peculiar and separate roles of a tribunal of inquiry and the DPP, and the fact that it is open to the DPP to take action on any tribunal report whether referred to him or not, the amendment is inappropriate and I am not in a position to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister's attitude.  He defeats his own arguments.  He stated that a tribunal may refer part of its report which refers to wrongdoing, irregularity or criminal activity to the Director of Public Prosecutions if it so wishes. I agree.  The Minister also stated that the DPP can take up an issue arising from a tribunal of inquiry of his own volition.  However, the Minister did not say so in the Dáil on 31 August 1994, but he will agree that disgraceful behaviour was revealed by the beef tribunal.  Huge scandals in meat factories robbed Irish and European taxpayers of millions of pounds.  However, no action was taken because the chairman of the tribunal had no legal obligation to report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The DPP did not bother to take the matter up either.</P>
      <P>The public cannot understand and is confused how this kind of wrongdoing was exposed and proven, not in a court of law but in procedures which are akin to a court of law, yet no action was taken.  I will do everything to assist the Minister to preserve section 5 of the 1979 Act. However, an obligation in law should be placed on the chairperson of a tribunal or the DPP that if wrongdoing is revealed as a result of a tribunal of inquiry, there is a responsibility to pursue that wrongdoer through the appropriate channels.  We are not saying that, because wrongdoing is alleged or revealed, it will necessarily be proven in court. That will be a matter for the courts.  This is why I must press this amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Connor makes an important point in relation to my earlier remarks <Col N="366" /> on public accountability.  If a tribunal exposes a breach of the law, it is not sufficient for law makers to say that is fine and we let the DPP take care of it.  The public wants tribunals to have a facility through which responsibility is clearly and publicly taken for the pursuance of a criminal matter.  It is up to us to use our creative minds to draft a proposal in that regard.  We must ensure that tribunals have the maximum level of public accountability at their disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Minister's comments.  Hitherto, tribunals have had powers to report or send files to the Director of Public Prosecutions. An example of this was the Whiddy tribunal where cases were initiated against certain witnesses who were accused of committing perjury. This was a serious matter involving the loss of 50 lives.  A tribunal of inquiry is not a court of law.</P>

      <P>We cannot cross that barrier. A tribunal is set up to inquire into matters, prepare a report and put it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It also has the right to send a report to the DPP.  We would tread on dangerous constitutional ground if we were to empower a tribunal to do X, Y and Z and give it the right to deem someone guilty of an offence.  Any person so accused has the right to a trial.</P>

As a result of this Bill, where a tribunal makes recommendations it will have the power to go to the High Court to ensure that those recommendations are enforced, particularly concerning costs. I accept the point being made by Senator Connor but this amendment would give the powers of a court of law to a tribunal; this was never envisaged.</P>

      <P>Senator Connor suggests that where a tribunal of inquiry learns there is <Col N="367" /> clear evidence of criminal activity, the evidence should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for investigation and appropriate action. The Senator, by using the phrase &ldquo;clear evidence&rdquo;, must mean the tribunal is of the view that there is sufficient evidence for a criminal action to be taken against an individual or individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with that proposition is that the question of whether there is sufficient evidence to lay charges against an individual is a reserved function of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <P>The tribunal has no role in deciding what does or does not constitute criminal activity.  The independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the preservation of that independence is of considerable importance in the context of democracy.  It would be deplorable to seek to transfer his functions in this fashion.  In addition, it could also be interpreted as a form of conviction before any charge is laid because a tribunal of inquiry is usually presided over by a judicial personage.</P>
      <P>The concept put forward by Senator Connor fails on a number of counts, not least of which is that the independent function of the Director of Public Prosecutions would be usurped if this amendment became law.  There are good reasons for ensuring that the Director of Public Prosecutions be responsible for deciding whether there is sufficient evidence in a given case.  The Director of Public Prosecutions can, of his own volition and without anybody referring a matter to his office, decide to investigate or examine a matter to see if there is sufficient evidence to bring a charge.  The tribunal can forward any report or findings to the Director of Public Prosecutions to enable him to decide whether prosecutions should or should not be brought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Senator came close to saying that the Director of Public Prosecutions by an act of omission was at fault with regard to the findings of the beef tribunal.  On reflection the Senator might decide this is an unwarranted criticism which does not stand up and should be withdrawn. The Director of Public Prosecutions exercises a function which is independent of the Oireachtas and is of considerable importance to <Col N="368" /> the proper functioning of the State.  It is regrettable that the Senator appears to denigrate it in this manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of denigrating the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Does the Minister condone the findings of wrongdoing in the beef tribunal report which went unpunished?  I can draw a clearer implication from the Minister's comments than the implication about the Director of Public Prosecutions which he tried to draw from my comments.  His comments imply that he condones the wrongdoing exposed in the beef tribunal.  Does he not agree that such wrongdoing should have been investigated by the proper authorities and that procedures should have been in place to ensure that happened?  The law did not oblige Mr. Justice Hamilton to carry out an investigation and the Director of Prosecutions, who may do so of his own volition, did not do it.</P>
      <P>Such a procedure must be in place.  Nothing disquieted the public more about the beef tribunal report than the fact that wrongdoing was revealed and proven by procedures similar to those used in court, yet the people concerned got off scot free.  In addition, the taxpayer was obliged to pay their legal and spin doctors' costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply expressing the concerns of the public.  This legislation is unlikely to come before the House again and I am seeking to put a simple procedure in place to provide that if wrongdoing is exposed it is somebody's responsibility to ensure it is investigated.  I am aware a tribunal of inquiry is not a court of law and that nobody can be found guilty by such a tribunal.  However, the chairman of each tribunal has been an eminent judge and such a person is well qualified to make an adjudication about what constitutes wrongdoing and whether a matter should be referred to the Garda Síochána or the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>There should be no misrepresentation of the content of this amendment.  This is an embarrassing issue for the Minister but he can escape his embarrassment by accepting the amendment.  We will co-operate in every way to preserve the integrity of section 5 of the 1979 Act, but we also wish to ensure that if wrongdoing of the type exposed in the beef tribunal is ever again exposed, it will not go unpunished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash; An application to the High Court by a tribunal pursuant to Article 28.4.3 of the Constitution shall be made in a summary manner, on notice to the Attorney General, every person represented before the tribunal pursuant to section 2(b) of the Principal Act appearing to the tribunal to have an interest in the application, and any other person specified by order of the High Court.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to set out a procedure which is not provided for in the Bill so that the tribunal can refer to the High Court issues relating to Cabinet confidentiality.  The recent amendment to the Constitution relating to Cabinet confidentiality allows a procedure whereby the High Court alone decides whether a tribunal can investigate a matter which would normally be covered by the very strict rules on Cabinet confidentiality.  Ironically, that arose from a Supreme Court ruling on a matter raised in the beef tribunal.  Now a tribunal can only look at a matter normally covered by Cabinet confidentiality if the High Court allows it to do so.  The procedure by which an application can be made to the High Court is not covered in the Bill, and this amendment allows for a simple procedure to be available to a tribunal to apply to the High Court to decide if Cabinet confidentiality could be set aside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment refers to the new Article 28.4.3º of the Constitution as accepted by the people in a recent referendum. The Article provides that the confidentiality of discussions at Government meetings shall be respected in all circumstances save only when the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in respect of a particular matter in the interests of the administration of justice by a court or by virtue of an overriding public interest pursuant to an application in that behalf by a tribunal. The tribunal must be one appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into a matter stated by them to be of public importance.</P>
      <P>The tribunals in question are covered by the tribunals of inquiry legislation of 1921 and 1979. This amendment does not attempt to change the law contained in Article 28.4.3º of the Constitution, and could not do so, because the relevant matter is a fundamental provision enshrined in our Constitution.  Neither does it attempt to change the substance of the law contained in the 1921 and 1979 Acts.  The amendment attempts to prescribe what form the applications from a tribunal should take when a tribunal applies to the High Court for disclosures by the Government of confidential Cabinet material.  The effect of the amendment would be to provide that where a tribunal makes such an application to the High Court, it would have to be on foot of a summary summons.  It might assist the House to outline the manner in which civil proceedings are commenced in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All civil proceedings, with the exception of petitions, commence in the High Court with either a plenary summons or special summons, all of which are provided for in the rules of the superior courts.  A plenary summons is used for cases requiring pleadings and oral evidence; a summary summons is used for proceedings to be heard on affidavit without pleadings and may, in certain circumstances, be supplemented by oral evidence. A special summons is used mainly for equity claims such as probate matters or the administration of trusts.  A summary summons procedure in the High Court is the exception rather than the rule.  Given the fundamental nature of applications from tribunals that would be in question, it would seem wrong in principle and practice to rule absolutely that all applications to the <Col N="371" /> High Court should be made in a summary manner.</P>
    <P>The experience may be that a good proportion of applications from tribunals should more appropriately be made on the more particularised basis provided for in the plenary or special summons. However, the range of matters which the Oireachtas may decide need to be inquired into by a tribunal may be quite extensive.  It is not possible to determine at any time what issues may be the subject of a tribunal of inquiry or in what circumstances it may be necessary for a tribunal to apply to the High Court for confidential Cabinet material to be disclosed.  To specify the form of applications now by way of legislation is not the best way to proceed.  The procedure that should apply before the High Court is in question, and legislation already empowers the various court rules committees to make rules in relation to pleadings, practice and procedure before the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must concur in the making of any such rules, and the rules for the purpose of applications to the courts under Article 28.4.3º would, therefore, be a matter for consideration by the superior courts rules committee.  Rules are not specially prescribed, allowing for procedure by summary or special summons.  Order 1, rule 6 of the rules of the superior court provides that in all proceedings, other than to take a minor into wardship, commenced by originating summons, procedure by plenary summons shall be obligatory. Last week the Minister undertook in the Dáil to write to the superior courts rules committee. He wishes to confirm that he has since asked the committee to consider whether rules of court should be made for the purposes of application under Article 28.4.3º. For those reasons, I am not in favour of the amendment and am unable to support it.</P>

    <P>(b) any other rule of law or provision of an enactment providing that such information may be required by a court only in connection with criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment.  It is made even more important by the response of the Minister, during the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill, to the concerns raised be me and other Senators about the operation of the Central Bank's statutory obligations in relation to the Guinness &amp; Mahon bank and specifically the Ansbacher account.  The Minister said that the McCracken Tribunal had reported that there was no <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrongdoing in relation to the Ansbacher account.  There is no doubt that a suspicion remains in the public domain and it is not sufficient for the Central Bank simply to wash its hand of its responsibility in relation to the operation of this account.  It is certainly not acceptable for the Minister for Finance to say that the matter is over and that is the end of it.  This is not the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to remove Central Bank immunity from disclosure of information. There is public concern because there is a suspicion in the minds of the public that the Ansbacher account has been used for tax evasion or for hiding money for some other reason.  Why was £38 million placed in these deposits &mdash; a secret account &mdash; when it could have been placed in any other bank?  The reason is very simple.  The money was placed in the Ansbacher account for purposes of secrecy.  This raises the question of why did the owners of this money want it kept secret?  The obvious answer is that it was done for tax avoidance purposes or because the money was the ill-gotten gains of criminal activity such as drug related activity.  This is a matter of public concern.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for the ring fencing of this account?  My concern is that some people want the Ansbacher accounts to remain secret because they fear that if such accounts are open to scrutiny millions of pounds will leave this country. This raises a very important question.  If opening such accounts to scrutiny causes money to leave the country what is such money doing in these accounts in the first place?  We are sending a signal that this country is a safe haven for ill-gotten gains or for those who wish to avoid their tax responsibilities on a huge scale.  This is the issue around the Ansbacher accounts and that is why the Minister's response to the Second Stage debate was so unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not taking into account the public interest with regard to these accounts, the function of the Central Bank and its statutory responsibility.  He seemed to suggest that there was no need to give the Central Bank any <Col N="373" /> additional powers to investigate suspicious activity with regard to this or other accounts. There obviously is a need to give the Central Bank more powers and to give a tribunal power to remove the Central Bank's immunity from disclosure of information.</P>
    <P>The issues of large secret deposits, tax avoidance and potential criminal activity have not been raised solely in the context of the McCracken ribunal.  They continue to be raised in the context of the Moriarty tribunal.  We do not know what disclosures might be made in that regard.  The level of information uncovered by the McCracken tribunal was breathtaking.  I would urge the Minister, in the public interest, to accept this amendment.  Since the publication of the McCracken report it has become more urgent that a tribunal of inquiry would have the power to remove Central Bank immunity from disclosure of information.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Meara.  I, too, during the debate on the Second Stage referred to the Central Bank and the outstanding question of the Ansbacher accounts.  The Minister read an inadequate, hand washing reply from the Governor of the Central Bank.  The letter excused the Central Bank of responsibility and then seemed to say that it did not have the authority to act in certain ways.  I have never seen such a handwashing exercise on behalf of the Governor of the Central Bank.  I take it that it was he who had written the letter in response to fairly innocent inquiries which the Minister for Finance had made of him.  I am not at all satisfied with this reply from the Governor of the Central Bank. The Central Bank has a regulatory and supervisory function with regard to all banks in the country, including Guinness &amp; Mahon.  At one time the Ansbacher accounts had £38 million in them although we can only account for the £1.3 million which was used to make a payment to Mr. Charles Haughey by a tortuous and circuitous route.  If the Central Bank was carrying out its duties, as it is statutorily bound to do, it would have seen, in the accounts of Guinness &amp; Mahon, the existence of the Ansbacher accounts.  They accounted for 35 per cent of the total deposits in the Guinness &amp; Mahon bank.  The law states that no depositor may account for more than 15 per cent of a bank's total deposits.  In other words, a bank's liability may be no more than 15 per cent to any one depositor.  If the Central Bank had been doing its work it would have seen this clear breach of the regulations.  The Minister, in his reply, said that the Central Bank would not have seen the report of the auditor.  Guinness &amp; Mahon's own auditor drew attention to these accounts in his report in 1989 and expressed his alarm at their existence and their overweening influence on the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will assure the House that somebody has asked the DPP if it is right for Members and the public to know the hoped for comprehensive response of the Central Bank to <Col N="374" /> these questions on its role with regard to Guinness &amp; Mahon, what it knew about the Ansbacher accounts and what it might have done. The Central Bank reports to the Minister for Finance. Perhaps it reported to the Minister subsequent to 1989.  We would like to know.</P>
    <P>The Minister's half hearted reply and his failure to assure the House that this information will become public worries me.  I support the amendment. If the Minister is unable to accept it then it should be put to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator O'Meara's opening remarks there are now two of us sorry that the Minister is not in the House.  The Central Bank is subject to strict confidentiality requirements. These are set out in section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, and subsequent amendments. Under pain of severe penalties no current or former Governor, director or officer of the bank may disclose information about the business of individual persons or entities to third parties other than in exceptional circumstances which are specified in legislation.  The exceptional circumstances, <i>inter alia,</i> allow for the provision of information as required by a court in connection with any criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Non disclosure requirements which attach to the Central Bank Acts are subject to the rider that disclosure is permissible to enable the bank to carry out its functions under the Central Bank Acts of 1942 and 1989.  The exceptional circumstances do not include proceedings before a tribunal because they are not, and cannot under the Constitution be, criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Irish law on confidentiality and financial supervision implements EU law which requires a high standard of professional secrecy for financial regulation.  This standard is set out in Article 12 of the first banking directive which provides that the member states shall provide that all persons working or who have worked for the competent authorities shall be bound by the obligation of professional secrecy.  This means that no confidential information which they may receive in the course of their duties may be divulged to any person or authority whatsoever except in summary or collective form such that individual institutions cannot be identified without prejudice to cases covered by criminal law.</P>
      <P>Section 16 of the 1989 Act implements the provisions of the first directive and places specific secrecy obligations on the staff of the Central Bank.  Subsection (2) provides, in line with the directive, for certain exceptions to the secrecy requirements such as information required by a court in connection with criminal proceedings or the communication of data to other banking supervisors in the EU who are similarly bound by the secrecy requirements of the directive.</P>
      <P>Section 16(1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who, at the commencement of this section is, or at any time thereafter is appointed, Governor or a Director, officer or servant of the Bank or who is employed by the <Col N="375" /> Bank in any other capacity, shall not disclose, during his term of office of employment or at any time thereafter, any information concerning&mdash;.</P>
    <P>(a) the business of any person or body (whether corporate or unincorporate) which came to his knowledge by virtue of his office or employment, or</P>
    <P>(b) the Bank's activities in respect of the protection of the integrity of the currency or the control of credit,</P>
    <P>unless such disclosure is to enable the Bank to carry out its functions under the <i>Central Bank Acts, 1942 to 1989,</i> or under any enactment amending those Acts.</P>
    <P>The relevant parts of section 16(2) state:</P>
    <P>(2) The provisions as to non-disclosure contained in subsection (1) shall not apply to any disclosure&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) required by a court in connection with any criminal proceedings,</P>
    <P>(b) made with the consent of the person to whom the information relates and, where not the same person, of the person from whom that information was obtained,</P>
    <P>Section 16 further provides that a person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable:</P>
    <P>(a) on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both, or</P>
    <P>(b) on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £25,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to both.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 purports to amend section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, so as to allow the bank to breach the strict code of confidentiality under which it must operate.  Even if the principle or policy of the amendment were acceptable, which it is not, it would have to fail being outside the scope of this Bill which, under its long title, is &ldquo;An Act to amend the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 and 1979.&rdquo;.  It is not a Bill to amend the Central Bank Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>The Department has consulted with the Department of Finance concerning the implications of the proposed amendment for the Central Bank and the Department of Finance has in turn consulted the Office of the Attorney General. The advice available to me is that it would not be possible to comply with paragraph (a) of the proposed amendment as to do so would entail a serious breach of EU law.  Article 12 of the first council directive on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions requires the State to ensure <Col N="376" /> that the Central Bank maintains strict confidentiality. The directive, while prescribing certain exceptions, does not permit the proceedings of a tribunal to come within the exceptions prescribed.</P>
    <P>The high standard of secrecy enshrined in the first directive provides a protection for privacy, balancing the very wide powers of inquiry which the bank must have to carry out its supervisory role.  This reflects the concern that the publicity or release of information obtained for prudential supervisory purposes might damage public confidence or inhibit exchanges of information between regulatory authorities.</P>
    <P>The amendment also purports to provide in paragraph (b) that a person can be required to disclose information to a tribunal notwithstanding any rule of law or enactment providing that such information may only be disclosed in connection with criminal proceedings.  If such a rule of law were to be overridden as suggested it would fly in the face of our EU obligations.</P>
    <P>The amendment demonstrates a lack of understanding of the role and function of tribunals and the law in relation to them.  A tribunal is an inquisitorial body; it is not a court of law and proceedings before a tribunal are not criminal.  Tribunals cannot impose penal sanctions.  In order for a tribunal to have a person before it comply with its order it would have to apply to the High Court for enforcement of its orders and where criminal proceedings before the courts are concerned, which arise out of proceedings before a tribunal, it is in those proceedings that disclosure of information by banks may arise.</P>
    <P>On the question of banks generally, it should be noted that, in so far as disclosure of information is concerned, banks have no special privilege and, as such, are required to comply with an order of a tribunal to disclose such information. Failure to do so is an offence under the Tribunals of Inquiry Act, 1979.  A person found guilty of an offence under that Act is liable to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or imprisonment for two years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 4 strengthens the powers of tribunals by providing that where a person disobeys a direction of a tribunal, it may apply to the High</P>
    <P>Court which may order the person to comply with the direction of the tribunal.  Failure to do so would be a breach of the High Court order, in respect of which breach the person may be sent to prison.  Section 4 is a significant advance on the law as it stands and will obviate any delays which might arise in the workings of a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest, as this amendment does, that proceedings before a tribunal are criminal, when clearly they are not.  It is wrong to suggest the law can allow disclosure by the Central Bank of an individual's business in tribunal proceedings. The amendment is misconceived and I am not in a position to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's very tortuous and technical response did not cast much light on the core problem we are trying to address.  He stated the bank operates under strict confidentiality and can only disclose information under exceptional circumstances.  He then went on to indicate the only exceptional circumstance, which is in the context of a criminal investigation. Is there any reason other exceptional circumstances cannot be prescribed?  Surely, the substantial public interest would constitute another exceptional circumstance under which the Central Bank could disclose information.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of this tribunal is to establish accountability and to get to the core of matters which gave rise to considerable interference with the law and public disquiet.  The core of this matter is a very large sum of money, at least £38 million, in the Ansbacher accounts which it seems we cannot touch.  Nobody seems to be responsible for that.  The Central Bank seems to have, on the one hand, a monitoring, investigative and regulatory responsibility and, on the other hand, seems to be able to say categorically to the Minister for Finance that it does not have a watchdog role.</P>
      <P>What are we to expect when we are told we cannot have an amendment which would enable us to get information in the possession of the Central Bank?  Perhaps the Central Bank does not possess this information because it is not carrying out its duty.  How are to find out whether it is carrying out its duty?  We have heard what its responsibility is but we have no way of assessing whether it is fulfilling out that responsibility because of the rule of strict confidentiality.</P>
      <P>The matter at the core of this tribunal is of substantial public interest, which is the definition of &ldquo;exceptional circumstance&rdquo;.  I see no reason the Central Bank cannot fulfil that responsibility and duty to the public.  There is no question of a breach of European Union law as long as we define it within the context of exceptional circumstances.  I do not think it would be possible for any circumstances to be more exceptional than these.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State referred to the need for professional secrecy and our responsibilities in the context of European law. One can understand that any bank requires a certain level of secrecy and confidentiality.  However, there is a <i>quid pro quo</i> for that, which is statutory regulation and powers of investigation by the Central Bank so the public can be assured that, while there is a certain confidentiality about the <Col N="378" /> operation of banks, there is a provision whereby the regulatory authority, that is, the Central Bank, is carrying out its duty.</P>
      <P>I am very disturbed by the Minister's response on Second Stage.  There is obviously a major problem in relation to the operation of the Ansbacher accounts by Guinness &amp; Mahon.  The Governor of the Central Bank stated there was no record in the Bank that it was informed of the internal Guinness &amp; Mahon audit.  In other words, the Central Bank had no record that when Guinness &amp; Mahon realised it had reason to be concerned about the Ansbacher accounts it conducted its own audit, in so far as it deemed to be proper and necessary in the context of commercial procedures.  That alone is a matter of public concern.</P>
      <P>We accept the need for some secrecy and confidentiality. However, there must be a <i>quid pro quo</i> for that because the public must be assured the regulatory body has the necessary powers and is carrying out its functions, as given to it by the Oireachtas.  There was obviously a difficulty in how the Central Bank carried out its functions in relation to the Ansbacher accounts, which is why there continues to be public concern.  That concern will not go away, no matter how much rationalising, handwashing and abdication of responsibility occurs.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not misconceived but is in the public interest.  It is designed to ensure that what has now emerged as a central issue can be dealt with by a future tribunal, which is why we intend to press it.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann commends the Government for the recent increase in funding to Irish Immigrant Organisations and requests the Minister for Foreign Affairs to consider a review of his Department's policies in relation to emigrant issues and to outline the additional measures the Government can undertake to give further assistance to these working among emigrants.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern, and thank him for taking this debate.  When framing the motion, I became aware that emigrant issues are in a bureaucratic mess.  I say that with the greatest respect to those involved.  Funding for emigrants, such as it is, comes from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which primarily provides funds for the Irish in Britain through the DÍON Fund, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, which provides a sum of money for immigrant centres in America and Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister of State is here wearing a Department of Foreign Affairs hat and will no doubt respond in that context.  However, it highlights the fact that emigrant issues should be handled by one Department.  I would go as far as to say that a body should be set up on a statutory basis to handle all emigrant matters.  We should seriously consider setting up a body which would recognise the invaluable work done not only in the United Kingdom, America, Australia and <Col N="381" /> wherever Irish people gather, but also in Ireland. I acknowledge the presence in the Public Gallery of Fr. Paul Byrne of the Oblates, to whom I will refer later, who is doing outstanding work in that regard.  If he were a Member of this House, he would give us his expertise so we will have to do the best in the circumstances to transmit his views.  Many Members on both sides of the House have been briefed by Fr. Byrne.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread perception that the Celtic tiger has eliminated the need to emigrate. The controversy relating to refugees seeking asylum here has fuelled that thinking.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Irish centres in the countries I mentioned continue to respond with their limited resources to a constant stream of inquiries from Irish citizens who have been excluded from the benefits of our growing prosperity. I commend the Government for increasing the grant to DÍON, through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, from £600,000 to £613,000 in the current year.  One of the last acts of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ray Burke, during his September visit to the United States was to announce an increase of £20,000 to immigration centres in the US and Australia.  This brings the total amount of funding to £185,000, £15,000 of which is provided for emigrant groups in Australia.  While these sums are far from adequate, it is a considerable improvement from the late 1970s when a Government refused to consider providing any funds to assist emigrants on the principle that it would encourage emigration.  It is sad to say that, to some degree, that view permeates thinking within the permanent Government.  I refer to those who administer rather than their political masters.  The situation has changed and people are returning to this country.  While we still have emigration, it is not the same involuntary economic emigration of previous years.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware I have extensive contacts with Irish groups in the United Kingdom, particularly in the London area.  I pay tribute to all those working for better conditions for our emigrants, especially the Oblate Order, which provides invaluable social and pastoral care in several towns and cities not only in the United Kingdom, but in the United States.  The Irish Centre in London and the hostel on Quex Road, Kilburn, are well known ports of call for Irish citizens seeking assistance in the London area.  Other centres in Hammersmith, Haringay, Brent, etc. , also spring to mind.  Centres in Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow also do outstanding work.  I acknowledge the outstanding work of the Federation of Irish Societies and the county associations, which are the unsung heroes among the Irish in Britain.</P>
    <P>When one considers that many of the Irish who had to emigrate before the advent of free education here were in many cases semi-literate and from predominantly rural backgrounds, with little more than primary education, their achievements in providing a valuable social outlet for those who <Col N="382" /> came after them can be seen in the many impressive Irish clubs in the United Kingdom.  It is long past time that we in Ireland paid public tribute to these Irish men and women who have made and continue to make a significant contribution to the economic and social life of their adopted countries.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years the exodus of an entire generation of Irish boys and girls to the United States could have had severe repercussions for the future of this country.  The brain drain of previous generations resulted in an emerging Irish State regressing as the best people left these shores, their creativity, imagination, risk taking and inventiveness being lost forever.  A pleasing aspect of the phenomenal success of the Irish economy in recent years is that many of these well educated young people who left in the 1980s have returned and continue to return in significant numbers, bringing with them new skills and that indefinable spirit of adventure that can only be explained and understood by those who have had to leave their homes and families to seek a living, as the song says, far, far from Erin's shore.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a specific proposal to the Minister in response to discussions I have had with Sr. Lena Deevy and Ciarán O'Sullivan of the Irish Immigration Centre in Tremont Street, Boston. This centre, one of the largest on the east coast of the United States, has an outreach programme which involves visiting Irish immigrants throughout Massachusetts on a regular basis.  It also welcomes hundreds of callers to the centre on an annual basis seeking jobs, accommodation and refuge.  The centre is grossly under-funded and mainly exists on its own fund raising efforts and the welcome funding from the Department. However, it is in need of more technology to assist it in conveying specific information on job opportunities to those intending to return to Ireland.  Towards this end the centre urgently needs computer technology with Internet access and I ask the Minister to consider, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, a once-off grant to provide this important facility.  Once in place I understand the centre would liaise with FÁS, the national training authority, which would provide the necessary software and information to alert potential job seekers among the Irish community in the Boston area of current job opportunities in Ireland and the new training and upgrading of skills opportunities available here.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the acute skills short-ages in several industries, including the construction, catering and computer industries.  In my discussion with the Boston office it was pointed out that many Irish citizens who emigrated in recent years have not done as well as they might have expected but, for a variety of reasons, have not returned home.  As a former emigrant I well understand the need for those who leave to be successful in their adopted country while perceived lack of success can sap one's self confidence <Col N="383" /> to the point where to return home would be interpreted as failure.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the provision of information along the lines described would result in more of our young people returning home and to that end I ask the Government to consider providing a once-off grant in the region £5,000 to £10,000.  This would be separate from the existing annual grant which is not sufficient to meet the current running costs of the Boston centre or similar centres throughout the United States.  Perhaps other centres may be able to utilise this information, but there is a specific proposal from the Boston centre to which I hope the Minister will give favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>I understand things can be difficult and that it could be said that a sufficient amount of money is being provided by the two Departments I mentioned. However, this grant would be for a specific purpose and FÁS, which under the Treaty of Rome operates almost exclusively within Europe, would be interested in making a significant contribution within their own obligations.  It sees this project as being linked to training, retraining and the provision of jobs and, therefore, part of its brief.  It could be an exciting prospect for the Boston centre and one which could be expanded to other areas where Irish people are working and living in the United States and Europe.  I would be grateful if the Minister would take this proposal on board.</P>
    <P>This debate provides an opportunity for the House to reflect on the issues still facing our emigrants abroad and the issues facing people like Fr. Paul Byrne who are involved preparing people who wish to emigrate but who have no way of knowing what is facing them.  Increasingly young people are emigrating without information. These people start out with the best of ideas and intentions but they fall through the social safety nets in place for them in their host countries.  It is then they turn to the Irish centres in those countries seeking information.  The Government has a role to play at the crucial points of departure and arrival.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the interdepartmental committee which was established several years ago to discuss matters relating to emigration might examine how it can best serve those who leave Ireland despite or in spite of our prosperity.  There will be no public outcry at or criticism of a Government which takes on board this real social issue and which provides sufficient funding and backup technology.  We are now short of skills and people are returning.  There is a greater onus on the Government to provide the finance and backup I am suggesting.  I understand other Members will expand on this theme.  I know that acceptance of my proposal would be extremely welcome by the Boston Immigration Centre and would go some way towards alleviating its problems.</P>
    <P>I am grateful the Minister has taken time to come to the House to discuss this matter.  He comes from an area similar to my own and I know <Col N="384" /> he has a great understanding of many of the issues we are discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Mooney. The pattern of emigration has changed over the past number of years.  Our emigrants are no longer economic emigrants except in the sense that they can now sell their skills, skills which they acquired here through the huge investment in education at all levels.  This does not mean that nobody in Boston, New York, Australia, Taiwan, etc. , falls into the trap of not being able to support themselves.  There should be support for such people wherever they are.  It is necessary to put a small amount of money aside &mdash; I do not know how much &mdash; to support emigrants who fall into need because they cannot survive in their host society.  The ethnic Irish community in these countries should be in a position to help those who find it difficult to survive and perhaps we could provide additional support for them.</P>
      <P>We are proud that our emigrants have done exceptionally well, but there are drop-outs and failures.  These people fail not necessarily because they emigrated &mdash; they might have dropped out if they remained in Ireland.  If we decide to support people who go abroad and experience problems, I would welcome the setting up of a fund through the Department to help centres in Boston, New York, Australia and other places with which we are familiar and which perhaps contain larger numbers of Irish people than Wales or France.  I do not want to focus on the Oblate Fathers or any other group; the de la Salle Brothers run centres in Kilburn in London.  However, I do not want to single out any group which has supported Irish emigrants.  There may be publicans in London who have supported emigrants and they should be supported too.</P>
      <P>I agree absolutely with the motion.  I would not like to specify the groups to which support should be given.  If Irish emigrants experience problems we should fully support them.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Mooney's comments on the work which the Oblate fathers have done. However, I do not want to single them out as it might appear that other groups have not been supported.</P>
      <P>Apart from the political efforts of Senator O'Dowd's brother Niall, he and his ilk have done amazing work throughout the years.  People all over the world have worked for Irish emigrants. We must ask the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance to give as much help as possible to Irish emigrants experiencing trouble.  They may experience problems because of the area in which they live or perhaps because of the circumstances in which they left Ireland. Let us ask the Minister to support all Irish emigrants.</P>

      <P>The Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants does tremendous work for Irish emigrants.  Fr. Paul Byrne of the commission informs me that approximately 29,000 people emigrate from this country per annum and 18,000 of those are in the 15 to 24 year age bracket.  Many of these young people have no choice but to emigrate.  They are not voluntary emigrants; they leave the country because they cannot find work in Ireland.  Many of them are poorly educated and take up unskilled jobs in the UK and the US.  Many of them do not even hold valid American visas.</P>
      <P>We must educate all of our young people in the area of life skills.  Transition year students may be a core group with which to work.  Pre-emigrant education should be available in all our schools to give young people proper training in life skills and to help them to understand new cultures.  We must equip people with the fundamental knowledge for survival.</P>
      <P>If people emigrate to the UK or the US they should know where to seek advice.  Proper advice centres must be set up outside of schools and we must counsel emigrants.  We should not be afraid to say there is an office in O'Connell Street or wherever for the sole purpose of counselling emigrants. Workers in such a centre could talk to emigrants about what their needs are.  They could try to persuade them to stay in this country if at all possible and ideally find them employment.  If people choose to emigrate, we should be able to provide them with the best information to help them on their way.</P>
      <P>The Government should appoint a Minister who would have total responsibility for emigrant affairs.  As it stands, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Foreign Affairs and Social, Community and Family Affairs are involved in various aspects of emigrants' affairs.  A junior Minister should be appointed to co-ordinate all policy and activities in relation to emigrants.</P>
      <P>We must consider the value returned emigrants can bring to our community and we must consider emigrants' success abroad.  I welcome Senator Lanigan's comments in relation to my brother, Niall.  In America and the UK, a network of very well placed Irish people show great goodwill towards our emigrants.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of information in this area which must be properly collated and organised. Fr. Byrne cited a comparison between the Israelis and the Irish and the way in which each race treats its people.  The Israelis are better organised than we are.  We have the right people in the right places but we need to co-ordinate our efforts.</P>

      <P>I am sure Senator Kennedy could obtain something similar for Irish people.  There is a real and tangible connection between Ireland <Col N="386" /> and the sources of power in the present US Administration.</P>
      <P>A number of emigrants have fallen on hard times in America and the UK.  Those who were formerly known as &lsquo;McAlpine's Fusiliers&rsquo; are now living in very poor accommodation.  Many of our emigrants to the UK live in dreadful poverty. Something in the region of 30 per cent of the people who are homeless and sleeping rough on the streets of London are Irish.  If one considers the massive rates of immigration into the UK, a very significant portion of Irish people are literally down and out.</P>
      <P>Fr. Colm Campbell does a great deal of work for Irish emigrants in America.  Many of those who emigrated to America in the 1930s and 1940s lived in neighbourhoods of which they were a vital part.  These areas have now become very deprived and Irish emigrants do not have the money to move out of them.  The culture in these neighbourhoods is generally alien to these former Irish citizens, who are literally locked into their homes.  Thousands of Irish emigrants in New York live in very poor conditions.  The Irish Episcopal Commission would like to see this issue tackled in a positive way, with proper funding and understanding being provided to these groups.</P>
      <P>We must fund social workers who are ethnically Irish.  Many of the social workers in New York would not necessarily understand Irish culture although they would be fine and able people. In poorer areas populated by Puerto Ricans and other races, an Irish person would be totally isolated.</P>
      <P>It is important that we discuss the issue of emigration. If we organise ourselves better, we can improve our support services to our emigrants. We can use our successful emigrants in the UK and America to do more and we can encourage them to bring their skills and knowledge together to provide better information, contacts, advice and facilities for our emigrants.  I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for allowing me to use her time. Beidh mé ag éisteacht leis an ndíospóireacht.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Senator Cassidy and others at the instigation of Senator Mooney for tabling this motion and allowing this House another opportunity to give attention to the needs of emigrants and how best to meet them.  The motion is addressed to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Responsibility for the co-ordination of policy with regard to emigrants and emigration is a proper matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and I am here at the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a period of strong economic growth there is a tendency to assume that emigration has ended, which, as Senator Mooney said, is not quite true. Central Statistics Office figures show that while in recent years there is more inward than outward migration, about 30,000 people are leaving the country every year, of which about 13,000 go to <Col N="387" /> Britain.  In the year to last April about 18,000 people in the 15 to 24 year age group emigrated and about 14,000 came into the country.  There are therefore still many young emigrants &mdash; mostly in Britain, but also in other European countries, the United States, Australia and elsewhere &mdash; needing guidance and assistance both before they leave Ireland and when they are trying to find their feet in a new environment.</P>
    <P>Since 1984 Governments have given financial support to voluntary organisations providing advisory and welfare services to Irish people in Britain.  These grants support the employment of professional staff to give advice and counselling as well as practical assistance to new arrivals from Ireland or to Irish people already in Britain for some time who may be encountering problems. Studies show that, for cultural, social and other reasons, Irish people there, especially the elderly, are sometimes slow to approach or even claim their legal entitlements from the State welfare agencies.  Therefore, voluntary agencies run by members of the Irish community or close to that community play an indispensable role.  A small part of the funds that are made available goes to support research into aspects of welfare problems affecting Irish people in Britain.</P>
    <P>Grants are made from the Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote on the basis of recommendations of the London based DÍON committee, which is chaired by an officer of that Department stationed at the embassy there.  The committee's terms of reference, set in 1984 with the approval of the Oireachtas, are to advise and report on emigrant welfare services, to make recommendations on the provision of financial assistance towards the employment of professional workers dealing with the welfare of Irish workers and to consider and make recommendations on specific questions at the request of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In recommending grants the committee seeks to address ways in which the Irish community in Britain is significantly disadvantaged including through unemployment, through inadequate access to State agencies, welfare rights, housing or through ill-health.</P>
    <P>The amount provided in the DÍON subhead of the Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote for grants to emigrant welfare organisations in Britain was £500,000 a year for a number of years until it was increased to £550,000 in 1996 and to £600,000 in 1997.  Some 33 organisations have received grants averaging about £18,000 each this year.</P>
    <P>Since 1990 Governments have also given financial support from the Foreign Affairs Vote to voluntary groups in the United States providing information and advice to Irish emigrants there, especially new arrivals and those who are &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo;.  The tightening up of US immigration legislation in recent years &mdash; for example, the ending of the possibility for illegal aliens to adjust their status without having to leave the <Col N="388" /> country, the introduction of re-entry bars on people who overstay &mdash; means that there is a continuing need for the assistance and guidance that voluntary organisations can provide.  The amount of funding to such organisations was £150,000 a year until this year when, mainly because of the unfavourable exchange rate, it was increased to £170,000.</P>
    <P>Thirteen organisations in Boston, Florida, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco have received grants of from $500 to $60,000 in 1997.  Decisions on the distribution of funds are made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the recommendation of the Ambassador in Washington, the Consuls-General in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco and the Irish Immigration Working Committee in New York.  This committee is comprised of representatives of Irish immigrant welfare bodies in the New York area and is chaired by the vice-consul there.</P>
    <P>The embassy in Washington and the Consulates-General in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco carefully monitor how the frequently changing immigration rules affect Irish people in the US and, through their contacts in the Congress, use their best efforts to ensure that their interests are protected as far as possible. When he was in the United States in September the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Burke, also raised current immigration issues with Senators and Members of Congress he met there.</P>
    <P>The first grants, amounting to £30,000 to three organisations, were made to Irish immigrant welfare organisations in Australia in 1996.  Grants amounting to £15,000 have been made to those organisations in 1997.</P>
    <P>The need for a co-ordinated and structured approach to matters relating to emigrants and emigration led in 1988 to the establishment by the Government of an Interdepartmental Committee on Emigration.  It is chaired by an Assistant Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and comprises representatives of Departments and Offices dealing with emigrants.  The Committee facilitates the flow of information and ideas between Departments and Offices, targets specific areas for attention, agrees on responsibility for action or joint action, monitors developments in action areas and has meetings with people directly involved with emigrants.  The committee is finalising a review of its activities, including an examination of the main issues of concern to Irish people in the countries in which they have settled in the greatest numbers.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments to promote the economic development of Ireland to the point where none of our people will have to go abroad to find employment. However, voluntary emigration will always exist, as it does in every country.  Ireland has a well established tradition of emigration which has left communities of people of Irish birth and descent in many countries.  The existence of that tradition and those communities themselves is an incentive <Col N="389" /> to our young people to think of emigration, whether or not they need to do so for economic reasons.  The common travel area with the UK and freedom of movement within the European Union are further incentives.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, assumes that for the foreseeable future people will continue to want to go to other countries, at least on a voluntary basis, even though it may be only for a few years.  That being so, there will continue to be a need for back-up information, advice and guidance services both before departure and after arrival in the other country.</P>
    <P>In the past few years the need for adequate pre-departure information, especially for youngsters going to London, has been one of the main issues addressed by the Interdepartmental Committee on Emigration.</P>
    <P>FÁS, the Training and Employment Authority, organised seminars in Dublin and London drawing together people from Government and voluntary organisations in Ireland and the UK.  This has resulted in the coming into existence this year of the Emigrant Advice Network, EAN, co-ordinating the activities of the relevant agencies in Ireland.  Earlier this year FÁS produced a migration information pack which is distributed widely not only through their own offices but also through voluntary groups in contact with young people throughout the country.  FÁS also has a series of other specific country leaflets for young people thinking of going abroad to work.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs &mdash; in consultation with Emigrant Advice, a voluntary organisation in Dublin &mdash; this year has produced information booklets entitled &ldquo;Thinking of Going to London?&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Thinking of Going to the United States&rdquo;.  These contain practical guidance on job seeking, accommodation, health care and welfare entitlements.</P>
    <P>The Irish Immigration Working Committee in New York recently submitted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs proposals for the co-ordination of activities regarding pre-departure advice of bodies in Ireland and in the US.  They are currently being considered by the Departments and Offices concerned.</P>
    <P>Another issue affecting Irish people in London which we have been hearing about with increasing frequency in recent times is homelessness. Several studies show that it is a problem being faced by a disproportionate number of Irish people there.  This is one of the main priority areas wherein the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have agreed that the two Governments will develop closer co-operation in the East-West context.</P>
    <P>As interest among Irish people abroad in returning to Ireland has increased, so have inquiries and requests for up-to-date information about living and working here now.  In response to this demand, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, again in co-operation with Emigrant Advice, produced a booklet this year, <i>Returning to Ireland,</i> with useful practical guidance. <Col N="390" /> The first print run of 20,000 copies has already been distributed abroad, mainly through voluntary agencies in contact with Irish people, and a second printing is being considered.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of a conference on Ireland and the Irish diaspora at University College Cork last September to mark the establishment there of an Irish centre for migration studies, the Department of Foreign Affairs sponsored a one day seminar concerning contemporary issues in Irish migration.  This was a useful opportunity for experts from the academic field, practitioners involved with emigrants and their needs and people dealing with policy issues to exchange information and views.</P>
    <P>Through the Departments and offices represented on the interdepartmental committee on emigration, including embassies abroad, the Government continually keeps developments regarding emigrants and emigration under review and responds to changing needs as appropriate. Despite the welcome decrease in involuntary emigration, we accept the need to maintain services to intending and actual emigrants as well as assisting intending returnees.  We will listen with interest to the debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney mentioned the Irish Immigration Centre in Boston, one of the recipients of grants from the Department of Foreign Affairs Vote, and suggested the centre be given specific financial assistance to purchase a computer for its outreach activities.  The Minister agrees that the services provided by the IIC are excellent, as are those available from ten to 12 other organisations in the US which receive grants.  The centre would have to meet certain standards to qualify, and it would be invidious to suggest that any one recipient organisation was better than another.</P>
    <P>Recognition by successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the merits of the Irish Immigration Centre is evidenced by the fact that the grants it received grew from $18,600 in 1993 to $40,000 in 1997.  This is a rise from 9 per cent to 16 per cent of the total money available, which was $253,300 in 1997, including $20,000 to compensate for the fall in exchange rate.  The amount provided in the Foreign Affairs Vote for grants for emigrant welfare organisations in the US and Australia is now £169,000.</P>
    <P>I will convey Senator Mooney's suggestion to the Minister and ask him to contact the Senator directly.  I apologise that the Minister, Deputy Andrews, is not here.  He is unfortunately engaged in other business.  He asked me to convey his best wishes and to assure Senators he is continually aware of the need to care for emigrants.</P>

      <P>We have discussed the plight of Irish emigrants in New York and other places before.  We talked of the dead end position of people who are illegal in a foreign country and who are not eligible for social security nor are they recognised for financial purposes.  They cannot open a bank account or obtain a social security number.  We spoke of how bad it was, how our people were treated and how they ought to receive better entitlements. We see the same happening here.  The vast majority of politicians have been above reproach in this matter but too many are prepared to use it as a means to enter into a populist area, thereby sowing the seeds of future problems.</P>
      <P>I accept that Senator Mooney has shown a consistent interest in and support for the problems of emigrants for at least the past 12 years and, perhaps, for much longer.  However, I recall that when I went to London in 1986-87 and spoke on voting rights for emigrants, I did not receive support from anyone in either House of the Oireachtas.  The only Member who supported me within a few months was Deputy Jim Mitchell. All parties that have been in power over the past ten years have given commitments to some form of voting rights or voting participation for emigrants, yet none of them has fulfilled those commitments. Three Members present and three more who are absent have among their electorate people from every corner of the globe who have no difficulty in keeping abreast of what is happening. We have voters everywhere from Sydney to Valparaiso, from Dunquin to Moscow.  The distance does not matter; they still cast their votes.</P>
      <P>I have been less than impressed with the type of extraordinary, nonsensical and illogical opposition over the past seven or eight years to giving voting rights to emigrants.  We can restrict it as much as we want and the obvious way to do it is to have a constituency for emigrants in each House of the Oireachtas with three seats in each constituency.  It is not a question of a constituency of 25 million people deciding who would run Ireland, as one inane politician once put it.  It is just that there is no voice in the Oireachtas to highlight the problems our people abroad experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a serious problem with some of the immigrant centres.  I know the people who run them are motivated and committed, but I have been to immigrant centres in various parts of the world and there is a huge difference between them.  Tá cultúr dár gcuid féin againn; it is strong and neither static nor stagnant.  It is based on the Irish language, music and literature.  It includes not just writers, from the first who wrote in Irish and English down to Heaney, but also includes people like U2 and Sinéad O'Connor.  They are also part of Irish culture whether people like it or not.  There is a danger that many of our emigrants <Col N="392" /> live in some kind of a timewarp.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure such people are told about Ireland as it is today.</P>
    <P>People have spoken at length about those who are completely down at heel, who are in the gutter and are homeless.  I do not wish to rehash the argument.  I support what has been said about them.  However, there are others, such as blue collar workers who work every day of their life in London or Northampton and do not have any pension when they retire because they have been employed by someone who will not pay social security.  They find themselves, having worked all their lives, with neither a home to return to in Ireland nor one to move into in England or wherever they happen to be.  I would like to see practical financial advice provided for them rather than just social welfare advice.  I accept what the Minister said about it being important but we must go beyond that.</P>
    <P>We must discuss pensions.  It would be good if the Irish Government set up a pension fund into which people working in menial or blue collar jobs in other countries who would like to return to Ireland could contribute so that they would have an element of security, dignity and independence in their latter years.  Such practical measures must be taken.  We must also recognise that many of these people have literacy problems. Adult literacy support could be extraordinarily helpful for many of our emigrants.</P>
    <P>Two Members of this House recently spoke of three or four immigrants to this country taking advantage of the social welfare system.  I nearly vomited listening to them.  Irish people have done that in other parts of the world.  It is no reflection on Irish people as a whole, just on those who did it.  We should remember that we sent criminals abroad because we did not want them here.</P>

      <P>They were given choices &mdash; get out of the country or go to jail.  We sent them abroad and they are creating havoc.  People who left this country as emigrants have settled into a life of crime in other countries.  They are Irish immigrants in those countries.  To us they are emigrants.  Let us take off the rose-tinted spectacles. We need to look at all elements of this matter.  We need to give practical help and support to those who need it.  We also need to be clear that we do not condone activities which we would not accept in this country.  We need to recognise where we are going in terms of our culture. We should take this opportunity to give due credit to a group which has received bad publicity in recent times &mdash; the Irish hierarchy and religious abroad.  They have done extraordinary work for emigrants in every part of the globe. They know how to be supportive and we can be proud of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that political parties do not understand the problems of emigrants.  I do not believe that they do not see a distinction between <Col N="393" /> different classes of Irish emigrants.  Every political party from Sinn Féin to Fianna Fáil has found ways of identifying those who can afford a $1,000 dinner when they want to raise money.  If they can do it for the rich they can do it for the poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  I am concerned about emigrants.  I have been involved in the emigration movement in Ireland and abroad for the past 18 years.  I have not been found wanting on emigration issues, particularly in the US.  I was an emigrant in the 1960s and I know the plight of emigrants, particularly in the US.</P>
      <P>In New York in 1987, I set up the first meeting on the plight of illegal immigrants in the US between the Taoiseach, the Immigration Reform Movement, the Catholic charities and other groups.  There were thousands of illegal immigrants in the US at that time.  During the postal strike in Ireland, when no one gave tuppence about illegal Irish immigrants in the US, I took 16,000 visa applications to the US and processed them.  I did this without any assistance for the sake of those living illegally in the US and those who wished to emigrate there.</P>
      <P>We are afraid to speak of emigrants but they are our own people.  Two-thirds of my family were emigrants.  Half have returned to this country. I know of numerous families who have done well abroad but returned home and established businesses.  They were not afraid to be called emigrants. I know of people who are in good employment and wish to emigrate to broaden their horizons. However, despite all the programmes, there is a serious problem.  A department will have to be created to deal with these issues.  For the past two months Senator Mooney and I have been trying to get some Department to take responsibility for missing persons.  We have knocked on many doors but we are waiting for someone to take up the challenge.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will only accept responsibility if the matter is officially reported through the Garda.  However, some of these people leave home because of a row and they may never return.</P>
      <P>The Kerry Emigrant Support Group was set up in 1991.  The group has rehoused five or six emigrant families in Kerry.  There is a lack of co-ordination between organisations working in the UK and the US and a similar, funded group in Ireland.  This problem will have to be tackled.  I compliment those involved in advice groups abroad, particularly in the UK, who work on behalf of the homeless and Irish immigrants.  Fr. Paul Byrne is in the Public Gallery.  He has done tremendous work for emigrants and is trying to implement some co-ordination between groups in the US, the UK and Ireland.  This work is done on a voluntary basis without any funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also compliment those who set up the missing persons line without assistance from the State. This line is working well and they must get funding. It is pointless to say that we are grant aiding <Col N="394" /> groups involved with missing persons in the UK, the US or Australia because there is no link to an organisation in Ireland.  Many of these emigrants will never go to the authorities because they do not want anyone to know that they are missing.  Perhaps they are ashamed to return home.  However, people in Ireland would like to rehouse or relocate these people.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the numbers who took up the Government's 90 per cent grant to build community homes.  I built some of these homes in Kerry 20 years ago when there were no grants available.  I was fortunate to raise money locally and built four such homes.  We brought four emigrants back from the UK and housed them.  I am glad we did so.  More groups should avail of the 90 per cent grants and build community homes for the homeless, whether in Ireland or abroad.</P>
    <P>The new organisation established in the US is working well.  There is still a problem with illegal immigrants in the US.  Every year, thousands of people apply for visas.  Last year Ireland had a quota of 3,850 US visas.  However, only 300 of these were allocated to the Republic.  This is unfair and someone is making a mistake.  Eight hundred and ninety visas were granted for the island last year.  We need to take care of those living without documentation in the US and those trying to go to the US.</P>
    <P>I stood in front of a television camera at Shannon Airport with 16,000 applications in 1987. People said that I was trying to export the problem. However, Irish people have always been travellers.  No one wants to export their problems. If people wish to travel they will do so.  One cannot put shackles on them and tell them that they must stay here whether they wish to or not.  Irish people have always liked to go abroad to try their expertise.  They are well educated.  Our emigrants are in big demand in countries such as the US because they are white, they speak English and they are highly intelligent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>These countries are using our expertise.  However, Irish emigrants are gaining much experience and they have returned in droves over the past three or four years.  They have created new businesses and employment in this country.  However, there is still a problem for the homeless and for emigrants who could not make it abroad and were too shy or afraid to pick up the telephone and admit they were in difficulty. I compliment the Irish centres in the UK, the United States and Australia for helping them, but some type of helpline must be established. We must also establish an organisation in Ireland to co-ordinate with agencies abroad.  We must not be afraid to confront the challenges posed by emigrants who are in difficulty.  We should have our hand out to help these people.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an appropriate time to debate this motion and I commend Senator Mooney for tabling it.  Since the 17th century over seven million Irish people have emigrated.  Currently, there are one million people living abroad who were born and reared in this country.</P>
      <P>Much of the emigration this century took place in the 1940s, 1950s and 1980s but there are still problems for our emigrants in such countries as England, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.  This issue has never been addressed or taken seriously by any Government.  The attitude appears to be that, as the emigrants are gone, they are no longer our problem or responsibility. However, these people are part of the Irish nation.  We live in the Irish State but our emigrants are part of the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that every Government includes emigrants within the nationhood of Ireland and that can only be done by taking a serious policy approach.  It is unfortunate that no political party or Government has had a specific policy for our emigrants.  I am delighted that research into the emigration issue is to commence at the end of December and will be completed next year.  Hopefully, that research will provide the basis from which a substantial Government emigration policy can emerge.</P>
      <P>The major problem at present is the plethora of organisations which deal with emigration issues.  In the 1980s there was an attempt to co-ordinate these organisations when an assistant secretary of one of the Departments chaired a committee with that objective.  However, it is still the case that if somebody decides to emigrate to New York, London or Brisbane they do not know where to go for specific direction and advice.  The one thing to emerge from this debate is the need to provide proper counselling in local centres. This could be carried out effectively in each village and town through the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>In a number of his speeches Fr. Paul Byrne referred to the need for people to &ldquo;talk before they walk&rdquo;.  That is vitally important because the emigrant is moving from one culture to a different culture.  The cultures of Britain, America or Australia are different from the Irish culture and the emigrants who move to those countries often cannot cope with the culture shock.  When emigrants are unable to manage even the basics serious problems arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, many emigrants are of the opinion that it is easier to be Irish in America than in the UK.  That is the reality for many emigrants and we should focus on it.  A great deal of emphasis was put on our emigrants in the United States during the past decade because of difficulties which arose with regard to visas.  There is not as much focus on the position of our emigrants in the UK.  It is opportune at this point to compliment our ambassador to Britain, Mr. Ted Barrington, on his forcible and confident defence of the position of Irish people in Britain.  It is <Col N="396" /> extremely important to have somebody at that level to articulate the Irish position in a competent fashion.  I congratulate him on his work in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in embassy circles to mingle with the nobs but there is a need for our embassy personnel to involve themselves with the most deprived members of our nation in foreign countries.  I hope this issue will be addressed by the Department of Foreign Affairs through our embassies and consulates.  However, it must also be acknowledged that fine work has been done by the embassies and our consuls, many of whom operate on a voluntary basis without funding, to help Irish people who get into difficulty in foreign countries.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister would make a major announcement of an increase in funding.  It is disappointing to learn it will only be increased from £150,000 to £170,000 and the reason for the increase is changes in the exchange rates.  At a time when the Celtic tiger is boisterous and so much money is available, I urge the Minister to return to the Department and demand a realistic approach to this issue.  The country is flush in financial terms and plenty of money was given away in the recent budget.  Surely our emigrants deserve a better response in terms of funding for the agencies which are serving them abroad than an allocation of £15,000 or £18,000 per agency. What can be done with £18,000?  It would not run a constituency office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>How can one expect a room to be provided in New York, Chicago or other major cities without proper funding?  The Government must respond to the plight of emigrants. We have relied for too long on voluntary organisations and on the Catholic Church.  For many years the church has provided a fine service to our emigrants in these cities.  However, since the number of priests and nuns is reducing drastically both in Ireland and abroad, they will not be there to provide these services in the future. There is an onus on Government to fill that gap and to provide the service that is required through counsellors, agencies and advisers.  These advisers should be people with life skills which are globally acceptable rather than simply nationally acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge diaspora of Irish emigrants who have been extremely successful.  Senator O'Dowd referred to the wonderful network that operates in the Jewish diaspora on behalf of Israel.  Unfortunately, we have not successfully tapped into the Irish diaspora, which constitutes almost 40 million people in the US, between six and seven million in Australia and up to 20 million in the UK.  If we were more successful it would benefit the diaspora as well as this country.  The Department of <Col N="397" /> Enterprise, Trade and Employment should put a great deal of emphasis on this area.</P>
    <P>Voting rights is a fundamental issue which should be addressed.  The last Government was in the process of doing so but had not concluded any specific proposals.  The Presidency, however, is a specific office and President Robinson identified to a great extent with the Irish diaspora during her term of office.  We should give serious consideration to empowering the one million Irish people abroad to vote in the presidential election.  The President is not just the President of this State but the President of the nation, and that extends beyond the Twenty-six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the motion. Senator Taylor-Quinn has relieved me of the responsibility of making a speech because she said most of what I intended to say.  It is sad to be accosted by young Irish people, from the North and South, on the streets of London begging for money or to see them prostituting themselves. To say we have no responsibility for them is a denial not only of our responsibility, but of their rights.  I applaud the work done by the emigrant advice centres and Fr. Colm Campbell, Mr. Niall O'Dowd and his friends in New York.  I was struck by the figures given by the Minister of State because they did not amount to much when one added them up.  The sums of $500 and £18,000 are small in terms of the problems faced by these people.</P>
      <P>At a time when the Exchequer is robust, the State should take its courage in its hands and substantially increase the amount of money available to such bodies.  It should be concentrated on two groups.  I do not have enormous worries about the people who leave with skills because they are mobile and their skills will help them.  They may even return to Ireland and become economic contributors. Despite Senator O'Toole's remarks, I am not inordinately worried about people with a university franchise.  However, we should be concerned about the young people who leave this country unprepared and who often have domestic, familial, health or emotional problems. Money should be invested in this area to provide advice and counselling so that young people are aware of what faces them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a focus on the young people in the country to which they go to help them overcome the transition and settle into society. The resources of former emigrants who have made good are extremely important in that regard.  Some people will be out of their depth and will not know where to turn.  These people, more than anybody else, need help, succour, good <Col N="398" /> counsel and support.  They may not go to a church or something which appears to be authority for this help.  It may be necessary to find new and slightly unorthodox means of making contact with them.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale, some people, who are now elderly, have spent their lives doing unskilled work, particularly in Britain.  We should ask why the Irish are inordinately represented among the homeless, the prison population and in psychiatric hospitals in Britain.  Those are the people for whom we should care.  We should help them in their current situations or to transfer back to Ireland if they wish to spend their old age here.</P>
    <P>A huge bureaucratic structure should not absorb funds which could go to voluntary bodies. There are such bodies with proven track records and they should be helped with sufficient money to give them a critical mass and make them effective. This would enable them to work in decent places to which people will come to see them. Why should they work over cafés or in old corner buildings or dance halls?  There is no need to spread the money all over the world.  It is hard luck if two or three people are having problems in Upper Volta.</P>
    <P>The problem of emigration is well settled round the world.  We are aware of the places, cities and countries to which young Irish people go. A focus of effort and money on those destinations in co-operation with the voluntary bodies already in existence and harnessing the goodwill of emigrants who have made good in those places would make an enormous difference.  These are our people and we owe it to them to help them through the difficulties they are experiencing and embrace them as full members of the nation, even if they have left the State.</P>

      <P>This subject is of major concern and I subscribe to all the comments made about the plight of our emigrants.  I am concerned at the horrific figures on the degree of homelessness among our emigrants and that the Irish are the only emigrant group in Britain whose life expectancy drops in comparison to their life expectancy at home.  In addition, unfortunately, a significant number of Irish people are in prison in Britain.  I am concerned about these matters, but I wish to put the figures in perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the height of the emigration wave in the 1980s, it was suggested that there were 250,000 undocumented Irish people in the United States. That country is approximately 80 times the size of Ireland so the equivalent figure here is 3,000. People did not descend into a moral panic about <Col N="399" /> a crisis of illegal immigration in the United States when there was the equivalent of 3,000 illegal Irish in the US.  However, in the last three weeks, Ireland has descended into a position close to barbarism in relation to dealing with the problem of 3,000 illegal immigrants seeking asylum in this country.</P>
    <P>The 250,000 Irish emigrants in the United States had the effective lobby of the Government, Irish-America and other people who arrived before them to protect them.  The 3,000 people in this State have no lobby and are becoming the victims of political convenience.  Unfortunately, there is a whiff of hypocrisy about elaborate concern for people who emigrate from this country and the tightening of the rules governing illegal immigration in the United States, while at the same time a significant body of opinion in Irish journalism and politics is winding people up on the idea that people who are in Ireland illegally should be dumped over the Border at the first possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that a tradition from which we have benefited internationally in terms of welcoming those whom Ireland could not afford to keep and one which was extended as recently as the 1980s in the United States has been abandoned in this country.  How can we justify the extraordinary contradiction of policies where we worry about our own abroad, but say we have no responsibility for other people's children when they come to Ireland?  People moan and whinge about welfare and housing and imply that an entire collection of chancers and shysters are on the streets of Dublin abusing our services.  At the same time we expect other people to look after our own in other countries.  In charitable terms, it is an exercise in double think about which we should be ashamed.</P>
    <P>I would prefer the House to discuss what Ireland should be doing for the misfortunate people who are in much worse circumstances than any of our emigrants were before they left. These people come from countries whose economies have collapsed and from countries where, if they go home courtesy of the Star Chamber of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, they will be killed.  None of our emigrants, in their worst possible imagination, were under any threat if they returned home.  Most of our so called illegal immigrants are frightened by the collapse of their countries and for their wellbeing and safety.  We have decided to operate a two sided policy.  One half of our brain considers our own abroad and worries about them; we want them looked after and secure.  However, the other half of our brain looks at those from other countries who are in Ireland and tries to figure out the most expeditious way to get rid of them.  We should be ashamed of ourselves because we are contradicting in practice and in terms of our affluence the precise principles we want applied to our own abroad.  That is not good enough and it is time we faced up to our responsibilities. <Col N="400" /> Emigration is now a two-way street for us.  If we do not get used to it, we will join the ranks of people who wanted to drive the Irish out of Britain and the United States.  We call them racists when they do it in Britain and the US, and it is time to remove the motes in our own eyes.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Mooney and his colleagues for this important motion.  This is a very significant issue, and I was pleased by the tributes paid by colleagues to the work done by the churches in this area, particularly the Roman Catholic Church.  That church is often attacked and reviled, but the wonderful work it has done, which is unpopular, unpaid and unseen, is sometimes forgotten.  I have no difficulty, as a member of the Anglican community, in paying that tribute.</P>
      <P>I was in Argentina recently where there is a huge, eclectic Irish community.  There are over 400,000 people with Irish connections in Buenos Aires alone, and those people have a wonderfully moving commitment to Ireland.  There are fourth generation Irish descendants there from Westmeath and Wexford.  There is a cluster of Howlins there, and when I used that name it seemed to belong to half the people in the hall I was addressing.  They speak impeccable Spanish, but they speak English with Wexford and Westmeath accents.  The Minister of State has had that experience.  They have a deep respect for Irish culture; they have a hurling club but do not play because they have nobody to play against.  Their facilities are wonderful and it was an honour to be there.</P>
      <P>We should not forget how wonderfully successful many of our emigrants have been.  It is a source of great pride to travel and see that. However, there is a minority who have not succeeded, and I was pleased the Minister of State said that there was an arrangement for continuing discussions between the British and Irish Governments on homelessness, particularly in London. The existence of that problem is a reproach to all of us.</P>
      <P>The existence of Irish centres in American cities is very important.  I received an appeal from one recently and sent back a small cheque, adding that I wished they were sensitive to the fact that a group of Irish people have been forced out to London, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco &mdash; gay people.  I received a very nice reply from a nun involved with this centre which said that the matter was a priority for it and that gays were recognised as a vulnerable group for whom the centre went out of its way for.  I was surprised and felt I had misjudged the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We advise people on insurance, health, residence and other matters.  Senator Dan Kiely should attempt an exercise in imagination in relation to Senator Brendan Ryan's comments on people emigrating to Ireland.  Senator Kiely said he boasted about bringing 16,000 visa forms to Irish people in New York some years ago.  How would those with reservations about immigration <Col N="401" /> into Ireland feel if someone in the Bosnian or Zairean parliament said they had brought 16,000 visa forms to Dublin for their people?  We must realise we live in one world and that we are interdependent. Senator Kiely made a slip of the tongue when he said Irish people were working in American society because they were white.  It was honesty, and he is right.  There is racism in America, and there is racism in Ireland, which I deplore.</P>
    <P>I raised a matter on the Order of Business today concerning a Nigerian and Sudanese, both in good standing here as asylum seekers, going to the mosque on a bus.  They were yanked off the bus, interrogated by the police and brought to Pearse Street Garda station in a squad car that was called to the scene.  They were interrogated again, told they were lying and strip-searched. They were then forced to sign a document stating that they had been well treated before being photographed against their wishes before leaving. Imagine if that happened to an Irish person in England.  There would be screams about British racism, and quite right, but what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, whatever the nationality of goose or gander.</P>

      <P>This debate is relevant to the majority of Irish people.  The majority of homes have been touched by emigration; four members of my family emigrated.  Every person in this Chamber could tell harrowing tales of heartbreak about people leaving Ireland, perhaps never to return. Something that has stood out for me in working with emigrants for 25 years is the generosity of spirit of our emigrants.  There is very little hostility towards a country that was unable to provide employment for them.  The opposite is the case, as they have demonstrated an undiluted affection for Ireland and developed concern and support for Ireland.  I remember many occasions when emigrants tried to express their views on this country but were told in less than polite language that it was none of their business.  That is the reason we have not given the fullest service to our emigrants and not recognised their potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last November I went to celebratory functions in Liverpool, Leicester, Glasgow and west London for four weekends in a row.  There were up to four generations of emigrants at those functions, and I noticed immense pride in Ireland among all of them.  That, more than the work of Governments, has provided a good image of Ireland in their adopted countries.  The work of Irish people abroad has made Ireland known in those countries.  It is important to recognise this when speaking of the downside of emigration. Recently I read a book by Donal O'Donovan, the <Col N="402" /> former PRO of the Bank of Ireland, which stated that 40 per cent of corporate America was controlled or directed by people of Irish extraction. We should bear that in mind when considering our emigrants' potential to help Ireland, as we have not yet found a structured way to do so.  I praise the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs for their efforts in this area.  I know of no country whose diplomats have given such positive service and they have always been readily available.</P>
    <P>However, we must not think in terms of what we can do for our emigrants but what we can do to facilitate emigrants to work for us.  There have been many occasions when our emigrants could have been forgiven for believing they were only important on St. Patrick's Day or when groups left Ireland on fund raising missions.  That happened when churches and community halls were being built and employment projects were being developed here.  The emigrants have never been found wanting but there was always a feeling that they were entitled to much more than that.</P>
    <P>I would like to pose a scenario which might be helpful to develop this debate, not tonight but on a future occasion.  If it is possible for us to develop a concept and a structure which is extra-territorial in regard to the European Union, if it is possible to develop a concept of the United Nations, why is it not possible to maximise the potential of our emigrants abroad?  I do not mean that in a lip service manner.  I do not mean to have others acting on their behalf.  I mean working in a representative manner because I have no doubt that we would find plenty of goodwill on the part of those who have been successful abroad to help those who have not been quite as successful.</P>
    <P>Last year in Boston the North American convention of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann was held. Minister Alan Dukes attended on behalf of the Government.  The previous year Minister Síle de Valera attended the convention in Toronto.  On each of those occasions more than two thousand delegates attended from all over the United States and Canada at great expense to themselves. Why did they do that?  They did it because they wanted to feel, as Senator Taylor-Quinn has mentioned, that they are part of the Irish nation, the nation in exile, the nation which is much more numerically strong than we are here.  Because they have that strength it is important for us, not only to acknowledge it but, to facilitate them in using it at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on a previous occasion that in North America alone we have 40 million people of Irish extraction.  In recent surveys it was very evident that many of those people are coming back to Ireland to trace their roots.  An opportunity has been provided, through the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments, to help them to do that.  If such people come back to Ireland and want to identify with us then they should also be given the opportunity of participating in a fuller manner.  I would find it very difficult, in conscience or in tradition, to ignore the <Col N="403" /> comments which were made by Senator Brendan Ryan regarding immigrants to this land.  It is not possible to be insensitive to those immigrants, to ignore their plight and at the same time to demonstrate a concern for our emigrants abroad.  Any person who has set foot in Gros Isle or in Ellis Island will realise the emotional trauma which must have been experienced by our people when they emigrated.  It is worth making the point that they were not always received with open arms. There were many occasions when signs were displayed saying, &ldquo;No Irish need apply for jobs&rdquo;. The greatest recognition and acknowledgment which we can give the Irish diaspora is to demonstrate a sense of generosity &mdash; a céad míle fáilte - when the opportunity comes our way.</P>

I would support other Senators who have said that we must be very careful that we do unto others as we would have done to our emigrants when they are abroad.  There has been a tendency in the last few years to look on those who have come to our country in quite an appalling way in some situations.  Many of the people I have met who have come here as refugees are academic and professional people who have no desire to be a charge on the State and only want to become part of the community here, having had to seek asylum here from the possibility of death in their own lands.  This is a part of Senator Mooney's motion which, perhaps, he did not expect to be seized on so enthusiastically by the rest of us.  I do hope that is heard outside here and in the other House too.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in what Senator Maurice Hayes said about the difficulty of looking after our emigrants in Upper Volta.  I have no one in Upper Volta at the moment but I do have someone, a son, in the Republic of Benin, which is just south of it.  As he appears to be the only Irish person there at the moment I had better tell him to paddle his own canoe because there is not going to be an Irish club founded for him just at the moment.</P>

      <P>Oh, thank you Minister.  It is interesting to see that practically everywhere you go you can find a couple of Irish people.  We must, of course, concentrate on the areas where there has been the most emigration.  It is important, too, to involve those who have been succesful in places like London, New York, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, the large cities of Australia and South Africa in whatever we put in place.  As many people have said, the Churches have for too long been expected to do everything. I have found that young successful people are <Col N="404" /> extremely enthusiastic about becoming involved in helping other people.  There is, for example, a big ball held in London by young Irish people to raise funds for those who are not in as good a situation as they are.</P>
      <P>We have to ask ourselves constantly: why do people leave us?  Some people leave for very serious social reasons.  I am the president of Cherish, the association for single mothers, and I find that far too many girls still go to England feeling that they cannot stay in Ireland to have a child. It distresses me to say that every time, when going on the tube in London, I have stopped a girl who is sitting begging with a child, the girl has been Irish.  Not once was a girl I spoke to from anywhere else.  This may be just a coincidence but it is not a great feeling to see a fellow Irish woman sitting begging.  When I implore them to go home so many girls still say that they cannot go home because their parents would not have it.  We must really look at the people who feel that they cannot come home to us when they are in trouble.  This is true of people who may have had problems with the law or who have suffered a psychiatric illness.  It is widely known that Irish emigrants, particularly in Britain, have a very high instance of psychiatric illness.  We have to be sure that people for whom things do not go too well feel that they can come home.  It is much more difficult to come home when you have been a failure rather than a success.  We must make sure that it is understood by anyone who leaves here that, no matter what the situation is, he or she is perfectly welcome to come back again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It was a very good idea of Senator Mooney and his colleagues on the Fianna Fáil side of the House to put down this motion.  The debate has been wide ranging and very relevant, because at a time when the country is seen to be doing so well in many respects it is important to realise that, as the Minister has said, 30,000 people leave the country every year and 13,000 of those go to Britain.  I accept that many of those leave voluntarily.  We have always been very much aware of emigration, and particularly so in the 1980s.  The needs of emigrants do not get so much attention now because the trend is in the other direction.  Thirty thousand people is half the population of my home county.  Thirteen thousand people going to Britain is more than the population of the town in which I live.  This is a sizeable number of people and I thank the Senator for focusing our attention on their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worked abroad on three occasions for lengthy periods &mdash; in the United States, the Netherlands and Germany.  I was lucky because I went with an education and with good information and back up.  It was by choice that I went.  We must record and recognise the positive aspects of emigration. Many Irish people, like me, got a chance to learn new skills abroad, to broaden our horizons and maybe to appreciate a little bit more what we had <Col N="405" /> at home.  This has enriched Irish life and helped to contribute to the success and development that we have seen in recent years.</P>
    <P>I support Senator O'Dowd's suggestion that a Minister of State be given responsibility for working across the various Departments to co-ordinate the support provided for emigrants.  The Minister of State indicated that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Foreign Affairs are mainly involved in funding, while the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has produced excellent guides.  Many people are doing good work but it needs to be properly focused to ensure that needs are being met and that information is disseminated and backup provided where it is needed.</P>
    <P>I compliment successive Ministers, especially over the past two to three years, including former Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring and Mr. Ray Burke, who have ensured that increased funding has been provided to the DÍON committee and for the Foreign Affairs Vote.  It is never easy to read a book of Estimates, but it would appear that the Estimate for DÍON will increase by £13,000 next year while the Estimate for Foreign Affairs is due to fall by £16,000.  Perhaps further information following the budget announcements will be made.  Will the Minister of State clarify the exact amount of money to be provided?  Most Members will probably agree that more will be needed than that which will be provided.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney is more proficient than I in the area of broadcasting and communications.  On my visits to the Offaly County Association in London over the years I often heard complaints that it was very difficult for members to receive RTÉ Radio One.  The improvements in broadcasting, especially through the Astra satellite and the provision of short-wave communication broadcasts for the major games and other events has been a big help.  I compliment RTÉ on its work and would encourage it to do more to ensure that reception of our home news and current affairs is provided, especially in the other continents.</P>
    <P>Everybody is in favour of voting rights, but there are different views on the practical measures required.  I encourage the Minister for the Environment and Local Government not to be disheartened by the lack of a positive response to the proposals tabled for consideration and debate by the previous Minister.  These pleased nobody but that is no reason for the Minister not to return to the subject.  I encourage him to use this House to table proposals for discussion.  If we apply our minds to the problem we could agree on provisions regarding voting rights which, on the one hand, would genuinely recognise the fact that Irish people abroad are still citizens of this State while, on the other hand, would meet with the broadest possible political consensus necessary to enshrine it in law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> I am delighted that this motion on the needs of Irish people abroad has also focused attention on the needs of people from other countries living in this country.  Deputy Callely's ill-advised remarks at least prompted debate on an important issue in this and the other House.  Anybody who is tempted to make derogatory, ill-tempered or ill-conceived statements regarding the position of people from other countries resident in this country, either on a temporary or a permanent basis, would do well to first think of all of the issues for which we have fought for Irish emigrants in other countries and, following that, I am confident their remarks will be better tempered.  In this regard, there is an obligation on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that the Refugee Act is implemented.  Its speedy implementation will assist in ensuring that any attempt to whip up racial or ethnic tension will be quickly stamped out.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a special plea for the county associations in Britain.  Many of them find it difficult to keep going because there is no-one to take the place of many of those emigrants from the 1950s and 1960s who were actively involved. Young emigrants perhaps do not have the same cause to depend on support from them.  I also wish to record my appreciation of the work of groups such as the Oblate Fathers, especially the work of a fellow parishioner, Fr. Tommy Scully, who did great work through the years.  I wish him well.  I appeal to local authorities to make a special effort to have included in next year's Estimates a specific provision for support for their county associations in Britain.  Over the past couple of years we in County Offaly have started on a small basis to support our associations in London and Manchester.  It would not take too much money in the context of a local authority budget, but it would be greatly appreciated.  I appeal to Senators who are members of local authorities to take the matter up with their colleagues.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.  He provided much new information.  I also thank my colleagues on all sides of the House for their gracious comments with regard to the initiative taken on this motion. It is gratifying and is another example of the environment of consensus in the House on motions such as this, which is a serious social issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Henry, I was aware of the context in which the motion was framed.  The Senator will be aware that I took an active role on the other side of the House during the debate on the Refugee Bill.  I share the views expressed by Members on this and hope that perhaps the pending High Court <Col N="407" /> case will be dispensed with to allow the legislation take effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher's proposal that local authorities support their county associations is excellent and should be widely circulated.  I hope they will encourage their office holders, their cathaoirligh and leas-chathaoirligh, to attend functions, be they in England, Australia, New Zealand, America, Benin or Upper Volta.  Those of us who have been fortunate enough to attend social functions organised by our county associations and by Irish societies will testify to the value placed on our presence, not because of ourselves but because of the office we hold or the message we convey from our people at home.  It also relates to the comments made by Senators Taylor-Quinn, Henry, Ó Murchú and others about the inclusive nature of the Irish diaspora.  They feel Irish.  The fact that they live thousands of miles away makes no difference.  Similarly, the distance of the generations makes no difference; second and third generation Americans feel Irish.</P>
    <P>Regarding the points raised by the Minister of State, I welcome the reference to homelessness. This issue arose in the past week to ten days. Senator O'Dowd referred to the horrifying statistics The Minister said that one of the priority areas is homelessness and that the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have agreed the two Governments will develop closer co-operation in the east-west context.  Perhaps the British-Irish Parliamentary Body might have a role in that regard, in that it could monitor it through its sub-committees Time did not allow him to elaborate on the exact nature of the initiative.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to him for his commitment to reflect on the proposal about Boston.  I appreciate his point that one cannot single out an area.  However, Boston has made this proposal which could be applied to other areas because it does not involve a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>I suggest the role of DÍON and the emigration working committee be widened to include Irish based organisations and individuals.  For example, why should someone like Fr. Byrne or his organisation not be included on DÍON?  It is an exclusively London based grouping of seven worthy people.  I had the honour to serve on its predecessor, the Committee on Welfare Services Abroad, for five years from the late 1970s until Deputy Quinn, the then Minister for Labour, abolished it and established DÍON.</P>
    <P>However, he narrowed the focus too much &mdash; it went from the extreme of having too many people from this country on the original body to having only one or two on the new body.  It is 14 years since DÍON was established and it is time for it to be reviewed.  Perhaps it should have a wider role in the context of pre-emigration information and education.  I was interested to learn that the emigration committee is exclusive to the New York area.  Perhaps the Minister of State might consider including on it a representative from Boston, which is just down the road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> Not many people know of the existence of the interdepartmental committee which was established in 1988.  I agree it is working very well and is providing an input into Government.  However, despite its status as an interdepartmental group, could its reports and recommendations come into the public arena so that we would have some idea of Government thinking on the issue?  Perhaps its structure may not allow that, but it would be a valuable input into the ongoing wider public debate.</P>
    <P>I have always fully agreed with votes for emigrants, although the structuring of that is a matter for Government.  When I was an emigrant I was always annoyed by the fact I could not vote in Irish elections.  I am grateful to the Minister of State for coming to the House so close to Christmas.  I know he has every sympathy with, and understanding of, the case which was made here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am sorry the Minister for Health and Children is not here himself because this is a very important topic.</P>
      <P>This week the Minister has been dealing publicly and in the other House with the possible transmission of infection by a blood product. While the possibility of the infectious agent which causes CJD being passed on in this way is most remote, I want to ask the Minister to deal urgently with another matter &mdash; the transmission of HIV infection from mother to unborn child.  If the Department of Health and Children does not deal with this now, there is a definite possibility of successful litigation by children who are so infected.</P>
      <P>While there have been major advances in the past few years in the treatment of HIV infection, it still remains an incurable and ultimately lethal condition.  Testing for the presence of HIV infection is voluntary, but in view of the fact that early treatment gives better results people are becoming less reluctant to undergo testing.  For one group of those infected with HIV, testing is of extreme importance, that group consists of infected children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking at the Foundation Day meeting at Crumlin Children's Hospital recently, my colleague, Dr. Karina Butler, who is a consultant in <Col N="409" /> paediatrics and paediatric infectious diseases, discussed the need for antenatal testing of pregnant women for HIV infection.</P>
    <P>About 7 per cent of all persons who test positive for HIV infection in this country are children and nearly 100 per cent of these test positive because of infection in their mothers.  There is a vertical transmission of HIV from mother to unborn child.  Not all HIV positive mothers infect their children but about 30 per cent do during pregnancy, labour or delivery.  Dr. Butler pointed out:</P>
    <P>It is now possible to intervene during pregnancy to dramatically reduce this transmission rate.  In 1994 a seminal study published by Connor et al (Connor E, et al, New England Journal of Medicine, 1994, 331, 1173) conclusively demonstrated the benefits of administering antiretroviral therapy, zidovudine, to pregnant women; the transmission rate remained at 25 per cent among those who received a placebo compared with 8 per cent in those receiving zidovudine.  This has since been replicated in other studies.  Even more optimistically, with the advent of more effective therapies, viral monitoring during pregnancy, and possibly for some deliveries by caesarean section, it is anticipated that this transmission rate can be further reduced to possibly 2 to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is an incredible reduction.  These findings mean that for most children HIV is a preventable disease if HIV infection in their mothers is recognised early in pregnancy.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we rely on women who feel they are at risk of having contracted HIV infection to identify themselves.  We carry out unlinked testing on throwaway blood samples to ascertain the level of infection in pregnant women in general. From a combination of these results we know that many women do not realise they are infected. HIV infection is strongly linked to intravenous drug abuse but, in many cases, the drug use may not be by the woman but by her partner.  Dr. Butler concluded that &ldquo;relying on self disclosure by women of their risk status is an unreliable way to detect HIV infection in women&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For all screening programmes three conditions must be fulfilled: first, there must be a test that is scientific and specific, which we have; second, there should be an available intervention, which, as I said, now exists; and, third, there should be a significant prevalence of the disease, which, unfortunately, there is.  Anonymous antenatal screening between 1992 and 1995 showed a prevalence in the Eastern Health Board area of one in 2,675 pregnant women and outside the Eastern Health Board area of one in 21,436 pregnant women.  In the Rotunda Hospital, where I work and which has many inner city patients, in a paper published by Dr. Mary Cafferkey and her co-workers in 1997 there was a prevalence of one in 1,800.  There are indications that while the incidence is not rising in the Eastern Health Board area it is increasing outside it; therefore, <Col N="410" /> testing should not be in the Eastern Health Board area only.</P>
    <P>Based on the prevalence of HIV infection in Ireland, ranging from one in 1,800 to one in 21,400 and tests costing £1.94 each, it would cost about £3,000 to £35,000 to detect each infected child.  The cost of managing a child with AIDS for one year has been estimated at £36,000 sterling by a study carried out in St. Mary's Hospital, London.</P>
    <P>On a cost basis alone, this clearly justified the immediate routine screening of pregnant women. However, what about the hidden costs?  Can we deny unborn children the right to live without HIV infection?  It is not just the suffering of these children and the grief of their death which matters, but the reality that with current therapies these children will grow to sexual maturity.  The infected children of today will be the infected teenagers of tomorrow and sources of infection to others through sexual contact, as has happened in the United States of America.  They will also be sources of vertical transmission to their children.</P>
    <P>We already screen newborn babies for hypothyroidism which occurs in one in 3,500 births; phenylketoninea, which occurs in one in 4,500; galactosemia, which occurs in one in 19,000; homocysteinuria, which occurs in one in 63,000; and maple syrup urine disease, which occurs in one in 120,000.  The likelihood of a child being born with HIV is much greater, yet we do not test for this.  It is imperative that we now screen for HIV in pregnant women on a routine basis.</P>

      <P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.  I thank Senator Henry for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>The issue of HIV/AIDS continues to be a priority in the Department of Health and Children Since the publication of the national AIDS strategy in 1992 there has been a concerted effort on the part of the Department, in consultation with a range of health and education professionals, to work towards reducing the overall number of people who become infected with HIV and in providing the best possible treatment and care for those who are HIV positive or who have AIDS.</P>
      <P>The report of the national AIDS strategy committee has four main components to its recommendations &mdash; care and management of persons with HIV/AIDS; HIV/AIDS surveillance; education and prevention strategies and measures to avoid discrimination against persons with HIV/ AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four separate sub-committees were set up to deal with each of these elements.  A number of programmes have been undertaken by the surveillance <Col N="411" /> sub-committee, one of which includes a programme on the anonymous unlinked testing of pregnant women attending ante-natal clinics. It was important from the outset of this programme that the information gathered was anonymous and unlinked because of the confidentiality aspect for the client.</P>
    <P>The report on the results of the first four years of this screening programme became available in June 1997 and covers a four year period from October 1992 to December 1996.  Out of a total of 222,687 tests, 37 were confirmed HIV positive, giving a rate of 0.017 per cent, one in 6,019, confirming a lower prevalence in this population group than in other European countries.  The report also showed that the prevalence rate for the Eastern Health Board area, 0.032 per cent, was nearly four times higher than the rate for other health boards combined, 0.009 per cent. The results from this population group will help to improve the information provided to service planners for HIV and AIDS and will allow interventions to be focused more effectively on this target group.</P>
    <P>There is no ongoing routine linked testing for women in ante-natal clinics.  However, women wishing to have a HIV test are appropriately counselled and tested and results furnished to them, once again with appropriate counselling where necessary in ante-natal clinics.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, because of recent advancements in the effectiveness of drug therapies for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and in the resulting improvement in health outcomes for both mothers and their babies, the question of testing all pregnant women for HIV on a routine basis has become an issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has not yet come to a firm conclusion about it either way. Some of the questions which do arise, however, are whether a nationwide screening programme would be justified, given the generally low incidence of the virus among pregnant women.  Would it, for example, make more sense to concentrate our education and prevention strategies, and testing as well, on those most likely to be at risk?   The Minister is also aware that the question of routine testing of pregnant women for HIV is arising in other jurisdictions and there might be something to be learned from the experiences there.</P>
    <P>This question has also been raised at the national AIDS strategy committee and the Minister is anxious to have the views of the committee before coming to a definitive decision.  The Minister asked me to assure Senator Henry that he is aware of her concerns in addition to those working in the field and that he will be keeping these in mind in his consideration of the matter.</P>

I am disappointed the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is not in the House to take this matter but I am sure the Minister of State is fully briefed on all aspects of local authorities.</P>
      <P>As a former member of the Local Authority Members' Association, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is the one person all the local authority members look to for guidance.  They place their trust in him that more powers will be given to local authorities in the next couple of months.  I also wish the Minister for the Environment and Local Government well in his portfolio.  It is appropriate that this matter be dealt with at this time as the Minister is bringing about changes in the structure and funding of local authorities. There will be no change in local authorities unless they are given powers to raise funds and change their structures.</P>
      <P>This matter relates to members' attendance and expenses for attending local authority meetings. We are all aware that if members do not attend at least 80 per cent of local authority meetings, they will not be paid.  It is right that members should not be paid for meetings which they have not attended.  If a member is sick, allowances should be made.  A local authority should have discretion in relation to members' expenses, particularly if they have been ill.  It is unfair if a member, who is sick for 30 per cent of meetings and attends the remaining 70 per cent, does not qualify for payment for attendance.  I hope the Minister will consider this matter in the review of the local authority system and give local authorities discretion so that they may decide if a member is genuinely sick and should be paid for attending meetings.</P>
      <P>I raise the question of county enterprise boards.  A number of local authority members are on county enterprise boards and they do not qualify for expenses.  It is unfair that members of local authorities must sit with other board members on county enterprise boards who qualify.  We all appreciate the value of the work they do.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Burke for sharing his time.  I endorse the sentiments expressed in relation to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace.  I would like to make a plea for councillors who are absent on council business. They are marked absent and are not allowed claim travel and subsistence expenses.  Local authority members in the Dublin area have the same problem with the partnership and urban boards as other members have with the county enterprise boards.  It is a diminution of the role of the councillor to expect people to travel to meetings at their own expense.  In case I sound too petty, I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that Dublin councillors lost one third of their yearly allowances when meetings were capped.  In the area I represent and in other growing urban areas, there are, in some cases, only three councillors per 30,000 voters.  It is most unfair and I do not know of any other sector in society which would have lost allowances without an outcry.</P>
      <P>Councillors are the front-line troops in our democracy.  If we do not get proper remuneration, we are telling society that only well-off people can run for election or people who are subsidised by trade unions or other groups. People will be unable to go forward for election unless the Minister, in whom I have great faith, comes forward with realistic funding proposals. The labourer is always worthy of his hire.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Burke and Senator Ridge for their comments.  I will bring the points raised to the Minister's attention.  Councillors receive an annual expenses allowance designed to cater for attendance at meetings of the council and its committees.  A booklet outlining the system was distributed to all councillors on its introduction in January 1994.  The allowance is calculated by reference to a formula which is designed to meet reasonable expenses for travel and subsistence, as well as an element for postage, telephone and miscellaneous representational expenses.  The annual allowance system was reviewed in 1995 following which some improvements were made.  For example, increases in the travel and subsistence rates for senior local authority officials are now automatically passed on to councillors.  There has been a number of such increases.</P>
      <P>The expenses allowance for city and county councillors is by its very nature related to attendance at council meetings.  At the time the system was being introduced, councillors themselves sought an attendance requirement.  However, I want to make it clear that councillors do not have to attend all the relevant council meetings to qualify for the full allowance; a tolerance of up to 20 per cent non attendance still qualifies.  A 50 per cent attendance requirement is all that is necessary to qualify for the full representational element of the allowance.</P>
      <P>Members of the House would agree that the reduced attendance requirement, as outlined, for what is substantially an allowance to cover necessary travel and subsistence costs, is reasonable by any standard.  Moreover, the reduced attendance thresholds go a fair distance to catering for situations where, in the normal course, councillors are unable to attend through illness.  However, to be more generous in this regard would seriously call into question the current tax free status of the expenses allowance.  As Members may be aware, the system had to be approved by the Revenue Commissioners in this respect at the time of its introduction in 1994 and again when the improvements were made arising from the review in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the strategic policy committees will call for some adjustment in the councillors' expenses system.  Guidelines on the establishment and operation of the SPCs have been recently issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to city and county councils.  A review of the expenses system has now commenced and data is being sought from local authorities.  While the review is at an early stage, the Minister considers that it will <Col N="415" /> result in some increase in the present level of expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has left the door open by saying there is some room for improvement and that when the strategy policy committees are put in place, there will be an adjustment in the councillors' expenses system.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will convey our views to the Minister who will consider them when carrying out his review.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise this matter, which relates to the lack of a Sunday midday train service to the west.  There is no train from Dublin to the west on a Sunday.  The line from Athlone to Westport and Ballina, the only line which has no midday service on a Sunday, is especially affected.  This is regrettable and must be changed.  There is widespread public concern as for the past number of Sundays the evening train which leaves at 6.00 p.m. has been full to capacity with at least 200 <Col N="416" /> people having to stand.  This underlines the fact that a midday service would not be a loss maker for Iarnród Éireann.  There is a demand for such a service and it should be provided.</P>
      <P>The tourism season, during which air traffic into Dublin begins early in the morning, will start after Christmas.  Those arriving who have to continue their journey to the west must wait until 6.00 p.m. on Sundays before they can get a service to carry them home.  I would like the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to request the management of Iarnród Éireann to provide a midday service forthwith for the people of the west, especially those living in its outer limits. There is a service to Portarlington but no service to Westport or Ballina at midday on Sundays.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has a duty to the public to provide this service and to eliminate the conditions prevailing on the trains which depart from Heuston on Sunday evenings.</P>
