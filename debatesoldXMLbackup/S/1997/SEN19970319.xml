      <P>I have notice from Senator Mulcahy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide the necessary funds to enable the erection of a security fence around Bishop Galvin and Bishop Shanahan schools in Templeogue, given the repeated acts of vandalism which have occurred and are regularly occurring at these schools.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the proposed extension to the Salesian secondary college, Pallaskenry, County Limerick, is completed in 1997.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to confirm that Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh will go to tender and commence construction in 1997.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to honour the existing agreement in which school transport is provided for post-primary pupils from Dysart, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the extension to Illistrin national school, Letterkenny, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Mulcahy's and Senator Neville's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <Col N="870" /> I also have notice of a matter of concern from Senator Neville under Standing Order 30.  It will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items 1, 2 and 29, motion 24.  Item 1 will be taken at the end of the Order of Business until 6 p.m., item 2 from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. and item 29, motion 24, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  I suggest 20 minutes per speaker on item 1.</P>

      <P>I take it that if item 1 does not conclude by 6 p.m. it will conclude on another day.</P>
      <P>On 5 February I proposed an all-party motion on the Nirex centre and the Leader agreed; all the parties of the House agreed to demand that the British Government not proceed with the Nirex dumps so this week's decision must be welcomed. I said at the time it was a national issue and that was a national victory.  We should build on one or two aspects of that decision.  For the first time the British Government recognises the legitimate Irish interest in that issue and recognised its obligations to other states in relation to nuclear waste and Sellafield.  I now ask that the House unite again behind a further motion to ensure that the aging 30 year old nuclear reactors be destroyed and that their waste, which has been declared a health risk, be dealt with safely.</P>
      <P>We should be putting pressure on the German Government not to send any more waste to Thorp.  I ask the Leader to consider my proposal that we unite, again, in the national interest on this important issue.  I commend all those who have been involved in helping the British Government to come to what was an important decision for the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo what Senator Wright has said.  The manner in which the Nirex executives sought to conceal the seriousness of the situation adds weight to Senator Wright's request.  At the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body we were exposed to the justifications by the Nirex chief executive.  The sanctimonious self-righteousness of the presentation showed just how far these people have a sense of complacency and are trapped in a certain scientific, technological mindset which refuses to accept as serious the concerns of ordinary people.  As Nirex is son of Sellafield in many respects, I am quite sure the same mindset prevails among the Sellafield people.  What has happened over Nirex gives further support to Senator Wright's request that we push as hard as possible on Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks that have been made about Nirex.  While I welcome the decision that has been taken I agree that it is only half the story and much more needs to be done to get rid of the inherent dangers in the facility. There has been huge complacency in Britain at <Col N="871" /> official level regarding that facility.  It is worth recording that the public inquiry into Sellafield was conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture in Whitehall.  One wonders about the relevance of that ministry to the activities of nuclear energy.</P>
      <P>Last week I raised the hepatitis C issue and in his reply on the Order of Business the Leader indicated there would be a debate on the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  As we are all aware, things have developed even more seriously since that report was issued last week.  There is a great cloud hanging over the activities of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  In my view it has come to the point where the board should be replaced and an alternative way found of supplying blood to those who require it.  This is an extremely serious matter and one the House needs to examine in detail.  It is important that the Minister attend the House.  We must establish who is accountable because there seems to be a tremendous lack of accountability in all this.  In addition to having such a debate there should be questions to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I noted today that a senior official in the Blood Transfusion Service Board said there was embarrassment over the incident that had taken place. It is only today that a letter of apology has issued for an incident which took place some time ago. That is not acceptable and we will have to give it due attention in the House.  The Leader has said he hopes the matter will be debated before Easter.</P>
      <P>The other matter I wish to raise concerns the unfortunate death of a young person in Cork as a result of joyriding.  There was a suggestion that the Garda Síochána is restrained from using so-called &ldquo;stinger&rdquo; spikes to puncture car tyres.  I understand that this measure is covered in the legislation but it is a question of bringing it into effect to allow the spikes to be used.  As things stand, gardaí are only able to use them in particular circumstances and joyriding is not one of them.  The provision is in the legislation, however, and that part of the Act should become operational. I would ask the Leader to investigate the matter with a view to implementing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright who raised the question of Nirex.  I welcome the decision of the British Government not to proceed with the dump facility.  The British authorities have acknowledged the legitimate interests of the Irish Government and people in regard to the issue.  I also support the Senator's second point that the question of Sellafield must be raised again in a determined manner.  We should pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, who has been extremely tenacious in pursuing Government policy on the issue as well as the interests of people both here and in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the hepatitis C issue and the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  It is absolutely <Col N="872" /> inexcusable that the board has again made a mistake in contacting a woman who had contracted hepatitis C through anti-D.  At the same time it is irresponsible to suggest we can suddenly find another method of supplying blood.  We must have a continuous supply of blood for a great many people around the country who are dependent on it, whether on a regular basis or once off as the result of an accident.  It is not as simple as saying that the Blood Transfusion Service Board should be disbanded.  I was dismayed by the interview with Deputy Harney on <i>Morning Ireland</i> this morning.  She did not address the real issues concerning the question of having a safe and reliable supply of blood in which the public can have confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is not as simple as disbanding the board and finding an alternative way to supply blood.  That does not advance the safety of blood supplies and finding the truth.  I support the decision by the Minister for Health to transfer the board to the grounds of a public hospital to ensure proper accountability.  Deputy Harney's proposals go too far in this regard.</P>
      <P>It was announced today that a Bill will be introduced by the Minister for Education to raise the school leaving age to 16 and to tackle the problems of truancy and young people not attending school.  Perhaps we could speed up its passage through the Houses by introducing it in the Seanad.  I ask the Leader to make inquiries in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the recent joyriding accidents in Cork, where a young girl was killed, and in Limerick, where a garda was seriously injured, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice to consider reintroducing the use of the cat o' nine tails or the cane.  The people committing such crimes are 14 and 15 years of age and they have no regard for law and order.  We need a form of punishment to act as a deterrent.  If anyone else injured or killed a garda they would get life in prison, but these people are getting away with it.  It would only cost the taxpayer £60 or £70 a week to keep them in Loughlin House.  The Minister should consider introducing such forms of punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright.  I visited the Nirex site on two occasions and I was delighted that Mr. John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, refused the application on appeal.  The initial application was refused by Cumbria County Council which, together with a number of local authorities, voiced their concerns about the site.  If we want to close Sellafield we must harness the goodwill already established among the local authorities in England.  We must bring home to the British people the problems Sellafield could cause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always tried to be careful when speaking about the hepatitis C issue because of my involvement with patients.  It is the most appalling therapeutic disaster we have had in this country but we must be careful and measured in what we say.</P>
      <P>I was extremely sorry this morning to hear a politician giving clinical advice to patients to think carefully before having blood transfusions. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health, who has no medical qualifications or expertise in transfusion medicine as far as I know, to issue a statement that patients should be guided by their clinicians who have their best interests at heart.</P>
      <P>I feel particularly strongly about the maternity services.  During the 1960s the major cause of death in women of child bearing age was haemorrhage. This has now ceased.  I would be deeply disturbed if a woman going for an elective caesarean section would be guided in what she said to her clinician about receiving blood by a non-qualified person.  I would also be concerned about patients going for elective operations where blood might be required being obliged to take the advice of someone who, as far as I know, has no expertise in transfusion medicine.</P>
      <P>I was extraordinarily critical of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and I insisted on a debate in the Seanad when I discovered I had been deceived by it.  I support those who say everything must be done to ensure that blood is of the highest possible standard.  However, we must be extraordinarily careful about those less fortunate than us who are lying on hospital beds and being given advice by people who are not expert in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis' comments on the joyriding problem in Cork.  In the last month two lives have been lost while another person has been seriously injured.  There have been ongoing discussions on the crime and justice issues in both Houses of the Oireachtas and attempts have been made to solve the joyriding and other criminal problems.  It is surprising that the gardaí still cannot use spikes to deal with joyriding. Why is that?  There is great concern in the Cork region about this matter.</P>
      <P>There should be a serious discussion about the comments by the Central Bank on living costs in the east of Ireland.  We might have an opportunity for such a discussion when the Seanad deals with the Finance Bill.  Would the Leader ask the Minister of Finance to come to the House to discuss this matter?  There is a danger of an increase in interest rates and consequent price increases because of increased costs in the eastern region, particularly in property costs.  Would it be possible to have a discussion on this issue in the Seanad since it is already being discussed in business circles and in the Central Bank?  We must ensure this problem does not destroy the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest hepatitis C scandal is worrying.  The Minister does not appear to be in control.  The fact that a hepatitis C sufferer was asked to give blood, even though the judicial inquiry was in the middle of its proceedings, undermines confidence.  It was a highly incompetent action.  It is insensitive that such a thing should happen and everybody is extremely concerned about it.  It is up to the Minister to deal with it but he does not appear to have his finger on the public pulse in this regard.  He should have been extremely vigilant to ensure that such a thing would not happen.  However, it did happen and it is a matter of great concern for everybody who is trying to convince the public that everything will be all right.  If the Minister intends to carry out his job he must create confidence in the blood supply.  The House should urge him to deal strongly with this matter or, if he cannot do his job, he should step aside and let others deal with it.</P>
      <P>I read this morning that the school leaving age is to be increased to 16 years.  I have no difficulty with that policy as in most schools children automatically remain in school beyond school leaving age.  However, in certain areas children do not even want to stay in school beyond the age of 13 or 14 years.  How can we devise a system to deal with those pupils?  It is easy to offer platitudes about truancy and dropping out of school but would the Minister come to the House for a full debate on such issues before she issues statements? The principals of schools do not know what this statement really means.  There should be a full discussion with the Minister about it and I ask the Leader to facilitate such a discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>A potentially damaging situation has arisen in sugar beet growing areas as a result of the failure of the IFA and Greencore to reach agreement on the price for the 1997 crop. The IFA has urged farmers and beef producers to boycott products and fertilisers produced by Interchem and Grassland Fertilisers, respectively. As a result, those not directly involved in the dispute will suffer and jobs will be lost.</P>
      <P>During the next six weeks the sugar beet crop will be sown and time is not on our side if we are to take action in respect of this potentially serious situation.  Intervention at the highest level, perhaps by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, might be helpful.  I urge the Leader to encourage both sides to enter negotiations before serious damage is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to consider framing a resolution to urge the establishment of a full international judicial inquiry into the slaughter of people on Bloody Sunday in Derry? I am sure the Leader shares my concerns about the most recent revelations which suggest that state-sponsored terrorism occurred on that day. My views on this matter became further entrenched when Mr. Heath argued that what happened in Tiananmen Square, which was in <Col N="875" /> line with views expressed by Mr. Kitson at the time, was a perfectly legitimate approach on the part of the Chinese state.  There can be no confidence that the Widgery Tribunal or the British judiciary are in any position to carry out a judicial inquiry and it is time an international inquiry into this slaughter took place.</P>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming the decision on Nirex.  I endorse statements by Senator Wright and others that the halfway stage has been reached.  However, the problem of Sellafield remains to be addressed.  Ministers and Ministers of State in successive Governments must be complimented because they held a good line on this issue.  The pressure must be maintained.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding comments by Senator Henry, confidence is significantly important if the Blood Transfusion Service Board is to be accepted as legitimate.  There is so much evidence of incompetence and maladministration that it is time to dismantle the BTSB and put in place a body which can win the confidence of the public.  That lamentable organisation has placed itself completely outside the pale.  I share Senator Henry's concerns about people about to undergo operations because everyone must have confidence in surgical procedures and one of the most important of these is blood transfusions.</P>
      <P>There have been some welcome changes in the circumstances of Róisín McAliskey.  However, it is time the German and British judicial authorities brought her case to a conclusion.  Ms McAliskey is innocent and it is extraordinary to hear her being referred to in certain terms by right-wing British Tories touting votes.  It is time the judicial authorities involved realised that justice delayed is justice denied.  As an innocent person, Róisín McAliskey is entitled to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming the decision on Nirex which, with Sellafield, has been the subject of discussion for a number of years.  This House championed the campaign to highlight the issue of Sellafield and current and former Ministers and Ministers of State must be congratulated for their work in bringing this issue to the attention of people throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Dardis and others in expressing concern about recent appalling joyriding incidents in counties Cork and Limerick.  A young Garda in the first weeks of his career is lucky to be alive, almost every bone in his body has been broken.  The Minister has introduced measures. Will they be stepped up and introduced in areas outside Dublin?  The situation has improved immensely as a result of changes in Dublin but there are difficulties in other cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we need a safe supply of blood and a board that will ensure its safety. That is the only thing that will give confidence to <Col N="876" /> those who receive blood transfusions.  I do not want to see any more victims as a result of incompetence or negligence on the part of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The Minister acknowledged the first recommendation in Mr. Justice Finlay's report which was that the blood bank should be closed down and moved to a new site. If the board is not capable of delivering a safe blood supply to people who require it, it should move aside and its members should be replaced. I was amazed to hear officials from the blood bank say today they were dealing with an antiquated system.  It is extraordinary that the safety of the blood supply and the effective running of the BTSB is not the number one item on the agenda of the Minister for Health.  It is the number one health issue and has been for a long time. The Minister must take political responsibility and deliver on that.  Then, we will be happy.</P>

      <P>With the spotlight on the food industry following recent newspaper articles will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to instigate an information campaign on genetically modified organisms and their alleged risks to the food chain?  Will he also ask him to ensure genetically manipulated foods are labelled as this is not the case at present?  The public are worried about these types of food due to a lack of information.  Will the Leader provide time for a debate on genetic engineering in food and cloning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to implement the law regarding wandering horses?  Last week on my way to Dublin, three horses crossed the Sligo-Belfast by-pass.  It was a miracle an accident did not occur.  Last night on my way to Dublin I witnessed an accident where a horse was killed and a truck jackknifed.  It could have been a serious accident.  Do we have to wait for more people to be killed before stray horses are rounded up?  The Bill was passed by the Oireachtas and it is time those wandering animals were taken off the roads around Dublin.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the media to be more careful when reporting incidents in the North.  In Dromore peace was restored.  The Orangemen, Nationalists and Sinn Féin agreed to allow a march to pass through the village but, because it was highlighted by the media, hard line Orangemen have said there is no agreement.  It would be more beneficial if the media kept quiet until the event was over.  We have to be very careful where Northern Ireland and the restoration of peace is concerned. It is a delicate instrument and issues should not be highlighted that will cause more interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with those who have raised the question of joyriding.  It is called &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; but there is no joy in it for those who are killed.  I agree with Senator Bohan, though many people might not. The day of psychiatry and psychology is gone.  We have been dealing with this problem for 20 years and we have a disastrous situation.  The day of <Col N="877" /> sitting such people down to try and talk sense to them is gone.  Queen Victoria did not bring in harsh rules because she enjoyed doing it; it was a case of having to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we may have to reintroduce Victorian laws because we cannot allow teenagers to take the lives of gardaí.  A deliberate attack was made on the garda in Limerick when a teenager drove a car over him.  Do we intend to stand by and allow that to happen or will we take a strong line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Henry on unqualified people making comments on radio about the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Politicians must be careful what they say at a time when there is a shortage of blood.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board depends on voluntary donations.  This is an extremely sensitive and emotional issue and we should be careful what we say in this regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell mentioned Dromore where a decision was taken by both communities on parades marching through the town this summer. Suddenly, outside influences became apparent&mdash; I do not blame the media &mdash; in the Orange Order in relation to Sinn Féin and the decision was squandered.  It was the first time a step was taken in the right direction.  It is important we send a message to party leaders to get the Anglo-Irish secretariat to work as quickly as possible and the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Office to do something to instigate talks on the marching season.  I have no doubt the madmen in Northern Ireland are gearing up for a long hot summer which will be worse than anything we have seen heretofore.  Everything should be done to try to remove tension from the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my sympathy to the family of the victim tragically killed by a car thief in Cork this weekend.  This raises fundamental issues.  I suppose we should be careful what we say as regards zero tolerance.  There should be mandatory reporting of children who are expelled from school.  At present there is a huge problem as regards children who have been expelled from secondary schools because of involvement in anti-social behaviour, drugs, etc.  There is nothing for these children to do.  It is time we had a debate on this matter as these children are being thrown on the scrap heap because of a misdemeanour in school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education has not issued guidelines in this regard and social services do not follow up cases where children have been expelled from school for anti-social behaviour.  It is time we had a debate on delinquency.  Perhaps mandatory rehabilitation, which has been successful in the United States, should be considered. Delinquency, joyriding, etc., are serious <Col N="878" /> problems and it is time we had a full debate involving the Department of Education and the Department of Health to ensure that, once and for all, we solve these problems and remove the burden from teachers who cannot cope because there are no backup services.</P>

      <P>I am sure it is an indication of better things to come from other Galway teams this year.</P>
      <P>Unless something is done, the game of hurling may be priced out of existence.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to examine the price of hurleys, particularly in relation to VAT?  Will the Minister consider removing VAT from hurleys? This situation has pertained for many years but nobody has done anything about it.  The Minister might consider allowing clubs, which are finding it difficult to survive, to claim a rebate on the VAT they pay on hurleys.  It is important that our national game of hurling is nurtured, cared for and cultivated and this would be a means of doing so.</P>

      <P>I refer to the breakdown of law and order, especially the incident in Limerick which has resulted in trainee Garda Keating from Kilbaha in west Clare being seriously injured in the Limerick Regional Hospital.  Will the Leader convey our serious concerns about what is taking place to the Minister for Justice and ask what action she proposes to take, especially with vicious and well organised attacks on members of the Garda Síochána?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to state the outcome of negotiations he had in Brussels in the past few days for compensation payments for farmers as a result of fluctuations in the green pound and the fallout from the BSE outbreak?  Will he draw the Minister's attention to the crisis small dairy farmers have suffered in the past year because of the payment of levies and super levies?  In allocating the package the Minister negotiated, I ask that he take account of small family farms which have been severely penalised in the past few years and that some allocation be made to them.</P>

      <P>I offer sympathies to the family in Cork and to the young Garda in Limerick who were victims of joyriding.  Will the Leader clarify whether the trainee garda is fully insured because of his trainee status?  A rumour, widespread in Limerick on St. Patrick's Day, is that he does not have the same insurance protection as a fully trained garda.</P>

      <Col N="879" /> For decades, we built huge housing estates without providing any form of recreation facilities and no programmes were initiated to cater for the youth of those estates.  It is little wonder then that one or two in each large estate take to stealing cars and driving them at reckless speeds.  They are a danger to themselves and to the inhabitants of the estates.  As public representatives we have much to answer for because we have let them down.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with Senator Bohan's call to deal harshly with joyriders. These young criminals no longer fear the law.  The Minister for Justice would have everyone's support in immediately introducing stricter measures to tackle the problem.  Seanad Éireann is united today in calling for these measures.</P>

      <P>In light of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht making known his proposals for forthcoming legislation for a super broadcasting authority, will the Leader arrange for a discussion on this?  The Minister has been very supportive of the House and perhaps he will come before us for a discussion on this matter.  There are farreaching changes involved.  I am happy with the RTÉ Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission but the Minister's proposals are farreaching.  I know they will not be implemented before the general election, but a debate to enlighten his civil servants on the attitude of the House towards these changes would be helpful.</P>

Our farm produce enjoy an excellent image and it could be necessary to debate this process in the near future to ensure that our food standards and quality remain high.  This process is causing considerable concern.  I have received a number of representations, as I am sure most Members have.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Justice has carried out her duties in a splendid manner and has introduced much important criminal law legislation.  There is a necessity to further tighten laws, particularly in the context of gardaí being attacked over the <Col N="880" /> weekend and squad cars being damaged.  Is the Leader aware that quite a number of rows have taken place in which different types of implements, such as pickaxes and billhooks, have been used?  There should be an examination of the situation where cases of such a serious nature are heard in a District Court where the maximum sentence is two years.  These cases should be heard in the Circuit Court to show society's abhorrence of what is happening.  Joyriding offences should also be heard in the Circuit Court and it is also essential that they be heard expeditiously.  Delays result in people thinking the crime has gone unpunished and that a sense of urgency is absent.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate on this matter?</P>

      <P>There were many contributors today but a number of the issues raised were covered by several speakers.  With regard to Nirex, I compliment Senator Wright, in particular, because it was at his instigation that we had an all party debate in this House on the issue some months ago.  That debate was influential as was the Labour Party's Private Members' motion, as amended, on the action taken.  That is a good example, where the national interest is at stake, of all the parties being willing to come together and speak with one voice.  The Minister appreciated our backing in the excellent work he did on our behalf.</P>
      <P>The question of joyriding was raised.  The death of a young Cork man, the terrible injuries sustained by his friend and the injuries sustained by a trainee garda in Limerick are matters which need and receive our full sympathy.  They also provoke anger and outrage that such things happen. The terrible loss of life of a promising young man fills us all with sadness.  I will convey this sentiment to the Minister who, as a parent, is fully aware of the depth of feeling on this issue and of the call for necessary preventative action to be taken.</P>
      <P>The House owes a vote of thanks to Senator Henry for her very sane and informed contribution on the topic of the blood supply.  I was angry this morning when I heard a non-medical person offering clinical advice to people who might be in life threatening situations.  That sort of shrill and irresponsible opportunism on a clinical matter is something in which no politician should ever indulge. No vote is worth that kind of danger.  The security of the blood supply system is something which should be fundamental to anything we say in this House.  Any scaremongering which causes that confidence to be weakened and which may have effects further down the line is something we should avoid at all costs.  There will be an opportunity next week in a very full debate on the hepatitis C report for all these points to be made and for the Minister, who is very anxious to answer the points made in recent days, to reply.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde raised the question of the legislation on the school leaving age.  That legislation will be debated in the House in the normal way.  I will convey Senator Townsend's concerns on beet to the Minister.  Senator Roche raised, as he has done on a number of occasions, the matter of Bloody Sunday.  We also had an all party debate on that issue and it is clear that a judicial tribunal must be one of the options considered.</P>
      <P>Senators Naughten and Enright raised the question of genetically manipulated foods.  I would be prepared to allow time for that next session. Senator Farrell raised the question of straying horses.  The Control of Horses Bill has been enacted and is in effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Maloney raised a very important question, as did Senator Farrell, on the events in Dromore. For a short time at the weekend there was a ray of hope and a belief that sanity would prevail <Col N="882" /> and that a headline could be set for people across Northern Ireland.  Sadly, the old bigotry and intransigence seem to have intervened but let us hope that, even at this late stage, what would have been a copybook example may yet come into being.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher raised a number of issues which would really be more appropriate to discussion on the Education Bill when it comes before the House.  Senator McDonagh, apart from his well merited pride in his local hurlers, raised the question of VAT on hurleys.  Many of us remember when this vexed issue put us under great pressure in the mid-1980s.  Certain commitments were made then which, sadly, have not been honoured but perhaps we could look at the issue again.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised compensation payments, on which I expect a full statement in the near future.  I do not have the information for which Senator Kelly was looking.  The broadcasting policy debate called for by Senator Cassidy may take place in the next session.  Senator Lydon raised forms of dress.  Senator Lydon is always impeccably dressed and gives this side of the House no cause for concern so he can rest easy.  The matter raised by Senator Fahey would be better discussed on the Adjournment.</P>

    <Title>Litter Pollution Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to introduce more important environmental legislation to the House.  The Litter Pollution Bill, 1996, is an important part of the anti-litter initiative <i>Action Against Litter</i> which was activated just over a year ago.  The essential purposes of the Bill are to put in place a wide ranging legislative charter for action against litter, to spell out clearly what occupiers of property must do to keep their property free of litter and to set out the powers and duties of local authorities for preventing and controlling litter.</P>
      <P>It is important that local authorities have adequate statutory powers to undertake the task of litter prevention and control.  Their existing powers were conferred by the Litter Act, 1982. However, weaknesses in this legislation have gradually come to light and it is now opportune to restate litter legislation comprehensively, to sharpen its focus and to broaden the legislative and regulatory instruments available for combating litter.  Before outlining the principal features of the Bill, I would like to set out some background factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Litter is one of the most persistent environmental problems of our time.  It is an urgent and visible problem affecting Ireland's towns, countryside and beaches.  Litter is an unfashionable issue, even in environmental terms.  Solving <Col N="883" /> the litter problem does not yet command the idealism or the supportive public response which have been so effective in addressing other environmental challenges.</P>
    <P>Litter undermines and challenges the credibility of other policies and measures for protecting the environment.  It is running down shopping and business areas.  It is taking from the amenity of housing estates and open spaces.  Litter is damaging efforts to promote tourism, conservation and heritage protection.  It is hurting the Irish economy because it compromises our ability to attract and consolidate commercial development. Litter is also hurting our environment.</P>
    <P>To quantify the extent of the problem countrywide my Department commissioned a national litter survey to provide an accurate assessment of the incidence of litter.  This survey was conducted in October 1995 at various locations throughout the country and was designed to establish a detailed breakdown of the composition of litter and to identify and classify types of littered locations.</P>
    <P>The main findings of the survey were that very few of the places inspected were either totally free of litter or grossly littered.  However, over 80 per cent of sites surveyed were found to have significant amounts of litter.  The incidence of litter was quite prevalent and is particularly likely to be found near fast food outlets, automatic bank telling machines and, unfortunately, secondary schools.  This survey has been circulated to all local authorities and will serve to give factual guidance for targeting local initiatives.</P>
    <P>Shortly after I took office as Minister for the Environment I indicated that a more urgent and aggressive approach to litter prevention should be promoted.  This is why the <i>Action Against Litter</i> initiative has been mobilised to combat litter in a radical and effective way.  The initiative is built on four main foundations: improving local authority performance, including more effective enforcement against offenders; reforming, updating and streamlining litter legislation; promoting public awareness and education and developing effective partnerships with commercial and voluntary interests to combat litter.  To drive this initiative, a new anti-litter unit was established within the Department of the Environment with a dedicated budget in support of the campaign.</P>
    <P>There are a number of key players in the <i>Action Against Litter</i> initiative.  The Department of the Environment is responsible for driving and co-ordinating the initiative at central level but the contribution and involvement of local authorities is crucial.  The public rightly looks to local authorities to prevent and control litter, provide good street cleaning services and enforce litter laws against offenders.  Some local authorities are making an effort but clearly there is considerable scope for improvement.  There is much to be done because overall national performance is uneven.</P>
    <P>I have already requested local authorities to move litter prevention and control up the scale of <Col N="884" /> their priorities and as a first step to prepare their own litter abatement plans for tackling the problem. The preparatory arrangements for these plans should involve consultation with business and community groups.  I am happy that over 40 authorities have completed their litter abatement plans while other authorities are currently in the process of finalising their plans.  Local authorities generally agree that their litter control programmes need to be stepped up.  I am confident that in the current year and in future years we will see a significant improvement in the prevention and control of litter by local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is important that we place a strong emphasis on promoting anti-litter awareness across all sections of the community.  To begin the task of overcoming the large deficit in public awareness of the effects of litter my Department mounted a public awareness campaign last year to give the public a wake-up call on the issue of litter.  This multi-media campaign is being continued this year and is designed to bring about change in public attitudes and, more importantly, behaviour towards litter.</P>
    <P>Education is important too.  It is essential that we promote understanding by young people from an early age of the degradation caused by litter. To approach this task in a structured way, educational materials for schools have been specially prepared for my Department by one of the specialist teaching centres.  These materials have been circulated to all first and second level schools in the country and I am pleased that responses to a recent questionnaire sent to schools confirm that the issue of litter is now being enthusiastically addressed in our schools.  I also expect that the new curriculum for primary schools will embrace environmental issues more comprehensively for the future and I would hope that primary education of young people would develop a greater anti-litter awareness in young people.  The cost of funding the public awareness campaign and educational measures is being met from the Department's Vote and a provision of some £400,000 has been made for this purpose in the current year.</P>
    <P>Government and local authorities cannot provide a litter free environment on their own.  One of the main features, therefore, of <i>Action Against Litter</i> is to develop the involvement of the private sector and voluntary interests in the fight against litter.  Environmental initiatives, such as <i>Action Against Litter</i>, give businesses in particular the opportunity to prove themselves as good corporate citizens.  The emergence of the Irish Business Against Litter movement demonstrates this point well.  Consumers relate better to companies which demonstrate strong environmental credentials and performance.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should be able to measure progress under the <i>Action Against Litter</i> initiative.  It is intended, therefore, to establish a system of performance measurement that will monitor the state of cleanliness and assess progress by local authorities in achieving the objectives <Col N="885" /> of their programmes under this initiative. The Department intends to develop and activate an external monitoring process which will be brought into place next year.</P>
    <P>I would like now to comment on some of the main provisions of the Bill.  A more detailed commentary will be found in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill.  I remind Senators that the Bill repeals the Litter Act, 1982, but restates and strengthens some of the basic provisions of that earlier legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out an important requirement on the occupier of property, if it is a public place or visible to any extent from a public place, to keep the property free of litter.  In addition, where a property or premises faces onto a public road and is within the confines of a speed limit area, the occupier will be required to keep free of litter any footpath or pavement between their property and the roadway.  This requirement applies to all speed limit areas except where the general 60 miles per hour or the 70 miles per hour motorway speed limit apply; it is designed to cover properties in all built up areas.  I believe the provision is necessary to tackle the problem of litter and to ensure that responsibility is taken by individuals for maintaining a litter free local environment.</P>
    <P>In section 6 also, in addition to the duties of occupiers, a duty is imposed on the owner of a house that is let in flats or bedsits to ensure that the curtilage of the house is kept free of litter. This provision is being included in response to requests from local authorities, particularly Dublin Corporation, which have encountered difficulties with refuse and litter being left to accumulate for days outside houses let in flats.</P>
    <P>Section 7 imposes an explicit duty on local authorities to keep public roads free of litter as far as practicable.  Roads are a known resting place for litter and it is appropriate to state a clearer obligation on road authorities to maintain good litter management arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 9 contains a new power for local authorities to issue a notice to the occupier of a littered property, which is visible from a public place, to clean it up and take specified measures to prevent a recurrence.  It will be open to a local authority to take action and recover the cost involved in the event of an occupier failing to comply with the terms of a notice.  I would like to see this provision being actively availed of by local authorities to demonstrate seriousness about tackling heavily littered sites where litter has been allowed to accumulate over long periods.</P>
    <P>Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 relate to the duty of local authorities to draw up litter management plans for their functional areas.  Such plans are essential to guide and support a more systematic approach to litter prevention and control.  The adoption of these plans is a reserved function of elected councils but the Bill also requires local authorities to consult with local interests on their intended proposals at the preparatory stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> Section 15 sets out obligations for the operators of mobile food outlets in relation to litter control in the vicinity of their business.  This provision has been suggested by a number of local authorities. It will also be open to local authorities to frame additional requirements for mobile outlets by way of special notice.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides local authorities with a new power to take stronger action against the operators of premises whose business activities have a particular tendency to create litter.  The types of premises on which additional requirements can be set are set out in subsection (9); this list may be extended by regulations to include other classes of premises.  The need to impose additional requirements on these types of premises is a matter to be judged by individual local authorities having regard to, and knowledge of, local circumstances.</P>
    <P>The obligation being imposed on an occupier under this section can extend to an area up to 100 metres from the person's premises.  By agreement with the local authority, an occupier of property may be relieved of the obligation directly to implement litter control measures by making a financial contribution to the local authority.  A notice from the local authority imposing additional obligations must first be served in draft form to allow for comments on it.  A confirmed notice may be appealed by the person affected to the District Court.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 are designed to create a more structured litter management regime for events which are likely to be attended by large numbers of the public.  Inevitably, litter is created at well attended events, such as major concerts, sporting occasions or, as we saw over the weekend, St. Patrick's Day parades.  The Bill authorises local authorities to serve a notice on the organisers or promoters of major events requiring them to take specific measures to prevent or limit litter creation and, ultimately, to provide for its removal.</P>
    <P>A notice under section 17 may also require a bond to be lodged with the local authority as security against the taking of required measures. A local authority may also afford organisers or promoters the option of making a financial contribution to the local authority in lieu of taking direct measures.  This contribution must be applied by the local authority to litter prevention or removal at the relevant event.  In other words, it is not designed to be a funding mechanism for local authorities to make windfall gains.</P>
    <P>A local authority may also act to remedy any failure by a person to carry out the requirements of a notice; and it may recover its costs in doing so.  Promoters of events will, in future, have to take greater responsibility for litter prevention and control before, during and after events.</P>
    <P>A new provision in section 19 will prohibit the placing of advertising material on windscreens of cars and other vehicles.  There is no hesitation in proposing this measure because placing advertising leaflets in this manner is well known to be a <Col N="887" /> major cause of litter.  In addition, local authorities will be able under section 21 to introduce by-laws at their own discretion to prohibit or regulate the handing out of advertising leaflets in streets.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is a new provision imposing a duty on the person in charge of a dog to clean up if it fouls in certain public places, such as on the street or footpath, on a beach or in a park.  Apart from environmental considerations there is a health imperative in relation to the provision because of the danger of children contracting the disease of toxocariasis.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 to 28 deal with the important issues of enforcement and penalties.  The maximum fine for an offence under the Bill is being increased from £800 to £1,500 and there is also a maximum penalty of £100 for each day that there is a continued contravention by a convicted person.  The on-the-spot penalty remains unchanged at £25 but may be varied in future by regulations.  All the proceeds from fines will now go to local authorities as opposed to the Exchequer which currently enjoys the benefit of such fines.  Local authorities will also be able to ask the courts to award costs against a convicted person in respect of the expenses incurred by local authorities in investigating, detecting and prosecuting offences. I am confident that this change will act as an incentive to local authorities to tackle realistically and I hope enthusiastically enforcement more effectively in future.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of on-the-spot fines against litter offenders has proven to be problematic in the past for local authorities.  It is now proposed that in addition to litter wardens, members of the Garda Síochána will also be empowered to issue on-the-spot fines.  It is not intended that gardaí will take over the role of issuing on-the-spot fines. It will be desirable that this remains primarily with local authority litter wardens.  I hope to see more litter wardens being appointed by local authorities.  However, there are circumstances where gardaí on street patrol could very usefully penalise transgressions of our litter laws.  It is important that the power to carry out that action should be vested in them as well as in litter wardens. The fact that the public will know that a member of the Garda Síochána is empowered to issue such on-the-spot fines will act as a further deterrent.</P>
    <P>It will also now be possible for litter wardens to call on the assistance of the Garda where they believe they might be obstructed from carrying out the duties imposed on them under this Bill. This will strengthen the standing of litter wardens. I am confident that local authorities will become more involved in active litter enforcement once the new Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Bill allows the Minister for the Environment to issue directions and guidelines in relation to carrying out the provisions of the Bill.  When the Bill is passed, it is intended to issue comprehensive guidelines to local authorities <Col N="888" /> in relation to the provisions of the Bill and their duties under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Litter Pollution Bill is an important milestone in environmental legislation. I look forward to hearing the views of Senators who, from their practical experience, will no doubt have valuable perspectives to bring to bear on this matter.</P>
    <P>Litter is a difficult and urgent environmental problem.  It has proven to be a persistent, difficult and thorny issue to resolve.  The solutions necessary, however, should, in general, be much less complex for litter than for other environmental issues.  What we need above all is a more widespread public recognition of littering as a socially unacceptable activity.  <i>Action Against Litter</i> will continue to be promoted to increase this awareness and to achieve our common objective of a litter free Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fail Party I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on the initiatives he has shown in this area since taking office.  When we dealt with the Waste Disposal Bill, the Minister indicated he proposed to introduce this Bill.  In so far as it goes, the Bill is welcome.  We support it and will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage.  The Bill adds a further statutory provision in the fight against litter pollution and will enable local authorities to plan and implement a new range of incentives and requirements to reduce litter pollution.</P>
      <P>In some respects, it is depressing to note the serious litter problem that exists all over the country, in urban areas and in the countryside.  In spite of all the work and effort over the years to create a greater awareness of the damaging effect litter has on our image as a nation, the situation seems as bad as ever; in some respects it seems to be getting worse.</P>
      <P>Scarcely a visitor to Ireland does not comment on the careless way in which we deal with our litter problems.  One has only to travel along the roads to witness volumes of discarded plastic bottles, cans, chip bags and, in some places, even bags full of rubbish which are all a blight on our landscape.  The chronic state of villages, towns and cities &mdash; especially after weekend events in the vicinity of discotheques, canteens, stores and nightclubs &mdash; indicates a growing carelessness, lack of awareness and a general laziness concerning the disposal of refuse.  This is especially so for teenagers and other young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have expected that by now the campaigns to keep Ireland tidy, such as the Tidy Towns competitions and other initiatives taken over the years, would have created a greater interest and concern, especially among the younger generation, of their responsibility to respect the environment but, unfortunately, the situation seems to be deteriorating.  Local authority managers and administrators must realise that litter will be with us for the foreseeable future.  The battle to rid our streets and roads of the menace of litter must be intensified.  This Bill <Col N="889" /> is a further weapon in the fight against litter pollution.</P>
    <P>We have passed important legislation to deal with pollution and waste disposal but we still seem to be losing the battle.  When the Dumping at Sea Act, 1995, was introduced by the Minister for the Marine, I and other speakers indicated that, unless enforcement measures were introduced, the legislation would not be adequate to deal with the situation.  I noticed at the weekend the growing volume of refuse in our most scenic coastal areas, which calls into question the effectiveness of this legislation.  We must co-ordinate our approach in dealing with matters such as waste disposal at sea and the effect it has on the shoreline and the environment generally.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are also responsible for scenic coastal resorts.  I was amazed recently to see the amount of refuse which came ashore from boats or ships along the Atlantic coastline in west Clare.  The volume seems to be increasing, not decreasing.  The amount of discarded netting, fish boxes and other materials connected with the fishing industry along the coastline is alarming, particularly when it is not long since we passed what I thought was effective legislation to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Unless resources are provided this legislation will not be effective in dealing with the chronic litter problem which will continue to escalate out of control.  I am disappointed the Bill does not indicate the amount of Government finances available to local authorities to deal with this problem.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that £400,000 will be provided.  I presume that will be provided to local authorities by way of a supplementary grant.  We may have an opportunity to discuss section 33 in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if it is intended to establish a separate fund in local authorities and borough councils to implement this legislation.  It would be inadvisable to put whatever grant is given to local authorities into the general county council or municipal authority fund.  I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to establish a separate litter fund which would be supported by Government grants and into which fines would be paid directly.</P>
    <P>I question the value of £25 fines but I am sure the Minister is satisfied they are adequate to deal with the situation.  It should be possible to set up a mechanism whereby fines imposed for breaches of this legislation are paid directly into this fund so that it can be used in the fight against pollution. I draw the Minister's attention to a system which operates under the fisheries legislation.  A proportion of the fines imposed for fishing irregularities are paid into the fisheries fund to fight illegal fishing.  We need to establish a special litter fund which would be supplemented by State grants and credited with the fines imposed for breaches of the legislation.  This would provide an adequate fund for local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> I am worried that this legislation is being introduced at a time when there is severe financial pressure on local authorities to deal with the various problems facing them.  Anyone who has contact with local authorities is aware that local authority financing is a critical issue.  Attempts to deal with local problems have put a severe strain on local authority finances.  If this legislation places a further charge on local authorities, its implementation will be low on its list of priorities.  If local authorities have to compete for available resources to fill potholes or repair coastal erosion, finances will be switched around and the desirable objectives of this legislation will not be attained because of a lack of finance.  I ask the Minister to clarify if the £400,000 will be paid to county and borough councils by way of a capital allocation or will a special refuse fund be used to fight the litter problem.  Finances should be available to help councils undertake this work.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the time frame for the implementation of the litter management plan, which is the responsibility of the local authority. Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 deal with the preparation of and amendments to the plan and its implementation.  These are fundamental parts of the Bill and we must ensure that a time frame is set to implement it.  Section 10 states that the plan will be prepared within six months of the enactment of the Bill.  Will section 10 come into operation when this legislation is enacted or will it be left for a period to enable local authorities to prepare a litter management plan?</P>
    <P>It appears there are already plans in existence and what is proposed in the Bill is a formalised agenda to deal with them.  After a three year period they can be amended or redrafted, depending on the success or otherwise of their operation.  Can I have clarification of the time frame envisaged for implementing those sections?  I am confused whether section 10 will be implemented on the commencement of the legislation or if it is subject to an order being issued, which might be two or three years in the future.</P>
    <P>There are welcome provisions in the Bill to make property owners responsible for the protection of areas they own from litter pollution.  Valuable sites which have been set aside for development are often covered with refuse.  A site in Dublin, not far from Leinster House, which was recently sold for £6 million had become a virtual dump site over the past three or four years.  In the case of sites earmarked for development but which have not been developed and whose ownership might not be clear, it is important that caretakers of property, as well as property owners, would have a degree of responsibility for preventing litter pollution on the property.  This would avoid the problem of important and valuable development sites being used as dump sites while a consortium prepares its financial plans and packages to undertake development.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the litter problem at bank machines.  Banks have made huge profits in <Col N="891" /> recent years and some of those profits have been generated by the modernisation of their transaction arrangements.  However, in the streets of towns and cities one can see piles of discarded receipts and dockets from cash machines, particularly at night.  In this legislation banks should be held responsible for the refuse they are creating. They can surely spare some money from their valuable profits to tackle this problem.  Perhaps they are doing so already, but if they are not they should.  On the Continent banks would not be allowed to litter the streets around their premises.</P>
    <P>The banks have cameras located around such machines and if somebody is misbehaving at them they can quickly pick out the offender.  Their video cameras should also show the damage being done to the streets, especially in our capital city.  They should have some responsibility in this regard and they should make a financial contribution to deal with it.  This is why I favour a fund. Banking institutions which create litter problems could contribute to a litter fund to tackle litter pollution.  It is preferable that it be handled by the litter fund rather than involving it in local authority finances, which is a separate area.</P>
    <P>I am particularly conscious of the disposal of refuse from cars travelling on motorways.  While the Bill refers to roads legislation, I am not sure if such legislation deals with motorways.  If one is driving on a by-pass after 11 p.m. one is liable to get a chicken bone thrown on one's windscreen or car bonnet as a result of chicken bags being discarded by passengers in other cars.  It is a disgrace. Senator Howard referred to this problem during a previous debate on litter.  He pointed out that he lives the same distance from Ennis as it takes one to consume a bag of chips.  He has the inconvenience of having chip bags, beverage cans and other food containers being discarded outside his premises by people travelling from Ennis who have consumed the goods they bought in takeaways there.</P>
    <P>This problem must be dealt with, but I doubt the provisions in this legislation can do anything about such events which occur late at night.  A new system for traffic control is due to come into operation.  If one exceeds the speed limit on the dual carriageway to Shannon one can be automatically photographed by a new mechanism in operation there.  There should be the same system to deal with people who dump takeaway foods and cans out of their car windows when travelling at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour.  There should be a clear provision in the legislation to deal with that issue.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation.  Litter pollution has been a source of frustration for people involved in tidy towns committees and local authorities. There have been important developments in national schools which have been inventive in creating an awareness of the problem in primary school children through essay competitions and so forth.  Unfortunately, there is not the same level of awareness in secondary schools and colleges. <Col N="892" /> The survey to which the Minister referred indicated that the problem is quite bad in secondary schools.  We have not got the message across to people who litter streets at night that litter pollution is a critical problem that requires their co-operation. This Bill will go some way towards achieving that aim.  However, it can only be effective if the necessary financial resources are provided by the Minister to local authorities to fulfil their duties in this area.  I hope to discuss that aspect further on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will give local authorities statutory powers to undertake the task of litter prevention and control.  Prior to 1982, local authorities had little statutory power to control the litter problem.  The Litter Act, 1982, gave local authorities certain powers and progress was made.  A number of offenders were brought before the courts.  However, there were shortcomings in that Act.  This more comprehensive legislation broadens the legislative and regulatory framework available to combat litter.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, citizens are not very conscious of the damage litter can cause to our environment. It is only when one reads the complaints received by Bord Fáilte that the message gets through.  Visitors to our cities and countryside do not usually complain about the cost of food, entertainment or accommodation.  Usually they are complimentary about these issues.  However, the problem of litter disturbs them, particularly litter in areas of scenic beauty.  We have many such areas but it only takes a small amount of litter to destroy the enjoyment one gains from them.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 6 of the Bill which requires the owners of property to keep their property free of litter.  It is not unusual to see owners of shop premises sweep litter from their shops onto the footpath and leave it there.  The opposite happens on the Continent where owners of shops sweep the litter onto the footpath and then collect it.  They also have a good habit of washing the footpath outside their premises.  When did Members last see an Irish shopowner wash the footpath outside their premises?</P>
      <P>Section 6 deals with another problem with which I am often confronted in my constituency, Dublin South East, where many houses are set in multiple dwellings.  If domestic refuse is to be collected by the local authority on a Monday morning it is left out for collection on the previous Friday evening and over the weekend, the entire area is littered by this rubbish.  I welcome the fact that this section will place a responsibility on landlords to keep the areas surrounding their premises free of litter.  There should be an obligation on landlords whose property is set in multiple dwellings to provide proper litter receptacles for tenants which should be kept out of public view.  Sometimes such receptacles are placed in the front gardens of houses and are very unsightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> I am pleased section 9 contains the same principle included in the Derelict Sites Act that enables local authorities to serve notice on the occupier of a property, covered with litter and visible from a public place, to have it cleaned up. If he or she fails to do so, the local authority can carry out the necessary work and take action to recover the costs.  This is one of the best forms of enforcement in respect of litter.</P>
    <P>Sections 15, 17 and 18 are interrelated.  I believe this because, in my experience, the major sporting authorities, the GAA, FAI and IRFU &mdash; the headquarters of which is situated in my constituency &mdash; have a good record in subscribing to the cost of cleaning up litter after major sporting events.  However, the real problem in respect of litter is caused by the large number of the public concerts held in Dublin.  I have experienced this problem in my own area near the RDS.  The roads around Ballsbridge can be covered with litter on the day following a concert.  Such litter is not usually generated by people attending concerts, it originates from the large number of mobile food outlets parked on Anglesea Road and Simmonscourt Road to provide facilities for the young people attending concerts.  The same problem also applies to Funderland at Christmas.  With the passing of this Bill, I hope litter wardens will be able to note the names of the mobile food operators involved and, if the area is not cleaned the next day, local authorities will be able to clean up the area and levy the cost on them.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 17 which proposes that local authorities may serve notice on the organisers or promoters of major events, such as concerts, requiring them to take measures to prevent or limit the creation of litter and have it removed when the concert ends.  A more important aspect of this section is that such promoters may be required to lodge a cash deposit with local authorities. Therefore, if they fail to take the necessary measures to remove litter, local authorities will have the necessary funds to carry out the work themselves.  I also note that the Bill prohibits the placing of advertising material on car windscreens.  These leaflets often blow away and add to the litter in an area or owners, when they return to their vehicles, often remove such advertising literature and throw it away which causes further litter.  I hope politicians will bear this in mind during the election campaign and will refrain from placing literature on car windscreens.</P>
    <P>A new form of litter that has crept into our society in recent years is caused by bank cash dispensing machines.  The receipts issued by such machines should be outlawed because they are a new form of litter.  If a client wants to check the balance of his or her account, they should be instructed to do so by pressing a button on the machine.  If they require a written balance, they should be obliged to call personally to a bank. This would stop people obtaining receipts from cash dispensing machines and throwing them away after a brief perusal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> I also wish to refer to the issue of litter from cars.  Dublin Corporation enjoyed some success in trying to deal with this problem a number of years ago.  It encouraged petrol companies to sponsor litter bags for cars.  Car owners were asked to carry such bags in their vehicles and deposit their litter therein for disposal at a suitable time.  This project was successful.  We should encourage petrol companies in this regard to enable us to overcome this problem.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that a person in charge of a dog will be required to clean up if their pet fouls a public place such as a street, footpath or beach. The fouling of footpaths has caused annoyance to many of citizens and I am glad this measure is included in the Bill.  However, I do not know how effective it will be.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the on-the-spot fines measure in the Bill, I want to highlight the problems faced by Dublin Corporation in removing litter from the streets of the capital.  Last year it cost the cleansing department of Dublin Corporation £8 million to remove litter.  This was not domestic refuse, it was litter thrown on to our streets.  The figure of £8 million represents an increase of £1.2 million from the previous year. The 1997 estimate for street cleaning for Dublin is £8.7 million, which amounts to more than £18 per annum for each person in the city.  The cleansing division removes approximately 15 tonnes of litter from the streets each year which represents approximately 30 kilograms per person.</P>
    <P>Severe littering occurs at any major event in the city.  I was amazed on Monday last, following the St. Patrick's Day parade, when I saw the amount of litter in O'Connell Street.  It was as if everyone attending the parade had taken a small bag of litter with them and dumped the contents on the street when the parade had finished.  I understand that the litter collected by Dublin Corporation after the parade amounted to between a half tonne and one tonne.  Dublin Corporation is not given funding to do this.  People came from many areas of the country to watch the parade but the corporation must pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>Members may be interested to know that it takes 50,000 aluminium drinking cans to make up one tonne of litter.  Some restriction should be placed on supermarkets regarding the number of plastic bags they give to customers.  It is evident that shoppers take more plastic bags than necessary and later place litter in them for collection by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am glad that, under the Bill, maximum fines are being increased to realistic levels.  Local authorities will receive the benefit of such fines and the costs incurred in bringing prosecutions which may be awarded in court.  The power of issuing on-the-spot fines for litter offences is being extended to the Garda Síochána.  The Bill makes it an offence to obstruct a litter warden, if one can be found, or refuse to give a proper name and address.  If we are to overcome the litter problem from which our cities suffer, it will be <Col N="895" /> necessary to increase the number of litter wardens.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that local authorities should draw up litter management plans for their functional areas.  Such plans are intended to provide a systematic approach to litter prevention and control.  These programmes should include litter free zones.  There are nuclear free zones, smoke free zones and parking free zones.  Why not litter free zones?  Such a zone was put in place in the centre of Dublin a number of years ago but it was not a great success because the corporation did not have the powers this Bill will give local authorities to enforce the law.  If the Bill had been enacted at that time, the litter free zone would have succeeded.  There are advantages to litter free zones because they can be initiated in small areas and extended to cover an entire city.</P>
    <P>While local authorities, the gardaí and litter wardens can play their part, the main contributor to a litter free city is its citizens.  They should take pride in their city and keep it as clean as possible. Special attention should be given to young people in the prevention of litter.  For that reason I very much welcome the Minister's intention to allocate £400,000 to a public awareness campaign and the education of young people.  Many worthwhile measures are provided in the Bill to deal with the problem of litter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is about time we did something about litter, particularly in Dublin, although I am sure it is a countrywide matter.  The Minister said litter is an unfashionable issue, even in environmental terms. However, it is extremely fashionable with me. Many other people are profoundly ashamed of the condition of the city.  We are a dirty, filthy people; we are worse than any other country I know and certainly any capital city I know.  That says something about the psychology of the citizens of Dublin.  For that reason, I warmly applaud the Minister for allocating £400,000 to institute programmes in schools because we have got to tackle this problem at ground level where young people absorb values.</P>
      <P>It is tragic that many fellow citizens of Dublin so disregard their own city and exhibit a contempt for it rather than take pride in it.  I imagine this may have social and historical roots and is not unrelated to the fact Dublin was almost seen as not part of Ireland in the same way that Georgian buildings were despised and regarded as a colonial excrescence.  Dubliners have yet to fully reclaim the city for themselves, to feel this is their property, but by damaging trees and throwing rubbish on the streets they are not doing anything clever or insurrectionary.  They are cutting off their noses to spite their faces and damaging the environment.  We have to persuade people, particularly our youth, that they should make an emotional and cultural investment in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, very often they do not get this message from their parents.  On many occasions I <Col N="896" /> have intervened in the inner city and, indeed, in the suburbs.  One has to be sensitive because one does not wish to humiliate parents in front of their children.  Many times I have seen people coming out of shops, the mother will unwrap an ice lolly, hand it to the child and then throw the paper of the street.  My policy has been to pick it up and say politely &ldquo;I think you dropped this, madam&rdquo; to which the woman usually replies &ldquo;that is all right sonny, I was only throwing it away anyway&rdquo;.  Children will pick this up from their parents very quickly.</P>
    <P>My knowledge of the life of James Joyce tells me that he and his family were not immune from this behaviour.  When Joyce and Nora Barnacle went to Zurich first she was nearly arrested for throwing paper on the street.  She could not believe this was regarded as a serious matter.  Traditionally, our psychology does not take litter seriously.  I saw an individual in a Wexford registered car at a traffic light in Pearse Street.  He blew his nose in a paper handkerchief and flung it on the street.  I just picked it up and flung it right back in on top of his lap and said he better keep it because it was possibly infectious material.  We are dirty and a programme in schools would be very much welcome.  There should be zero tolerance of litter.</P>
    <P>Individuals are not the only ones to blame.  We must try and make them proud of the city and make them feel it belongs to them.  Firms also contribute to the problem and I am not averse to naming a few of them.  McDonalds is a classic example.  Why is nothing done about McDonalds, Burger King and the other fast food outlets on O'Connell Street?  I pay tribute to Dublin Corporation for its heroic efforts to keep that street clean but within ten or 15 minutes of a good job being done to clean it up the street is full of half eaten chips, styrofoam boxes, paper napkins, etc. These businesses should not be able to profiteer and create dirt and litter as they do without bearing some responsibility.  They should have to pay for part of the ongoing cleaning because of the dirt and nuisance they create, especially around the Anna Livia statue.</P>

    <P>The serious problem of chewing gum should be addressed.  The Minister did not refer to it in his speech nor is it referred to in the Bill.  I always try to give up cigarettes with the result I am now addicted to nicotine and chewing gum simultaneously. However, I do not drop chewing gum on the street.  For a while, I wondered what the black marks were on the pavement.  They are chewing gum marks.  I was in Singapore a number of years ago and I thought the authorities were mad to outlaw chewing gum.  I doubt if it is possible with our liberal democratic tradition but now I see the point.  People should be educated against sticking it underneath tables, putting it on the <Col N="897" /> pavement, etc.  I am not sure much can be done in legislative terms but I would welcome it if something were to be done.  As public representatives we need to give a lead.</P>
    <P>I flew over Dublin Bay earlier and saw the <i>Sir John Basil Getty</i> doing its duty with a nice crescent shaped quarter mile smear coming from the back of it as it dumped, as it does every two days, 250,000 tonnes of solid excrement into the bay.  I mentioned this to the Minister and he indicated this was coming to an end within the next two years; the sooner, the better.  It is absurd that this is done when we have a sewage works next door to a major electricity generating station.  Why do they not reclaim the solids, burn them off, generate electricity and various other useful by-products instead of destroying the bathing quality of the water?  This is not directly litter but it is related.</P>
    <P>On the question of street cleaning, I strongly commend and praised Dublin Corporation workers who do this manually.  They do by far the best job, especially in residential streets.  Where I live, a few men still go around with their barrows, brushes and shovels and pick up most of the rubbish. There is a problem with a sophisticated mechanised system.  For example, on a Sunday morning motorised machines which wake up residents are sent around at ungodly hours to clean the streets.  As people reside again in inner city areas, cars belonging to them are parked and the machines cannot get near the kerb.  In North Great George's Street we try to encourage people to park parallel to the kerb but at least a foot to 18 inches from it so that the street cleaner can get in.  I appeal to Dublin Corporation through the Minister not to totally abandon the human element of street cleaning because the workers do an extremely good job.  I am all in favour of any sophisticated advances and more money should be spent.  A considerable amount of money must be allocated if we are serious about dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>Although we are dirtier than other people, rubbish and litter are created in other capital cities. Paris, for example, has a superb mechanical cleansing system, although some aspects of it would be too expensive for us to implement as the infrastructure has been in place in Paris for many years.  They have little geysers which send out jets of water that flood the gullies and carry the rubbish away.  Unfortunately, we have neither the money nor the imagination to put in such a system.  They also have motorcycles with types of hoovers which pick up dog dirt, an issue to which the Minister referred.  Dog dirt is unsightly, unpleasant, particularly if one gets it on one's shoes, and is dangerous because it may cause toxoplasmosis which affects the eyes and then the brain.  In certain circumstances, it may cause death and may be caused by cats as well as dogs. A remarkably good job is done with this machine in Paris.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about this problem, we should look at other cities and send a small number of <Col N="898" /> representatives from the corporation, councillors or officials &mdash; perhaps we should send councillors because they love the odd trip &mdash; to carry out a comparative study.  How come Amsterdam, Zurich, Stockholm and Paris are so clean?  We may be able to learn things of a technical nature from these cities and implement our findings.  By doing this on our own and by trying to be innovative, we are neglecting the examples of other cities, which is unwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they do not, but I expect they have some of our problems.  I support Senator Doyle going on the junket as long as he produces a nice report for us.</P>
      <P>The collection of rubbish is not only a problem in the inner city.  Some of my neighbours are extremely poor but they are intensely clean and civic minded.  However, I have seen people from Foxrock, Ballybrack, Sandyford and elsewhere emptying their car ashtrays on the street.  I would love to see these people fined £250 or whatever for doing this.  People driving big cars leave black plastic bags, which are not securely tied, on my street.  Immediately, cats and dogs rip these bags open.</P>
      <P>A gentleman across the street from me is a plastic surgeon in the Blackrock Clinic.  When he is not lifting faces, he is running a tenement across the road from my house.  The people in his apartments leave out supermarket bags containing rubbish two or three days before collection day.  Inevitably, by the time collection day arrives, the rubbish is all over the street.  He is a professional man who earns his living from beautifying the appearance of human beings but he does not give a damn about the state of the street outside his tenement.  We must also educate some members of the so-called professional classes.</P>
      <P>The question of how we dispose of rubbish is important.  Although some people put out bins others use plastic bags, which is not adequate.  It would be good if Dublin Corporation and other local authorities examined the possibility of using wheelie bins.  These are used in Jerusalem and are excellent.  However, a problem would arise in terraced houses because it would be difficult for elderly people to manipulate them up and down steps and there would be no place to leave them outside.  Surely it is possible for local authorities to manufacture or establish a franchise for environmentally friendly rubbish disposal containers made from strong paper or a biodegradable material?  Our scientific agencies, which are paid by the State, should look into this issue and produce something which is environmentally friendly and which could become a standard unit for disposal.  Such units should be available at cost from the local authority, which should refuse to collect anything that is not appropriately packaged in one of these items.  That would deal with part of the problem of waste and dirt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> A problem in the city, and probably in the suburbs and elsewhere, is the widespread use of skips.  I have used skips but somebody should give those who run these container companies a damn good rap on the knuckles.  If one orders a skip, one is lucky if it arrives on the right day but one does not have a hope in hell of getting it taken away.  These companies leave skips for as long as they like and people come and throw more rubbish into them.  I do not know from where these people come.  People seem to drive around Dublin in cars full of rubbish looking for skips which become overburdened with rubbish that ends up all over the street.  Not only those who acquire skips but also the companies involved should be subject to penalties.  I presume we will be empowered to do something under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see section 15 which relates to mobile food outlets.  I greatly enjoyed a film based on Roddy Doyle's book, <i>The Van.</i>  I laughed like a drain and I am ashamed to say that it was so enchanting I even laughed when, after quite nonchalantly collecting a wad of notes, the person in the van kicked chips which were all over the floor onto the pavement of the carpark opposite the pub.  While it was unpleasant, it was highly entertaining.  Regrettably, it was classically observed Irish realism because this is exactly how we behave.  Everybody in the cinema laughed.  It was funny but it was also very sad.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the pernicious practice of shoving unsolicited material underneath windscreen wipers will be banned.  Everyone from pro-life groups to prostitutes have placed advertisements under my windscreen wipers, which I deeply deprecate. These people hire young people to shove this material in people's letterboxes.  Some nights when I get home I find 30 or 40 advertisements for a unisex hairdresser.  I have very little hair and I hardly need 30 advertisements.  These children receive instructions to get rid of advertisements and often they do not even put them into letterboxes but throw them on the street.</P>
    <P>I would like to offer a £10 prize to anybody who has seen a litter warden; Senator Doyle will probably try to collect on this.  I have never seen a litter warden.  They are probably hiding because they are afraid to approach anybody &mdash; I know the attitude of Dubliners.  If they tried to fine a person £50 on the spot for dropping a cigarette packet, they would certainly need the attention of my friend across the street who works in the Blackrock Clinic.  I welcome the fact the Garda Síochána has been empowered to carry out this duty.</P>
    <P>The question of plastic bags is important and was raised by several speakers.  The main problem with plastic bags is that they are not biodegradable. Anyone who walks along the lovely expanse of the North Bull Island will see how they distort the sand and they will continue to do so for generations. If one travels by train, one sees them along the hedgerows and hanging out of trees.  It <Col N="900" /> seems they cannot be got rid of.  They are a scandal and something must be done about them.</P>
    <P>I notice the Bill requires people to care for their properties where they abut onto the street, except where there is a speed limit greater than 60 miles an hour.  I am sure there is a good reason for this but I have no idea what it is unless it is that the speed of traffic blows litter to such an extent it is unfair to expect householders to keep their properties clean.  I cannot imagine any other reason for it.  I agree with this requirement.  I sweep the step outside my house regularly and often also have to sweep the footpath.  However, if property owners are to be made keep their properties tidy, the encouragement and active support of Government and local authorities is needed and this is provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope some of my suggestions are considered because they might bear fruit.  We want to live in a cleaner and better environment.  I congratulate the Minister and his advisers on producing excellent legislation.</P>

      <P>Ireland, as an island nation on the periphery of Europe, is regarded by our European neighbours as the garden country of western Europe.  That being so and with restrictions being imposed on agriculture, be it through milk production or cereal growing, we should capitalise on our natural resource and make as much money as possible through the tourism industry but that cannot be achieved until litter and other kinds of pollution are controlled and eliminated.  Many woodlands, parks and river banks are strewn with plastic containers and papers.</P>
      <P>I recently went to a festival in Brittany which I visit every second year.  While standing off the pavement, a colleague of mine asked me to look at it.  Not even a matchstick was to be seen, although upwards of 20,000 people were viewing the parade.  When I went to festivals here, broken bottles and glasses were thrown everywhere; today, it is beer cans.  It is a disgrace.  However, we cannot always blame the youth for this.</P>
      <P>There is an individual in my town who, in the early hours of the morning, dashes 15 yards to the river bank with his ashes.  I have warned him that, sooner or later, I will photograph him and put it in the paper.  With the strength of this Bill supporting me, I might possibly do that.  When we had heavy rain which resulted in flooding, I saw some of the few cowboy farmers left avail of the flood to dispose of slurry.  They turned on the tap and let it run down the dyke into the river.  They think it will not poison fish and that there is no danger of it being a pollutant but when silage effluent reaches a river, every living creature in it died.  It takes 2,000 gallons of water to dilute one pint of this effluent.  In my area, it will eventually find its way to the Blackwater Valley which is regarded as one of the finest salmon fishing rivers in the south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I compliment farmers who have recently introduced new technology which wraps silage, thus eliminating spillage.  I also compliment <Col N="901" /> them because they have now started to recycle the plastic and have produced paving posts, grids, etc.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of pollution in rivers because I come from a town which has two rivers meeting at its centre.  They are joined in turn by a little stream and link up with the Blackwater.  These rivers have been abused in the past when traders in the 1950s dumped decaying fruit and vegetables on the river bank to be taken by the flood to Youghal and beyond.  This practice has now been eliminated.  I compliment the community council and tidy towns committees because they are the heroes when it comes to wrestling with refuse dumping and littering.  They work very hard as voluntary groups and are proud when they attain extra marks or awards for their efforts.  They must take consolation and encouragement that the Minister has provided £400,000 to combat litter pollution.</P>
    <P>The habits of those over 50 will not be changed. I am delighted schoolchildren will be educated about the environment.  I would like films to be shown in schools, cinemas and on television portraying an unsightly drain and its transformation into a lovely park or whatever.  This would be very encouraging because seeing it with the naked eye is more beneficial than describing it.  I ask for this to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I come now to the issue of litter wardens.  I come from a small town and it would not be safe to mention a traffic warden there.  There are two hour parking areas in the town and gardaí feel it is not their function to enforce these regulations. If it is not their responsibility, it must be the traffic warden's.  Traders feel that, if parking tickets are placed on cars, the people who suffer will not return.  This is a very serious matter in small towns.  If a traffic warden is needed, his or her services must be shared with another town.  The possibility of getting a litter warden is, therefore, very remote.  I appreciate that the assistance of the Garda is desirable but I have never read in the paper of someone being fined £25 for littering. If the Garda is to implement these laws, and it is not doing so, are litter wardens needed?</P>
    <P>Some of the biggest littering criminals are the takeaways.  They cater for the after disco scene between 2.30 a.m. and 4 a.m. when other citizens are trying to get a night's sleep to prepare for the following morning's work.  People come from these discos, under the influence of beer, are noisy, abusive, race cars, blow car horns and have been known to kick doors.  There was a fracas after a disco in Kinsale, where plate glass windows were smashed and in other towns beer kegs were thrown through bank windows.  It is bad enough that there is a litter problem but there should be a restriction on noise until 1 a.m. to allow decent citizens to sleep.</P>
    <P>A councillor from a neighbouring county suggested that the containers for chips should be <Col N="902" /> edible.  This would eliminate much of the litter problem and I hope it is done.</P>

      <P>An additive should be used in the manufacture of plastic bags so that if they are discarded they will disintegrate.  That would solve many problems.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for the Environment for introducing estate management.  In the past, councils could rightly be accused of building estates with roads running through them, often putting in no lights and certainly not landscaping them.  They have now decided to provide trees in consultation with the occupants of the houses, in the hope they will care for them.</P>
      <P>I recently saw raw sewage being transported from a sewage plant and distributed on agricultural land.  There was no odour.  I was alarmed when I heard of the practice of tankers of sewage loaded onto vehicles which travel through fields.</P>
      <P>Too often the spraying of slurry is carried out within the parameters of hospital boundaries.  The odour is appalling.  The spraying of slurry should not be carried out in built-up areas where there is no water supply.  It can pollute the wells which supply houses.</P>
      <P>I was happy to read in this morning's newspapers that a consortium comprising an American company and the ESB has come together and been awarded the contract to build a 30 milowatt waste and energy plant near Dublin. This will reduce the oil bill by £25 million.  The American company has a 75 per cent stake in the consortium and the ESB has a 25 per cent stake. It will use approximately 490,000 tons of non-hazardous municipal solid waste per annum and, in doing so, it will provide electricity for 200,000 customers. This is a wonderful development and it lengthens the life of waste tips around Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Sustainable Development recently visited County Cork.  In Mallow we were shown the county council waste tip which is a flagship for the rest of the country.  It will have a lifespan of 30 years.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill and I fully support it.  Over the next few years the Minister for Tourism and Trade will hopefully be able to adopt the poem from which the following verse is taken:</P>

      <P>There is no way I am going to move back to west Cork now.  Will the Minister comment on the veracity of the story concerning a waste disposal incinerator in County Dublin? We are getting conflicting reports.  It was suggested that the company getting the contract for the incinerator was more than surprised and that Minister of State Deputy Stagg, had &ldquo;jumped the gun&rdquo; to quote the company.  Over the past few <Col N="903" /> weeks we have heard reports that a company allied to this American company has said that the system operating in America could not operate in Ireland because there is no separation of waste. If we are serious about the elimination of landfill sites around Dublin and moving instead to high-tech disposal it is important that the Minister clarifies whether a contract has been signed or if it is in the process of being signed.  The company in America deals with separated waste.  It would be a marvellous change from landfill sites if we could have this type of incinerator and produce energy from it.  However, the American company seems to be saying this is not possible unless we start separating waste.  I ask the Minister to make a statement on this matter.  It is of major consequence in ecological and financial terms.  If the Minister jumped the gun he should say so.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the realisation by the Government that litter is a major problem that must be dealt with.  Those of us who have served on local authorities know the problem of trying to keep the cost of litter collection and disposal under control.  The cost has been extraordinary. It is becoming more financially straining on local authorities because of the Environmental Protection Agency provisions.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny County Council was the first to have a contained, lined dump where the gases and water had to be taken away.  The cost of the facility is enormous.  It is only now that other local authorities and communities are beginning to realise how much it costs to provide landfill sites.  Unless litter is separated, a landfill site is a potential hazard.  We talk about Sellafield and the problems of containing nuclear waste but material which is not separated is put into landfill sites.  Everything goes into them and we do not know what will come out in 1,000,100 or, indeed, 50 years time.</P>
      <P>Senator Cashin suggested that a self destruct mechanism should be built into plastics and I do not think it should be beyond the bounds of technical possibility to do this.  I go into a particular shop to buy newspapers every day and I am annoyed if the checkout assistant offers me a plastic bag to put them in.  It is bad enough to have to dispose of the newspapers without having to dispose of the bags as well.  It is a cost to the supermarket and is a nonsense in ecological terms to put newspapers in plastic bags.  There must be an educational process to seek to eliminate the use of plastic bags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years ago, members and staff of Kilkenny County Council were offered compost bins at a nominal price in order to see how much household rubbish could be put into the bin and be recycled into garden manure.  I was one of the people who availed of the option.  We have never placed any household material into the rubbish dump since; bones, food waste and so on goes into the compost bin.  I burn quite an amount of newspapers and put the ashes on the compost heap also.  In ecological terms, there may be <Col N="904" /> people who would disagree with me.  Perhaps it is detrimental to the atmosphere to burn newspapers but I do not think so.  I would prefer something to be burned and reused in my garden rather than send it in bulk in plastic bags to the city dump.  There are times when there would be six to ten people in our house but we would not even have half a bag of rubbish for the dump in any one week.  If people seriously considered composting, we could prevent many of the problems faced by local authorities with regard to the elimination of rubbish.</P>
    <P>The situation in Ireland is changing.  I do not agree that people over 50 years of age cannot be educated about the elimination of rubbish in the same way as young people.  Over the years if a local authority put up a &ldquo;No Dumping Allowed&rdquo; sign, it gave an indication that there was some kind of quarry or other place into which things could be dumped.  The level of dumping at a particular location increased in line with the level of signs prohibiting littering.  If there was a sign saying that people would be fined £500 for illegal dumping, people would look at the sign and still dump rubbish if they thought they could get away with it.  Senator Cashin said that he has not heard of a £25 fine ever being imposed for illegal littering and I have not heard of anybody being fined £500.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying, as are local authorities, to appoint litter wardens to address this problem. In Kilkenny, the local authority advertised for one litter warden for the city and county.  We cannot afford to pay any more than one warden.  The Minister might say that the local authority would be able to pay for more than one position if it eliminated some other services.  However, like every other local authority, Kilkenny County Council are under financial strain.  We do the best we can with limited resources.  Kilkenny would not have won the Tidy Towns Competition in the category of towns and cities with a population greater than 10,000 if we were not aware of the need to eliminate litter.  A litter warden will not have an enforcement role; he or she will only be able to fulfil an educational role speaking to tidy towns committees and various other organisations.</P>
    <P>The public can be awkward sometimes with regard to the issue of litter.  I was in Tramore recently and I saw two elderly people dropping ice cream wrappers on the street.  As I passed, I asked them to pick up the litter and the two elderly ladies told me in no uncertain terms to mind my own business.  That is a common attitude. People will not react; they are not prepared to pick up their rubbish and place it in a receptacle.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny is a city and county which is very aware of the need to eliminate litter.  However, all of the new litter bins which are installed are quickly filled by people who decide to use litter receptacles as rubbish receptacles and we have terrible problems in this regard.</P>
    <P>The suppliers of &ldquo;10.10.20&rdquo; and other fertilisers should be forced not to use plastic packaging as <Col N="905" /> plastic bags are the biggest visible pollutant.  It would be cheaper for them to use recycled paper or some other form of packaging.  I do not understand why farmers cannot simply dig a hole in the ground and burn their waste.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not encourage that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be encouraged.  It has been proved that the hole in the atmosphere is not as big as we have been led to believe.  Burning a few plastic bags will not make any difference. However, if we put plastic bags into a landfill site they will remain there for thousands of years.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil suggestion that a tax should be levied on plastic bags to discourage their use is one that should be looked at.  The number of plastic bags that people take out of supermarkets is totally unnecessary; 90 per cent of the foodstuff is already packaged and &ldquo;plasticised&rdquo;.  There are many schemes under which containers are provided for recyclable materials and the Minister should encourage them.</P>
      <P>A huge amount of EU grants are given to upgrade factories, many of which generate large profits.  The same grants are not available to those who want to get involved in recycling on a small scale.  If we are to provide a litter free society, we must provide the means to small entrepreneurs and co-operatives to get involved in the recycling business.  We should support them to the same extent as the beef and financial services industries. If we do not eliminate rubbish, our ecological base will be diminished and tourists will not come to Ireland.  I ask the Minister to speak to the Minister for Finance about grants and incentives which could be offered to those who recycle litter and waste.</P>
      <P>There has been a proliferation of posters all over the country.  Under legislation, election material must be taken down immediately after the election, which is correct.  Posters never got anyone elected.  Advertisements for dance bands and discos are often a cause of litter.  The legislation should be enforced.  I was nearly shot for taking a case against someone who put up posters all over Kilkenny.  The man in question was fined but he suggested that when his party came to power, my house would be the first to be burned. Signs were painted outside my house.  Luckily, two councillors on the corporation took a similar action in the following weeks.  This did not eliminate the problem, but at least people saw we were ready to take on our supposed role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cashin that litter bins outside takeaways create litter.  People decide on impulse to buy a bag of chips or a burger.  Having tasted the first bit, they realise they do not want it and dump it, creating a huge problem.  There are certain chains of takeaways and local takeaways who do an excellent job cleaning up outside their premises when they close and this should be done by everyone.  In the morning, outside any business premises in Kilkenny, it is nice to see people hosing down their shops fronts and sweeping <Col N="906" /> up.  People who dump without thinking are ignorant.  Those who go to sporting events such as hurling, football, soccer and rugby games or events such as &ldquo;Lark in the Park&rdquo; display a total lack of regard for others by throwing litter as the streets are not clean for months afterwards.</P>
    <P>We all back the Minister's efforts to eliminate litter.  Education and the proper employment of litter wardens are of paramount importance.  If there is to be proper management of litter, local authorities will have to be given funding to do it. Funding for local authorities is the vital element in the equation.  If there is funding for various elements in industry, we should equally give funding to local authorities to ensure proper waste and litter management.  The local authorities will respond.  There is a competing demand at local authority level but if local authorities do not receive an increased input from the State and if the money cannot be raised locally, there will be problems.</P>
    <P>The public should realise we cannot say our environment is clean unless the litter problem is addressed in a more caring manner than it has been in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  It is a worthy objective and he has taken a big step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Many of the Senators have spoken from the local authority perspective.  If they had turned around they would have seen my face getting redder.  I am in a confessional mood &mdash; I am one of those nasty people who creates litter.  I do not think any Senator did not refer to the nasty supermarket bags which are thrown away.  My company is one of those big polluters because Senator Lanigan is probably correct in saying we give too many bags away.</P>
      <P>We are in a competitive business and we meet the customer's demand.  It would suit us much better if we did not give away nearly as many.  I sit on a customer panel every week and I have raised the question of what would happen if we stopped providing plastic bags.  It is clear that if we stopped the customers would feel obliged to go somewhere else.  Others say they would put up with it and use another method.  This is what excites me &mdash; other solutions are now available. One of the important solutions which is not tied to technology is attitude.  If we can change the attitude to litter, which the Minister is doing in this Bill, we will take a step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A group, including the chairman of Kelloggs in the United States, visited one of our stores in Lucan last Friday.  He was with other Irish people who said they had not noticed the litter until he had drawn their attention to it.  He pointed out bags and litter and asked what had gone wrong. I told them about the technology which is now capable of taking steps towards reducing litter.  In the case of plastic bags there is technology which will obviate the necessity for them.  However, there must be a change in attitude and a sense of <Col N="907" /> pride in the nation among those who contribute to this pollution.</P>
    <P>I remember going to the World Cup in Italy over six years ago.  We were proud to be different from the English supporters and we were trying to establish that we were not English.  The Garda inspector who was present on the trains managed to give a sense of pride to the Irish supporters by saying &ldquo;We are representing Ireland and the television cameras of the world are focused on us so let us make sure we behave ourselves&rdquo;.  If the Minister remembers, English supporters were banned from the pubs and they were closed when they played.  However, the Irish were not banned, we were well-behaved and we were proud.  Most of all, I remember coming away from that match where thousands of people had gathered and looking at the ground.  There was not one cigarette packet or sweet paper left on the ground because as we left that stand, everybody picked up the litter.  We were proud to say: &ldquo;Look at the way we behave.  We are not like those other people from other nations&rdquo;.  If we can create that sense of pride, that is what can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I like the Minister's multifaceted approach to the problem.  He talks about a succession of different measures, of which legislation is just one.  I would caution against thinking that there is a simple solution or that law, on its own, will achieve solve the problem.  If we can create that sense of pride and a change in attitude through education, we will achieve much more than just the passage of laws.</P>
    <P>I was in the United States a couple of years ago with a man called Fred Meijr, who owned a marvellous company in four states.  I asked him how many people he employed in the company which he started some 50 years ago and was amazed when he told me had 92,000 employees. When we drove to his supermarkets and shopping centres, he never parked in a good customer parking place.  He never walked up to the supermarket without wheeling a couple of empty shopping carts with him.  He never walked past a piece of litter on the ground of the car park or in the shop without bending down and picking it up.  He was setting an example and that was evident to the 92,000 people who worked for him and the millions who shopped in his stores.  If there is one solution to this problem, it is having the legislation to back the example we set, the pride we will create and the change in attitude which will occur through the steps which are being taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pinpointed prevention as being most important.  To return to the supermarket business, one of the managers in my company, Paddy Keaveney from Galway, set himself a target to prevent the first piece of paper falling on to the floor.  I remember the night well.  It was around Halloween.  He brought all the young men who brushed the floor at night out to the back yard with their brushes and he got a can of petrol. He gave everybody a can of Coke and we stood <Col N="908" /> around and said goodbye to the brushes.  He burned them.  He said they would not brush the floor any more but would stop the first piece of paper falling on the ground.  He said if they achieved that, they would not have to brush the floors and would be able to get home earlier. They did achieve it.  As with Fred Meijr, Paddy Keaveney was also setting out to instil the pride to which Senators Norris, Doyle and others referred when he spoke about sweeping and hosing down the street outside one's home and having that pride which is an example to others.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined a succession of measures.  He is using a carrot and stick approach. He is holding the stick behind his back and we, as a nation, know it.  I get the impression from the Bill that he does not wish to use the stick but that it is important to have the option.  This Bill is a genuine effort to address the problem but it will not be easy to do so.  However, we have taken the first steps.</P>
    <P>This Bill replaces the Litter Act, 1982.  Why do we need litter pollution rather than a &ldquo;litter&rdquo; Bill?  I am sure there is a reason and the Minister can explain.</P>
    <P>If we are to succeed in eradicating litter, the whole nation must be behind the initiative.  Then the Minister will have no need to use the powers he will possess because we, as a nation, will have changed our attitude.  I wish the Minister well and congratulate him on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Quinn that, unless people are conscious of their attitude to litter, there will be a litter problem irrespective of the amount of legislation we enact.  Education is the answer to the problem. Pride of property and community also plays a part in it.  The latest trends in national schools in particular where awards are presented by local authorities to schools for their appearance is what is needed.  My local authority, Roscommon County Council, has had such a measure in place over the past five or six years and, although the prize is only £100 or £200, all schools which apply for the scheme are visited.  More schools join the scheme every year.  If all schools in County Roscommon joined the scheme, then every child attending national school would have a new attitude towards litter and keeping the environment in good condition.  It is a scheme which the Minister might encourage in other local authorities.  It is a novel idea and has worked extremely well in County Roscommon.  While the schools and their grounds have been the main beneficiary, it has the great effect of involving children in caring for the environment by not allowing a place to become littered and not becoming a person who <Col N="909" /> litters.  Maybe other local authorities are involved in the scheme but I found it to be a good one.</P>
      <P>Each local authority will have to undertake a waste management plan which is welcome.  The main area I find trouble with is the use of lane-ways and other secluded areas for indiscriminate dumping.  That is still a major issue nationally and I do not know how we can get around it.  Placing signs which warn of £500 or £800 fines does not seem to have resolved the matter.  To some extent it is really window dressing which has not worked.</P>
      <P>Transportation of baled silage along county byroads is also a problem.  It is out of order for farmers to travel along public roads with baled silage to feed cattle.  They will not travel on their own land because they do not want to damage it by digging it up with a tractor.  Invariably there are plastic bags and silage on our county roads as well as massive amounts of clay and mud.  We should tell farmers they are not entitled to use roads as a convenience for the transportation of silage.  They have a responsibility to stay on their own land as far as possible when transporting such material.  I understand that where there are fragmented holdings farmers must come onto the public highway, but it is an abuse of the system to use roads as I have outlined.  I hope the Bill will discourage that type of activity.</P>
      <P>The dumping of carcases poses yet another problem.  While we have always had such problems down through the years they have been aggravated recently because of new stringent regulations governing the movement of cattle.  I appreciate the reason for the new regulations is to control the movement of diseased animals but due to the cost involved in disposing of carcases, which can amount to £300 or £400, people are burying or dumping dead animals.  We must discourage this dangerous practice which can pollute wells and water courses.  The Minister might refer to that point in his reply.</P>
      <P>There is only one plant in the country, in County Cavan, equipped to receive and safely dispose of carcases.  That problem could be overcome, however, by grant aiding other plants to bring them up to the proper standards to deal with carcases.  This would avoid having to transport such material all the way to County Cavan.</P>
      <P>If I have a conflict with the Minister it is because of the differential in refuse charges between city dwellers and those in rural areas. All rural householders now pay such charges but those in cities do not and some people feel quite aggrieved.  I have said in the House before that when the Minister removed local charges he conveniently excluded refuse charges knowing full well that there is a public refuse collection service in cities but not in most rural areas.  People outside urban areas can pay £60 or £70 a year just to have their domestic refuse collected.  That is an anomaly which amounts to discrimination and which may contribute to some indiscriminate dumping.  While I would not tolerate such dumping, that anomaly exists and some people feel badly about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> We should not allow election material like posters to be used, which can cause litter problems. I would prefer if the law did not allow such material to be posted at all and if the same rule was applied for everybody it would not make a difference.  If the Minister had included a provision in the Bill banning election posters he might have received cross party support but I appreciate there would have to be all party agreement on such a move.  My view is that election material should not be used and I would support legislation to that end.  I cannot speak for anyone else but from general discussions I know that many people are of the same view.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation but hope it will not be like other measures I have seen over the years to deal with water or air pollution which were not implemented because of a shortage of funds.  It is all very well to enact legislation and hand the matter over to local authorities, but councils must have some money.</P>
    <P>For many years my county has provided a litter warden who does an excellent job.  Many people do not want him to interfere when he highlights a litter problem but he has a job to do and he does it properly.  Many sections in the Bill call upon local authorities to undertake certain tasks but, in order to do so, an authority must have money.  Hopefully, when the legislation is enacted local authorities will have the necessary finances to implement it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has extended the powers of the Garda to impose on-the-spot litter fines, although the general trend these days is for such minor duties to be reduced rather than increased since gardaí are preoccupied in too many small roles which are not relevant to the fight against crime. I wonder if this move will be welcomed by members of the Garda Síochána.  I do not know what their view would be, but we abolished Garda involvement in checking dog licences some years ago and I do not see why we should involve gardaí in imposing on-the-spot fines for litter. There may be a good reason for it but should we waste the time of such valuable professional people in this way?  I am not taking away from the importance of imposing such fines but litter wardens are the people who can and should do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for sharing his time.  This Bill is probably one of the most important ones we have discussed for a long time.  Litter is a major problem and we seem to be a dirty nation in some ways.  Regardless of whether you drive through towns or the countryside you will see all types of litter strewn around. On beaches in summertime one sees people leaving plastic bags, nappies and other horrible stuff behind them.  They will not remove litter and bring it home in the car.  Driving through the country one sees plastic bags left all over the place by farmers who do not bother to remove them after spreading fertiliser.  This is disappointing. Northern Ireland seems to have a better <Col N="911" /> system.  Perhaps that is because there is tighter security there and more police on the streets.  Our towns and cities are not as clean as they were when gardaí were on the beat and people were afraid of on-the-spot fines.</P>
      <P>I compliment the tidy towns committees for the excellent work they do.  I also compliment the Minister for visiting Letterkenny 12 months ago to present an award to the tidy towns committee. I am sure he saw the changes which are taking place.  Letterkenny Urban District Council has decided to use a small street cleaning vehicle to keep the town clean.  Sweepers start at 6 a.m. and by 8 a.m. the streets have been swept.  Donegal County Council also employs the street sweeper on a regular basis when it is not being used by the urban district council.  It is a cheap service which every local authority should have.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the beautiful beaches in Donegal where people leave litter after them. Most people who go to the beaches have cars so they should be able to take their litter home with them.  However, we cannot seem to educate people to do this.  I welcome this legislation which will make people, especially young people, more aware of the problems caused by litter.  I also welcome the fact that the school curriculum contains a lot of information about the environment to which young people should be introduced at an early stage.  A recent survey showed that 80 per cent of sites are covered in litter.</P>
      <P>I commend people in some fast food outlets for trying to clean the street outside their shops after they close.  I commend the owner of one fast food outlet in Letterkenny which gave a prize of a bicycle for the cleanest area.  He was trying to draw attention to the fact that people should throw their used food containers in a wastepaper basket.</P>
      <P>Since one would imagine that secondary school students would be aware of the problems caused by litter, it was disappointing to find they are among the highest polluters.  It is also unacceptable that people cannot throw their bank receipts from ATM machines in the baskets provided.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the initiatives he is taking to prevent litter.  I welcome the work being done by local authorities.  A number of colourful hoardings were put up in Letterkenny to encourage people to take their litter home with them.  A few hoardings put up by the prisoners groups are not as colourful but local authorities are afraid to remove them.  It is like trying to improve the state of plastic signs and billboards in towns.  Many local authorities have problems trying to stop people putting up plastic signs, but Donegal County Council was successful in this regard.  We must condemn the fact that local authorities are afraid to remove posters put up for political reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If local authorities take the initiative by conducting advertising campaigns and making statements at local meetings, which are published in <Col N="912" /> the newspapers, we might be able to solve the litter problem.  I welcome the provision of £400,000 to control litter.</P>
    <P>Owners of public houses and off licences are not doing enough to prevent litter.  People often throw cans and bottles on the streets at night when they leave their premises.  One of the problems is the lack of gardaí on the streets which means people cannot be fined on the spot.</P>
    <P>This legislation is typical of how the Minister has controlled his Department since he took office.  We will only solve this problem if local authorities take the initiative.  Litter management plans must be prepared by local authorities.  It is important for county councils and urban district councils to advertise in local newspapers, many of which are free.  Such campaigns could be used to educate people because everyone reads newspapers.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned an American recycling system.  Donegal County Council has received a proposal from an American company to build a £5 million recycling plant.  However, it maintains there is not enough refuse in Donegal and that it would have to bring in waste from Sligo, Leitrim and Derry to make it pay.  It has homed in on one specific area approximately four miles from the town.  However, the county council has decided to use that land for its landfill site. People who live in the area are concerned that it will be turned into a huge dump.  Local authorities must be careful where they allow such recycling plants to be located.  We all welcome recycling but we must choose the right sites.</P>
    <P>I welcome the steps the Minister is taking to prevent litter.  I also welcome this Bill which tightens the 1982 legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief partly because I have not done my homework as well as I should have on the details of the Bill and partly because I agree with much of what has been said and I do not want to repeat it.  However, I stress the importance of trying to inculcate an attitude which comes as a culture shock to many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he has distributed material to schools at primary and secondary level.  He should not stop at second level.  I come from a campus which, apart from one neo-Stalinist corner, is one of the loveliest to be found anywhere. It is appalling how degraded it is by litter.  One would almost be ashamed at times to bring visitors to it because of the amount of litter.  It is not that students are dirtier than anyone else.  Now that more young people are going to third level, this material should be sent to students' unions.  I would have tidy campus and dirty campus prizes, although given the year that is in it I am sure the Minister does not want to be seen awarding the first dirty campus prize initiated under legislation. I would try every trick in the book to raise consciousness among young people in particular because if it becomes embedded in them, they will, with luck, keep it for life.  That recommendation <Col N="913" /> should not cost much but I hope it would have an impact if sustained over time.</P>
    <P>How much money is spent by public authorities on cleaning?  This is a different issue to individuals keeping the footpath in front of their shops or houses clean, as regularly happens on the Continent. How much does Dublin or Cork spend on cleaning compared with cities of comparable size on the Continent or in the United States?  In continental cities one sees streets being cleaned daily, either late in the evening or early in the morning. I wonder if we spend nearly as much, allowing for the variables involved in these matters, as other cities.  If we do not, it signals where our priorities lie.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say we are dirty people, although we have been from time to time, but we are slovenly in these matters.  If the anti-litter campaign is have maximum impact it must have a combination of public and private involvement. The public sector must be seen to do its part in an almost preventive way.  It should convey the attitude that litter is so unacceptable it will be cleaned up daily.  That will establish minimum standards which, one hopes, will help elevate private perceptions of what is an acceptable level of litter.  I do not wish to use the phrase &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; for what is on the ground, but we should aim in that direction as far as possible. That involves being prepared to spend more than we are in a position to spend at present.</P>
    <P>They are my recommendations.  I welcome the Bill.  It is more important than the more spectacular legislation that comes before the House.  Who knows if much of that legislation will work?  If it does work, it will be seen to work.  Although it is probably low profile legislation, it is most important and I congratulate the Minister on it. It will be a step forward if it can be implemented effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill, but I wonder if we can legislate to create a nation that is clean in its habits.  One of Ireland's biggest problems is that Irish people are inherently slovenly.</P>
      <P>We tolerate litter, filth and conditions in our scenic areas that would not be tolerated anywhere else.  I cannot understand that psychology. When one visits Glendalough and the Wicklow Mountains one can see carefully packaged litter which has been brought there by people from Dublin or the surrounding towns.  In addition to enjoying the countryside, they leave a carefully parcelled hallmark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is good legislation but we should not delude ourselves into believing it will create a better country.  We must work on people's minds and create a sense of civic pride. I welcome the initiatives the Minister has taken in this area.  The Bill makes such good sense I will simply comment on its sections.  Senator Lee referred to the cost of street cleaning.  Litter can be found everywhere but it is predominantly an <Col N="914" /> urban problem.  We must face the reality that we will not create a litter free built environment unless we are prepared to put resources into it.</P>
    <P>In every continental town one can see street cleaning operations taking place after commercial business hours and often late at night.  In French towns, for example, one regularly sees streets being hosed and washed.  Evidently many resources are put into such operations, which indicates that people are willing to pay taxes for it.  Government must levy tax for everything it gives.  By putting more onus on the individual, we are avoiding the reality we cannot and should not try to avoid, namely, that creating a litter free environment is about investing resources.</P>
    <P>Section 6 puts a statutory responsibility on the owners and occupiers of properties to keep the area around such properties clean.  That is welcome; it is something one should do in the natural course of events.  I live on a main thoroughfare in Bray and one of the services I carry out for my constituents each Saturday morning is to remove the fast food packaging which litters the area around my house after the previous night.  It is an irritating task but it is something one must do.</P>
    <P>Street cleaning should primarily be the responsibility of the local authority, although I accept that people who live and carry out commercial operations in these areas should try to keep the surrounding area clean.  The Minister will remember one of the great traditions in Wexford, where both of us grew up, of people in towns and villages spending one day each week cleaning and washing the streets.  That tradition lasted for many years and it is hard to find out why it finished.  The Minister is trying to recreate the attitude that every citizen must take responsibility for the problem.  I welcome that, but there also must be a statutory responsibility on local authorities.</P>
    <P>We are a religious people and local authorities observe all the holy days and bank holidays.  A major problem in many urban areas, including Bray, is that bank holidays often coincide with bin collection days.  In areas such as Connolly Square and Kevin Square in Bray the bins are not collected on banks holidays.  Those houses do not have back gardens so plastic bags full of litter must be left on the street.  If there are two bank holidays in a row or if there is a problem with bin collection, it can result in an unsustainable amount of litter.  The Minister might consider putting a statutory responsibility on local authorities to ensure bin collection services are comprehensive.</P>
    <P>I can give the Minister a long list of areas where bins are collected on Mondays but where there is no collection on bank holidays or on religious holidays that might fall on Mondays.  In areas where there are old houses which have little surrounding space or which open onto streets, there is nowhere to store litter.  Inevitably it is left in black plastic bags outside the doors of the houses and dogs, cats and other scavengers cause the litter to be strewn on the road.  That problem <Col N="915" /> arises because the local authority has not fulfilled its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions regarding the responsibilities of owners of houses, particularly owners of houses in multiple lettings.  Properties in multiple lettings can be a serious problem. They are usually located in town centres and frequently do not have provision for the storage of litter.  I also welcome the provisions in section 7. If one travels on the N11 between the Loughlinstown bypass and the Fassaroe overpass one can see where beautiful planting was carried out on both sides of the road by the two county councils. However, the plants are covered by plastic and wind blown litter from the many open top lorries which travel that road carrying litter.  That should be an offence.  One of the operators who travels that road is exemplary in that he has tremendous facilities to prevent that occurring.  However, many operators still carry litter through the area in open top lorries.  The Minister should examine the possibility of imposing a specific responsibility under section 7 on people who transport waste to ensure that it cannot blow across the countryside.</P>
    <P>In addition, something will have to be done to create a sense of responsibility in the NRA.</P>

    <Title>Development of Economic Environment: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann is concerned that we do not yet as a nation fully appreciate the massive economic and social benefits to be gained from creating a fully competitive open-market society.</P>
      <P>I tabled this motion because I am very enthusiastic about the potential of competition and I want to share my enthusiasm with the nation.  I purposely worded the motion so that it does not criticise anyone and I am surprised that the Government has tabled an amendment. However, we might deal with that issue later.</P>
      <P>I will now discuss my enthusiasm for competition. We are virtually ignoring the massive economic and social benefits which could flow from a truly competitive society. Despite this week's arrival of new competition in broadcasting and telecommunications and the establishment of an aggressive Competition Authority with sharp teeth, Irish culture remains profoundly non-competitive at heart.  Most of the change on the competitive front has been driven by Europe and has emanated from Brussels.  We would not have brought about such changes on our own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a nation, we do not understand the benefits of competition.  Left to ourselves, we tend to turn away from and dilute competition rather than <Col N="916" /> embrace it enthusiastically and exploit its benefits. A competitive society is one of open doors, not closed shops.  It is a society where the cardinal principle is of earning a living through meeting the demands and needs of customers and doing so better than the competition.  It is not a society where the cardinal principle is that the world owes me a living.  This antipathy to full competition is deeply ingrained in Irish people.  It extends to the media and includes legislators, administrators and the management and workers of many organisations in the private and public sectors.</P>
    <P>Many people share a perception that open competition is somehow evil and must be controlled and diluted.  This attitude is holding us back.  It is not in our best interests to allow this to happen.  We must recognise competition as a good thing in economic and social terms and seek to nurture, encourage and protect it wherever possible.  I will provide four brief examples of this attitude.</P>
    <P>If a retail price war is in prospect, the media treats it as negative not positive and such headlines as &ldquo;Price War Looms&rdquo; are typical.  However, vigorous price competition is good and almost always benefits the customer in both the short and long term.  I have been involved in the grocery business for 31 years and fierce competition for a generation or more has had a major influence on keeping inflation at bay.  Without an effective distribution centre and sector, our overall cost of living during the past 30 years would have been at least 20 per cent higher than at present.  That is a substantial benefit.  I work in a business where 18 grocery chains have ceased trading but customers and the economy have benefited.</P>
    <P>Another example of the wrong attitude was highlighted when Ireland obtained a full derogation from the full liberalisation of the telecommunications industry.  Originally this was to have been for five years but, thankfully, it has been reduced to two.  This derogation is a bad thing but it was hailed as a victory because Telecom Éireann would not have to face competition for a further two years.  I do not understand that attitude and we should have stated that it was a failure on our part.  This delay on the road to full liberalisation is bad for the customer and, therefore, bad for the citizen because they must pay more.  It is bad for the economy because low priced telecommunications are a critical element in accelerating growth.  People have stated that competition should not be encouraged because Telecom Éireann is a semi-State company. However, competition benefits customers, taxpayers and the public in general.  The derogation will, perhaps, have the worst effect on Telecom Éireann and its workforce.  Far from protecting the company and its workers, it exposes them by putting off the day when they are fully equipped to survive and thrive in a newly competitive marketplace. Seeking derogations from competition <Col N="917" /> is akin to King Canute attempting to turn back the tide.</P>
    <P>The third example of an anti-competitive attitude involves Dublin taxis.  This is one of my pet hates because totally artificial constraints are placed on supply and demand.  The customer's needs are not being fully met and the classic market response to this would be that new interests enter the market to increase supply.  However, that has not happened in the case of Dublin taxis. The number of taxis in Dublin is controlled not by market forces but by bureaucracy.  I favour the regulation of taxis because carriage vehicles should be safe and their drivers should be extremely familiar with the territory they cover.  I am very impressed with London taxis.  However, Dublin Corporation does not seem to bother with regulation and is not concerned with such niceties. It is primarily concerned with what is effectively a cartel.  An understandable side effect of this is the market in taxi plates which raises the cost of entering the carriage business.  Keeping the cost of market entry high never benefits the customer, it benefits those who want to exploit the customer.  Our entire approach to transport is riddled with anti-competitive attitudes.</P>
    <P>My final example also involves artificial constraints on meeting customer demand and I believe it will appeal to the Minister of State who has strong views about competition in this area. Howls are emanating from the publicans' lobby in response to the suggestion by the head of the Competition Authority that the lack of full competition is keeping prices high in the Dublin area. The prices charged for alcohol in off-licences, where full competition exists, decreased during the past ten years.  However, they increased sharply in public houses in the same period.  A person operating a successful restaurant cannot complain if someone opens another restaurant in the adjoining premises.  What would have happened in Dublin if it had been decided 20 years ago that there should be a cartel of restaurants and no one could open a new premises unless they obtained a licence and permission to do so?  What would have happened if we had limited the number of hotels because we wanted to ensure that people did not actively compete with each other?  In that context, we must consider the number of hotels in Dublin which are booming, thriving and attracting increased business to the city.</P>
    <P>Suggestions that full competition would infringe the sacred property rights of existing publicans are hogwash.  Subtly and suitably disguised, this is the dreary old whinge that &ldquo;the world owes me a living&rdquo;.  My company owns a number of licences and it paid money for them but I am not foolish enough to think anybody owes me a living as a result.  When I hear talk of the correct number of pubs for an area or of maintaining an orderly market, I am reminded of the first time I was in Leningrad, Russia.  As we went down Leningrad's main street, our guide said that an art gallery and a museum were on our left and the best grocery store in the city was <Col N="918" /> on our right.  I asked if we could stop and see the store.  We were disappointed as it was not even self-service and was very old fashioned.  She said they had a supermarket also and made arrangements for us to see the supermarket the following morning.  I met the grocery manager of the supermarket and I asked him how many customers he had, to which he replied 19,257.  This is the first question anybody in business should ask, not how much money one takes in.  I was impressed because that can be figured out with good technology. I asked him how he knew that because he did not seem to have good technology.  He said this was the number of people who live in this town.  At that time in Russia the size of a supermarket was related to the population of the town or city in which it was built.  It was the worst supermarket I have ever seen, was clearly not related to customers needs and there was no competition.</P>
    <P>A way has to be found to create competition in everything we do.  I am delighted to see it coming into radio this week.  It will liven up radio and will be hugely beneficial to listeners.  I want to see competition with Telecom Éireann because it will benefit callers.</P>
    <P>However well intentioned one may be, when one restricts competition the customer suffers and not just in price.  Competition is about a great deal more than price.  I want to make a connection between a competitive culture and a society that is fully customer driven.  They are almost two sides of the one coin.  The trend towards a customer driven society is one of the great historical movements of the twentieth century.  Long after people have forgotten about Communism and Thatcherism, this trend will remain and will be seen as one of the great shifts in society.  A truly customer driven culture is democracy in action.  It works for the benefit of the people, not the benefit of a small elite group within the community.</P>
    <P>Most companies are not customer driven, even fewer State companies are, although there is no necessity for that to be so.  A sense of customer commitment in the public service is even rarer, but if one injects that type of customer focus wonderful things begin to happen.  As part of the strategic management initiative, all Government Departments are identifying their customers and are putting their needs at the centre of what they do.  We as a nation have to find a way of recognising the great benefit of having a competitive marketplace.  I am not talking about privatisation but about a competitive marketplace.  The beneficiaries in such a marketplace are the customers. As a nation, we want to move towards a much more competitive marketplace in everything we do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am firmly divided on this motion and I will try to strike a balance.  I hope Senator Quinn does not take that badly.  I agree with virtually everything he said, but had he referred to a fully competitive open market economy I would have little difficulty in agreeing with <Col N="919" /> 95 per cent of what he said.  However, when one refers to an open market society one is bringing in a much wider dimension than economy.  One must strive for the optimum balance between competitiveness in those areas where competitiveness is appropriate and co-operation in those areas of social activity where co-operation is more appropriate.  The Senator would not dissent from that, but the phrasing of the amendment applies a monolithic criterion of competitiveness across every area of activity.</P>
      <P>I agree there is a strong anti-competitive streak in our inherited psyche.  It is largely explicable in historical terms because of a need for security, given our historical background, which is understandable in an objectively insecure society.  We have carried it over into a period when we have become much more successful and prosperous economically and when there is not the same objective explanation for the obsession with security.  Therefore, I welcome the emphasis on greater competitiveness in many areas of economic and administrative activity.</P>
      <P>My background is in education, an area which many would regard as highly uncompetitive. There is little direct institutional competitiveness in higher education.  I get paid the same whether I work 100 hours per week or zero hours per week. There is little incentive on the one hand, and little disincentive on the other.  It is the same with virtually everybody in this sector.  It is quite remarkable how many people work a great deal more than one might expect, although there are also some of the other type.  We are not uncompetitive and do not think in those terms.  We do not compete in monetary terms but compete intensively internationally in reputation terms, because every word we write in academic journals etc. will be scrutinised &mdash; and repudiated, if possible &mdash; by dearly beloved colleagues at home or abroad.  We are not profit driven in a strictly economic sense. There are people in this country who may not appear to be part of a competitive economy but who nevertheless have a highly developed competitive instinct, at times a murderously competitive instinct.  We need to take account of how we harness those impulses if we are to optimise the potential of latent or diverted competitive instincts.</P>
      <P>There is a big difference between competitiveness in a small home market and a big one. We undoubtedly fostered many small protected firms in this country behind the tariff walls which had little idea of a competitive instinct.  They formed cosy cartels quickly with each other and their unions in order to exploit the customer.  One of the reasons so much Irish industry went to the wall after the 1965 and 1966 agreements with Britain and entry to the EEC was that even after 30 or 40 years a competitive instinct had not been inculcated in many of those who were doing nicely with a cosy share of a protected market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our small scale and the insecurity, which was an integral part of Irish existence for a long period, <Col N="920" /> contributed to fostering this mentality.  I do not believe we are not normal people.  We are changing as opportunities improve; and it is important we drive further in that direction, although we must strike a balance.  It is admirable that Senator Quinn tabled this motion at this time.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Quinn speak about the strategic management initiative.  I hope he is placed on every committee dealing with it because I contacted three Departments this week and not one has heard of the strategic management initiative or, if they have, they are concealing it very effectively.  I have no doubt it is flourishing in other quarters.  There is still some distance to go before everybody becomes fully aware of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general thrust of what Senator Quinn said.  I agree with his observation that it is not privatisation as such but the competitiveness of the competition privatisation is assumed to bring that is the gain for the economy.  Privatisation in other economies has had a detrimental rather than a positive effect in a number of cases. Whatever about public monopoly, private monopoly is even more likely to involve a rip off of the customer.  I would look strictly at the merits &mdash; in so far as one can look at things on their merits independently of an ideological position &mdash; of specific proposals in these areas.  I would not be as ideological as the phrasing of the motion implies, but a pragmatic competitionist, if there is such a word.  One of the greatest challenges confronting us is how we combine a capacity for competitiveness in the economic sphere with a capacity for co-operation in the wider social sphere.  Civilisation depends on striking that balance &mdash; we cannot have economic efficiency without a high degree of competition or a civilised society without a high degree of co-operation.  We must find a way to foster the competitive instinct while fostering the co-operative instinct.  That is the real challenge.  I agree with Senator Quinn that we need to go further in the competitive direction in the economic area, which is why I am happy to second the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government amendment to the motion will not be moved.  Much of what the two previous speakers said was very constructive. However, I was confused when Senator Quinn made the comparison with Russia.  Ireland has never been compared to Russia and I would not like people to think we should learn from them, because even in our worst days we did not only have one supermarket or shop in a town.  We had huckster shops and people were in competition with each other.  I do not agree with the notion that because others are opening up supermarkets our society is better off.  Supermarkets are not losing money as a result of the competition &mdash; people compete to make money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would we be better off if there was competition in all areas?  If there was competition in the health area, many people would be without <Col N="921" /> health services.  If we allow competition in the electricity area, we must be sure we get a proper service.  Looking at the British economy, concerns have been raised as regards the supply of water, particularly in northern England, and the cost of water since it was privatised.  The British Government sold off many areas in which there was a need for competition, particularly transport. However, money is not being spent in many areas of transport since privatisation because it is not worth it to those who have invested in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn was right in what he said about taxis in the capital city.  In Cork city, a taxi or hackney service is available at a keen price and at any time of the day; but is everything above board?  Are they operating in the same way as taxis and hackneys in Dublin?  I give credit to taxi drivers in Dublin because they put in the hours and provide a service.  While there is a need for more taxis in Dublin, it should not be a free for all because some will operate illegally.  While the public is getting a service, it is not necessarily a good one.</P>
    <P>Although the economy is doing well, there are not enough people, particularly young people, at work.  If we do something we do it well and we should take pride in that.  People coming from Europe or the United States to Ireland to invest see the opportunities provided by our education system.  If Senator Lee works ten or 40 hours per week, he gets paid the same; but I do not.  He said if he does not work, he still gets paid the same wage.  Is that fair?  I am not saying for one moment that Senator Lee does not put in the hours.  He has an excellent mind and has considerable abilities, like Senator Quinn and others, and they should be complimented.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago a private college in Dublin went into receivership, although students had paid huge fees.  Should we allow our health and education systems be privatised and face competition? Unlike the State, nobody would spend over £4 billion on our education system, £4 billion on our welfare system or a similar amount on our health service.  If we were to privatise these areas, elderly people would not be looked after.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn was right in what he said about Telecom Éireann but it is still not cheap enough. Our telephone charges are still the highest in Europe or even in the world.  If we had not allowed money to be borrowed at cheap rates, would we be experiencing this economic boom? Inflation has been low in recent years, and this has been good for us.  It should not be forgotten that when inflation was high financial institutions made the most and benefited from this country more than anyone else.  The two largest banking institutions make over £400 million per year each in profit, which is £1.2 million per day.  They open for five hours per day, five days per week, are closed Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day and still make £1.2 million per day.  This is where there should be more competition.</P>
    <P>The airlines are another example.  If we had not allowed Ryanair to invest and compete, how <Col N="922" /> would Aer Lingus treat us now?  However, the middle ground should be taken on this and I would be afraid of the consequences of not doing so.  Nonetheless, Ireland is doing well because Ryanair is prepared to compete.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle of the motion, but I agree with Senator Lee that there are aspects of it which need some form of control. It is timely that Senator Quinn has tabled this motion and I compliment him for it.  No one could disagree with the points he made.</P>
      <P>The best example of the positive impact of competition is the removal from the old uncompetitive Department of Posts and Telegraphs of some semi-State bodies and their transformation into the new companies of An Post and Telecom Éireann.  Many say they are still uncompetitive but they are making major strides in the direction of competition.  This is also true of the old CIE company and the new Bus Éireann one.  Five or six years ago it cost £23 to travel from Galway to Dublin by bus or train but it now costs as little as £6 or £7 by Bus Éireann due to private competition on the route.  Nowhere has there been greater development than in the airlines, where the influence of Ryanair has reduced fares on the London route significantly.  There are also bad examples where competition does not exist on air routes &mdash; for example, the regional airports. Shannon Airport recently allowed competition between A B Shannon and Aer Lingus on the London route which has significantly reduced fares.</P>
      <P>I agree in principle that there is a need for a more competitive culture.  However, some areas require control.  While I agree there is a need for open and strong competition in Senator Quinn's business, supermarkets, it has resulted in negative effects.  I would like to hear what he has to say about this.  Strong competition in the supermarket business has led to below cost selling, small suppliers being squeezed significantly and difficulties being created for suppliers and consumers.  I recall ten years ago being a member of the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services which studied the impact of below cost selling.  It found that some supermarket chains with a good marketing policy were able to convey the message that they were selling at very low prices when it was only a small number of loss leaders and the basket of goods was more expensive to the customer overall.  This is an example of the ingenious methods people employ to show they are competitive without their being so.  Would open competition allow that sort of abuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one could but argue that there is a need for more competition in the taxi business.  In Galway there has been a liberal regime of issuing hackney licences with several hundred being issued in the past years.  It has not had any major effect on fares but it has been unfair to people who have paid £50,000 for a taxi licence.  Their neighbours can spend £100 on a hackney licence and, by stretching a bad law, can compete unfairly with <Col N="923" /> the taxi driver who has paid dearly for his licence. Regulation is necessary; but I agree with the principle of competition in the area, especially in Dublin, where there are not enough taxis.  The fault lies with the authorities, who have not responded to the need for more licences to be issued as necessary.  In Galway it was a back door effort on the part of the local authority to grant hackney licences when it should have granted taxi licences in the first instance and charged a proper price for them, bringing money into the public sector.</P>
    <P>I find the issue of pubs an interesting and useful one and the Minister is to be congratulated for the stance he has taken with publicans on the price of drink.  In the little town of Gort, where I used to live, there are 27 pubs for 1,000 people. In the new town I represent, Knocknacarra, on the western environs of Galway city, there are 8,000 people and no pub.  There was one attempt to build one, which was disallowed for a variety of reasons.  There is a need for some form of proper planning, control and development which will change the situation of having 27 pubs in Gort &mdash; they know all about competition &mdash; and major suburbs with none and where, if permission and a licence could be obtained, one would have it made.</P>
    <P>I agree we are a society which shuns competition, and nowhere more obviously than in the public service.  I am glad to see that a transformation is taking place in the public service and in the semi-States.  I hope the strategic management initiative will enhance that, where previously, public sector bodies did not want to know about competition.</P>
    <P>The teaching profession, which I and the Leas-Chathaoirleach come from, is an example of a radical new approach which must be taken.  Many teachers do not want to be teachers and perhaps did not want to be for the past ten to 15 years. They are now in their late 50s, are burned out and want to retire.  I hope we can soon afford to allow them retire and then pay more to good young teachers to be competitive and better than the others.  It is a system which works well in France where public servants are paid on the basis of performance.  Denis Brosnan said recently that you must examine your position in the company which employs you and decide if you are an asset or a liability.  If the company were without you, would it make more money or do a better job?  I hope the public service goes that route and that public servants, be they teachers, civil servants or others, are paid for performance and become more competitive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about this motion.  If it advocates unfettered capitalism, I do not agree with it.  There must be some restrictions. In a global context restrictions are necessary in the protection of undeveloped and underdeveloped economies.  We did not say no to structural and cohesion funds when we felt we <Col N="924" /> needed a leg up in competing with our European partners.  We were grateful when the EU decided to tilt the balance in favour of certain countries thus giving us a chance to participate in the market.</P>
      <P>I received a questionnaire from Oxfam today. The last question says:</P>
      <P>Throughout the developing world, transnational corporations have been attracted by unregulated, open-door investment policies. Unregulated transnational operations often lead to poorly paid jobs conducted mostly by women and children in conditions that are extremely hazardous to health.  Do you believe that a social clause which would seek to protect workers' basic rights as outlined in International Labour Organisation's core conventions should be included in trade agreements negotiated, implemented and monitored by the World Trade Organisation?</P>
      <P>My answer is yes.  There has to be control in relation to workers rights and in the protection of those who have no jobs.  If a limiting of the competitive environment through such measures as the working time legislation is not attempted, certain people will have no jobs while others will work all the hours God gives them, leaving no time to see their families.</P>
      <P>There must also be a geographical balance.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment recently announced incentives to bring more jobs to smaller towns.  That type of development is positive and to be welcomed.  Whatever measures are taken to maintain the population of rural areas are also to be welcomed.  This may mean limiting competition.  The attempts to modify the growth of Dublin Airport to the benefit of Shannon is good.  Whatever can be done to avoid having everything happen around the Dublin area should be done.  I think Senator Quinn would agree with me.</P>
      <P>Regarding essential services such as telephones and electricity, there has to be a social clause whereby people living on the side of a mountain can have basic services even though, competitively, they could not cost effectively pay for those services.  Neither should there be competition in areas such as health and education.  I totally oppose a schools' league table which is being spoken of in Britain.  A basic service should be provided for everybody on the basis of need and access.</P>
      <P>There must also be control in the area of private monopolies.  We are aware of the debate over Sky TV.</P>
      <P>Competition is not fair if some people are operating in the black economy while others are operating in the white economy.  I do not think Senator Quinn would have any problems with my reservations in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be competition in the fairly traded commodities sector once the areas I have referred to are excluded, namely, the provision of basic services, worker protection and the protection <Col N="925" /> of underdeveloped economies.  I agree with Senator Quinn that we have not been as competitive in the past as we should have been.  However, this is changing.  An Bord Tráchtala's annual review and outlook published at the end of 1995 speaks of a strategy for 2001.  Their primary target is to increase indigenous exports from the 1994 base of £3.28 billion to £8.2 billion by 2001.  They are trying to achieve this through intervention by establishing targeted marketing consultancy programmes using Irish Embassies, a business leads campaign and a group marketing scheme.  They are helping producers compete on the world market. The work being done by Forbairt, Shannon Development and the IDA in supporting industry is positive.  It is an intervention in the market.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the amount of money floating around the world financial markets.  I know we are getting our slice, particularly through the IFSC, but there is a huge amount of money moving around on a 24 hour basis and I feel that only a very small sector of the population is benefiting.  It is uncontrollable.</P>
    <P>I have a yes and no attitude to the motion.  As long as the various controls are maintained, which involve Government intervention, I am in favour of competition.  We have come a long way from the old days of putting in the time and not really putting in the effort.  Small businesses are in an extremely competitive market and they have had to sharpen themselves in order to compete.  That is very good for the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for sponsoring this motion. It is appropriate that this House considers issues such as this.  I acknowledge Senator Quinn's credentials in terms of contributing to this debate.  In business he has put the focus on the customer and the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Like Senator Lee, I describe myself as a pragmatic competitionist.  The difference between Senator Quinn and Senator Lee seems to be that if Senator Lee had been in Leningrad he would have chosen to go to the Winter Palace first and then the supermarket.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Senators have a major contribution to make.  Senator Quinn has raised four areas that are not as major or significant as I thought might have been the case when I was anticipating what would be raised.  Concentration on the incidence of retail price war, derogation from the telecom liberalisation, the matter of taxis in Dublin and the issue of pubs in Dublin and other major urban centres betrays a conviction on Senator Quinn's part that in so far as the thrust of economic policy goes, we have come a long way and that the thrust of economic policy in general is in favour of the competition ethic. That revolution has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> As Senator Fahey said, the situation with regard to publicans is very peculiar.  It can probably be explained in historical terms in so far as we probably do have sufficient licences in the country but they are probably in the wrong places.  It seems crazy to any reasonable person that the situation is so anachronistic that some Victorian law determines whether one can open a pub in a centre of large population because the law states that the pub must be opened within a certain number of paces.  If the distance between licences does not satisfy this stipulation, one pub must be closed to open another, or two licences must be quenched to get a new one.  As Senator Quinn is aware, we are seeking to deal with those anachronisms.  The Competition Authority, which I think is evidence of the conversion, is carrying out a study on the whole question of pub licensing and the resultant impact on pub prices and customer service.  The authority, as a result of the Competition Amendment Bill, 1996, has the capacity to have its own decisions implemented through the office of the Director of Enforcement and we look forward to that.  In the interim, I had to take certain steps to stabilise pricing until the report is ready.  I am not arguing that price control is the ideal way to deal with this problem. It is not.  However, in a situation where one is confronted by unreasonable demands, given what vintners' representatives said to Government before the budget and given that Government kept its side of the bargain, I do not think there was very much choice in the matter.</P>
    <P>The taxi situation in Dublin is also a historical matter.  It would be a very foolish Minister or city manager who would wade into the middle of that debate without having some regard to how they tread.  If one does not tiptoe carefully through the tulips on that issue, none of us will have any taxis. It is a situation which has to be examined on its merits but it does seem very unfair to the customer.</P>
    <P>On the question of the retail price war and the allegation that price is always a good thing, I am not sure that things are quite as clear-cut as they have been made out to be.  I do not think that price is always necessarily a good thing because costs are externalised to other lower wage countries. One could be confronted with the phenomenon to which Senator O'Sullivan referred if one were to adhere entirely to the competitive ethic in that area.  Senator Fahey also raised the question as to whether retail price wars would drive small retailers out of the market, consequently resulting in the dominance of the few.  Clearly, there is a balance to be struck there.  Nonetheless, there would probably not be popular support for putting corner shops and smaller traders out of business.  I am not suggesting that should be countenanced if the price situation is so absurd that the service being offered by the multiples becomes the better choice.  I do not think that will happen because there is a competitive dynamic even in those situations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> I also believe it is true that lower prices can create more competitive local companies, but not if prices are so low that no national supplier cannot compete.  I think Senator Cregan was making that point.  Even in the retail area, the case is not an open and shut one.  I have been in the United States on Government business, and with the IDA in five American cities over the past five days.  One of the lasting impressions I was left with concerned the quality of their television programmes. It is an absolute nightmare to try to find out what is going on in the world and to have to put up with some brand of hair spray or dog food intervening between the first and second news stories.  Competition in broadcasting in the United States seems to have slumped to the lowest common denominator.  One found oneself harking after the good old BBC or even RTÉ, which I am not suggesting is perfect but which is a very fine station, given its resources by comparison with what is inflicted on the consumer &mdash; and which perhaps is having an impact on turning them into zombies &mdash; in the United States.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Telecom situation, which I accept is crucial for the reasons of which we are aware, I want to quote briefly from the report <i>Growing our Competitive Advantage:</i></P>
    <P>Within that context, Telecom Éireann's charges have been substantially cut with reductions in charges worth £130 million to business and domestic consumers having been implemented since the start of 1995.  The company has also introduced a customers' charter with provision for compensation if the company fails to meet its standards for line connection and fault repair.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn would probably accept that a good deal of progress has been made there.  We are confronted with a situation where a company which employed 21,000 people in the recent past now employs in the region of 11,000.  Many people's livelihoods rest on that and it is a question of managing transition effectively.</P>
    <P>Let me say, in the manner of Senator Lee, that I found the concept of Senator Quinn's notion of an &ldquo;open-market society&rdquo; intriguing.  I certainly hope he does not view society purely in terms of markets, which smacks of the monetarist view that there is no such thing as society, only an economy.  I suspect that a society composed of nothing more than competitive markets is not one in which the vast majority of this country would want to live.  In that regard, I think the House should have no concerns at any perceived lack of public appreciation for such a creation.  A society dominated by unregulated market competition can yield massive economic benefits, as has been demonstrated again and again throughout history wherever, to use Senator O'Sullivan's term, unfettered capitalism has been given its head. However, these benefits accrue to the few, not to the many, and are won at a high cost, one which is paid throughout society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> Therefore, I would dispute some of the premises on which the motion is founded.  What we should be seeking is the development of an environment which stimulates innovation, entrepreneurship and enterprise at all levels and which fairly rewards those who contribute positively to this.  By creating the appropriate environment for enterprise which stimulates risks and spreads the rewards, we can achieve both economic and social benefits.  This was very much the message of the Culliton report and it will be reiterated and amplified in the statement on Enterprise Strategy which the Government intends to publish shortly.</P>
    <P>We are currently seeing the benefits arising from the improvements the Government has made in the environment for enterprise.  These are reflected first and foremost in the economic fundamentals.  Recent years have seen a dramatic improvement in Irish economic performance, as Senator Cregan said.  GNP growth, in particular, has been very impressive, with growth rates of 7 per cent in 1994 and 1995 and an estimated increase of 6 per cent for 1996.  The average GNP growth of 4.5 per cent since 1992 compares very favourably with the EU 15 average of 1.5 per cent.  Ireland's fiscal deficit is now one of the lowest among EU member states and is continuing to fall.  The general Government deficit (GGD) has been reduced from 2.2 per cent of GDP in 1993 to approximately 1.5 per cent in 1996.  The debt/GDP ratio has also fallen, from 94 per cent in 1993 to an estimated 76 per cent at the end of 1996.  In addition, inflation and interest rates in that period generally have been historically low.</P>
    <P>Taxation issues have also been tackled by the Government.  Over its lifetime 4 to 5 per cent has been taken off the tax take from the average industrial wage.  There has been a 12 per cent decrease in the small business corporation tax rate and 4 per cent off the higher corporation tax rate.  In addition, we have delivered significant reforms of employers' PRSI, with two thirds of the workforce on the lower 8.5 per cent rate of PRSI.</P>
    <P>These achievements have translated into an environment for enterprise in which people are willing to take risks, to invest and to generate employment opportunities right across the economy in both services and manufacturing.  In the three years up to April 1996, the numbers at work grew by 136,000. When the 1997 labour force survey is published it is likely to show a further net increase of 40,000 in the numbers at work.</P>
    <P>The prudent management of the economy, supported by the consensus approach embodied in the PCW, has created an environment in which enterprise can play its part in the creation and reinforcement of a virtuous circle of growth and employment.  The recently concluded national agreement, Partnership 2000, will further underpin that growth.  However, it would be wrong to put the improved performance down to fiscal prudence in terms of the management of the main economic indicators.  My concern would be that <Col N="929" /> the fully competitive open market society envisaged in Senator Quinn's motion is one in which total faith is put in the private markets to sort matters out.  As the economist Cathal Guiomard has pointed out in his book <i>The Irish Disease:</i></P>
    <P>Markets cannot do everything.  They are not such perfectly self-regulating mechanisms that they can be turned over entirely to prices, profits and competition and thereafter left to their own devices.</P>
    <P>As Guiomard points out, unregulated markets can easily fall prey to anti-competitive practices like cartelisation and bid rigging, which are fundamentally antithetical to the consumer's interest.</P>
    <P>Perhaps of even more concern is that markets in themselves are inherently short term in their outlook.  An emphasis on the bottom line is fine when looked at on an individual company basis, but taken in the aggregate it ignores public goods such as education, training, healthcare, crime prevention and infrastructure.  These are the kind of factors crucial to the welfare of society, as distinct from economy, and its longer term economic performance.</P>
    <P>In his book <i>Ireland 1912-1985: Politics and Society</i> Senator Lee gives an eloquent description of the hardships caused by under-investment in many of these areas in Ireland in the 1920s and 1930s.  We can see the backlash in both the UK and the US against the &ldquo;greed is good&rdquo; mentality of the 1980s and the widespread concern about falling educational standards and declining infrastructure.</P>
    <P>There is a strong and continuing role for Government in ensuring we invest in the seed-corn of future growth.  This aim is shared by our partners in the EU through the Structural Funds, which, in tandem with national resources, have been deployed in ways which have a tangible effect on employment, economic performance and standards of living generally.  For example, in transport, £2.6 billion is being invested in our roads, seaports, airports and public transport systems under the 1994-1999 community support framework.  For business, these investments cut time to market and help to reduce the disadvantages Irish exporters experience due to our geographical peripherality.  Investments in support of enterprise are also of critical importance.</P>
    <P>There is no general consensus in favour of all-out, unregulated competition.  Free and fair, and I stress the term fair, competition, however, is very much part of the concept of a pro-enterprise environment that I outlined at the start of my address.  The State has a key role to play in ensuring that such competition is fostered.</P>
    <P>The Competition Act, 1991, brought forward a new era in Irish national competition legislation. The Act prohibits all restriction on competition &mdash; for example, price fixing, market sharing, bid rigging, and abuses of a dominant position &mdash; and applies to all areas of the economy, both private and public sector alike.  The Competition <Col N="930" /> Authority which was established under the Act has performed a very important role in its decision making and in promoting pro-competitive business behaviour.  Since the introduction of the legislation many companies have adopted competition compliance programmes and there is now a greater and growing awareness of the benefits of competition for the economy as a whole and for business generally.</P>
    <P>An acknowledged limitation of the 1991 Act was its reliance on private individuals or firms to take civil actions in the courts to remedy alleged anti-competitive practices.  It is understandable that enterprises, particularly small enterprises, have frequently been reluctant or unable to take this route, given the high costs of litigation, fears of commercial retaliation and problems of gathering sufficient evidence to sustain a <i>prima facie</i> claim in a civil action.</P>
    <P>This concern has been addressed in the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, which gives the Competition Authority the power to investigate alleged breaches of competition law, either as a result of complaints from third parties or on its own initiative.  The Act also allows the Competition Authority to take legal action where it judges this to be warranted.  This new more pro-active element in our framework of competition law underpins the Government's commitment to promoting the kind of free and fair competition that benefits the consumer.</P>
    <P>On the international stage, the Government also promoted competition as part of its programme during the recently concluded Irish Presidency of the EU.  The Culliton report highlighted the relative disadvantage faced by Ireland in the face of the high levels of industrial subsidies offered by certain other EU member states. During the Presidency, Ireland put forward detailed proposals for the reform of the system of control for state aids in Europe.  While, as might be expected, these proposals did not achieve universal approval, they nevertheless represented a first step in addressing the issue of a more rigorous control of state aids within the Union which, with the expressed support of the EU Council, can be built on over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The House will, of course, be aware of the general EU environment for competition as it applies across the area of infrastructure.  In that context, markets are being opened up in Ireland in a way which is sensitive and appropriate to our particular circumstances.  Telecommunications is a case in point, where increased competition within the industry has been provided for in the Government approved mandate of July 1995 which sets the liberalisation date for the industry at 1 January 2000 for both infrastructure and services.  This is a two year derogation from the date generally applicable within the EU.  However, it should be noted that the Government is not exercising its right to apply for the full five year derogation which it was originally granted.</P>
    <P>Terminal equipment and value-added services are already liberalised and provision for the introduction <Col N="931" /> of private networks to carry currently liberalised services will be effected from mid 1997. Competition has also been introduced in mobile telephony, where Esat Digifone has been awarded the licence to provide a competitor GSM mobile telephone service.  In addition, Telecom Éireann, through its shareholding in Cablelink, is committed to developing the cable network as a platform open to third parties on a cost-oriented and non &mdash; discriminatory basis for the delivery of a range of competitive services.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to establishing an independent regulatory regime as provided for in the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.  The legislation provides for the establishment of an Office of Director of Telecommunications Regulation and the transfer to that office of the Minister's existing regulatory functions in the areas of telephony, radio communications, and cable television services and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The identified need for increased investment in the telecom system and for increased scale in the face of global consolidation of the industry has been addressed by the sale of a 20 per cent stake in Telecom Éireann to PTT/Telia.  The consortium involves the Dutch telecom company PTT Telecom BV and Telia BV of Sweden.  Such investment will underpin the continuing competitiveness of Ireland as a location for services businesses depending on advanced telecommunications.</P>
    <P>I will now return to the role of Government in enterprise development.  I am concerned that the motion before the House sees no role for the State in helping companies to grow and to develop their competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>The key issue here, which applies to all of the State's interaction with enterprise, is one of balance. Clearly, closed markets and protectionism are not the foundations of high living standards and long-term growth.  Nor will an unfocused and overly generous grants regime foster innovation, entrepreneurship and jobs.  Having said this, there remains a valid role for the State in industrial development, both in terms of promoting indigenous enterprise and in attracting foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years we have been moving towards a more balanced approach which seeks to identify where the State can most effectively assist company development within the context of the overall enterprise environment. That balanced approach is demonstrably delivering results.  For example, a particularly encouraging feature is the fact that the historical trend of net job losses in the indigenous sector has been reversed, with jobs in indigenous companies assisted by Forbairt growing by 4,700 net last year.  This jobs growth has been accompanied by significant increases in output, which indicates an improvement in the underlying competitiveness of the indigenous sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> Foreign owned companies have also been making a major contribution to Ireland, both in terms of the jobs generated and in other ways.  In addition to the 7,300 new jobs created by foreign-owned companies last year, Forfás estimates that some £320 million in corporation tax was paid to the Exchequer by companies in the sector, and this does not include revenue returns from International Financial Services Centre companies. These financial returns, along with the £5 billion plus spent in the economy by overseas companies, have very positive knock-on benefits for indigenous manufacturing and services companies which are reflected in the overall job creation figures.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these results have been achieved by a balanced approach which does not depend solely on the blunt instrument of capital grants.  Science, technology and innovation is a case in point.  My office is responsible for a comprehensive range of supports which address the research and development infrastructure, through the programmes in advanced technology; skills issues, through the Techstart and Techman programmes and direct grant supports via the measure one scheme, which helps companies offset the risks involved in undertaking research and development.  These supports have helped create an environment in which business expenditure on research and development has risen from 0.47 per cent of GDP in 1987 to 1.02 per cent in 1995.  This increase in spend has moved Ireland much closer to the research and development spend of other advancing small countries, such as Norway and Denmark, and is an essential component in the achievement of sustainable, competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>Another example of the positive contribution made by Government is in the area of finance for enterprise.  Initiatives, such as the business expansion scheme, the access to finance scheme and the recently introduced seed and venture measure have incentivised both private individuals and the financial institutions to provide much needed seed capital and equity funding for manufacturing and services enterprises.  These initiatives, with the increased use of equity funding by Forbairt and SFADCo, are helping to create a culture in which the financial institutions become less risk averse and more receptive to funding enterprise, while companies for their part begin to develop a better appreciation of the disciplines and performance requirements which attach to such funds.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would put it to the House that substantial and worthwhile advances have been made towards the creation of an environment which stimulates innovation, entrepreneurship and enterprise, and that tangible benefits are flowing from this in terms of increased employment and improved living standards.  These benefits are, contrary to the motion before the House, fully appreciated.  I would stress that they are benefits which have been achieved by a balanced approach which is based on a commitment to sound economic management, regulation to <Col N="933" /> achieve free and fair competition and long-term investment in the productive capacity of the economy. This approach has been pursued in a way which acknowledges the strengths of the private markets but which also aims to identify where the market failures exist and moves to correct them. Increasingly, this is being done through partnership with the private sector rather than by competing with, or substituting for, private enterprise.</P>
    <P>It would be naive to suggest that no more needs to be done.  The essential nature of competitiveness is that it is a dynamic phenomenon. For example, we are only beginning to appreciate how the emergence of the information society will affect both enterprise and society generally. In addition, Economic and monetary union will further increase the competition Irish manufacturers experience within the domestic market while simultaneously improving the growth prospects of our most competitive enterprises.  In other words, the key competitiveness issues which face us today may not be those which are at the forefront in three, five or ten years time.</P>
    <P>It is for precisely this reason that my Department is actively working on the development of a competitiveness review mechanism.  The new mechanism will involve the establishment of a national competitiveness council involving the State, the social partners and private enterprise as envisaged by Partnership 2000.  The competitiveness review mechanism will ensure that we can build further on the achievements I have described and, critically, do so in a way which ensures that the benefits of improved competitiveness are felt throughout Irish society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Senator Quinn, for introducing this important motion.  Its importance lies in the fact that it is to a large extent a philosophical and ethical notion to which he brings very considerable experience as a successful businessman and entrepreneur, so one must listen with great deference to what he says.  I must hedge my bets on this one and I hope my friend and colleague, Senator Quinn, will not feel that I am paying him back for gallantly and graciously seconding my motion recently and then distancing himself as far as possible from its substance, and I will return to some of the matters I raised during that debate.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Minister of State in his erudite but very ministerial way, I wondered where was the socialist fire which used rumble in that non-ministerial belly because it seemed a little dampened by all this economic material, a large portion of which went completely over my head.  I deal in comparatively simple concepts, such as the battle between capitalism and socialism, and I must say I am still unashamedly a socialist, although I might well be a champagne or smoked salmon socialist because, as the Minister knows, nothing is too good for the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused to discover that the Government had tabled and then withdrawn an amendment; <Col N="934" /> that showed a curious lack of the same kind of passion.  The Government amendment read:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;supports the development of an environment which stimulates innovation, entrepreneurship and enterprise at all levels, and which fairly rewards those who contribute positively to this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is better to avoid a vote on theis kind of motion and simply discuss the ideas and allow the substance of the motion to pass into the record of the House.  However, I would be very tempted to follow the wording of that amendment because I can agree completely with a notion that we should foster innovation, entrepreneurship and enterprise but I am a little concerned at the notion of some aspects of a completely open market because we then get down into a rather cruel and uncaring society.</P>
    <P>I am not too worried about the taxi service in Dublin but then I own a car and I bicycle.  A certain amount could be done by introducing further taxi licences and competition.  I wish &mdash; although this is totally irrelevant to the debate &mdash; that they would rid O'Connell Street of taxis as it was a mistake to spoil that impressive walkway to the top of O'Connell Street by providing an indentation for a small number of taxis which could be put somewhere else.</P>
    <P>I agree completely with Senator Quinn that a comparatively small number of licencees have cornered a market and reaped an undue advantage from the limitation of pub licences in Dublin and they are milking that advantage outrageously.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to his visit to Russia.  I have not been to Russia but I am interested in the situation there.  I can understand some of what he feels about the state monopoly in supermarkets, that some faceless bureaucrat could decide that one shop is sufficient for 29,750 people and thereby imprison the customers.  He is right to talk about the value of a customer-driven society. Anybody who has had the pleasure and privilege of visiting one of his emporia could not but remark on the success of this attitude and the rewards which customers gain from it.</P>
    <P>However, I have some questions about the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  I wonder if the introduction of capitalism in so marked a form in Russia has been entirely to the benefit of the population at large.  If one went to Russia and asked ordinary people in the street of their experience, would it be so undilutedly blissful as we sometimes suppose?  There may, indeed, be luxury goods in some of the shops but nobody can afford them except the western capitalists who are pouring in to pick on the corpse of that unfortunate state.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest and most competitive growth industries in the former Soviet Union which has spread into many of the Baltic States is the rise of the Russian mafia in a terrifying and <Col N="935" /> horrible manner, and that is not what people want.  Civil servants are never sure of their pay and the army is mutinous because the State cannot guarantee its wages either.  The poorest, weakest and most marginalised members of society in the former Soviet Union are now paying for the mistakes of their masters.  The elderly are not receiving their pensions and things that were at least guaranteed under the grey and sometimes ghastly days of state socialism in the Soviet Union are no longer guaranteed.  I do not applaud the fact that the weakest members of Russian society are being penalised.</P>
    <P>Although there was much glee about the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, I felt at the time it would be a great mistake if the ideals of the October Revolution were entirely abandoned. I am naive enough to think that the simple formulation of the socialist creed &ldquo;from each according to their talent to each according to their need&rdquo; is a noble one and should be incorporated, if possible, into&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Oh dear.  What a pity because I wanted to have a smack at Rupert Murdoch, at Dunnes Stores &mdash; which shows you what happens when you have this kind of thing where they tie their unfortunate suppliers in &mdash; and at the loathsome Alan Clarke, who I was disgusted to see has managed to creep his way back into Westminster. He not only shafted his best friend but then followed it up by shafting his best friend's wife and their daughter.  He then gloated about it in his bleating autobiography, which I read but am glad to say I did not pay for because I read it in a bookshop.  I would not contribute to it.  This is the man who is peddling arms all over the world so that people like the East Timorese could be exterminated and then justified it with reference to the open market economy.</P>
      <P>I regret that by squandering my time I did not allow myself to deal with the really interesting experiment in Nicaragua which was extinguished by American intervention.  A wonderful experiment was tried there of attempting to mix the ideas of capitalism and socialism.  I believe that although socialism is in great difficulties and communism is in a state of disintegration, the day of unrestrained capital will come as well.  I do not believe it is capable of solving all our problems.  I will not, however, go quite so far as the Anglican cleric in London during the week who recommended theft from supermarkets in revenge for the extermination of the corner shop.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I commend Senator Quinn for his initiative in promoting this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the speakers who contributed and particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  May I attempt to criticise the red herrings that tended to crop up?  The first one <Col N="936" /> was the confusion between competition and privatisation and the belief that in some form or other they have something to do with one another.  That is one of the great red herrings.  In this case, Senator Cregan spoke about health, electricity and water in Britain.  I am such a believer in competition that I think we are now ripe and ready to accept it.</P>
      <P>In recent years the Government has put into operation such things as a Competition Authority that the Minister of State referred to.  I am opposed to monopolies and cartels.  The purpose of the motion was to remind us as a nation to avoid monopolies and cartels no matter who owns them.  As the Minister of State pointed out, I selected just four as examples.</P>
      <P>We do not and should not impose cartels.  I was impressed by the chairman of the Competition Authority who, a couple of weeks ago, said he did not see any reason why we should have licences for pubs.  I do not think we should have licences for taxis and telephone services either. Finland has decided to deregulate telephones to the extent of saying that anybody can set up a telephone system, although they must contribute towards the telephone service up the side of the mountain.  A clever European invention, if I may use that word, has put that operation in elsewhere. We do not need to create cartels and we should never create licences to restrict the number of people who may enter a trade.  In so doing we will bring a huge benefit to the nation as a whole, which then becomes a customer driven competitive market.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why we could find any reason not to go in that direction, in spite of the words used here tonight.  The red herrings concerned privatisation or, in the case of Senator O'Sullivan, who made a good point, unfettered capitalism.  Those are lovely words.  How can one defend it?  Senator O'Sullivan then went on to talk about workers' rights, safety and hygiene legislation.  Of course, we need legislation to protect those.  This is to do with a number of companies competing in a market place where they must obey the law.  That point applies to Senator Fahey's contribution also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to concentrate on the benefits and results of competition in a marketplace where everybody must keep within the law.  I am enthused about recent legislation and the fact that the chairman of the Competition Authority has voiced a similar opinion.  Senator Cregan cited the example of airlines.  Some 15 years ago two airlines were operating between Dublin and London.  Both were State owned and they charged something like £239 for a return ticket. We then allowed competition into that market place and have now ended up with a number of different airlines which do not just compete on price.  They also compete on quality, service, punctuality and choice of airports.  That came about not solely because we accepted it with enthusiasm, but because Mr. Peter Sutherland as European Commissioner said that anybody who <Col N="937" /> wishes to run an airline between two cities should have the right to do so without a licence as long as they meet safety and other criteria.  Mr. Sutherland was an example of someone who imposed competition on people who did not want it.</P>
    <P>What we need here is a similar attitude in everything we do.  I am delighted to see RTÉ getting competition from Radio Ireland.  I do not understand, however, why we must limit that by saying someone must have a licence to run a radio station.  If you remain within the law in all other areas, why do you need licences for pubs, taxis, telephones and radio stations?  Let us have competition with no cartels created by the State or monopolies created by the Dublin city authorities. On that basis we would have a much healthier and more economically viable customer driven economy and society.</P>
    <P>I accept entirely the point made by Senator Lee.  We probably have inherited this from a sense of historical insecurity.  We should, therefore, be able to compete with one another nowadays and we should encourage competition.  I am hoping this debate will remind the Government and ourselves as a nation that competition is in the interests of the citizens of this State.  The more competition we can encourage in every area, the more likely we are to find a customer driven economy and society.  That will be a better and healthier society but, of course &mdash; to return to Senator O'Sullivan's point &mdash; not unfettered. It needs the law.  Many of those laws are now in place so we can allow the removal of all those cartels and monopolies to encourage competition in every area.  We have the laws in place to ensure we do not break the standards that we as a nation have decided to insist upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 37, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The ordinary directors, who in the opinion of the Minister, have wide experience in relation to employment, environmental or transport matters, local government, community development administration or urban economics including a representative from the Dublin Inner City Partnership and two community directors one each from the north and south community networks shall be appointed by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The intention behind this amendment is to broaden and focus the involvement of local communities, which is important particularly in this area of considerable disadvantage where the development is contemplated.  It would be provocative to create employment for the middle classes or for outside people without engaging as actively as possible those elements of the existing community in this depressed area.</P>
      <P>These amendments, literate and wonderful as they are, did not spring unaided from my pen or my brain but were suggested to me by these communities. For that reason it is incumbent on us to listen to them.  I know from conversations with the Minister, which were not confidential, that he is sensitive to this type of requirement and feels that we are moving in the right direction.  It would be useful if some of these amendments were accepted so the communities which are most deprived would feel involved in the maximum possible way.</P>

      <P>The Minister is attempting to set up a two tier system &mdash; a council, where there is wide participation by the community in framing policy and drawing up a plan, and a working executive.  It is dangerous to suggest that the executive as well as the council must be representational.  The representational aspect, which is highly desirable and strongly supported in the Bill, is catered for in the council.  The executive, which will be made up of experts &mdash; they may not come from Dublin &mdash; who will give us the required expertise to run the day to day business of the board, should not be a representational body given the fact that we have catered for this fully in the council.  We are proposing a strong representational council and an expert executive.</P>

      <P>I accept the points made by Senator Norris and Senator Daly about the local community.  However, Senator Norris need not emphasise its disadvantage.  I have dealt with some of the groups and they are composed of dynamic, forward thinking people who will not be pushed aside.  The first report of the task force on the docklands was specific about the primary involvement of the communities.  The progress report also recognises the central position the communities will have in this development.  We lauded the development of Temple Bar but we also learned from that development that more thought should have been given to the indigenous population.  That mistake will be avoided in this development.  Everybody I have met is conscious of the fact that without the co-operation of the community it cannot be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>People in the area believe the council will be broad and general and will deal with the overall concept of the development but they fear it will only meet about twice or three times a year. The driving force or power house for the project will be the executive.  Local people believe that unless they have representation on that inner sanctum of the enterprise, as it were, they will be disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister of State's assurance that they will have direct representation on the council and an input into the overall concept of how the project will evolve.  However, power will lie with the driving force within the system.  That is how the enterprise will operate and the local people want to be there.  Can the Minister accept even one nomination from the local committees to the executive?  I believe he can.  It would be a sensible and wise course of action.  It would indicate to the community that it will not just be part of an outside tier that has some say but a mechanism to give it a meaningful role in the development. I agree with the local community's view, not the Minister's.</P>

      <P>I accept Senator Magner's comments. His heart is in the right place in this regard, as befits a good Labour Party representative. However, the suggestion was forcibly made to me, by the people about whom Senator Magner spoke so eloquently, that there is no real partnership with the local communities and that the council is cosmetic.  When I hear that these people can be represented on the council but they are not wanted on the executive, alarm bells begin to ring.  The executive is where day to day decisions are made and it is vital that those decisions are taken with the consent and participation of people in the local community.</P>
      <P>I remember the middle class squawks when Deputy Gregory was elected in my constituency and held the balance of power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of my best friends are middle class and they considered it outrageous.  &ldquo;Who does he think he is making deals?&rdquo; they wondered. However, politics is about making deals. What they really objected to was somebody from the inner city community being involved in the executive function.</P>
      <P>The executive board should be of a demonstrably high quality and should have the correct sectoral balance for the proper monitoring of the development process as required for sustainable development and combating long-term unemployment. The executive board would benefit from the expertise of professionals in their fields who are familiar with an executive role.  The legislation is open ended with a development period of over 15 years envisaged for the docklands area. We cannot assume we will have Ministers of the same high integrity we currently enjoy for this entire period.  The legislation should not permit the appointment of political appointees who might have gained favour through party donations rather than achievements in the fields of endeavour.  The recent Dunnes Stores revelations are pertinent in this regard.</P>
      <P>If we really believe in involving the local community, excluding it from the executive is an odd way to go about it.  I appeal to the Minister of State to think again about the amendment.  I will not press it at this time in order to give him an opportunity for, in the words of a much loved political colleague who is no longer with us, &ldquo;mature reflection&rdquo; before Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The council is far from cosmetic.  It will have real authority and will, in a sense, be the authority.  Any representational council would require an executive.  If two members of the executive should be representational, why should the seven members not be representational? Why not have a 25 member executive? If the executive is to be representational, it will require 25 members to meet the demands for representation.</P>
      <P>We should include as many people as possible on the council in a representational role.  We should also give the council as much power and authority as possible and we are doing that. However, we also need an expert executive. Local people are not excluded from the executive; it simply is not a representational body.  They have every right to be included in the executive and the Minister could appoint seven local people to it.  However, if the local community should be allowed to elect members of the executive, so should the other interests.  That will be the immediate demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a demand but it is not in my amendment.  The Minister of State is a skillful debater but let us remove ourselves from this phantasmagoria.  We are dealing with the amendments and not with demands from all and sundry. I am specific that the people who should be <Col N="941" /> included in the executive should be from the local community and from groups who work there.</P>
      <P>In a way I am encouraged by the Minister of State's response.  If, as he says, the council is the superior body and has greater control and if these people are good enough for that more powerful, influential and significant body, they are almost too good to be on the executive.  They should be on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

If the people to whom the Senator refers show their mettle on the council and if they currently show their mettle in the ways described by Senator Magner, I do not doubt that a Minister worth his salt will recruit such expertise from the local committee onto the executive body and that they will do a good job for their area on the executive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how it could be otherwise. If the executive and the council were to be divorced in any sense they would not work.  There must be a continuing relationship, as laid out in the Bill, between the council and the executive and their functions are clearly defined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the chairperson chairs both the executive and the council is very important because it means that he or she can run but they cannot hide.  If a situation arose where the executive attempted to ignore or give due weight to the clear aspirations and express wishes of the council, the chairperson has no place to go. <Col N="942" /> It is an important development that he or she chairs both bodies.  This will hopefully avoid the problem to which Senator Daly referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Senator Magner's point that the chairperson of the executive also chairs the council.  In any normal organisation the shareholders or members elect a large council which then elects an executive.  In this case, however, the council will be elected and the Minister will appoint the six person executive.  That seems to run against the norm, but perhaps I do not understand it correctly.  With the exception of the chairman, who is elected, the other members of the executive will be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice is similar to that exercised in local authorities where the members are elected.  However, such elected representatives do not have as much authority as will the members of the council.  Members of a county council are elected and their executive is appointed by the Local Appointments Commission &mdash; effectively by the Government &mdash; without the direct involvement of the Minister.  Essentially, we are discussing a new form of local authority for the Dublin docklands the main council of which will be representational and will have many powers that elected local authorities do not.  The executive will be appointed by either the Minister or the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State provided a good example which prompts me to inquire why the Government did not adopt the approach of having the Appointments Commission appoint the executive?  Why was the method outlined in the Bill chosen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated that this body will be treated as though it was a local authority.  That is my basic problem with the attitude towards the Bill.  I believe more vibrancy, life, enterprise and innovative effort is required. As I stated on Second Stage, if it is treated like a local authority it will not have the ability to create the activity required of it in the marketplace.  I am concerned that instead of the authority being like an active business, which must compete and attract outside investment, it is almost being made to resemble a local authority.  Will the Minister of State reconsider whether that is the correct way to deal with an organisation which should operate as a business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very convenient if we could dispense with democracy and merely do business, because there would be no problems regarding representation, elections, local communities, etc.  However, we are bound to take a different route and encourage representation and consultation.  For these reasons the council is being established and will have direct powers to make the detailed plan for its area.  This supersedes the local authority which, it must not be <Col N="943" /> forgotten, also occupies the area.  The council will be elected by the people and will have residual powers.  The local authority in question and other agencies left the area derelict and the Bill represents an attempt to take positive action.</P>
      <P>Having witnessed the examples of the Custom House Docks and Temple Bar, I have no doubt that millions of pounds will be invested in the development of this area as a result of the legislation. If the area in question was situated anywhere else in the country, Senators representing that area would be attempting to rush the Bill through the House.  However, Dublin is unique. With notable exceptions, Dublin Senators do not seem to be aware of the parochial interest in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very distinguished audience, albeit small.  Let us call a spade a spade.  The reality is that the new Docklands Authority subsumes the Custom House Docks Development Agency which currently exercises a high degree of expertise and has been outstandingly successful. As far as I am concerned, there are too many companies situated outside the International Financial Services Centre whose licences stipulate that they should be within its confines.  To a large extent, it is questionable whether they should still be trading under the flag of the IFSC when they are not situated there.  Part of the reason they are not within its confines is that there is no space available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current executive of the Custom House Docks Development Agency will be subsumed by this new body and there is ongoing work which must be carried out.  Senator Daly stated that the executive will be obliged to be the driving force, which is a fact of life.  The Minister of State generously stated that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, may appoint seven members of the local community, but that is not how it will happen.  An executive will have to be <Col N="944" /> put in place, the members of which share the vision referred to on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>This is the largest development in Dublin for generations and it will change the face of the city. One cannot play around with this executive; people with great expertise will have to be included.  It cannot exclude the dynamism of various people working against the odds in Ringsend, because they live in the area and share a vision.  We must find a balance and I have no hang ups in regard to the involvement of various people on the executive.  However, because it will be the engine to drive this process, we will have to get it right.  We cannot pander to everybody &mdash; for example, Dublin Port and Docks and CIE, which are major players.  There are as many major players as one could create spaces for on this executive.  Choices will have to be made and they should be made on the basis, as Senator Quinn so often preached to me, of people able to get the job done.</P>

      <P>In setting out the functions of the authority in this section, the Minister took careful cognisance of the content of the report of the Dublin Docklands Area Task Force.  The words which this amendment seeks to include in the Bill are taken from that report.  However, in drafting legislation, a degree of precision is required in order to ensure its terms are as clear as possible. Therefore, while the precise wording of the report may not appear in the Bill, provision is <Col N="947" /> made in regard to training, education, employment and the development of residential communities, all of which are key development issues. On that basis, the Senator's case is met in the Bill, although not in the exact words he used but in what my officials describe as more precise legislative language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Authority shall establish from within the Council and the Executive on Education and Training Forum to examine and make recommendation on the education, training and other requirements necessary to ensure the maximum participation of persons from the local communities in the regeneration and development of the New Docks.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This important section, which sets out the functions of the authority, should be expanded to place greater emphasis on the needs of local communities and to ensure their participation in the long-term development of the project.  Amendment No. 30 seeks to establish a forum from within the executive and council to consider mechanisms by which the local community may become involved in the development, to discuss education and training and to identify possible job opportunities and possible shortcomings in the existing education structures in the area.  We must avoid the criticisms made in relation to other developments where there has been an absence of opportunities for long-term and sustainable employment for those living in the area.</P>
      <P>Last week I tabled amendments, which were voted down, to include representation from the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee. The views of the education authorities in the area are important.  Members from Dublin will know of the proposal for a new community college in the Seán McDermott Street area, which is not included in this development.  Although I sought to include it, my amendment was disallowed.</P>
      <P>The forum would ensure that discussions would take place, parallel to and without interfering with, work taking place to identify for the council and the executive shortcomings in the education field.  By doing so, young people in the community could play a meaningful role and get a job in this development.  Then the same criticisms we received over the Custom House Docks development, which brought yuppies into the area to the detriment of those who lived there, could be not be levelled against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> Amendment No. 31 relates to how this concept will be monitored.  A tracking committee should be put in place to see how this develops and to report back to the council on where it is going wrong.  I am sure many mistakes will be made in this development, as they were elsewhere, and those who believe otherwise are naive.  A committee should monitor progress in terms of the participation of the less well off sections of the community. Figures from the task force and elsewhere have shown a huge decline in the local population which has perhaps been caused by the shift in the pattern of trade and commerce that took place in the past.  If we are to have a meaningful impact on the problems in this area, such as unemployment, deprivation and the problems associated with poverty, we must put in place a committee to track progress, to give guidance and keep in touch with the local communities and to ensure the concept does not move in a way which is detrimental to people who live there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything Senator Daly said.  It is instructive to look at the priority given to the area about which the Senator spoke, in terms of education and training, by the task force for the docklands and in the progress report from Riverrun.  It carried out an educational audit of the area and outlined the disadvantages about which Senator Norris spoke.  There is a determination that the fears Senator Daly expressed will be addressed from flag fall.  We must marry the population so far as we can to the jobs.</P>
      <P>The master plan for the docklands, which will identify the type of industries we are likely to attract, will enable the executive and the council to set in train the necessary educational programmes. Let us not fool ourselves &mdash; many of these jobs will be high-tech and will be like those created in the International Financial Services Centre.  However, there will be other jobs because if, as we envisage, the area is regenerated, shops, restaurants and bars will be opened. It will not be copy of Temple Bar but a new place of leisure, business and industry which will create the types of jobs that do not require a university degree which, as Lemass once said, would make the place very boring.</P>
      <P>The points the Senator raised have been more than adequately covered in the Bill.  There is a specific responsibility on the authority to do the things the Senator suggested.  It is committed to pay for Riverrun which will form an important part of the master plan.  I support everything the Senator said and am enthusiastic in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 18 is to set out the functions of the authority.  It is not intended to set out requirements in relation to the structures which the authority should establish in order to perform those functions.  The aim in passing specific legislation to establish a special State body to undertake a major regeneration project such as this is to have a single agency responsible for the task and to allow it as much <Col N="949" /> flexibility as possible in deciding how it should carry out its work.  The authority will require particular flexibility in how it organises its staff for the purposes of performing its functions &mdash; a flexibility which is given to every semi-State body established by statute.</P>
      <P>I appreciate and, indeed, support the underlying sentiments of Senator Daly's amendments in so far as they seek to ensure the key issues such as employment, training and education are addressed.  In response to suggestions from his own party in the Dáil, amendments were introduced to the Bill to ensure the authority's functions cover these areas.  The authority will have a duty to perform these functions and will be fully accountable for its performance in this regard.  On that basis, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>When in Government with Senator Daly's party, I was responsible for urban renewal and housing and we had a problem in this particular area.  Some 99 per cent of the Sheriff Street flats had been vacated but it would have cost a huge amount of money to knock them down; we had a problem finding the money to do so.  I said we should not knock them down, but sell them.  My officials were incredulous at the idea of selling the Sheriff Street flats, which had been a problem housing area for a long time.  We put them on the market and got £4 million.</P>

The private housing there was turned into social housing or tenements.  That was the worst possible solution. People are again living in private housing in Dublin city centre and they live happily cheek by jowl with social housing.  That social mix is a great success and I foresee more of the same as a result of this proposal.  On foot of the amendments tabled in the Dáil, which were along the lines the Senator argued, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment about the principle under which a number of amendments were ruled out of order, especially amendments Nos. 25 and 28, the intention of which was to extend the operational area of the authority to include adjacent communities.  The reason given for ruling the amendments out of order was that they <Col N="951" /> created a charge on the Exchequer and one must accept that.</P>
      <P>However, this underlines the stupidity of that clause which clips the wings of Seanad Éireann. We know well that some of these are important matters which properly concern this House and, although the amendments are ruled out of order, we frequently manage to persuade the Government to include them as its amendments.  In any review of the operation of Seanad Éireann we should re-examine this childish clipping of an essential part of the adult privilege of the political process.  If this measure is taken to its extreme, amendment No. 31 could have been ruled out of order as it makes requirements which will inevitably and incidentally create a charge on the Exchequer.  An argument could be made that everything creates a charge on the Exchequer. The printing of the amendment creates a charge on the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a very profligate person.  I do not wish to be tendentious but this is an absurd restriction of the powers of adult political persons and the sooner it goes the better.</P>
      <P>Having made the arguments for these amendments, I ask the Minister to examine, between now and Report Stage, the possibility of the Government sponsoring these amendments.  I take on board what the Minister and Senator Magner, who clearly knows and has extensive knowledge of this area, said.  I am not surprised and am very pleased to hear him speak so eloquently about it because I live in the area.  I agree with what the Minister said about tenement buildings and that some local authorities deliberately tried to corral the working class into a one-class system in such areas.  Those authorities squealed like stuck pigs when people like me started moving in, not because they objected to us living in what they saw as a slum but because they knew we would bring lobbying skills, etc., into the area and that we would be troublemakers. We were and we won.  With the co-operation of people in the Oireachtas, we brought people back to live in private housing in the inner city and we have created a healthy mixed area where we co-operate with our new neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I agree with Senator Quinn that we need the dynamism and energy which this enterprise area would bring, it would be a pity if the boundaries were drawn too narrowly resulting in marginalised areas being excluded.  This would cause provocation because energy would be expended in a concentrated area and outlying areas would be excluded.  Later amendments also address the issue of extending the area by naming the streets to be included and these might also be ruled out of order.  They were carefully drawn up by people who live in the area who saw it as a benefit for the entire area and not as the creation of a new <Col N="952" /> area of privilege which excludes others.  I ask the Minister to look carefully at these amendments so that, if possible, the Government can introduce them.  It would make a radical transformation to the entire area and not just this concentrated area of privilege which we hope will be shared generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris in the strong case he has made for the inclusion of areas adjacent to the area we are discussing.  I have a small map of the extended area which I will give to the Minister of State to consider before the Final Stages.  All that is being sought is the inclusion of an extra block which would comprise of Seán McDermott Street, Portland Row, Summerhill and Gardiner Street which most people would view as being very deprived, run down and neglected.  This would strengthen the prospects of resolving some the problems within the original boundary.  I presume that, even if this change is not made now, another Minister will return to the House at some later stage seeking amendments to the legislation.  I have tabled an amendment to the Schedule defining the area, but it will be disallowed because it would mean charges on the Exchequer.  However, I hope the Minister will take into account what was said by Senator Norris.  It will be found that drawing a line through the most deprived areas of the city and leaving one part out will not be feasible.  This is apparent when one looks at a map of the areas.</P>

The site of the Custom House Docks Authority has been extended to include other developments as land became available.  What Senator Daly outlined will happen because it is a 15 year programme in five year tranches.

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (1) (a) (i), line 11, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make the council view the master plan as a flexible document and not as a rigid document that can only be changed infrequently and with difficulty.  By proposing revisions of the plan every three rather than five years, consideration of the plan is permanently on the agenda of the council, as it should be.  We are living in cloud cuckoo land by thinking that a master plan can be drawn up now and that it will be right in 15 years' time having been glanced at it once or twice in between. Revisions every five years are too infrequent.  We need revisions more often so that everybody concerned will see the master plan as something evolving on a continuous basis as the area itself develops.</P>
      <P>The Custom House development master plan was designed ten years ago.  I remember going to the opening launch and it was a great plan. However, the development does not bear much resemblance to what they planned in 1988.  There is a need to force the council into a constant, permanent re-examination of what it plans.  Otherwise, all sorts of opportunities will be lost through the rigidity of saying &ldquo;It is not part of the plan&rdquo;. There is a world of difference between five years and three years.  Providing for five years makes it just one item on the agenda every fifth year. However, providing for revision every three years means continuous consideration.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to consider reducing the examination from five years to three years.</P>

      <P>At present I am not an advocate of the permanent cultural revolution, but that concept could be applied to what Senator Quinn is <Col N="954" /> saying.  I draw his attention to the fact that five years is a maximum period.  I expect that the plan will be on a permanent agenda.  It is not necessary for the plan to be on the agenda of the council every time it meets.  It can be reviewed after one, two or three years.  The maximum period allowed is five years.  This ensures both a flexibility and a cut-off point.</P>
      <P>The Custom House Docks is a good example of how the original concept does not reflect what is there now.  I do not like the present design, but that is a personal view.  It is very ugly, particularly alongside the beautiful Custom House.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to put the Bill back for a month to change the provision for review from five to three years when the council can review it anytime they like.</P>

The plan is going to evolve and move and it needs to be dynamic. It is different from a local authority and I am trying to instil that sense of dynamism.  I fear that somebody will decide to put revision to one side until the five year period is up.  Others will say that the plan cannot be touched for five years because that is what the legislation says.  I want to strengthen the other voices which will call for continuous challenge and revision.  I urge the Minister to consider the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if the Minister will produce a parallel argument to the one he has just made.  I thought he might, but I remind him that it will not delay the Bill by a month.

      <P>It seems extraordinary to me that a body as significant as the authority would not meet at least once a quarter.  If it is going to be responsible and dynamic it must meet not less than four times a year.  I want to ensure that this council is a weighty body and that it is taken seriously.

      <P>If it is going to be so important, I cannot imagine a body that is going to have this kind of interaction and responsibility meeting less than once a quarter.  One of the reasons we should consider this very seriously is that in the way the council is constituted, there will be a large number of statutory members who by virtue of their engagement in the council will have many demands placed on their time.  Even I, as the lowest form of political life known in this country, have difficulties with my diary.  There are times when I would willingly skive off and not attend meetings.

I think that would be disastrous.  It can do no harm, if only to mark their cards, to say that the council is expected to meet at least four times a year.  I imagine they will meet much more frequently than that and I am sure the Minister will agree. The amendment is a very mild and modest one.  I am a little concerned about the Minister's reply earlier when he said that an amendment would delay the process for a month.  That is like waving a red flag and saying he is not in a position to take any amendments whatsoever.  I think the Minister should show his mettle and agree to this small amendment, which does not make very much difference because the Minister says the council will <Col N="956" /> meet more than four times a year anyway.  His acceptance would show that the Seanad is able to get an amendment through.  Accepting this amendment would do no more than mark the cards of the council members.</P>

While I would be worried about imposing numbers from a subsidiarity point of view &mdash; the body should have the right to decide itself when and how often to meet &mdash; I think in the initial stages it would be right and proper to have this minimum number of meetings.

      <P>This is an attempt to focus in on the specific requirements of the area in order to benefit them. It simply means adding another paragraph to provide for the development and monitoring of social, economic and environmental indicators in the area in consultation with the local communities.

      <P>The purpose of section 24 is to set out the key issues to be addressed in the master plan.  Therefore, the section is expressed in broad <Col N="957" /> terms.  The master plan is not intended to be the authority's work programme; that would be a matter for the authority itself to determine once it is established having regard to the functions which apply to it.  The aims and objectives of the authority will require it to establish a range of social and economic indicators to enable it to monitor its progress towards achieving those objectives.  I do not see any need to provide specifically for these in legislation.  Formal environmental monitoring in the area will remain a matter for Dublin Corporation and the Environmental Protection Agency, as appropriate, and there is no intention that the authority would become involved in duplicating the work of these bodies.  If there was any attempt to move in on the area of responsibility of either I have no doubt that a civil war would break out in the docklands.</P>

      <P>I will not be bought cheap in November when the figure goes up to £500,000.  The reason the architect to whom I referred gives for the need to insert an amendment such as this is that an integral part of sustainable development in mature urban eco systems are sophisticated and comprehensive monitoring and feedback mechanisms.  These must be established at the outset of the development process and funds must be provided for the proper updating and maintenance of such indicators in order to ensure the best quality information for the council and <Col N="958" /> the executive board.  That expresses the situation very succinctly and confirms my suspicion that the intention behind this amendment is to spend money.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 24 (5) of the Bill, Dublin Corporation will be required to consider bringing its development plan into line with the master plan to be prepared under section 24, once the master plan has been adopted by the authority. This requirement makes it essential that the corporation have an input into the master plan preparation process.  It is for this reason that section 24 specifically requires the authority to consult with the corporation in the course of preparing the draft of the master plan.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it is necessary to include a similar specific requirement in relation to the Heritage Council, as is proposed in amendment No. 38.  As with any other organisation, statutory or otherwise, with an interest in the master plan, the Heritage Council could become involved in the process of preparing the master plan under section 24 (3)(c) which requires the authority to make arrangements for consultation with other interested persons and organisations.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I do not believe that amendment No. 40 is necessary.  The authority, when preparing a planning scheme, will be obliged under section 25 (3) (c) to consult with any statutory body which appears to have an interest in the area covered by the scheme.  Given the terms of its definition in section 3, the term &ldquo;statutory body&rdquo; would include the Heritage Council.  On this basis, perhaps Senator Daly will withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (4), between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>(b)  publish the draft master plan in its entirety on the World Wide Web during all of the period referred to in subsection (a) (ii) of this section,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to provide for the publication of the entire draft master plan on the World Wide Web during all the period referred to in section 24(4) (a)(ii).  We are living in an information age. I was on tenterhooks as I did not know whether I would be told that because putting the master plan onto the Internet would involve a cost, the amendment would be ruled out of order.  The World Wide Web on the Internet is a highly economical manner of publishing detailed information to a large number of people.  If the master plan is on the web, anyone can access it at any time, from libraries, homes and businesses.  It is important that those interested in accessing the plan have the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>This Bill is written as though we were still living in the 19th century, although we are on the brink of the 21st century.  The information age offers the Docklands Authority all of the new tools to get its message across and provide better access to the public.  We should use these new tools, which is why I proposed this amendment.</P>
      <P>The same point applies to all three amendments. Amendment No. 46 proposes:</P>
      <P>In page 35, subsection (2), line 13, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;as soon as may be, and to be published on the World Wide Web&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We need to ensure the report is published as soon as it goes to the Minister.  There have been too many instances where the Minister sits on a report for months or years before it sees the light of day.  There is no reason why any Department should do this.  The report of a State agency is the agency's report, not that of the sponsoring Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was chairman of An Post, we promised we would publish our reports early.  Yet we found that when handing them to the Minister, we had to urge him to publish them, because the publication is the hands of the Minister.  Last November I looked for the annual report of RTÉ for <Col N="960" /> 1995 but I discovered it had not been published. When we questioned the chairman of the authority, he said the board had handed over the report in April.</P>
    <P>Some of the Bills published recently have included the requirement for immediate publication. We are not setting a precedent.  I cannot see any reason why the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications should hold up publication.</P>
    <P>The second point of this amendment is to include World Wide Web and the Internet as an integral part of the statutory publication process. The Internet gives greater access to details in a more economic manner than a printed report, which costs several pounds.  Putting this type of information on the web is part of how we can use the information age to enrich the democratic process.</P>
    <P>Within less than a decade most information will be published in this manner.  We should legislate for that now.  I urge the Minister to move into the 21st century by including this provision in Bills.  I intend to put similar amendments down in other Bills coming through the House.  It is outrageous that the ability to see this information is available to every citizen through libraries, homes and businesses, yet they will have to buy a paper document if we do not ensure the provision proposed in my amendment is expected and anticipated in future.  I urge the Minister to accept my amendments.</P>

It is often followed by a more detailed inquiry.  I presume <Col N="961" /> there would be some degree of interaction by which they could call out information and home in on specific areas.

I am talking about the requirement for tens and hundreds of millions of pounds of investment.  It would be outrageous if we did not take the opportunity to put this information on the most modern, widespread and cheapest system of imparting information.  I thank Senator Quinn and the other Senators who have spoken in support of this for bringing forward this novel idea and moving us on from the stage where we put a notice in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which was fine in its day &mdash; I am not decrying <i>The Irish Times</i> in any sense by saying that.  This is about getting information to people and the best way of empowering people is to give them information. Information is the real basis of power and this amendment will achieve that so I accept it.  I would ask the Senator to allow us to examine the wording as it may need to be corrected technically on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 24, subsection (7)(a) to delete the subparagraphs (i) and (ii), and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(i) in an area where a planning scheme has been prepared and has received planning <Col N="962" /> permission under the 1963 Act and subsequent regulations, the carrying out by the Authority of any development in the Area which is consistent with that planning scheme;</P>
    <P>(ii)  in an area in respect of which a planning scheme has been prepared and received planning permission under the 1996 Act and subsequent regulations, the carrying out of any development in the area by a person other than the Authority which is certified by the Executive Board to be consistent with that planning scheme; provided that a certificate under this paragraph may contain such conditions in relation to the carrying out of the development as the Executive Board considers appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This involves replacing two subparagraphs with a slightly different but significant form of words.  It involves altering &ldquo;approved&rdquo; under this section and inserting &ldquo;has received planning permission ...&ldquo;and referring to the Executive Board instead of the authority.  The reason for this amendment is that the benefits of a comprehensive local development plan or planning scheme can be achieved under existing legislation.  These benefits include a consultation period with the local community to evolve the best overall urban design, mix of uses and linkage mechanisms to ensure sustainable redevelopment of the area and a short design and planning period, with reduced uncertainty and risk to the subsequent developer of the scheme or parts thereof.  The scheme can be submitted for planning approval in the usual way, which should take only four to five months with the co-operation of An Bord Pleanála. Working with Dublin Corporation, it should be perfectly possible for subsequent piecemeal development by third parties, conforming with the scheme, to be exempt from a further planning permission application.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate that the Ministers for the Environment and Finance take detailed interest in the preparation of planning schemes of a local development authority which is properly set up and with accountability enshrined in the composition of the members of the council, as outlined in the Bill, and with the planning control system intact.  In fact, it is directly contrary to the subsidiarity principle to further erode local government powers, particularly those relating to planning control within the docklands area.  The planning scheme powers which the CCDDA currently enjoys is a contentious issue with local communities and is not a suitable model for emulation. That is not quite like calling a spade a spade and a little more like calling it an agricultural implement for the trituration of the soil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment as it would have the effect of setting at nought the whole thrust of the scheme.  With due respect to subsidiarity and Dublin Corporation, which could have organised itself as a development corporation for any part of its functional area had it <Col N="963" /> wanted, which it did not, this is taking it away from the corporation deliberately and setting up an alternative system so that something can happen to it.  Dublin Corporation had its chance for as long as it has existed and it did not do anything with this area and that is why action is required. If we make it a requirement, as the amendment suggests, that the plan needs planning permission, that doubles or trebles the red tape and could give rise to a situation where the authority would be providing one set of conditions and the planning authority providing a contradictory set of conditions and that would be the permission with which the developer would have to deal.  In view of what I have said and the Senator's wish to get this development moving quickly and positively with the minimum of red tape and the maximum efficiency, I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go over the same ground again at this time but there is something unwise in having one set of legislative procedures for one area and others for the remainder.  I am generally concerned about a situation where there is a legislative procedure governing the whole planning process, which is applicable everywhere except these particular locations which seem to be receiving special treatment, and I am not so sure it is such a good idea.  I do not think it is an argument to state that Dublin Corporation did not do certain things in this area. One could say the same about many areas.  There were similar arguments with regard to other developments.  One could say that Dublin Corporation did not develop Temple Bar and special legislation was introduced; but I am not certain it is advisable in the long-term to have one type of legislation in place for one area and another in place for somewhere else.  The section could be redrafted to conform with the planning Acts rather than provide a special concession, which is bad practice.  I will not press my amendments now but I feel this is a very dangerous road to follow in the national context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a special situation requiring special treatment.  We are saying that the council, which is a new statutory authority, will draw up a plan similar to the county development plan but in greater detail and be exempt from the need for planning permission; but it will require approval from the executive within the terms of that plan. There is that planning process, which is not that dissimilar from the norm, and there is a precedent for it under the urban renewal plan and the plan for the development of the Customs House <Col N="964" /> docks.  We are talking about dealing with a special situation and a special difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a precedent.  Not so long ago we had a situation in County Clare which was much to our cost, although maybe not in line with the Minister of State's ideas.  For instance, in the Mullaghmore situation the Supreme Court made certain decisions in relation to the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to require that they should have planning permission.  It is not necessary to go into that matter at this time of night, but I have a feeling that this may well be challenged at some stage.  The Minister of State may find himself in a situation where, as a result of court proceedings, he will be back here trying to change this.  I am not certain that it is wise to go along the lines the Minister of State is taking because there is a precedent for other areas.  If you have complaints from other parts of the country about special permission arising because there is a differential between the law that applies to parts of Dublin and that which applies to parts of Limerick and Cork, then we are heading into an area that could lead to some dispute and possible court proceedings later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will appreciate that we are not in a Mullaghmore type of situation where an authority had at that time the power to do anything it liked without seeking licence from anybody.  That is not the case.  A body has been set up and people living within the remit of that body's area must get a licence from it to act.  They must also have regard to the county development plan of Dublin Corporation, which is the statutory body for the area.  They must consult with the corporation also when drawing up their plans. There is a constant approach to the local authority for these two things and the involvement of the actual planning authority and the plan it has drawn up.</P>

      <P>Subsection 1(c) must be read in conjunction with section 26.  The section requires an environmental impact statement to be prepared where a planning scheme includes development to which environmental impact assessment or EIA applies.  The effect of section 25(1)(c) is to limit the range of EIA type developments which can be included in a planning scheme to three classes: industrial estate developments, urban development projects and sea water marinas. Development proposals involving an EIA type development which do not fall into one of these three categories could not be included in a planning scheme and would be subject to the requirement to obtain planning permission from Dublin Corporation in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of this that I am a bit confused about the thrust of what is being done in the section.  It appears in part that you can have areas where planning permission will not be required, yet in other places it will be.  This is a recipe for widespread confusion, but I will not pursue the matter here.  It would be wise if the Minister of State got an overall view of what the import of this section will be before this is finalised.  We may be making a stick with which to beat ourselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 27, subsection (2), lines 13 and 14, to delete &ldquo;or may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance under section 31&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I say with some confidence that the Minister of State will be pleased to know there is no danger of this being ruled out of order by reason of a cost to the Exchequer.  I am totally opposed to the State guaranteeing loans if there is any alternative. Here is the perfect case of an alternative. Whenever the authority needs to borrow it will have enough assets against which to do so and that should be enough.  The value of not having a State guarantee is that your lenders look closely at the proposal's viability and that is a good thing. If they do not think it is viable then they will not lend, but if there is a State guarantee they could not care less.  If it is guaranteed, why bother? Whatever happens they will get the money back. The only brake on such lending is by the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer that any brake we put on lending is nearer to the real world of business and commerce than that of the Department of Finance. By removing this very guarantee we ensure that all borrowings by the authority will be made purely on commercial grounds.  This is exactly my concern about the Bill.  In helping this worthy Bill <Col N="966" /> with its good objectives we are trying to bring it closer to the real world of commerce.  It needs to be close to that world if the docklands are going to succeed.  That is why I want to bring it closer to that real world by making it face up to normal lenders and bankers as though it was a normal commercial operation.  Investment in the docklands will be a good bet.  Whether it is through equity investment or lending, the docklands does not need the crutch of a State guarantee, especially since that crutch is not a help but a hindrance. It would be a healthier, more viable organisation, which would be closer to the market place without a State guarantee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The critical word in the Bill is &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  If a situation arose where the authority had a requirement to borrow some non-commercial money it would then possibly need a State guarantee.  In the normal course of events, however, its borrowings would be secured on the basis of its revenue, funds and property.  That is the intention.  It would borrow on that basis but it is not a mandatory situation.  It is a last line &ldquo;may&rdquo; so that the Minister in certain circumstances could agree to guarantee such borrowings. It is less than mandatory.</P>

In section 32 the Minister for Finance, on the advice of the Minister for the Environment, can make some funding available to the council.  That issue was raised in connection with the Custom House Docks legislation.  On a previous occasion I endeavoured to ascertain what type of funding would be available in the initial stages to get the project motivated and whether or not it would be necessary to repay that.  Under the Custom House Docks legislation that body repaid moneys that were advanced to it.  Is that correct?  Can we get some indication of what type of moneys we are talking about?</P>

It is a well established principle that members of the executive boards of State bodies and their employees cannot be members of local authorities.

Over the years many Bills were anti-county councillors.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, acknowledged this when we discussed the Harbours Act, 1995.  I was one of the first people to be removed from a board in 1980 when I was a member of BIM.  Senator Wright was also affected.  Whatever about removing Senators, Deputies and members of the European Parliament from boards, county councillors should be left on them.  Perhaps the Minister could reconsider this issue.

      <P>I see no reason the authority should be given six months to submit its report and accounts.  Most companies quoted on the stock exchange do this in three months or less.

      <P>I would have preferred if the Minister for Education or the Minister of State at the Department of Education had been been available to discuss this matter.  However, I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, will do an excellent job.</P>
      <P>This matter concerns the necessity for the Department of Education to provide funding for a security fence around Bishop Galvin and Bishop Shanahan schools in Templeogue.  These are two fine primary schools but every week they are subject to vandalism.  Last week five windows were smashed, six windows were smashed the week before and seven windows were smashed during the previous week.  The Department of Education has a scheme to deal with this problem.  Planning permission has been obtained for the proposed security fence and a formal application was submitted to the Department in January, along with tenders from two construction companies for its erection.  Under the scheme the Department will supply 85 per cent of the required funding, with the 15 per cent balance being provided by the school.  I strongly urge the Minister to provide finance for the immediate construction of the fence around these two schools.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of vandalism in this area.  Crime and vandalism in housing estates in Templeogue will have to be addressed as a matter of urgency not just by the Department of Education but also by the Garda Síochána.  I have made many representations to the gardaí about this matter and recently had a meeting with them about vandalism in Rossmore Park.  The tyres of cars in the area were slashed recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important issue.  There is no reason the Department should withhold funding for the fence.  The schools play a vital role in the local <Col N="971" /> community and I call on the Minister to provide the necessary funding forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education's current position regarding the proposal to erect a fence around Bishop Galvin and Bishop Shanahan national schools, Rossmore Road, Willington, Templeogue, Dublin 6.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education is aware that both schools currently have a staffing of a principal, 15 assistants and a remedial teacher.  Both schools had an enrolment of 474 pupils on 30 September 1996.  The two school buildings are located on the same campus.  In September 1995, the manager of Bishop Shanahan school, on behalf of both schools, submitted an application to the Department for grant aid towards the cost of a perimeter fence.  The Department requested the Office of Public Works to investigate the proposal and to furnish a report and recommendation.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the schools decided to appoint a private consultant architect to handle the proposed project.  This architect prepared a report for the school in March 1996 and a copy was forwarded to the Department in September 1996. The school also advised at this stage that they had already sought and obtained planning permission for the scheme.  The schools' private architect estimated the cost of the scheme at £95,000.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the private architect's report the Department again contacted the Office of Public Works seeking its recommendations in the matter. In October 1996, the Office of Public Works submitted a report and recommendation to the Department.  On receipt of this report and in light of the fact that the scheme was ready to go to tender, the proposed scheme was considered for grant aid.  However, due to budgetary constraints the Department was not in a position to sanction grant aid for the scheme and the school manager was informed of the position in October 1996.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows the erection of the proposed fence around the Bishop Galvin and Bishop Shanahan schools is urgent in the light of the repeated acts of vandalism on the buildings. However, the House will appreciate that a decision on the timing of the tender and contract processes must be taken in the light of existing contractual commitments and the funds available this year.  I assure the Senator that every effort is being made by the Department to ensure the project is progressed at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise the need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the proposed extension to the Salesian college, Pallaskenry, County Limerick, is completed in 1997.  I first raised this matter in March 1994 and I am <Col N="972" /> disappointed I must raise it again this evening in an effort to secure progress.</P>
      <P>The number of pupils attending the Salesian college has been increasing for many years and, as a result, there is a need for extra space in the school.  A schedule of work has been proposed to and accepted by the Department.  It includes one general classroom, one mathematics classroom, one demonstration room, one home economics classroom and flatlet, one woodwork/ construction studies classroom, art and crafts store, mechanical drawing classroom, library and ancillary stores, special tuition rooms, kitchenette and cloakroom and locker room.  The Department has accepted that this development is necessary and important.  I urge the Government and the Department to treat it as a matter of urgency and to ensure that work is completed in time for the 1997-8 school year.</P>
      <P>The need for the proposed development was identified over five years ago.  In February 1993 the college authorities wrote to the Department of Education advising it of the intention to convert the dormitories and requesting assistance. The school is situated on the Shannon Estuary and serves the catchment area of Pallaskenry, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>In December 1993, the principal of the school sought authorisation for the provision of post-primary education in the area.  He received a reply on 8 March 1994, from John Moloney, higher executive officer, from which I will now quote:</P>
      <P>The question of how best to organise the provision of post-primary facilities in the area has been under consideration in the Department for some years.  It was considered that four schools were not required for the area; given the lay out of the catchment area, however, the rationalisation of all four schools into a single school development appeared to be an unrealistic and unattainable objective. The Department's hope was that, in time, the four schools could be reduced to two.</P>
      <P>... At a meeting held on 9 April 1991 it was agreed by all present, including the Salesian representatives, that the logic of the area pointed to a two-school development, ie:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a new school development centering on the existing schools in Foynes/ Shanagolden/Askeaton;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Salesian School at Pallaskenry staying separate.</P>
      <P>At that stage, the Department accepted the amalgamation of the four schools into two.  The letter goes on to state:</P>
      <P>An application for grant-aid to convert dormitories to classrooms has been approved by the Planning Section on the basis of catering for an estimated 400 pupils...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department considers that the two schools, with total accommodation of 800 <Col N="973" /> places, will cater adequately for the needs of the catchment area for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>That was the situation in 1994, but there has been little progress in the interim.  Subsequently, the Department informed the school that it had second thoughts about the dormitory conversion and proposed instead a school extension on the ground floor adjacent to the existing school building. A design team was assembled by the school and approved by the Department.  Architectural planning proceeded throughout 1995 and stage 3 of this was submitted to the Department for approval in February 1996.</P>
    <P>Despite many efforts on the part of the school to obtain approval for stage 3, the building unit did not pursue the matter until October 1996, a delay of eight months, when officials of the Department discussed its submission.  It was decided that a number of minor changes were required and a revised submission was prepared by the design team and sent to the Department on 31 January 1997.  The team insisted that a written reply that the submission was received be issued.  The school awaits acceptance of stage 3 and written approval to proceed to stages 4 and 5.  I urge the Minister to hasten the process.</P>
    <P>In 1990, similar requests for an extension fell on deaf ears when an application was made to convert a dormitory to a computer room and language laboratory.  The then Minister for Education failed to respond to the needs of the college which, despite limited resources, spent £40,000 on a computer room and a further £30,000 on a language laboratory.  At present the Salesian community cannot proceed with its plans unless finances from the Department are forthcoming. It is important to the college, its pupils and the area that money is provided.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Salesian Fathers in Pallaskenry for the work they have done in teaching and preparing people for entry into the farming community through their highly successful agricultural college.  The Salesians came to Pallaskenry in September 1919 and received their first students in January 1920.  It is interesting that Fr. A. Sutherland, STD, is credited with the successful establishment of the college in Pallaskenry, because he was the granduncle of Peter Sutherland, former European Commissioner and head of GATT.  The college progressed over the years and continues to play a vital role in the education of people living in the Shannon catchment area. I urge the Minister to assist the Salesians, the people of the locality and the school management to progress this application.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  It gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education, to outline the current position regarding the proposed extension at the Salesian Secondary College, Pallaskenry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I wish to outline the background to this project.  This is a co-educational school which has <Col N="974" /> a current enrolment of 405 pupils.  There are 234 boys and 171 girls in the school.  Some years ago the Department of Education received an application from the school regarding the conversion of classrooms to specialist room and a library.  It was stated that a large dormitory would soon become vacant and would be available for conversion to teaching accommodation.  An educational worksheet was completed by the school and it was agreed that the long-term projected enrolment for this school was 400.</P>
    <P>At this time the school informed the Department that specialist teaching spaces which are currently situated in the community house building would not be available in the future.  Following a survey of existing accommodation and a report by the Department's architects, schedules of accommodation were agreed with the school. This accommodation includes specialist rooms and a general classroom.  These schedules were further revised to include additional specialist rooms and the appointment of a design team was approved.  Following a planning briefing meeting between the school authority, the approved design team and Department officials, a revised layout of the proposed extension was forwarded to the Department in June 1995.  As a result, the overall area of the extension to be provided was increased.  Architectural planning has progressed and a revised stage 3 &mdash; developed sketch scheme &mdash; was received by the Department in February 1997.  These documents are currently being examined by the Department's technical staff.</P>
    <P>It is expected that this project will progress smoothly through the remaining stages of architectural planning.  When that planning has been completed, the question of proceeding to construction will be considered in light of available resources and competing priorities.  I assure the Senator that I will bring the strong case he made to the Minister's attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Health to examine, as a matter of urgency, the need to restrict the sale of paracetamol products to pharmacies and to further restrict such sales to a particular quantity, such as 20 tablets.  I suggest that a person should sign a form to indicate receipt of this product and whether an additional quantity was dispensed.  Pharmacies should ask patients why the product is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about an epidemic of potentially lethal overdoses of paracetamol among young people, particularly women.  This has been worrying doctors and psychiatrists and has cost the State a fortune.  However, the public seems blissfully unaware that a drug contained in the bathroom cabinets of most homes can have such lethal effects.  Paracetamol products should not be freely available across the counter in supermarkets, shops and petrol stations.  One in five cases of self-poisoning in Ireland is caused by paracetamol products.  Paracetamol was the <Col N="975" /> second most frequent cause of poisoning in 1993 when 831 instances were recorded.</P>
    <P>Medical sources estimate that between 500 and 600 people in the Republic suffer liver damage each year caused by paracetamol overdoses. Approximately 50 per cent of the emergency liver transplants carried out in this country resulted from such poisoning.  These products should not <Col N="976" /> be freely available without the provision of advice about their dangers.</P>
