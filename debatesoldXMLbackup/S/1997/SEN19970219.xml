      <P>I have notice from Senator Rory Kiely that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to immediately reinstate his staff at Henshaws Meat Factory, Dock Road, Limerick, to enable them to reopen the slaughterhouse and to allow the plant function properly.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to press ahead with the feasibility study for the Ulster Canal.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to report on the discussions of the interdepartmental committee established by her to address the special needs of children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the extension to Ballingarry boys national school, County Limerick, is completed in 1997.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make an early decision against locating a dump in the Coolbeg/Ballynagran area of County Wicklow in view of the local opposition to its location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Kiely's and Senator Cotter's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give <Col N="174" /> notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1, Second Stage, will be taken from now until 6 o'clock, with 20 minutes per speaker.  Item 2 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and I suggest ten minutes per speaker. Item 3 will be taken from 8 p.m. until it concludes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend members of the Garda Síochána on their efforts yesterday in the fight against crime and terrorism.  Hopefully, lives and property have been saved by their excellent work.</P>
      <P>Also yesterday, the Government announced its policy on the future of sport.  The Leader will be aware that my own party produced its document on sport within the last month.  In the context of both documents and given the importance of sport in our everyday lives, will the Leader make time available as soon as possible for an in-depth discussion on the development of sport and its future funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Noting the fact that the Government side seems to be facilitating us with statements every Wednesday night, which is impressive and open of them, does this signal a coming election?  More to the point, the fact that the Government has now announced the date of the next budget as 29 October, will the Leader confirm that the Government intends introducing another budget before the election?  It would allow us to plan things like the summer holiday break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible.  It is within the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  My question is to the Leader who knows I am well aware of the constitutional possibilities.  That was not the effect of my question.  My question was whether the Government has decided to bring in a new budget before the next election.  This information would be convenient for all of us in terms of planning our diaries for the remainder of the year.  It would also take some pressure off the Government parties.  Of course, the Leader should tell his own people first.  To take some pressure off the Government benches may I reiterate my earlier request that, in order to inform Members of the House what is happening in the country's schools, the Minister for Education should supply us with a list of her planned buildings for this year, next year and the following year, the amount of money to be spent on each school and where and when the money will be spent.  That would save us much trouble and would save the staff of this House and the Department having to spend time preparing material for matters on the Adjournment.  It would also be an efficient means <Col N="175" /> of meeting the Government's objective of delivering better government.</P>
      <P>On previous occasions I mentioned the beef industry on the Order of Business.  The threat posed to the poultry industry by the spectre of Newcastle disease has caused public concern in recent days.  The proposed debate on agriculture should focus on the effects of BSE and Newcastle disease.  In order to create public confidence we must debate the facts and base our judgments on them.  Perhaps the debate next Wednesday morning could deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader indicated that an early debate will be held on agriculture.  Can he confirm the date?  He also suggested that debates be held on Wednesday mornings; I agree.  Will the Order of Business will be taken at the start of business or later on Wednesday afternoons?</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need for a debate on agriculture in view of the BSE crisis, events in the Russian and Egyptian markets and so forth.  The incidence of Newcastle disease is an additional reason.  It is important to realise, however, that the outbreak of Newcastle disease is different from the BSE crisis.  There appears to be a public perception that Newcastle disease in poultry is contaminative and poses a potential risk for people who eat poultry.  That is not the case.  It is a virus much like any other virus that might occur in animals.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright referred to the report &ldquo;Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland&rdquo;.  It is important that the House debates the report and examines our policy on sport.  We should dwell on the role of the Olympic Council of Ireland and how funds will be distributed.  I have no difficulty with what is proposed in the report in that regard. However, given the proposals on the share of national lottery funds, the building of a 50 metre swimming pool and so forth, it is important that such matters are dealt with early.</P>
      <P>Another subject worthy of debate is economic and monetary union.  The debate should be extended to our fiscal and exchange rate policies. There is considerable concern in the farming community and elsewhere about the effect interest rates can have on the exchange rate and the fact that a reduction in interest rates would reflect on exchange rates.  However, there appears to be a difference of opinion between financial analysts and stockbroking firms so it is important that we examine this issue in the near future, preferably within the next two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls of Senator Wright and Senator Dardis for a debate on the report on sport released by John Treacy and the Irish Sports Council.  My colleague, Senator Maloney, has called for a debate on sport on several occasions and the report is a suitable basis for such a debate.  I understand from newspaper reports that the report deals with both structures and finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> All Governments have failed sport in terms of allocating national lottery funding.  It was originally intended that a larger proportion of that funding should be devoted to sport but that has not been done by any Government.  The issue of women in sport is extensively dealt with in the document and I welcome that.  Perhaps the famous Oireachtas rugby team might be challenged by the eight female Members of this House who were not even considered for selection recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not mind scrumming beside the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's party colleague has a son who is very good at rugby and I am sure he inherited that talent from somewhere.  We will certainly seek the opportunity of selection in future.</P>
      <P>The Control of Horses Bill, 1996, was signed by the President but it has not yet been signed into law by the Minister.  I wish to reiterate the concern of local authorities, who must deal with the problem of stray horses in urban areas, that the legislation be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>We are pleased we could facilitate Senator O'Toole as regards the Labour Party's Private Members' Time tonight.  We were responding to calls in the House from our Members and from such people as Senator Mooney and Senator Ormonde for a debate on youth unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the leader of my party in calling for a debate on sport.  Perhaps there should also be a debate on national lottery funding because sports people do not seem to be receiving any.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for allowing time for a debate on local government structures. Not enough time was allocated to it and we should have more time to debate it because we did not discuss the matter in depth.  As there is now disagreement between Fine Gael and the Labour Party on water charges, we should debate the matter further.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, if I were allowed I would put a question.  We should have a full debate about funding for the Shannon estuary; this was proposed and guaranteed by the Minister of State.  However, I am informed that money this will be diverted to the National Roads Authority which is running out of money.  This is very serious for the counties of Clare, Limerick and my constituency in Kerry.</P>
      <P>I would also like the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, to come to the House for a debate on the rail system. I am very disappointed with the funding provided for the upgrading of the Tralee to Mallow line.  While he is here, we could debate the proposed new telephone charges.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis and Senator O'Toole have comprehensively covered what I was going to say regarding Newcastle disease in the North.  I ask the Leader to convey our best wishes to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in what is a testing year for him.</P>
      <P>I was involved with the Ministry of Agriculture in the North during several outbreaks of Newcastle disease there.  There is close veterinary co-operation between the North and the South. However, Newcastle disease has now spread to Armagh and this places the South in danger.  I suggest that the Government sends an unofficial observer to the operations room in Dundonald House to monitor the administrative operations. Establishing restricted zones involves an elaborate administrative operation and it might be useful for officials from the South to observe how this is done.  The system used in the North received much acclaim in a veterinary journal in the mid-70s during the first serious outbreak of this disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the roads leading to farms are being neglected, particularly those on the western seaboard.  Would the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment to make a special injection of funds into the local improvement schemes to clear the backlog in this sector?  This would be appreciated by those living in rural, western areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on sports policy.  This is worthwhile in terms of the education of young people.  Can we have a debate on the role of FÁS?  The nature of work is changing from permanent to short-term employment and I am concerned that FÁS has not redesigned its courses to take account of this. This has not been discussed in this House for a long time and I would ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to attend such a debate.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about under-funded primary schools in areas of high population growth.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education to come into the House and make a statement on this sector of the education system which is not receiving its fair share of funding?</P>

      <P>Twice in the last few months I have had visitors who were planning to hold a large number of conferences here next year.  I later learned that they had bad experiences in Dublin because they could not get taxis.  This is a matter for Dublin Corporation but would the Leader impress upon the Minister for Tourism and Trade the effect the disastrous taxi situation in Dublin is having on tourism and on our citizens?  I can only repeat the utter disbelief of these large groups of tourists that in a European capital city a small group of people demand that the rest of the city bow to a lack of competition.  I am not sure what steps should be taken.  I urge the Minister to grab this challenge and ensure there is competition in this area, not just for tourism but also for the public.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McAughtry who congratulated the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for the work done in this area in the past year.  An item in today's newspaper referred to Jacques Santer, the President of the European Commission, transferring responsibility for human health from the Commissioner for Agriculture to the Commissioner for Consumer Policy. Another newspaper report stated that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is being restructured to emphasise the consumer role.  The Department is making an effort to claw back some of the power taken over by the Food Safety Board.  In my view, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Health should be separate.  That is a direction Europe is taking and is the one we should take.  I urge the Government to ensure that we do not allow our sensible, good and well organised Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to claw back the power it has lost as regards consumer affairs.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the national plan for sport introduced by Minister of State, Deputy Allen, yesterday.  Any of us who saw the debacle <Col N="180" /> in Atlanta as regards the Olympic Council of Ireland and the BLE will be delighted at the lessening of the OCI's influence.  I congratulate the Minister on the work he is doing.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader set a date for a debate on the White Paper on mental health?  This matter has been raised on a number of occasions on the Order of Business.  When can we debate the Safety Group report on the fishing fleet?  It has been some time since these reports were introduced and nothing has happened.  I know there is work to be done on them in the Departments but it is important that they be brought before the House as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Some time ago, this House united in expressing its sympathy to the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday.  This was an expression not just of this House but of the feelings of the people of Ireland.  Since then the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made a gratuitously offensive statement in which he indicated that he saw no reason for the British Government to apologise for what has been established as official murder.  This House should now unite again in rejecting and condemning that offensive and dangerous statement from the Secretary of State.  Their deep hurt has been aggravated by this insult.  Can the Leader also ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to protest vigorously on our behalf at that gratuitous insult to the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday?</P>
      <P>My colleague Senator Dan Kiely asked for various Ministers to come into the House.  I ask three Ministers to come in together to clarify the group water schemes issue.</P>

      <P>Taking into account the fact that we are preparing to celebrate &mdash; at least.  I presume we are &mdash; the 200th anniversary of the 1798 revolution, what plans, if any, are there to include some proper commemoration of the gallant career of Lord Edward FitzGerald?  I received a letter a day or two ago from his great-great-grandnephew asking if this House is going to do <Col N="181" /> anything to commemorate him.  There was a portrait of Lord Edward in a corridor here which, apparently, has been removed.  It seems a pity that any trace of the connection with the FitzGerald family, the Dukes of Leinster, should be removed from Leinster House, particularly the picture of Lord Edward FitzGerald who was a gallant and significant personality in the development of this country.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition and a number of other speakers raised the question of a debate on the new sports document.  I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, who is very happy to co-operate with us.  I will make a tentative arrangement, which I will confirm later today, for a debate on the morning of Wednesday, 5 March.  The Minister of State and I look forward to that debate.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked me to confirm the date of the next general election.  Sadly, my constitutional role does not extend quite that far.  I might have a word with the Cathaoirleach about it and let him know.  However, I have every confidence that this Government will continue until late in the year.  I know my confidence is shared by Senator Dan Kiely who has asked for five separate debates, as we will need all that time to accommodate his demands.  As soon as I have hard information, Senator O'Toole will be one of the first to know.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole also raised the question of the schools list.  I am sure the Senator has ample audience with the Department of Education but I will raise the matter with the Minister.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators, including Senators O'Toole and Dardis, raised the beef and poultry issue.  A debate will be held fairly soon on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked about the Wednesday debates.  As I said, the first one will probably be on the sports issue.  My understanding is that the Order of Business must precede all other business <Col N="182" /> on the day, so it is not possible to have the Order of Business later in the day.  However, if that causes a problem we can see if Standing Orders can be changed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan raised the Control of Horses Bill and I will get that information if I can.  As I said, Senator Dan Kiely asked for five different debates.  I will do my best between now and November to accommodate him.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator McAughtry for his helpful observations on Newcastle disease.  I will have the information for Senator Lee on the regional technical colleges deadline tomorrow morning.  I will pass on the point made by Senator McDonagh to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point raised by Senator Ormonde, I believe it will be possible to discuss FÁS within the context of the debate this evening.  That is the intention of Senator O'Sullivan in whose name the motion will be moved.  It is an important topic and if that is not satisfactory to the Senator we will do something about it. Senator Cregan raised the question of primary schools and I will see if that can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of taxis which, as he quite rightly said, is not the responsibility of this House.  However, I have been informed that Dublin City Council recommended at its last meeting an increase of 200 taxis straightaway, all of which will be accessible to the handicapped. While the problem is bigger than that, this is a start in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney requested a debate on the White Paper on mental health.  The legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I agree with him that there should be a discussion on the safety procedures for fishing fleets.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of Bloody Sunday.  There is unanimity in the House that there should be a new inquiry and a full apology.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the question of the portrait of Lord Edward FitzGerald and a possible commemoration of the Rising of 1798.  I would welcome a short series of statements to commemorate the anniversary.  I am sorry that the portrait has been removed.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this important Bill is twofold.  First, it contains the Government's legislative response to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland.  Second, it provides for certain <Col N="183" /> amendments of the current law on the recognition of foreign adoptions.  Before dealing with the individual provisions of the Bill I will outline the background to it.</P>
      <P>The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case was in favour of the father of the child, born outside marriage, who was adopted against his wishes.  The relationship between him and the child's mother lasted for two years, during one of which they cohabited.  The pregnancy was planned and they were also planning to marry.  However, early in the pregnancy the relationship broke down. Shortly after the birth, the child was placed for adoption by an adoption agency at the request of the mother but without the knowledge of the father.  As soon as he discovered this, he sought to block the adoption by applying for guardianship and custody of the child.  His applications, which went as far as the Supreme Court, were ultimately rejected and the child's legal adoption was finalised in 1990.</P>
      <P>Mr. Keegan then brought an application before the European Court of Human Rights under the European Convention of Human Rights.  On 26 May 1994, the European Court delivered its judgment.  The court found in favour of Mr. Keegan on two grounds.  It held that his relationship with the mother of the child had the hallmark of family life for the purposes of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The fact that Irish adoption law permitted the secret placement of the child for adoption without his knowledge or consent amounted to an interference with his right to respect for family life under Article 8.  The court also upheld, as a violation of Article 6(1) of the convention, Mr. Keegan's complaint that he had no right to challenge the adoption placement and has no standing in the adoption procedure.  The judgment did not affect the validity of the adoption order made in respect of the child, nor did Mr. Keegan wish it to.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Article 53 of the convention, the State is obliged to make the necessary changes to our domestic adoption laws in order to bring them into line with the convention.  These changes are provided for in the Bill now before the House.</P>
      <P>Important developments, aimed at giving greater recognition to the position of the father of a non-marital child, have taken place in Irish adoption practice since the Keegan case was determined by the courts here in 1990.  These developments are designed to ensure that adoption agencies endeavour to consult fathers and ascertain their attitude before children are placed with adopting parents.  While these changes occurred too late to benefit Mr. Keegan, they are acknowledged by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgment.  These measures form the basis of the Government's legislative response to the judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> Central to the Government's approach is the introduction of a new statutory procedure for consulting the father of a non-marital child before the child is placed for adoption by an adoption agency, so as to afford him an opportunity of exercising his right to apply for guardianship and/or custody of the child, if he so wishes. Where a father raises no objections, the placement may proceed without further reference to him.  However, if he is opposed to the adoption, the placement must be deferred for a short period to enable him to institute proceedings for guardianship and/or custody of the child.  If the father's application for guardianship is granted by the court, then the adoption cannot proceed without his consent.  If he is awarded custody of the child, then that will effectively be the end of the matter as the child will no longer be available for adoption.</P>
    <P>The advantage of this approach is that since the child would not have been placed with adopting parents, the question of the child developing bonds with a new family would not arise.  This was a crucial factor in Mr. Keegan's case which ultimately militated against him.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for certain exemptions from the requirement to consult the father.  It also provides for the prohibition of the direct placement by the mother of a child for adoption with non-relatives. I will address these two matters in some detail when dealing with the relevant provisions.</P>
    <P>It has to be acknowledged that the introduction of a consultation procedure will give rise to some delays in the placement of children for adoption. However, this is unavoidable in order to facilitate the exercise by a father of his right to apply to court for legal rights in relation to the child which, if successful, would entitle him to veto the adoption.  In this context, I must stress that the absence of such a provision in Irish adoption law is at the heart of the judgment of the European Court in the Keegan case.</P>
    <P>At the same time it is important to keep a sense of proportion in relation to the involvement of fathers of non-marital children in the adoption process.  It is not envisaged that the introduction of the new statutory consultation procedure provided for in the Bill will result in any significant increase in the number of fathers wanting to take on legal rights and responsibilities.  Experience since 1990 indicates that, in the majority of cases, the father shows little or no interest in the child and does not seek to be involved in the adoption process.  This is borne out by the Adoption Board statistics for 1995.  Of the 157 adoption orders made during 1995 for children placed by adoption agencies, in only 27 cases was there contact between the agency and the father.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for certain amendments of the Adoption Act, 1991, which deals with the recognition of foreign adoptions.  The main purpose of these amendments is to facilitate the recognition here of adoptions effected in countries such as the People's Republic of China, whose adoption laws permit the termination or <Col N="185" /> revocation of adoptions in particular circumstances. The carefully framed amendments of the Act are contained in sections 10 to 16 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that in July, 1996, the Supreme Court on appeal upheld a decision of the High Court that Chinese adoptions qualified for recognition under the Adoption Act, 1991. While this ruling by the Supreme Court has removed any doubt about the entitlement of Chinese adoptions to be recognised here, the Government considers it desirable that the position should be clarified in legislation, as the adoption laws of a number of countries other than the People's Republic of China, permit the termination of adoptions in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being availed of to make certain other worthwhile changes to the 1991 Act.  The most significant of these is the extension of the deadlines for the recognition of adoptions effected abroad in favour of Irish residents who had not completed the pre-adoption assessment procedures introduced by the 1991 Act.  A small number of cases have come to light where the adopters were unable to finalise the adoption process in the foreign country concerned until after the deadlines passed.  The Government considers that it is in the interests of the children concerned that their legal status here be regularised.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains definitions of key terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the insertion of new and substitute definitions in section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1952, which is the principal adoption Act.  The revised definition of &ldquo;relative&rdquo; includes a member of the extended family of the father of a child.</P>
    <P>Section 3 empowers the Adoption Board, with the consent of the Minister for Health, to make rules governing the new procedures for consulting the fathers of children being proposed for adoption.  Section 4 inserts a new Part IA, sections 7(a) to 7(f), in the Adoption Act, 1952, setting out various requirements to be followed by adoption agencies before placing children for adoption.</P>
    <P>Section 7A provides that &ldquo;father&rdquo; for the purposes of the new Part IA includes a person who believes himself to be the father.  This is to ensure that a father whose paternity has not been formally established will not be excluded from being consulted.</P>
    <P>Section 7B imposes a restriction on the placing by an adoption agency of a child under the age of four weeks for adoption.  This new restriction is necessary in order to ensure that a child will not be placed with adopting parents by an adoption agency before the father has had an opportunity, following the birth of the child, to notify the Adoption Board of his wish to be consulted. However, it should be noted that a child may be placed for adoption within four weeks of birth where the father has been consulted and raises no objections or where the agency has been exempted by the Adoption Board from the requirement to consult him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> At present a child may be placed for adoption immediately after birth, although the mother may not give her consent to the making of an adoption order until the child is at least six weeks old.  As most children are not placed by agencies with prospective adoptive parents within the first six weeks of birth, this restriction will have little or no impact on present adoption practice.</P>
    <P>Section 7C enables a registered adoption society, in accordance with regulations made by the Minister for Health, to arrange for appropriate care for a child pending his or her placement for adoption.  This will give registered adoption societies specific statutory authority to make interim arrangements for the care of children. The health boards are already covered by the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>Section 7D contains a new statutory procedure to enable the father of a child to notify the Adoption Board of his wish to be consulted on (a) a proposal by an adoption agency to place the child for adoption or (b) an application by the mother or a relative of the child for an adoption order relating to the child.  Such a notice may be given before the birth of the child.</P>
    <P>Section 7E requires an adoption agency proposing to place a child for adoption to endeavour to ascertain the identity of the father, including requesting the Adoption Board to provide it with a copy of any notice received from the father.</P>
    <P>Where the identity of the father is known to the agency it must take such steps as are reasonably practicable to consult him about the proposed placement.  Where a father indicates that he has no objection the agency may proceed to place the child with adopting parents.  If a father objects to the proposed placement the agency must notify him and the mother that it is deferring the placement for a period of not less than 21 days for the purpose of affording him an opportunity to make an application to the court for guardianship and/or custody of the child.  If no notice of such an application is received within the deferral period the agency may then place the child for adoption.</P>
    <P>A situation may arise where a father who is contacted by an adoption agency and informed of the proposed placement of his child for adoption does not give any indication as to whether he objects to the placement proceeding.  The Bill provides that in such an eventuality, the agency will be permitted to place the child with adopting parents if it receives no indication from the father of his intentions within 21 days after informing him of the proposed placement.  I am sure Senators will agree that, in the interests of the child, it is reasonable that a father should be expected to make known his intentions within a specified time frame.</P>
    <P>However, if at any time before the child is placed for adoption the agency receives notice of an application to court by the father, the agency will be precluded from continuing with the placement until the court proceedings have been concluded. Provision is made for the expedition of <Col N="187" /> any such proceedings in the best interests of the child concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 7F provides for exemptions from the requirement on an adoption agency to consult the father in the following circumstances: (a) where the agency is unable, after taking such steps as are reasonably practicable, to consult a father whose identity is known to it; (b) where the nature of the relationship between the father and the mother or the circumstances of the conception of the child are such that it would be inappropriate to contact the father, for example, in the case of rape; (c) where the identity of the father is unknown to the agency and the mother refuses to reveal his identity and (d) where the mother makes a statutory declaration stating that she is unable to identify the father and the agency has no other practical way of ascertaining his identity. The approval of the Adoption Board must be obtained to the placing of the child for adoption in the case of (a), (b) or (c) above.</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, it would be impracticable to impose an absolute requirement that the father be consulted in every instance. Cases will inevitably arise where it would be inappropriate to consult a father about a proposed adoption placement.  Where, for example, a child is conceived as a result of a casual relationship during a holiday romance and the father is not even aware of the birth of the child, it would be unreasonable to require an adoption agency to contact the father since such a relationship could not be deemed to have the hallmark of a family life within the meaning of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Similar considerations apply in the case of rape or incest.</P>
    <P>Most difficulty will arise where the mother refuses to reveal the identity of the father.  I have considered whether the placement of a child for adoption should be prohibited in such circumstances. However, I have concluded that it would not be in the best interests of the child to deny him or her the possibility of becoming a member of an adoptive family where the mother does not intend to bring up the child herself, and it is clearly her wish that the child be placed for adoption. I am conscious of the effect that a requirement to name the father could have on mothers. In an extreme case, a woman might opt for an abortion rather than allow the father to have any involvement in the post-birth situation.  The Bill, accordingly, provides that where a mother refuses to name the father, the adoption agency must counsel her to attempt to obtain her co-operation. I am firmly of the view that a mother cannot be compelled to name the father and that this is as far as the law can go in the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 5 extends the present categories of persons who are entitled to be heard by the Adoption Board on an application for an adoption order to include, among others, the child and the father or a person who believes himself to be the father.  Conferring a statutory right on the father to be heard on an adoption application addresses <Col N="188" /> the finding of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case that he had no standing in the adoption procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out new consultation procedures to be followed by the Adoption Board where an applicant for an adoption order is the mother or a relative of the child and no adoption agency has been involved in the case.  The board must take such steps as are reasonably practicable to consult the father in relation to the application.  It may arrange for a health board to assist it in carrying out its functions under this section.  The board is exempted from the requirement to consult the father in the same circumstances as are provided for in section 7F.</P>
    <P>Section 7 prohibits a parent from placing a child for adoption with a person who is not a relative of the child.  It also prohibits a person from receiving a child who is not a relative of that person for the purpose of adoption otherwise than from an adoption agency.  The purpose of these measures is to ensure that private adoption placements cannot be used as a means of circumventing the new procedure for consulting the father in cases where the mother does not want him to have any say in the matter.</P>
    <P>However, there are other compelling reasons for prohibiting the direct placement by the mother of her child for adoption with non-relatives. The Adoption Board, in successive annual reports, has expressed grave concern about such placements because they lack proper safeguards for both the child and the mother.  In the case of a placement arranged by an adoption agency, the prospective adopting parents will have undergone a detailed assessment of their general suitability. This pre-placement assessment provides an essential safeguard for the welfare of the child, a safeguard which is absent in private adoption arrangements.  It is not unknown for the adopting parents in such cases to have been turned down previously by an adoption agency.</P>
    <P>The involvement of an adoption agency also provides an important protection for the mother. She is assured of receiving non-directive counselling about the wisdom of adoption in her particular circumstances so that if she decides to have the child adopted, her decision will be an informed one.  In a private adoption there is no guarantee that the mother receives objective counselling as to the appropriateness of adoption. Experience has shown that the mother's position is often compromised.</P>
    <P>A further disturbing feature of private adoption arrangements is the possible involvement of third parties which is, of course, illegal.  In a number of cases investigated by the Adoption Board, it emerged that the mother did not know the adopting parents prior to the pregnancy and that they were put in contact with one another by a third party.  I believe that if a child is available for adoption, there is a duty on the State to ensure the best possible placement for the child with a couple who have been properly assessed and are considered by those with professional skills in <Col N="189" /> such matters to be most likely to meet the child's needs.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, however, that the prohibition on private adoption placements will not extend to the adoption of a child by a parent or the spouse of a parent, or a member of the extended maternal or paternal family.  Such arrangements are known as &ldquo;family adoptions&rdquo; and it is not proposed to impose restrictions on them.  Thus it will continue to be lawful, for example, for a mother to adopt her child jointly with her husband who is not the father or to place the child for adoption with the father and his spouse.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that it shall be an offence for a person knowingly to make or furnish any false or misleading statement or information to the Adoption Board or an adoption agency. Section 9 deals with offences generally and provides, among other matters, for the prosecution of offences up to 12 months after they were committed.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for certain modifications to the definition of &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; contained in section 1 of the Adoption Act, 1991.  This is intended to facilitate the recognition under Irish law of adoptions effected in countries, including the People's Republic of China, whose laws permit the termination of adoptions in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the revised paragraph (a) of the existing definition of a &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; is to provide for the retrospective recognition of simple adoptions which are subsequently converted into full adoptions in the countries in which they were granted.  The issue of the non-recognition of simple adoptions was debated at length during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  I will return to this in a few moments after I have outlined the rationale behind the other modifications of the current definition of a &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; provided for in section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the existing definition of a &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; requires an adoption effected abroad to have essentially the same legal effect as an Irish adoption order in relation to the termination and creation of parental rights and duties.  This condition has given rise to most difficulty, particularly on the recognition of adoptions granted abroad which are broadly similar to an Irish adoption in their legal effect apart from the fact that they may be terminated in particular circumstances prescribed by the internal law of the country concerned.  In order to provide for the recognition of such an adoption, the words &ldquo;for so long as it is in force&rdquo; have been incorporated into the substitute condition, &ldquo;essentially&rdquo; has been modified to &ldquo;substantially&rdquo;, and &ldquo;parental rights and duties&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;guardianship&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of the existing definition of a &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; provides that the law of the place where the adoption was effected required the relevant adoption authority, before effecting the adoption, to give due consideration to the <Col N="190" /> interests and welfare of the child.  While the adoption laws of some countries do not specifically contain such a requirement, it is clear nevertheless that they have as their fundamental purpose the promotion of the interests and welfare of the child.  Accordingly, the substitute paragraph (d) is designed to facilitate the recognition of adoptions effected in countries whose adoption laws have as their primary aim the promotion of the welfare of children who are adopted under those laws.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that some countries operate dual systems of adoption known, respectively, as simple or ordinary adoption and full or plenary adoption.  A full adoption has a broadly similar legal effect to that of an Irish adoption order in that it severs the legal relationship between the birth parents and the child and creates a permanent new legal parent-child relationship between the adopters and the child. Full adoptions effected in countries which operate dual systems of adoption already qualify for recognition here under the Adoption Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain at this point that the effect of the recognition of a foreign adoption under the 1991 Act is to accord it the same legal status as an Irish adoption order.  As Senators are aware, an Irish adoption order permanently severs the legal relationship between the child and the natural parents.  It follows from this that an adoption granted outside the State must have a similar legal effect to an Irish adoption under the law of the foreign country concerned to qualify for recognition here.</P>
    <P>However, simple or ordinary adoptions are more limited in their legal effect than full adoptions in that the pre-existing legal relationship between the child and the birth parents is not completely severed.  In countries such as Paraguay, where dual systems of simple and full adoption are operated, it is for the relevant adoption authority to decide which type of adoption decree is the appropriate one to make by reference to the provisions of its internal adoption laws.  I have been advised that we must respect that distinction and not seek to accord a simple adoption a legal status beyond that which it has under the law of the country where it was granted.</P>
    <P>Our own adoption laws have evolved on the basis that they protect the interests of the child and respect the rights of the birth parents as set out in the Constitution.  In the case of inter-country adoption, it is proper that our laws must give the same respect to the rights of birth parents abroad as they give to Irish parents.</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the practical difficulties that couples who have been granted simple adoptions in Paraguay are encountering because their adoptions do not qualify for recognition here.  The immediate difficulties arise in relation to Irish citizenship and passports for the children.  In the longer term, the children's rights and liabilities in relation to succession and taxation may be an issue.</P>
    <P>The issues involved are complex and clearly concern a number of area of Government. <Col N="191" /> Accordingly, I arranged to have them discussed at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Children's Services.  The committee agreed that everything possible should be done to support the children and find a resolution to their problems. An interdepartmental committee has been established to tease out how the difficulties currently being experienced by the families might be addressed.  This committee is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives of the Departments of Education, Equality and Law Reform, Foreign Affairs, Justice and Social Welfare as well as the Office of the Attorney General.  The work of the committee is proceeding and I hope this initiative will help to resolve some of the difficulties I have outlined.</P>
    <P>As regards the substantive issue of the status of Paraguayan simple adoptions, I have received a legal opinion on certain aspects of Paraguayan adoption law from a lawyer in Paraguay with expertise in that law.  This opinion has been considered by the interdepartmental committee and the lawyer concerned has been asked by the Irish Embassy in Buenos Aires to clarify a number of matters.  This clarification is still awaited.</P>
    <P>The amendments of the existing definition of a &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; provided for in section 10 of the Bill are as far as we can go in extending our statutory system for the recognition of adoptions effected abroad.  From a public policy point of view, it is not possible to modify the system further without completely undermining our credibility at the international level.  The provisions of section 10 of the Bill are the minimum criteria that a foreign adoption must satisfy in order to qualify for recognition here.  The legal opinion received from the lawyer in Paraguay has shed new light on our understanding of the legal effect of a simple adoption granted in that country. However, the advice available to me is that the legal effect of such an adoption does not comply with the terms of the substitute paragraph (b) of the definition of a &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo;.  In the final analysis, only our courts could give a definitive ruling on this question.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Senators that no stone will be left unturned in seeking a resolution of the practical difficulties which couples who have adopted children abroad under simple adoption decrees are experiencing.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for a technical amendment of section 2 of the 1991 Act.  Section 12 extends the grounds for the recognition of a foreign adoption effected elsewhere than the place in which the adopters were domiciled or resident on the date of the adoption.  At present, such an adoption will only qualify for recognition here if it is recognised in the country where the adopters were living at the time of the adoption.  The new provision is designed to deal with cases where persons who, while living in an Islamic country or a country whose laws do not provide for the recognition of adoptions, adopt a child in some other country.  I am aware that a number of Irish <Col N="192" /> citizens have found themselves in this situation and the new provision will be of particular benefit to them.</P>
    <P>Section 13 extends by 12 months the deadlines set out in the 1991 Act for the recognition of adoptions effected abroad in favour of Irish residents who had not completed the pre-adoption assessment procedures introduced by that Act. As I have already mentioned, a number of Irish residents were unable to finalise the adoption process in Romania and in certain other countries before the deadlines.  The purpose of the extension is to ensure that their adoptions will qualify for recognition.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for technical amendments of section 6 of the 1991 Act.  Section 15 amends section 7 of the 1991 Act, which empowers the High Court to give directions in relation to entries in the register of foreign adoptions maintained by the Adoption Board.  The amendments are designed to deal with situations where a foreign adoption which has been recognised here is subsequently terminated under the law of the place where it was effected.  A person seeking to have recognition withdrawn must apply to the High Court for an order directing the board to cancel the entry in the register.  The court shall not give such a direction unless satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the adopted person to do so.  Where the court gives such a direction, it may make such orders as appears to it to be necessary, including orders relating to the guardianship, custody, maintenance and citizenship of the adopted person.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the laying before each House of the Oireachtas of regulations made by the Minister for Health under section 9 of the 1991 Act in relation to the proof of foreign adoptions. Section 17 provides that sections 2 to 9 shall come into operation 90 days after the enactment of the Bill.  This is to give the Adoption Board time to make the necessary rules governing the new procedures for consulting the fathers of non-marital children, and the adoption agencies an opportunity to put in place arrangements for the operation of those procedures.  Section 18 contains standard provisions regarding short title, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Bill represents a major development in our adoption legislation.  The provisions for improving the position of the fathers of non-marital children in the adoption process are a reasonable response to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case.  The Government is satisfied that the provisions address the specific issues raised in the judgment and that they will bring our domestic adoption laws into line with the European Convention on Human Rights.  While it cannot be guaranteed that a child will never again be placed for adoption without the knowledge of a father who had established family ties similar to those established by Mr. Keegan, I believe that the enactment of the new provisions will minimise as <Col N="193" /> far as possible the likelihood of this happening in the future.</P>
    <P>The amendment of the Adoption Act, 1991, is designed to introduce greater flexibility into our statutory system for the recognition of foreign adoptions.  I am confident the amendments will be warmly welcomed by people who wish to adopt in countries whose laws provide for the termination of adoptions.  I know that there will be an equally positive response from those adoptive parents whose adoptions will qualify for recognition by virtue of the extension of the deadlines set out in the 1991 Act.</P>
    <P>This is the first of a number of Bills that I propose to bring forward to reform and update the law on adoption.  As I have previously indicated to this House, the establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for post-adoption contact between birth parents and adopted persons, and access to birth records, is a priority of the Government.  The need for such a framework is fully recognised and it is my firm intention that the necessary enabling legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible after a number of legal and constitutional issues have been clarified. In the meantime, I am proceeding with arrangements for the establishment, on an administrative basis, of an adoption contact register to assist adoptees and birth parents who wish to be put in touch with one another.  My Department is currently developing proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also intend to bring forward legislation to provide for the ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-country Adoption.  The primary objectives of this convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction, sale of, or trafficking in children, and to establish a system of co-operation among countries in order to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned.  The convention was signed on behalf of the Government on 19 June 1996 in order to demonstrate our support of the instrument and its objectives, and to signal our intention of ratifying it in due course.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House represents a significant step forward in the evolution of our adoption laws.  The progressive measures contained in it satisfactorily address two major issues.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the contribution of Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by the Minister of State in that part of his speech relating to the priority that must be given at all times to the adopted child.  The Minister mentioned the establishment, on an informal administrative basis, of an adoption register to facilitate contact between adopted children and their natural parents.  This register should be voluntary and the overwhelming benefit should accrue to the child who, at this stage, may well be an adult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State correctly said, this Bill deals with two very different problems.  The first <Col N="194" /> is the issue arising out of the Keegan case where a natural father sought to involve himself in the adoptive process and, it has to be admitted, was effectively stymied by our system.  He had to go to the European Court of Human Rights to assert his rights.  The second issue is the recognition of foreign adoptions.</P>
    <P>The position of the natural father <i>vis-á-vis</i> a child that may be adopted will always be a difficult one.  By and large this Bill contains positive measures that I am happy to support.  I would like to see them enacted quickly.  The onus should be on the mother to show that the natural father is not interested or does not want to be involved in the adoption process.  Natural fathers have rights which must be protected.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to read at length from the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, but I was rather dismayed by the reporting of this case in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 27 May 1994.  I will read from three paragraphs of it:</P>
    <P>Yesterday's judgment found that the decision to place the child for adoption without Mr. Keegan's knowledge or consent was in accordance with Irish law.</P>
    <P>Last November's hearing was told that Mr. Keegan's former girlfriend, named only as &ldquo;V&rdquo;, placed the child for adoption shortly after the birth.  Mr. Keegan was informed of this placement by letter some days later.  He contested the Adoption Board's decision to place the child, without his consent, through the Irish courts.</P>
    <P>Counsel for the State, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, SC, denied that there had been any discrimination against Mr. Keegan because he was an unmarried father.  He told the November hearing: &ldquo;There is no question of the Irish court resolving upon some wholesale disregard for non-married unions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many children are now born out of wedlock.  In so far as this Bill brings the recognition of the rights of natural fathers into a modern context, then it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I largely agree with the Minister's comment that it will not be possible in every case to secure the consent, advice or opinion of the natural father.  It would be unreasonable in certain cases even to ask for that.  The Minister cited three examples: rape; incest and a holiday relationship. While I completely agree with the first two, I would place a question mark over a holiday relationship because it is possible for people to fall in love quickly.  It does happen, if only for a short period.  In a case where the child is the product of voluntary sexual intercourse I am not sure that there should not be an obligation on the mother to disclose who the father is to the Adoption Board, or the adoption society concerned.</P>
    <P>Of course, I accept there would be immense practical problems in implementing that. However, I would leave the door somewhat open in that there could be occasions when, even on holiday or in some very casual way, there was a <Col N="195" /> relationship of love from which a child resulted. I would not close the door entirely on the possibility that, in such circumstances, the natural father should be consulted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be more than one relationship going on at the same time on holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>How would the Minister know that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, I believe that where an unmarried mother is placing a child for adoption there should be a fairly strong onus on her to inform the adoption society or the Adoption Board of the identity and location of the natural father.  Every effort should be made, without going to extremes, to ensure that the natural father consents to the adoption.</P>
      <P>I have a small query about the 21 day period, although we can address this in more detail on Committee Stage.  While there must be a cut off point &mdash; the clock is ticking and nobody wants to see a child in care for an indefinite period &mdash; perhaps 21 days is too short a period for a natural father to make such a decision.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill relates to the recognition of foreign adoptions.  By and large, I agree with the arguments advanced by the Minister of State as to whether simple adoptions should be recognised. With regard to full or plenary adoptions, the Bill introduced by Deputy Woods in the Dáil in March 1996 should have been accepted by the Government, albeit with amendments.  If it had, some parents who have anxiously awaited such legislation might have been able to move more speedily.  I will not make an issue of this because it is not appropriate to seek political advantage on a matter as sensitive as adoption.  However, I question the need for the long delay between the time Deputy Woods introduced his Bill in 1996 and the introduction of this Bill, which will not become law until March 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to address the general question of whether Ireland should recognise simple adoptions in foreign countries.  What is at issue is a basic conflict of laws.  If simple adoptions were recognised in this country a situation could arise where, if the natural parents who live in the foreign country suddenly wanted their child back, the child could not return to the natural parents because its adoption was recognised in Ireland.  In effect there would be a conflict of law between the foreign country and Ireland if both countries have different adoption laws.  This points to the need for worldwide uniformity in adoption law and practice.  That is the only real long-term solution to the problem.  I am delighted the Bill provides for applications to the High Court in cases where the register must be changed and that the <Col N="196" /> primary concern, as is normal in the High Court, will be the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>The recognition of simple adoptions is an extremely difficult issue and, in a way, the Bill does not solve the problem.  Are children to be the victims of differences between various countries in adoption law?  Are children who are languishing without hope in orphanages or children who are committed to a life of poverty and destitution in Latin America to be consigned to the scrap heap of humanity because there is a conflict of laws in relation to adoption?  It is a difficult and sensitive question and I do not pretend to have the answer.  However, as Deputy Woods said in the Dáil, the humanitarian aspect must be the absolute priority.  The legal formalities, if they can be overcome, take second place. However, that is subject at all times to not involving a child in a tug of law, rather than a tug of love.  That is the problem we are trying to avoid. It is an extremely serious problem.</P>
    <P>When speaking on this Bill in the Dáil, Deputy Woods read out a list of countries whose adoptions will not be recognised under this Bill.  The list includes Belgium, France, Luxembourg&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>That list is out of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will name the rest of the countries and perhaps the Minister of State will clarify how the list has been altered.  The other countries are Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, Mexico, Liberia, Guatemala, China, Japan, Lebanon, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Thailand, Poland and Russia.  I hope the list is now considerably shorter.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said an interdepartmental task force is looking into this problem.  Can he tell us the timetable for the conclusion of the task force's deliberations?  I am not suggesting that its deliberations should be rushed because nobody wants children to be the victims of rushed legislation. This is an extremely important and sensitive area.  However, there is a shortage of children available for adoption in Ireland while there is an excess of children available and in need of adoption throughout the world.  We have the urgent task of marrying the needs of Irish parents with those of the hundreds of thousands of children in other countries who are crying out for adoption. The Minister of State should outline the timetable for when this important work will be concluded. It is vitally important and sensible that parents who have been approved in Ireland for adoption should be able to adopt children who are unwanted and suffering.</P>
      <P>We welcome this important Bill and we will constructively debate each section on Committee Stage.  It is regrettable that Deputy Woods's Bill was not accepted last March but we will positively contribute to this legislation.  We hope it will be passed so that foreign adoptions by Irish adoptive couples and parents can be recognised as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="197" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is two-fold: it is a response to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case and it amends domestic law with regard to foreign adoptions.</P>
      <P>The Keegan case was unusual.  Since the passing of the first adoption legislation in 1952 a number of cases have been fought in the courts and changes have been made in adoption law as a consequence.  The Keegan case was a continuation of that trend.  Mr. Keegan had established a family relationship with the child and the court ruled in his favour.  The court found that the child was placed for adoption without his consent.</P>
      <P>Until recently, many children were placed for adoption without consent, in the strict meaning of the word.  A number of children were placed with adoptive parents after six weeks and mothers had no knowledge of where their children were placed.  Although the mothers gave legal consent, that was as far as it went.  I am pleased that the Minister of State is introducing a legal framework for post adoption contact between birth parents and adoptive parents.  He made that promise in an earlier debate in the House and I am pleased to see that he is fulfilling that promise.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy spoke about the rights of fathers of children born outside wedlock.  They have rights but they also have responsibilities.  It saddens me that, in Irish society today, men walk away from their responsibilities.  Mr. Keegan was different, but he was also an exception.  The majority of men have no interest in what happens to children they have fathered outside wedlock. Mr. Keegan, to his credit, took an interest and was anxious to be consulted.  The Minister quoted the 1995 adoption figures which showed that few fathers wished to be consulted about what happened to their children.  The figure for the years before showed that one in 1,000 had an interest. I worked in a church where a number of children born out of wedlock were baptised.  I was there 29 years and, in all that time, I only met one father who attended the baptism of his child born outside wedlock.  That is a measure of the interest shown.  Certain individuals have an interest in their children born outside wedlock and we must provide for that in law.  This legislation provides for fathers who show such an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the legislation deals with foreign adoptions.  This causes problems because there is a dual system of adoption in some countries &mdash; a simple adoption and a full adoption. Before we enacted the Adoption Act, 1952, this country could be classified in the first category because we only had a simple adoption scheme.  I want to tell the House about the problems that caused.  Children were born outside wedlock, adopted by adoptive parents and the child was registered in the natural mother's name.  There was no legal mechanism to change that until the 1952 Act was passed; adoptive parents could not change the register to put their names as the parents <Col N="198" /> of the child.  However, under the Act they had the same rights as the natural parents.  Until then, they did not and this led to all sorts of complications. Adoptive parents did not know at what hour of the day or night natural parents might come knocking on their door asking for the child.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for going through the full legal system and parents should be warned. Does the Minister know if adoption societies have a list of countries which only have a simple form of adoption so that parents can be informed?  It is important that parents be given that information when they are adopting children.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for setting up the interdepartmental committee to deal with the Paraguay issue and some progress has been made on that from what he has told us.  I hope it can be resolved.  Could he give a list of other countries where the problem of simple adoptions still exists?</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  It is very positive as regards the natural father being consulted if he so wishes and as regards foreign adoptions.  There is a great demand in this country to adopt foreign children because the number of Irish children available for adoption is limited as natural parents want to keep their children.  I hope the matter can be resolved and parents' anxieties removed.  We have been lobbied by parents who have adopted Paraguayan children and I can see the difficulties they face.  The problems are the same as those which existed in this country before the 1952 Act, such as getting adopted children's names on passports, etc.  These should be resolved, if possible, and I hope the Minister will make progress with the interdepartmental committee in resolving the matter.  I compliment the Minister for bringing his legislation before the House and I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  It is a daunting task to have to follow Senator Doyle who has such experience and is always so well informed in these areas.  I am glad to hear the Minister will introduce further legislation, especially concerning the ratification of the Hague Convention.  The abduction of children is a frequent occurrence, every week if not every day, both within the State and without.  The faster this legislation is enacted, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, for having the Intergovernmental Conference suggest that trafficking of people, children specifically, be included with the trafficking of drugs.  That is incredibly important because people in other countries are now extremely alarmed that the international movement of children is so easy.  I have met people in eastern Europe and the Far East who are desperately anxious about this, perhaps in an exaggerated way.  If we, in Europe, introduce legislation to show we will not tolerate trafficking in people, it would be a step towards assuaging the fears of the people in eastern Europe and the Far East <Col N="199" /> whose nationals are being transported around the globe.</P>
    <P>The two areas addressed in this Bill are the rights of the biological father and foreign adoptions. Senator Doyle was correct when he said that Mr. Keegan was an exceptional young man in that he took such an interest in the fate of his child.  There had been a long relationship and the child was planned.  It was very sad for Mr. Keegan that he was denied any rights regarding the placement of his child.  When he eventually won in court, it was still decided it would be better for the child if it stayed with the adoptive parents.  I am sure that was the correct thing to do because the child was four by that stage.  It is now recognised that moving children after a certain length of time is not a good idea.  Perhaps, with the Minister's welcome announcement about contact registers being established, he can look forward to a time when his child would be in a position to make contact with him.  Both the mother's and father's name will be included on these registers.</P>
    <P>The father is given a certain length of time to state whether he objects to the placement of his child for adoption.  I disagree with Senator Mulcahy that 21 days is too short.  After all, the woman was pregnant for nine months.  If the man had taken so little interest in the pregnancy, obviously it was a casual relationship and he would not be interested in the arrival of his child into the world.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious about the word &ldquo;obligation&rdquo; being used regarding the mother.  There is an obligation on her to disclose the father's name.  I worry that she might seek an abortion because disclosure of the father's name might raise problems for her.  She might not disclose the father's name for inclusion on the child's birth certificate if she thought there might be too many problems. I feel strongly about this because children are entitled to know their father's name and it should be on the birth certificate wherever possible.</P>
    <P>As president of Cherish, the organisation set up 25 years ago by and for single mothers, I say we must be very cautious with this section.  The Minister for Social Welfare and I have had correspondence recently about payments for lone parents where the mother must make reasonable efforts to get what is referred to in the Bill as a &ldquo;liable relative&rdquo; to pay maintenance for the child. We have always encouraged mothers to try to get maintenance from the father but this can be counter productive if it destroys any hope of a relationship between a father and his child.  Even in the case of separated and divorced women, where the father will have had an emotional relationship with the child and be subject to legal requirements, it can be very difficult to enforce maintenance &mdash; it is paid in only 50 per cent of cases.  This is a sensitive area and the Minister has achieved as much as is possible to ensure that the father can state his views on the proposal that his child should be put forward for adoption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> Foreign adoption is an emotive issue.  We have all seen television programmes from other countries in which children have been deserted by their parents.  However, countries do have a pride which must be taken into account.  The welfare of the child is paramount and we cannot allow ourselves to be seen as a country where these children are treated in a way which best satisfies us.  Some of these children live in the most appalling conditions and I want to ensure that they are given the best opportunities in life which, probably, will be with adoptive parents here. However, we must be sensitive to the culture from which they come and the feelings of those living in these countries.  For example, extended families in these countries may not be enthusiastic about the adoption of a child out of their culture and if they are prepared to undertake the upbringing of the child, then we must take that into account.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the Paraguayan children who have been adopted in Ireland.  There are about 30 children involved and I am sympathetic to their adoptive parents.  The Minister is taking the best legal advice available but the laws of other countries must also be taken into account. Just because we feel that our environment is preferable to that in another country does not mean that we can force our rules on these countries.  I hope something will be done soon to regularise the Paraguayan children because the adoptive parents are very anxious.</P>
    <P>When we are considering our views on foreign adoption it is important to remember what happened last year when the situation was reversed. Children who were sent for adoption in the US eventually discovered more about their adoptions when papers were found in the archives of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  A large number of those people have now made representations to try to find out more about their adoption. Approximately 60 of them have sought certificates of surrender and confirmation of suitability. At the time it was felt that the best course of action was being taken for the children.  The National Archives holds the files for the purposes of issuing passports but it only refers individuals to the convents or agencies who handled the adoption originally.  We need to be very sensitive about this.</P>
    <P>The contact register will be very important and I welcome its establishment.  I compliment Senator McGennis on her tenacity on this issue because she has been seeking such a register since I came into this House.  More and more adoptees are seeking information on their biological background but there is great difficulty finding this information as the records are confidential.  An adoptee may only know the name of his or her birth parent, usually it is the mother.  While the privacy of the adults involved has to be protected, the interests of the child should have priority.</P>
    <P>The contact register in England allows birth parents and adopted children, who have reached 18 years of age, to apply for the information <Col N="201" /> necessary to make contact with each other.  That information is exchanged only when both parties have agreed.  We should implement a similar system in Ireland.  The adoption register is one step towards more openness but a certain amount of secrecy still exists.  This has led to traumatic events in the lives of some adopted children, so the more openness we have the better.</P>
    <P>If a child is adopted at an older age it is important to maintain contact with a biological relative.  The register may also make it possible for the biological parent to be given information on the progress of the child without making contact. This can make an enormous difference to the mothers and also to the child if contact is eventually made and he or she discovers that their well being was inquired into over the years.</P>
    <P>The register will be of no use to those adopted before 1952 and who have only the names of the adoptive parents on their birth certificates.  There are two cases before the High Court where adults with such birth certificates are attempting to find the names of their birth parents.</P>
    <P>We should be sensitive about the language we use when discussing this issue.  Most adoptees prefer the term &ldquo;birth parent&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;real&rdquo; or &ldquo;natural&rdquo; mother or father.  If they have been happy in a family they will refer to the adoptive parents as their mother and father or parent.  The choice of words may seem a technicality but it can make a significant emotional difference and it also shapes and reflects the way we think about adoption.</P>
    <P>There seems to be problems from time to time regarding the Adoption Board.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday there was a report about a couple who have been refused permission to adopt because the wife had cancer.  Two oncologists stated that the disease had been cured.  From the medical evidence I felt that the condition was cancer of the cervix which has a very high cure rate but the Adoption Board decided that five years must elapse from the time of the operation before it would consider the couple for adoption. By this stage the woman will be 41 which is over the legal age for adoption.  Unless the board has expert advice from other oncologists I wonder how wise it is to treat people in such a manner.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Adoption Act, 1991, can be a cause of concern for would be adopters.  As of now, there is no need for the board to give any reason for its refusal to allow couples or a single person to adopt.  There are some anomalies here. In the Bill, a widow or widower is allowed to adopt but a single person is not mentioned.  A widower or widow is not necessarily a father or mother whereas a single person, especially a mother, could have one or more children and be a successful parent.  This could be important when women try to adopt children from countries where single parent adoptions are more readily allowed, for example, in China.</P>
    <P>I also have difficulty in understanding section 10 (2) of the 1991 Act which says that, notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, where the <Col N="202" /> board is satisfied that in the particular circumstances of the case it is desirable an adoption order may be made in favour of an applicant who is not a person specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of this section: paragraph (b) says the applicant is the mother, father or relative of the child and (c) that the applicant is a widow or widower.</P>
    <P>It is hard to work out what are the particular circumstances of the case.  If one cannot find out what the precedent is, how can a person find out what are the particular circumstances so they can see if they fall within that category?  Surely natural justice suggests that the board has to let people know what these particular circumstances are.  If a person is refused, can they ask for an independent assessment?  It is difficult for people who may appear to be admirable to adopt children who may be living in dire circumstances and may be in need of a family.  We now recognise there are many families where, regrettably, for one reason or another, there is only one parent and it is unfortunate that this is not made clear to those who want to adopt.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about pre-adoption assessments and he has provided for suitable changes to be made retrospectively in the Bill.  However, it is important that we watch this area.  As the Minister knows, sometimes people who are not found acceptable in pre-adoption assessment try other countries.  Because no reasons are given, it is difficult for them to know why they have been refused.  There were cases in England where people were described as being too fat to adopt. While I do not have the greatest enthusiasm for Stephen Dorrell, he has now suggested that adoption agencies will have to bring forward some reasons couples are refused permission to adopt. People may get themselves into invidious situations and they go abroad and bring back children. We then have to deal with the most heartrending cases where who knows what legislation will follow.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, the High Court encouraged the board to try to give would be adopters answers within a reasonable length of time, for instance, two years.  Will the Minister encourage the board to be more open in its decisions as to why people are refused and try to make their decisions known as soon as possible?</P>
    <P>There is a great amount of legislation being brought forward in the Department of Justice, but it would be helpful if a consolidated Bill were introduced because people would not have to refer from Act to Act, as has become the case because legislation has had to be updated so quickly.</P>
    <P>The day when people could easily adopt children in this country &mdash; when 4,000 or 5,000 children were adopted every year &mdash; is long gone. There are 3,000, maybe 4,000, adoptions each year now and almost all are inter-family, usually the mother, husband or another family member adopts the child.  This legislation dealing with foreign adoptions is important.  While it is difficult <Col N="203" /> for the Minister, I hope he will continue the work to ensure these adoptions do not run into trouble at a later date when they may be challenged because of legislation in the country from where the child originally came.</P>

      <P>The Bill has three purposes.  The first is to resolve the legal difficulties arising from the 1990 Keegan <i>v</i> Ireland case.  This case has been well outlined.  The European Court found that the placing of a child for adoption without consultation with the father was an infringement of his family rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is also agreed that the fact that Mr. Keegan was not allowed to participate in the adoption hearing was an infringement of his rights under Article 6 of the same convention.</P>
      <P>The second purpose is the facilitation of the proper recognition of Chinese or foreign adoptions in this country and the third is to clear up other minor anomalies in the Adoption Act, 1991. Adoption has psychological effects, especially on the mother.  In the years I worked in the psychiatric services, I came across a number of people who felt hurt by decisions they had taken as regards adoption which stayed with them for life. A woman will take a decision when she becomes pregnant &mdash; sometimes she may panic if she is not married.  What choices does she have?  She has to decide whether to abort the child.  If she decides to keep it, does she put it up for adoption or does she keep it?  Usually she is on her own.  The Minister mentioned 157 adoption orders in 1995 but there was contact between the father and the agencies in only 27 cases, a ratio of one in six.</P>
      <P>I have seen cases where a mother gave a child up for adoption and after six months decided to take the child back.  I remember the depression of and the psychological damage done to the adoptive parents.  They would have had no children of their own and their happiness during that period was unbelievable.  Some of them entered psychiatric hospitals because of it.  I have seen others who had to be treated later in life because of an earlier decision, whether to abort or adopt. They felt guilt and hurt which stayed with them forever; they never forgot it.</P>
      <P>I know one couple who adopted four children. They were the finest children anybody could have.  I also knew two friends each of whom adopted a child in the same year.  In the following year, both women were pregnant and had children naturally.  The benefits of adoption sometimes have to be weighed against the losses.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the situation in the Keegan case.  He set out to establish a statutory procedure to consult with fathers of non-marital children. Where a father raises no objection to the adoption of a child, it can proceed without further reference to him.  Those points were stressed by the Minister of State.  The changes in the Bill are a response to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights and must be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> If a father is opposed to an adoption the placement must be deferred to allow him instigate court proceedings for guardianship and custody. As the Minister of State outlined, there is a greater recognition of fathers in that provision, which is welcome.  If the court awards the father guardianship, the adoption cannot proceed without his consent.  If a mother decides to put a child up for adoption, it is important for the father and child, and augurs well for the child's future, if the father is in a position to adopt the child.  If the father is awarded custody the issue of adoption does not arise.  The Bill also prohibits direct placement of a child for adoption to non-relatives by a mother.</P>
    <P>The moves to consult the father are very important.  As was said earlier, most of these fathers slip away and avoid responsibility.  I have seen cases, however, where fathers, who were informed after their child was aborted or adopted, went through the same stresses and strains as mothers who felt extremely bad about having to do either.  This Bill is a definite step in the right direction.  Fathers and mothers can carry that loss and hurt forever and it is important we address the situation.  The Minister of State has made a good effort in that regard.</P>
    <P>Most of the issues were covered by other Senators and I will not go over them again.  The measure on Chinese adoptions was a Government response to Deputy Woods's Private Members' Bill.  The most significant measure was the extension of the deadlines contained in the 1991 Act for the recognition of foreign adoptions. Those who complete the extensive pre-adoption procedures outlined in the 1991 Act currently have a problem meeting the deadlines.  The Minister of State has gone some way towards addressing this situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has made moves in this Bill to try to close the loopholes in the law.  Most Members agree that the Bill is a major step forward and I commend him on it.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill which seeks to correct many anomalies.  It is right that fathers should have a say in whether their child is adopted.  It is a pity we could not have tighter restrictions to ensure that more fathers were made responsible and accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Senator is talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that only today or yesterday.  I got a headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> about ten years ago for making that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Senator gets a headline tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how far ahead I was in my thinking.  I do not see why the State or the girl <Col N="205" /> should be the victims and have to carry the can; as the old cliché says, it takes two to tango.</P>
      <P>It is also important that adopted children should be able to find out the identity of both their natural parents.  The big problem with adoptions has been that while it was always possible to discover the identity of the mother, it was not always possible to discover the identity of the father.  I hope we can remedy that serious situation.</P>
      <P>It is sad to hear girls saying they had a one night stand and do not want to meet the man again.  It is sad that society has got to the stage &mdash; I do not want anybody to jump on my back for saying this &mdash; where girls have dropped to that level because of drink and drugs.  Boys will be boys and many of them do not want to face up to their responsibilities as they should.</P>
      <P>It is important for foreign adoptions to be properly registered and documented.  Those children might wish to return to their country of origin in 20 years' time to find out where they came from and who were their parents.  I wonder if that is being documented as well as it should.</P>
      <P>Senator Maloney touched on the need for more support for unborn babies.  We are told that 500 girls go to London every month for abortions, a colossal number.  Is that the answer in the 1990s? We have been highly critical of children being sent for adoption to America and elsewhere in the 1940s and 1950s.  However, is abortion a good enough answer in the 1990s?  Are we doing enough or do we not want to hear about it?  I sometimes wonder if people have forgotten the Ten Commandments, particularly the fifth.</P>
      <P>It is sad that doctors are making £500 for ten minutes work in those clinics.  I heard a girl being interviewed recently who had changed her mind in an abortion clinic.  The staff in the clinic were very annoyed for wasting their time and she got no sympathy from them.  All they wanted was the money.  Although the great majority of doctors work long hours to save lives, it is sad that a small minority of those who studied to save lives are prepared to do the opposite.  Senator Maloney said he had experience of girls who had had abortions seeking psychiatric treatment.  Many women who have genuine miscarriages get worried and upset about them for a long time.  What will be the repercussions of the world we live in today? It is too horrific to think about.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As Senator Maloney said, it is a panic situation when a girl gets pregnant.  I have no experience of this, but from what I hear that is so.  Our current treatment of that problem is not good enough.  It is all very well to talk about freedom of choice, but the unborn baby should also be given the choice to live.  Legislation should be put in place in that regard.  There are many people who would be willing and delighted to adopt children but they cannot get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, and the Minister of State is doing a good job, I appeal to him to think about whether we are doing enough for the unborn.  We should put in place a system to try to <Col N="206" /> prevent the abortion trail.  In 15 or 20 years people will ask what kind of barbaric society and Government ruled Ireland in the 1990s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation for the work the Minister of State has put into this welcome Bill.  I do not need to repeat much of what has been said.  Our hearts are behind the objectives of the Bill.  Those of us fortunate enough to have natural families do not always appreciate the joy experienced by parents when they are able to adopt.  We are reminded of it when we encounter the trauma they experience in the adoption process.  Years ago, large numbers of children in Ireland were adopted; however, those wishing to adopt today must often go outside the country.</P>
      <P>The interests of the child is of paramount importance.  I was in America three weeks ago when an adoption case hit the headlines.  A father who had not given permission, claimed that the adoption of his child effected by the mother three years previously was illegal.  The child was removed from the adoptive parents to the birth parents, resulting in trauma and difficulty.  This case made headlines because the father had deserted the mother.  This was a difficult situation and it illustrates that it is not possible to legislate for all circumstances.  However, the Minister of State has done his best to address the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  It has nothing to do with Ireland, other than to remind us of the difficulties we face in this area.  A number of parents have adopted children from Paraguay and there is great concern that not every stone has been left unturned in the efforts to achieve success with the simple and plenary forms of adoption. The Minister of State said:</P>
      <P>The legal opinion received from the lawyer in Paraguay has shed new light on our understanding of the legal effect of a simple adoption granted in that country.  However, the advice available to me is that the legal effect of such an adoption does not comply with the terms of the substitute paragraph ... In the final analysis, only our courts could give a definite ruling on this question.</P>
      <P>I urge him to publish the legal advice he has received.  Lawyers differ, and in the same way as many hands at any task have a better chance of success, publication of the legal advice will enable those concerned parents make an input and help find a solution to this worrying problem.  In an era of freedom of information there should be no difficulty with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the basic problem between a simple and plenary adoption arises where the child predeceases the adoptive parents, and possible difficulties, such as inheritance and succession rights ensue.  Given that such situations are unlikely, there must be a solution to the problems <Col N="207" /> in this area.  The efforts made by all concerned, including the Minister of State, his Department and the parents themselves, to reach a solution would be helped by the publication of the advice received by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the steps he has taken.  I urge him to go one step further, especially in the area of Paraguayan adoptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome this Bill.  We are dealing with a complex area here because individual cases involving children, adoptive parents and natural parents are involved.  However, the welfare of the child must be of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State on the efforts he is making to resolve this issue.  We all know the difficulties faced by our constituents involved in adoption, especially foreign adoptions.  It is a complex issue and will probably require changes in the future.  However, I appreciate the Minister of State's efforts to address the more obvious difficulties that have arisen in recent years.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is two-fold.  The first is to meet the consequences of the judgment handed down by the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case, and second is to deal with the problems that have arisen with some foreign adoptions.</P>
      <P>We have not had the happiest relationship with the European Court of Justice, and have been found by the court to be in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights on a number of occasions.  For example, Senator Norris was granted a judgment by the court and legislation was introduced a number of years later to address the issues it raised.  In addition, there was the case of the Well Woman Advice Centres, and the Keegan case, which this legislation seeks to address.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which will change those aspects of the Adoption Act, 1991, which have given rise to difficulties.  They should lead to the recognition of adoption orders in a number of foreign countries.  Difficulties have arisen because while there are two different types of adoption processes in many countries, our law recognises one procedure and not the other.</P>
      <P>The initial impetus to produce a Bill to address this situation arose because of the problems with Chinese adoptions, which were highlighted on a television programme, and the subsequent move by Deputy Woods to introduce a Bill in the other House to address the difficulties being experienced by people to have Chinese children legally adopted in this country.</P>
      <P>However, the issue is wider than this.  Parents have had difficulties with Paraguayan adoptions. We have all been lobbied by members of that group and I welcome the efforts being made by the Minister to address their difficulties and concerns in having their adoptions recognised here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not only in adoptions of children from China and Paraguay that difficulties have arisen. I have had many representations from a couple <Col N="208" /> in my constituency who were interested in adopting a child from Thailand, as were other couples throughout the country.  That is because the number of children being placed for adoption here is so low that couples who would normally consider adopting children have been forced to go abroad. I welcome the fact that so few children are being put up for adoption and that women feel they are in a position to keep their children.  None of us wishes to go back to the past when many women felt that their only option was to place a child for adoption.  For many of them it was an extremely difficult decision that they made in the best interests of the child, but the fact that it is acceptable now for a single mother to keep a child rather than give it up for adoption is welcome.</P>
    <P>In relation to the couple from my constituency attempting to organise an adoption in Thailand, it is unfair that many couples go through all the procedures, such as exploring the possibility of adoption in a particular country and getting investigated by social services here as to their suitability, only to discover that they will never be able to legally adopt a child from a certain country because that country's adoption laws are not in accordance with ours.  Such couples should be informed at the beginning of the process that there is no possibility of a child brought back by them from another country attaining the status of a child adopted in this country or of a child adopted in a country whose adoption procedures we recognise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>They are informed but many ignore it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I found this extraordinary.  The Adoption Board should inform parents in the beginning that there is no point pursuing an adoption in a certain country because it will not have legal status here.  In the case in my constituency, the couple discovered that, in order for the adoption to be granted in Thailand, they needed confirmation that the child could be legally adopted here.  Because adopted children in Thailand retain inheritance rights from their natural parents, this meant there was no full and final break from the natural parents and the child could not be legally adopted here.  That prevented children from being brought here and it was heartbreaking for these couples to discover this after two years of following the procedures.  I found that provision on inheritance rights extraordinary as anyone who has to put their child up for adoption will probably not have much for that child to inherit.  I sympathised greatly with the couples involved.</P>
      <P>Maybe, as the Minister of State said, they are told this in the beginning but in this case I understand they were not, only discovering the problem at the end of the process.  I welcome the provisions being introduced in this complex situation and I appreciate the Minister of State's efforts, particularly in trying to resolve the Paraguayan situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> The second part of the Bill concerns the Keegan judgment from the European Court of Human Rights.  The recognition of the legal rights of fathers is a welcome development.  With every right there is a responsibility and encouraging fathers to avail of their rights and responsibilities is very worthwhile and should be encouraged.  It is very important that both parents are involved in rearing their children.  Until recently, most lone parents were women; it was rare for the unmarried, natural father to bring up a child.  That natural fathers are interested in bringing up their children is to be welcomed and it is important we recognise in law the rights of the natural father.</P>
    <P>We spoke of the blessing and joy of children. That is why we sympathise with childless couples. They have problems because of the shortage of children for adoption here and the difficulties adopting children abroad.  We can also understand a father who is legally removed from any involvement in the upbringing of his child.  It is difficult for two parents to bring up children so it must be extremely difficult for a lone man or woman.  Therefore it is important to recognise in law that both have the right to be involved as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to the adoption contact register to assist adoptees and birth parents who wish to contact each other and his development of proposals in this regard. Maybe he could inform us when this will be in place.  It is an issue on which many Members have been lobbied, particularly by adults who were adopted as children and who have had great difficulty in tracing their natural parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there are difficulties but this is a very important matter and the proposals should be brought forward quickly.  I welcome the amendments to the 1991 Act which are designed to introduce greater flexibility into our statutory system for the recognition of foreign adoptions.  These will be warmly welcomed by people who wish to adopt in countries whose laws provide for the termination of adoptions, and I appreciate the Minister of State's efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will have a quick passage.  It has been awaited for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  It is very timely but it is a pity it was introduced in the aftermath of a very squalid case which involved the violation of the human rights of some of the parties involved.  I can only begin to imagine the feelings of Mr. Keegan, who, having cohabited with a woman with the apparent desire to marry her and produce offspring, then found that their child was taken without his consent or knowledge and placed for adoption so that he lost contact with it.  That loss of human contact is a gross violation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> Over the past week or two we heard a similar but worse story of an Irish man living in America whose wife suffered from depression. Apparently they had everything &mdash; he had a good job, she had a nice home.  While suffering from depression she, without any prior indication, booked herself into an abortion clinic from where she rang him to say that his child had been destroyed.  It is clear that the feelings of that man were very strong.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what my colleague Senator Honan said about the feelings of fathers towards their children which are not often recognised.  I am glad this legislation will recognise these rights.  It is important that we develop our sensitivity towards people's human rights.  One of the delightful things about moral development is the number of young fathers one sees with their papooses slung over their shoulders in supermarkets. This balanced parenting is good for the psychological and social development of the children.</P>
    <P>I strongly support Senator Honan's call for an adoption register.  The Minister said he is awaiting a Supreme Court judgment in this matter and presumably this inhibits any immediate development. However, I hope there will be development. I have been contacted by a large number of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going ahead with the contact register on a voluntary basis.  However, there are other questions in relation to birth certificates, etc., and I will be in a better position to make my mind up when I have the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that additional information. I have been contacted by friends, one of whom is a married woman with children.  I did not realise she was adopted but late one evening under generous influences she poured her heart out to me and was extremely interested in discovering who her parents were.  On my desk I have a letter which arrived in the last couple of days from a young man in Cork who has exactly the same feeling that it is necessary to his sense of identity that he should have some information about his natural birth parents.</P>
      <P>The principal thing I want to address, and it has not been addressed to the extent I would like, is foreign adoptions, particularly Paraguayan adoptions.  The Minister addressed this matter in his speech but for legal reasons a final solution, if that is not an unhelpful phraseology, is being deferred in anticipation of advice from Paraguayan lawyers with expertise in family law.</P>
      <P>I wish to place on the record views that have been expressed very coherently by a group of people concerned with Paraguayan adoption.  I am not sure whether the Minister has this developed text:</P>
      <P>In its <i>Report on the Recognition of Foreign Adoption Decrees</i> the Law Reform Commission noted that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> Numerous legal consequences flow from the recognition or non-recognition of an adoption order.  Upon the validity of an adoption order may depend such matters as entitlement to exercise parental rights.  The rights and liabilities of an adopted person in relation to such matters as succession, maintenance and taxation may also be an issue.</P>
    <P>This is fundamental as it clearly indicates that central rights are affected by this question, rights which it is appropriate for Parliament to address.</P>
    <P>Adoption decree non-recognition denies the child growing up in this country the Irish citizenship his or her parents hold.</P>
    <P>This matter was drawn to my attention by a graduate of Trinity College who found himself in this situation about eight or nine years ago.  With his help I framed a piece of legislation which travelled a very small way down the legislative road before being stymied.  For that reason I have a particular interest in this matter.  The communication continues:</P>
    <P>The parents cannot put their son or daughter on their passports: even within the European Union the child cannot travel with his or her parents without having obtained entry visas for almost every member state visited.</P>
    <P>That is an absolute curse even in economic terms. I have heard economists say that one of the difficulties with currency and people advocating European Monetary Union is that if you take £100 and travel from Dublin to London, Paris, Brussels, etc., you have only £57/17/6 remaining. It is the same process of attrition that is inflicted on the parents of adopted children if they have to get all these extra visas instead of being able to put them on the passport.  The text continues: &ldquo;The child may have difficulty obtaining medical care or access to education because of his or her status&rdquo;.  This is something to which we should be particularly sensitive because it is precisely the situation in which Irish illegal immigrants in New York find themselves.  It is a very vulnerable position in which to be placed.</P>
    <P>Non-recognition also subjects the child to a penal tax liability on any inheritance he or she receives from his or her parents.  There are Irish families today that the law splits down the middle, making strangers of brothers and sisters by recognising one child's adoption in state X while denying recognition to another child's adoption in state Y.  [In other words, there is an absence of that well known and beloved platitude of politicians, the level playing field.]</P>
    <P>By providing for the establishment by the Adoption Board of a Register of Foreign Adoptions, the Adoption Act, 1991, put in place a procedure through which formal recognition could be extended in this State to an adoption order obtained in a foreign jurisdiction. But an entry can only be made in this <Col N="212" /> Register if the decree of the foreign state complies with all the conditions of the definition of a &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; contained in section 1 of the 1991 Act.  Some or all of the adoption decrees issued in approximately 20 foreign states are currently denied registration by the Adoption Board on grounds of non-compliance. I have been contacted by a group of families with children adopted in Paraguay which is one of these states.  As a result of the Adoption Board's stance, these parents find themselves living in a legal limbo subject to the legal degradations and disabilities to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals &ldquo;to address the difficulties that have emerged in the operation of the 1991 Act&rdquo; are contained in the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, which has been passed by the Dáil....  On Minister Austin Currie's own admission these proposals open registration to only a small minority of countries whose decrees are currently unrecognised because they continue to treat &ldquo;simple adoptions&rdquo; as being unworthy of recognition.  As he stated at Committee Stage to the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs on 2 October 1996:</P>
    <P>The effect of the recognition of a foreign adoption here is to accord it the same legal status as an Irish adoption order.  This means that the child is regarded in law as a child of the adopters as if the child was born to them within marriage.  It follows from this that the legal effect of the foreign adoption must be broadly similar to that of an Irish adoption. It must have similar characteristics to an Irish adoption order in terms of the termination and creation of parental rights and duties.  However, this is not the case where a simple or ordinary adoption is concerned since such an adoption does not extinguish the legal relationship between the child and the birth parents.</P>
    <P>In other words, this concerns the extinguishing of the relationship between the birth parents and the child and the creation of a new relationship between the adopted child and the adopting parents.</P>
    <P>To establish whether this statement is correct in the case of Paraguay we [the Parents of Adopted Paraguayan Children] have made inquiries in South America as to the exact legal effect produced by a simple adoption granted in that state.  The legal advice we have received appears at least to show that the Department of Health and the Adoption Board had not gone deeply enough into the subject and were wrong.</P>
    <P>[I should add as a footnote the following observation:] Countries with codified systems of law on the French model frequently possess two types of adoption &mdash; the plenary and the simple.  By contrast, Irish law, in common with that of other countries which have an Anglo-Saxon legal heritage, provides for only one <Col N="213" /> kind (the plenary).  In Paraguay only orphaned and abandoned children are eligible for plenary adoption: the simple form of decree is mandatory in the case of children whose birth parent(s) have consented to their placement for adoption.</P>
    <P>The true position, we are advised, is as follows: a Paraguayan simple adoption has substantially the same legal effect as an Irish adoption order with regard to, first, the creation of a relationship between the adopted child and the adoptive parents and, second, the termination of a relationship between the adopted child and the birth parents.</P>
    <P>With regard to the creation of a relationship between adoptive parents and the adopted child, our inquiries confirm that all Paraguayan adoptions &mdash; whether simple or plenary &mdash; create a family relationship between the adopted person and the adoptive parent(s): that is, they confer the position of a matrimonial child of the family upon the adopted person.  Under both forms of adoption other children of the adoptive parents, including adopted children, are siblings of the adopted child [and are recognised as such].  Thus a similarity of legal effect criterion is satisfied under this heading.</P>
    <P>With regard to the termination of the relationship between the adopted child and the birth parents a difference does exist between plenary and Paraguayan simple adoptions. There are &ldquo;rights and duties of the blood relationship&rdquo; not extinguished by simple adoption. These concern inheritance procedure [which is one of the factors to which I referred]. Whether adopted under the plenary or the simple Paraguayan form, the adopted child inherits from its adoptive parents as a matrimonial child.  This inheritance passes to the child's descendants if he or she predeceases his or her adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>It is not usual for children to predecease their parents and is relatively uncommon but it can happen, so it must be catered for.</P>
    <P>Where the simple adoption's unextinguished blood relationship arises is in the situation where a deceased child's heirs or his or her parents: the governing principle of this situation is that the deceased child's estate is divided equally between the adoptive parents and the blood parents [which seems fair enough].  (Such a principle either could not or should not govern the child adopted under the plenary form since, as we noted earlier, that child has been adopted in this way because it has been orphaned or abandoned.)  [In other words, the neglect of the child or mischance which has befallen the parents extinguishes the rights of the parents.]  Unterminated birth parents rights thus exist only in relation to what is in practical terms a remote set of multiple contingencies (the child pre-deceasing its parents and leaving no heirs with precedence over its parents in an <Col N="214" /> intestacy situation).  Moreover, these rights are brought into play only by the death of the child. Such a divergence between the plenary and the simple forms of adoption creates no reasonable ground for denying recognition to the latter: the similarity of legal effect between Irish adoption and Paraguayan simple adoption remains overwhelming in spite of it.  [While this groups accepts there is a divergence, it is saying the degree of divergence is marginal but, in legal terms, the degree of convergence is overwhelming.]</P>
    <P>After we brought new information on the legal effects of Paraguayan simple adoption to Mr. Currie's attention, the Minister wrote to us on 17 December 1996 that &ldquo;his Department is in the process of obtaining a comprehensive legal opinion from a lawyer in Paraguay [the opinion to which I referred earlier] with expertise in adoption law on certain aspects of that law.  It is expected that this opinion will be available shortly.  If this brings to light new information which is in conflict with our present understanding of the nature of ordinary adoptions, then the matter will be examined further.&rdquo;  The question of how the range of practical problems that stem from non-recognition might be resolved is also, Minister Currie informed us, being considered by an Interdepartmental Committee on Paraguayan Adoptions.</P>
    <P>We welcome these initiatives by the Minister. If available, a straightforward solution is to be preferred to a complicated alternative and the practical difficulties arising from non-recognition of our decrees would be removed if recognition were to be extended under the legislative proposals the Seanad will be considering.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is awaiting advice from the Paraguayan lawyer.  Perhaps he will inform the House of the likely time frame in which this advice will be made available and how it will affect the progress of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I, as I gather other Members have, been asked to establish the Minister's position on the recognition of Paraguayan simple adoptions.  I ask him to declare categorically to the House whether these adoptions will be recognised under section 10.  The clear legal advice which has been received by those who briefed me on this matter is that they should be entered in the register of foreign adoptions.  That seems to be the nub of the case.  They have substantially the same legal effect as an Irish adoption and it has never been suggested that total compatibility in nature and effect between Irish and foreign decrees should be a requirement for recognition.</P>
    <P>I notice my distinguished colleague, Senator Maloney, perusing the same document.  I hope I have not inflicted a second, third or fourth performance of this work on the House but it was so well argued and follows closely on what the Minister said, I thought it was useful to place the detail of the argument on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions.  I am heartened by the support the House has given to the objectives of the Bill. As I explained earlier, the legislation is specifically designed to address the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case and certain difficulties which have emerged in the operation of the Adoption Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>The important new procedures provided for in the Bill for consulting the fathers of non-marital children being proposed for adoption are a necessary legislative response to the European Court judgment.  They reflect the important developments which have taken place in Irish adoption practice since the Keegan case was determined by our courts in 1990.  These measures will bring our domestic adoption laws in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.  While nobody could give a cast-iron guarantee that a child would never again be placed for adoption without the knowledge of a father who has established family ties similar to those established by Mr. Keegan, the enactment of the new provisions will minimise the likelihood of this happening in the future.</P>
      <P>In this context and in response to a point made by Senator Mulcahy, I attach great importance to the new statutory right that a father will have to formally notify the Adoption Board of his wish to be consulted regarding the proposal to have the child adopted.  This will help to ease the burden on adoption agencies and, in certain cases, the Adoption Board to ascertain the identity of fathers, particularly where the mother is unable or unwilling to disclose his identity.  As a father may exercise this right before the birth of the child, this puts the 21 day time limit on a father who has been consulted into context.  Senator Mulcahy asked whether 21 days would be sufficient. Senator Henry pointed out that the father's partner would have been pregnant for nine months and, in those circumstances, 21 days is sufficient.</P>
      <P>As I have acknowledged, the introduction of a consultation process will give rise to some delays in the placement of children for adoption.  This is unavoidable in the circumstances.  However, I am sure Senators will agree it is clearly in the interests of the child, the birth parents and the prospective adoptive parents that any question or doubt as to the child's availability for adoption should be resolved conclusively before the child is placed.  In any discussion on adoption, especially foreign adoption, the element of certainty is extremely important because doubts can cause considerable difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> Senator Mulcahy expressed concern about the circumstances in which a father would not be consulted about the proposed placement of a child for adoption.  Generally speaking, the adoption agency concerned must apply to the Adoption Board for authority to proceed with the placement and the board is not likely to give such an authorisation unless it is satisfied, on the basis of cogent evidence presented to it by the agency, that reasonable grounds exist for dispensing with the requirement to consult the father.  The only circumstances in which the authority of the Adoption Board will not be received is where the mother is unable to identify the father and makes a statutory declaration to that effect.</P>
    <P>As to foreign adoptions, the amendments to the Adoption Act, 1991, are designed to introduce greater flexibility into the statutory recognition system.  Under that Act the Adoption Board has a central role in examining the adoption laws of various countries in order to establish whether adoptions effected under them are entitled to be recognised under Irish law.  In light of the Supreme Court ruling on 25 July last that Chinese adoptions qualify for recognition under the 1991 Act, the Adoption Board re-examined the adoption laws of a number of countries which it had previously considered not to be compatible with the definition of a foreign adoption contained in that Act.  It was for that reason I advised Senator Mulcahy that his list was out of date.  Arising from its review, the board considers that adoptions effected in Thailand and Liberia also qualify for recognition in light of the Supreme Court ruling. A decision on Guatemala and Peru has been deferred pending receipt by the board of a legal opinion from a practising lawyer in each of those countries.</P>
    <P>The board is understandably reluctant to publish a list of countries whose adoptions would be entitled to recognition by virtue of section 10 of the Bill in advance of its enactment.  However, the chairman of the board has indicated to my Department that, subject to legal opinion being obtained, the board may be in a position to recognise adoptions granted in Rwanda and South Korea.</P>
    <P>In reply to those Senators who spoke about the problems encountered by Irish couples who have adopted children abroad under simple adoption decrees, in particular, Senator Norris, Senator Quinn and Senator Doyle, who posed questions about the difficulties encountered by couples adopting children from Paraguay, I would like it to be understood and accepted that I am doing everything possible to find a solution.  I have enormous sympathy for couples who are in this position.  Acquiring a passport is apparently a major problem and other matters have arisen in that context.</P>
    <P>For this reason, I referred the issue to the Cabinet committee on children, the ideal body to which to refer matters of this nature.  Not only does it include the Departments for which I have responsibility &mdash; the Department of Education, <Col N="217" /> the Department of Health and the Department of Justice &mdash; it contains representation from the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Foreign Affairs, whose input is crucial as regards passports just as input from the Department of Justice is crucial as regards visas.  I chair the Cabinet committee on children and those Departments are looking with considerable urgency into these matters.  I have instructed the committee that I want these problems resolved as quickly as possible.  I assure Senators that to the extent that I can expedite this matter, get to the root of the problems and find a solution I am doing so and I do not think anyone could do more in this respect.</P>
    <P>However, as in all these cases, I must remember that I am Minister of State with responsibility for children and my paramount consideration is the interests of the child.  While I have the greatest sympathy for couples who, for whatever reason, do not have children of their own and wish to adopt, I know where my responsibility lies.  In response to Senator Honan, before these people brought children into the country they were warned that problems with simple adoptions, for example, were likely to arise, so they cannot say they were not aware of them.  I must now pick up the tab &mdash; I do not mind doing so &mdash; and I am determined to find a solution.  Senator Honan stated that the welfare of the child was our primary consideration and said couples should be warned at the beginning; as far as I am concerned, that happened in the case of Paraguay.</P>
    <P>Senators may not be aware that two options are available to adoptive parents who are in the unfortunate position of needing to regularise their legal status.  It is open to Irish residents who have been granted a simple adoption decree abroad to make an application to the Adoption Board for an Irish adoption order in respect of the child.  This option is available in any case where an adoption effected abroad does not qualify for recognition.  A number of countries, including Paraguay, which operate dual systems of adoption make provision in their laws for the conversion of simple adoptions into full adoptions. In acknowledgement of this fact and in order to facilitate adopters who pursue this possibility, I brought forward a Committee Stage amendment in the Dáil to provide for the retrospective recognition of simple adoptions which are converted into full adoptions in the countries where they were granted.  This amendment now forms part of section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Quinn, I am willing to make the opinion of the Paraguayan lawyer available to parents who adopted children there.  As I explained, clarification of certain aspects of the opinion is awaited.  When this comes to hand, I will arrange for the opinion to be transmitted to the group representing Parents of Adopted Paraguayan Children.  I want to be as helpful as possible with regard to all these matters.  I share the <Col N="218" /> concern expressed by Senator Doyle and Senator Honan that prospective adoptive parents should be made aware before they travel abroad that certain adoptions do not qualify for recognition here.  The Adoption Board and the adoption agencies do caution couples against adopting children in countries whose adoptions are not compatible with ours.  A list of such countries has been prepared by the Adoption Board and has been widely circulated.  Support groups for adoptive parents, such as the Irish Foreign Adoption Group, also play an important role in advising couples.</P>
    <P>I have taken note of the comments made by Senator Henry and Senator Norris about the need for transparency in the adoption process in relation to unfavourable decisions.  I will bring these valid points to the attention of the Adoption Board.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate.  I am sorry I have not been able to pay more attention to the document from which Senator Norris quoted large extracts.  In spite of the fact that every Senator appears to have a copy of this document, one was not available to me. That seems strange considering that I am the Minister of State with responsibility for changing the law in this area and I am making a very serious effort to find a solution to these problems.</P>
    <P>The debate has been a constructive one on an important Bill which represents a significant step forward in the development of Irish adoption law. I look forward to the Bill's progression through the House with maximum co-operation and in as short a time as possible.</P>

      <P>This is the first time we have debated in full one of the reports of the National Economic and Social Forum.  The setting up of the NESF was a remarkable achievement by the <Col N="219" /> Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.  It brought various strands of the community, including voluntary groups, business, agriculture, trade unions and public representatives, together to debate a wide range of issues.  The NESF report number 11 is entitled Early School Leavers and Youth Unemployment.</P>
      <P>To set the tone of the debate I wish to quote some statistics contained in the report.  CSO data for the period 1992-1995 indicates that the youth unemployment rate is almost twice that of the adult rate.  Some 85 per cent of early school leavers now come from working class origins or from small farms.  Some 55 per cent are from families where the father is also unemployed.</P>
      <P>The report reveals that single motherhood is highly concentrated among the unqualified and those with a poor labour market history.  Some 25 per cent of all suicides are in the 15 to 24 age group, and 90 per cent of those are male.  Of all those seeking treatment for drug abuse, 54 per cent are in their teenage years.</P>
      <P>The report paints a picture of multiple disadvantage and the one thing they have in common is that they left school early and are unemployed. It is no secret, therefore, that the most disadvantaged are those with few, if any, formal qualifications.</P>
      <P>Young people leaving school without educational qualifications are most likely to become unemployed, ending up in long-term unemployment. What is needed, therefore, is to keep them in education and essentially to make sure that this education is relevant to their situation, skills and job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Government policy is totally committed to the achievement of these aims.  A key target of the White Paper on Education is that by the year 2000, 90 per cent of those commencing second level education will complete the senior cycle. This is vital in the face of what is called the &ldquo;qualification inflation&rdquo; of the last decade.</P>
      <P>The NESF report emphasises that there has been significant qualification inflation for most occupations, even unskilled ones, and a significant upgrading of the desired employee profile. This, of course, highlights the need to ensure that young people have the skills to compete in the employment market.  It also emphasises the fact that job creation must be to the fore of Government policy.  Where job scarcity is a feature of the employment market, qualification inflation will occur.  That means the simplest jobs will go to those who have most qualifications.  It stands to reason, therefore, that the more jobs there are available, the better chance there is for those with less qualifications to secure them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is on the right track and is dedicated to job creation.  Current economic policies have resulted in a reduction in unemployment levels.  Since the end of 1994, unemployment has fallen by 31,000.  The forum found there had been a 4.5 per cent reduction in the rate of youth unemployment between 1994 and 1995. <Col N="220" /> However, that reduction applies to a high figure and the problem must be continuously examined to ensure that the reduction not only continues at this rate but accelerates so that by the year 2020 we will no longer have this problem.  Hopefully, there will be no early school leavers then and we will have tackled the problem of those who have left school early.</P>
    <P>Some of the problems that confront young people who leave school early are attributable to their low educational qualifications.  However, that is not the only factor.  Sometimes early school leavers are confronted by employers who have negative views of the area from which they come. This can mean that despite their qualifications, such young people are not selected for the jobs that are available.  In this context, I pay tribute to the work of the local employment service in trying to match employers with young job seekers in the area.  Too often, even in rural Ireland, factories open in areas of high unemployment but few people from the area secure jobs in them.  More often one sees workers commuting to the factories, bypassing houses where young people with relevant qualifications live.  There is a need for the local employment service to be extended throughout the country so young people with skills in various areas can be matched with the jobs that are available in those areas.</P>
    <P>As young people get older unemployment can become a habit.  They can settle into a pattern of unemployment.  I support the NESF report's recommendation to overcome this problem, that places be made available on community employment schemes for people between the ages of 18 and 21 years, especially those with low educational qualifications.  That will enable them to break the habit of being unemployed and get them into the workforce.  Sometimes the social welfare system, which is necessary, becomes a slight disincentive to seeking employment.  The longer a person is unemployed, the more negative the impression an employer has of the person.</P>
    <P>The number of people in the youthreach programme must be increased.  Youthreach, by specifically targeting people who have left school early, providing them with almost an alternative form of education and with confidence and job skills, is vital in overcoming the problems young people face when trying to enter the employment market.</P>
    <P>The report, in its conclusions, clearly summarises the situation.  It states:</P>
    <P>The key principle underlying the Forum's analysis of the problem of Early School Leavers and Youth Unemployment is that the link between educational disadvantage and subsequent poor labour market experience and life-chances must be clearly acknowledged... The Forum's analysis of the characteristics of early school leavers show that:</P>
    <P>those who leave school with primary qualifications only are most at risk of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment; <Col N="221" /> around 90 per cent of poor households are headed by early school leavers;</P>
    <P>the social origin of early leavers is very pronounced with 75 per cent of leavers coming from working class origin or small farms; 55 per cent of early leavers come from families where the fathers are unemployed;</P>
    <P>more boys than girls are likely to leave school early;</P>
    <P>Traveller children are among those most likely to leave early, with only around 5 per cent of Traveller children aged between 12 and 15 years attending mainstream second level schools;</P>
    <P>young women who leave early are more likely to withdraw from the jobs markets and to marry early or to be single parents with children;</P>
    <P>the earnings differential between those with no qualifications compared to those with qualifications is large and remains so over time; and</P>
    <P>rural areas have the highest level of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>We will proceed later to show how the forum's recommendations can and should be put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the submissions and recommendations of the report.  A great deal of research has been conducted in this area.  I conducted research on this matter for my masters degree in 1993.  My research dealt with the problem of drop-outs, unemployment and the perceptions of both.  I based much of my research on earlier research.  Since then we have had the educational research centre report of December, 1995, the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; report of May, 1996 which sought to identify disadvantaged areas and tried to provide supports in those areas, an EU evaluation report under the Department of Enterprise and Employment of February, 1996, which discussed early school leaving and was combined with the anti-poverty strategy, and the Forfás report &ldquo;Facing our Future&rdquo; which contained many sections dealing with the drop-outs in society.</P>
      <P>We are not short of knowledge, information and research in this area.  Although it is aspirational, I welcome the work that has been done by every sector of the forum to compile its worthwhile No. 11 report.  It is excellent.  However, what do we do now?  We have the information in the report.  Why are people dropping out of society?  We must go back further and examine how we can break the cycle.  Most drop-outs come from backgrounds where there are generations of unemployment.  They do not know anything else. They are coming from backgrounds where it is difficult even to get children to attend school at the age of four years and to work within a normal school structure and timetable.  That must be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> There are various points of entry into the system and one of them is entry to primary school. We must get to children when they are four years of age and provide the necessary props in terms of remedial and one-to-one teaching and a psychological service.  The Department of Education has only 37 psychologists.  Of that number, 12 educational psychologists are allocated to primary schools while 25 are allocated to post-primary schools.  How can we say we have a proper service for children of a young age?</P>
    <P>I maintain that the props of remedial teaching, early assessment, the district approach, where parents work with their offspring on their education and understand what is involved, and home schooling must be put in place.  I welcome the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative which has been implemented in a few areas.  However, yesterday I phoned three disadvantaged schools in north Dublin and asked if they were part of this initiative.  To my surprise, they were not.  I know the students in those primary schools and there will two or three dropouts from them next year. There is no doubt about that because I have done my research.  The problem lies at primary level and must be tackled at that early stage.  If psychological services, a one to one approach and the district approach are implemented at an early stage, they will go a long way to preventing dropping out at 11 or 12.</P>
    <P>There was the sad example in Cork last week of a young boy of 11 losing his life because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Last weekend, a number of strange incidents occurred in this city which are again the result of children dropping out.  These children have nothing else to do and nowhere to go so they naturally become involved in the subculture of drugs resulting in the eventual breakdown of law and order.</P>
    <P>We must reallocate our resources.  We have already sufficiently facilitated the advantaged by abolishing third level fees.  It is difficult to be aware of children who come from dysfunctional backgrounds if there are 20 or 30 children in a classroom.  There should be remedial teachers, reduced class numbers and one teacher per class in every primary school so that it would be easier for teachers to be aware of and detect problems. Children drop out of school at about 11 or 12.  I compliment primary teachers for the superb job they do in keeping these children at school as long as that.  When these children go to post primary school, they are assessed because they have problems.  After a couple of months, they drop out.</P>
    <P>I will give a case study.  I am handling a dropout case at the moment who was psychologically assessed, underwent remedial teaching, had a poor school attendance record and had to go to court as a result.  The presiding judge wanted the teachers involved to attend and make a report. He also called for an inspector from the Department of Education.  The Department was not able to do anything for that child.  It had no residential place in which to put him.  The judge adjourned <Col N="223" /> the case for two weeks to give the Department time to deal with the case.  That is the latest example I can cite.  Many similar children need residential care from Monday to Friday to help them.</P>
    <P>A full debate is needed on the role of FÁS in this.  If children leave school and drop out of the system at 13 or 14, there is a gap in services at that age.  No one can handle them and there is nowhere for them to go.  They are still supposed to be part of the education system until the age of 15.  The Education Acts give the impression that other agencies should not intervene and I ask for that to be reviewed.  Youthreach tries to intervene but is limited in what it can do as there is no co-ordination between the school system and the agency.  I do not understand why FÁS cannot become involved in these situations by working with schools in some kind of hands-on education and training programme.</P>
    <P>Even if one is older than 15 and wants to re-enter the education and training system, that reentry is on a competitive basis.  FÁS accepts applicants on the condition that they have five passes in the junior certificate, among other things, after which applicants must undergo an aptitude test to see if they are suitable for a course.  There are no suitable courses for those who wish to re-enter the system.</P>
    <P>CERT is another prime example.  It will not accept applicants until they are 17 or 18 years old. Excellent courses could be available through CERT for those who drop out and are unemployed but it will not entertain them.  Qualifications are again necessary before one can enter any of the courses.  I ask that the role of FÁS and CERT be revamped.</P>
    <P>Support systems must be implemented where they are needed most, at pre-primary level.  These systems must be organised on a district approach. There is a crisis in the community where structures are breaking down and, unless we break that cycle, we are simply throwing good money after bad.  It is not always a question of money but of a reallocation of professional resources.  The numbers in some schools are dropping so teachers will become available to be reallocated to help in crisis areas.  Much work must be done in this area and I would like the Minister for Education to reallocate resources to help the disadvantaged. The earlier we start, the better chance there is of helping the dropouts to re-enter the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this topic this evening.  Senator Kelly has given a good background to this issue.  She was a member of the National Economic and Social Forum and would have an inside knowledge of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a difficult and awkward problem to deal with.  Those of us with backgrounds in education appreciate how difficult it is to break the vicious circle nature of disadvantage.  All of us would have had many instances during our teaching <Col N="224" /> careers where we would have tried to motivate someone who was quite intelligent but from a disadvantaged background and would have failed and felt bad about that.</P>
    <P>Everything is stacked against people from disadvantaged backgrounds and most early school leavers we encounter are from disadvantaged backgrounds.  How does one motivate youngsters who come from houses where there is no appreciation of education and no library of books in the corner of the kitchen?  How does one come to terms with this?  It is easy to talk about throwing resources at the problem but I am not sure that we will ever obtain the key to unlock this door. I have spent many years teaching and running a secondary school and I do not know if we will ever find a solution to this vicious problem. However, we must try to do so and the approach adopted by all Ministers with an input into this matter is a good one.</P>
    <P>There is a financial dimension to this problem. In many households youngsters of a certain age are expected to earn money.  Once they get money into their hands their instinct is to keep earning.  Money gives them a status which they wish to continue enjoying.  This leads them to leave school early and their parents are happy about this because they do not put a strain on the family purse.  A framework evolves which temporarily solves a financial problem for the household.</P>
    <P>They then discover that those with low levels of skills do not get a good return on their efforts and when they reach 18 years of age they discover that they can receive £90 or £95 a week from the dole if they have a flat, regardless of whether they work.  Many of these young people end up getting £65 dole, a supplement for a flat of, perhaps, £25 and a fuel allowance in the winter.  If they are employed, they are in low added-value jobs because of their lack of skills.  Such a job would pay them just over £100 a week, out of which tax and PRSI would be deducted, leaving them with less than £90.  The wound continues to fester and there is no motivation for them to find employment. Once they reach their early 20s it is impossible to get them out of this frame of mind.  This scenario exists in rural towns.  People living in the inner cities realise that the problems I have outlined are not as bad as those which they experience but we have major problems.</P>
    <P>How do we motivate parents to encourage their children to stay in school for the maximum length of time?  Home schooling would help but every teacher knows that the very parents one needs to speak to do not turn up for parent-teacher meetings.  These parents show the least response to any initiatives because of their own circumstances.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where people who wandered through life without skills, education or confidence joined a FÁS course or a community employment scheme and discovered that they have an aptitude for some area.  These people were motivated, they returned to steady employment <Col N="225" /> and improved themselves in every way.  It is wonderful to see this but for every such case there are 99 others who do not undergo such a change.  These cases are the problem.  We must continue to urge people to stay in school for the maximum length of time.  This means that, even though the curriculum has changed dramatically over the past few years, we must continue to examine it.  If these students complete a leaving certificate after five years it will have a relative value to them.  If we can keep students in school until they complete their leaving certificate we will have achieved something because the school environment motivates students.  It is often the case that a student's peers will have a more positive influence on them than their teachers or parents.</P>
    <P>It is very frustrating for children when they feel that they cannot learn.  No one wants to be put down in front of their peers.  Many students opt out because of embarrassment and shame &mdash; they cannot handle the simple tasks of reading, spelling and addition, the three Rs although perhaps there is now a fourth one, computer training. They dodge subjects and play truant.</P>
    <P>The problem is a multifaceted one and there must be a multifaceted approach to solving it.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate and thank the Minister for her commitment to this and related issues during her period of office.  I welcome the report, although its recommendations are not sufficiently focused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The message in the report which has been reinforced in this debate is that being uneducated and unqualified almost certainly means being unemployable.  The report gives statistics on the number of long-term unemployed who have no qualifications beyond primary level.  The report should have gone a step further and shown the difference between early school leavers with qualifications and those without them in terms of the total number of long-term unemployed.  This was done three or four years ago and it showed, to nobody's surprise, that over 50 per cent of the long-term unemployed had no qualifications beyond primary level.  At that stage our unemployment rate was 18 per cent.  It was pointed out that the 50 per cent constituted a core group who, in the long term, would be unemployable.  Thankfully, in the meantime the unemployment rate has decreased to approximately 12 to 12.5 per cent. There will be a time when it will reach a minimum point beyond which the Minister cannot go, no matter what strategies are put in place.  I use a rough rule of thumb: where the number of children who leave primary education without proper numeracy and literacy skills &mdash; plus 50 per cent &mdash; is a figure below which the unemployment rate will never go.  There was a debate in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s as regards ROSLA &mdash; the raising of the school leaving age.  We are now talking about keeping children in school rather than raising the school entry age.  There was a <Col N="226" /> time when 14, 15, and 16 year olds could leave school without qualifications and get menial jobs, which were plentiful.  People do not seem to understand that those jobs are no longer there. On the other hand, there are important people in Irish life who bemoan the fact that these jobs have been exported to the Far East, Africa and the Third World.  These jobs are no loss whatsoever because nobody in this country aspires for their children to sit on an assembly line or spend their lives doing menial tasks done by previous generations.  The jobs are not there and if they were, they would not be done.  At any level of employment, qualifications are required.  This is the key to the problem.</P>
    <P>We must look closely at the background of those who are unemployed.  What have they in common and in what way do they relate to each other and to problems in society?  That is dealt with in part by the report.  The long-term unemployed, drug addicts and the potential prison population have at least two things in common. One is that they tend to come from the same areas.  This is not a party point, we all share this view.  It does not matter who is in Government, who has aspirations to be in Government or who is independent and will never be in Government &mdash; we all have to share responsibility for the fact that by looking at a persons' address or home background we can certainly say what way they are likely to turn out.  By looking at their address we can say there is a 50 per cent chance that they will go to a primary school which is under-resourced, that they might get into post-primary, that they will certainly leave without qualifications, will eventually be unemployed, may turn out to be drug addicts and may finish up in prison.</P>
    <P>In a debate in this House about six years ago, I said there are parts of this city where the State would save money on prison spaces by building a wall around them.  We are doing the same thing by taking people from a ghetto, putting them in prison and doing nothing in between.  Perhaps that is a simplification &mdash; we are doing things in between, but just not enough.</P>
    <P>The second thing these people have in common is that they all go to their local primary school. Therefore, the primary school can prove to be the conduit through which we can begin to address societal problems.  The pupil who is a failure &mdash; a term which people use in assessing students &mdash; in the primary sector will certainly not do any better at post-primary level.  They will leave without any qualifications and will then have hardly any chance of finding employment.</P>
    <P>The emphasis of the executive summary of the report, although the report itself is different, is on the second chance.  Second chance should be second choice and first chance should be first choice. We should look at what is going on in those cases.  The child who leaves primary school without the basics of reading and writing is almost certainly unemployable.  It is no use taking that child, who has problems in numeracy and literacy, <Col N="227" /> enrolling them on amazing state of the art training courses by FÁS or CERT or any of the other groups, giving them the glossiest of material and the best of overheads and locations, if they cannot make sense of what is put in front of them. They can only participate in those training courses if they have the basic skills of reading and writing.</P>
    <P>We must begin by dealing with the long-term unemployed, and the first step must be to stop the problem recreating itself generation after generation with no attempt made to stop it.  We should get to the source of the problem.  We must begin by investing in basic education, particularly remediation.  There are almost 1,000 primary schools in this country who do not have access to a remedial teacher.  Admittedly, they are the smaller ones but they account for thousands of pupils.</P>
    <P>When I put these questions, Senator Quinn always asks how will we pay for it?  It is a valid question as we are all answerable to the taxpayer. The number of those in primary education is falling and will continue to do so.  There is a democratic dividend.  Every year resources become available on the basis that there are a smaller number of pupils coming into the system.  As those resources are becoming available, they should be reinvested in the system.  The psychological service is not there and does not or will not meet anybody's needs.  The recommendation of the report is great, but we should get it done. It has not been done.  The Minister's party has been in Government for five years.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; scheme was broadly welcomed.  Last Sunday evening there was a tragic accident in Cork where an 11 year old child was killed in a car driven by a 15 year old.  The 11 year old was from Churchfield and the 15 year old was from Knocknaheeny, which are both highly disadvantaged areas and neither of which are in the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; scheme.  Both of the schools in those areas are left on their own without resources.</P>
    <P>That is the level we have to deal with, although much is being done.  There are 309 schools recognised as disadvantaged in the country and only 25 of them are in &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; schemes.  I do not have the time to develop this theme any further.  The Minister is to be congratulated on what is being done in this report.  The direction is correct, but we need to look at it.  There is no point in having FÁS and CERT if we do not look at what they have to do.  CERT can provide people with qualifications.  However, they need to enter an industry where they are valued, paid, recognised for their worth and given a feeling of success.  We began the debate by saying that we need to motivate children at primary level and make them feel wanted and successful.  However, this must continue into their careers.  This report is a first step, but more needs to be done.  We need to invest in our education in order to train people to earn employment.  However, if they are <Col N="228" /> unqualified and uneducated they are almost certainly unemployable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we need the NESF report to tell us that such large numbers of young people are leaving our national schools without being able to read or write?  It is an awful state of affairs in this day and age.  The NESF report provides a statistical basis for the link between educational disadvantage and other forms of social and economic disadvantage, a link which Democratic Left has highlighted for some time.  Investment in third level education does little to improve overall educational attainment unless the primary foundation is strengthened.  Forty six per cent of the 15-24 year old age group without qualifications are unemployed and are likely to stay unemployed while much of the current debate focuses on third level and their role in preparing young people to enter the economy.  Primary education remains the only educational experience many young people receive and it must be invested in.  Years ago employers took on young people, paid them a wage and gave them a start in life.  They learned from their experiences in the workplace and meeting other people.  That is not available to them now.</P>
      <P>Initiatives such as &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo;, which target resources at primary schools in disadvantaged areas, need to be consolidated and expanded.  The criteria for inclusion in such schemes need to be reviewed.  In this regard far more attention should be paid to rural areas. There is a tendency to mention the words &ldquo;urban&rdquo; and &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; in the same breath. Pupils in many rural areas are as likely as urban children to come from economically and, therefore, educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. Their needs must be addressed by Government initiatives.</P>
      <P>Resources are only one part of the problem. We need to look at quality as well as quantity. Every parent has the right to know that when their child leaves education, whether at 14 or 21 years of age, they will have basic literacy and numeracy skills and will not only be able to take up a job but to write a letter applying for a job. We must ensure that all children leaving primary school can read and write.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless a conscious decision is made to further target education spending at the primary sector, particularly in disadvantaged areas, we will continue to produce a cohort of unemployed and unemployable young people whose children, as evidenced by the NESF report, will later find themselves trapped in the same cycle of disadvantage. We can see that happening already.  We need to address the issue of how to keep young people in school and how to ensure they derive maximum benefit from their schooling.  The promised School Attendance Bill is vital and I urge the Minister of State to lose no time in bringing it forward.  There is legislation at present but I see no evidence where I live of it being <Col N="229" /> implemented in cases where children have not attended school for a long period of time.</P>
    <P>We also need to devise a system whereby the Department of Education is notified of all children who are expelled, suspended or otherwise excluded from school to ensure they are targeted by other education services such as Youthereach and, where possible, to ensure their integration into the school system.  In my town of Mallow we have had a Youthreach programme for three years.  It is a tremendous programme which is of great benefit to young people who have opted out of second level education.</P>
    <P>The Government has an excellent record of job maintenance and creation.  The number of those on the live register has been falling consistently and now stands at its lowest level for five years. However, less progress has been made on reducing the number of long-term unemployed, many of whom, as is evidenced by the NESF report, left school early without qualifications.  The report confirms what many of us have long suspected &mdash; early school leavers are potential candidates for the live register.  I welcome the report and hope it will not gather dust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for allowing me to contribute at this stage.  I congratulate the Labour Party Senators for tabling this motion.  It is a very important issue which has been constantly raised by Senators O'Sullivan and Ormonde, among others.  I am glad we have an opportunity to debate it.  As Senator Kelly said, this is the first time a report of the National Economic and Social Forum has been discussed at length in this House.</P>
      <P>We are all very concerned by the issue of early school leaving and youth unemployment.  I know this is of particular concern to the Minister of State from her contributions to meetings of the National Economic and Social Forum, of which she is a member.  The issue is obviously very close to her heart.</P>
      <P>We would all like to see a situation where no child leaving school was faced only with the option of a life of unemployment.  We are failing our young people if that is the only option we feel we can offer them.  The purpose of this report was to make recommendations to address the issue of early school leavers and youth unemployment. The report recommends that targets should be set to eliminate the whole problem of early school leaving over the next five years and to ensure that anyone leaving school moves on to a Youthreach programme, FÁS training scheme or community employment scheme, rather than facing the prospect of a life on the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must end the movement from the school roll to the dole.  It is very easy for those who are short term unemployed to move into the category of long-term unemployed with the prospect of never having a job.  That is a very sad prospect for anyone and should be totally unacceptable to us all.  Once a young person starts signing on the dole they no longer acquire any work experience, <Col N="230" /> additional training or qualifications.  Over a period of time that tends to remove them from normal economic activity and the prospect of ever getting a job and participating, as they wish to do, in the economic life of the country.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the other House last night on the Prisons Bill it was stated that idleness and social exclusion are not reasons to turn to crime. However, none of us can be surprised if people who are socially excluded and do not believe they have any purpose or position in life turn to crime. We must be aware of that and do all we can to ensure that situation does not develop.</P>
    <P>The report states in its conclusions that the forum is aware of the resource implications which arise from its recommendations.  We must acknowledge that the recommendations cannot be funded at no additional cost to the Exchequer. However, that expenditure is necessary and justified on economic and social grounds, as is stated in the report.  The amount of additional expenditure required should fall as changes occur in the population over the next number of years.  The elimination of the target group of early school leavers over the next five years will also have positive consequences for the funding implications.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Toole said, the most important area is the targeting of resources at primary education. Children who leave primary school unable to read and write have, as Senator Sherlock said, little prospect of gaining a second level qualification. They are obviously the children who will tend to drop out of school because they cannot see themselves participating fully in the system and feel they are as well off outside it.  That is a very sad situation.</P>
    <P>The area of FÁS and training schemes must be looked at.  Senator Ormonde has repeatedly made the point that there must be something seriously wrong with the State training system if it is not meeting the demands of the job market.  Last week and article by Mark O'Connell in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> stated that the Government is &ldquo;urgently seeking tenders for the training of thousands of computer specialists to supply the labour market needs of Ireland's rapidly expanding technology sector&rdquo;.  There seems to be little point in the IDA bringing in high tech industries if we have to import workers to staff them. We spend approximately £150 million on training every year.  Surely, we should direct that money to areas where there are prospects of jobs for our young people.</P>
    <P>There is an argument to be made for letting companies do their own training and directing some of the State training budget to these companies which would train our young people in the skills which they require.  It is a waste of resources to train young people for jobs which do not exist rather than for jobs which exist and which we have the prospect of attracting.</P>
    <P>Over the years FÁS has made an important contribution in the area of training, especially <Col N="231" /> with regard to community employment schemes. It has offered training and prospects to many of the unemployed, including the long-term unemployed. However, given the radical changes to its role and responsibilities, it may be time to review its operations to see if we are getting the best value from the resources invested in it.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the targeting of resources, especially by the Minister for Education into the primary school area and areas of disadvantage. However, there continues to be huge areas of disadvantage and large numbers of young people who feel that they have no purpose in life and that society has nothing to offer them.  We must, therefore, concentrate increased resources on the primary school sector because it benefits all. While those fortunate enough to avail of the second level sector can often proceed to third level, those who drop out of school early tend to gain least from our spending on the education system.  This is not an easy problem to tackle immediately and while I appreciate that time is required and that the Minister is addressing it, we would all like to see faster progress.  While there are huge resource implications involved, society is already bearing the cost of not addressing it, both in human and social terms.</P>
    <P>I have met many young people, especially girls, who on reaching the age of 18 years leave school, start to draw the dole and move into a flat because they will get an allowance.  They face a very bleak future.  We fail as public representatives if we do not accept that this is happening in society and if we do not do all we can to address it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most important that we target disadvantage at the earliest stage in the education cycle.  The Minister for Education has addressed this issue very effectively and has made a sizeable amount of extra funding available for home school liaison, disadvantaged schools and remedial education.  The early start and &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; schemes are significant developments under her ministry.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; scheme is revolutionary. It provides classes of only 15 students in size for children in 25 urban schools and 25 clusters of rural schools where severe disadvantage has been identified.  Senator Ormonde and Senator O'Toole mentioned schools which they considered to be in especially disadvantaged areas and which are not included in the scheme. The terms for the scheme were drawn up by the Department's education research centre and the Combat Poverty Agency.  The Minister did not pick the schools; they were selected on the basis of sound educational research.  Both schemes need to be consistently monitored and expanded, and money must continue to be invested in this area of primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Severe problems exist for those who are dropping out of school at a young age and who face long-term unemployment.  Smaller children need <Col N="232" /> role models.  For example, they need to see their older brothers and sisters getting into training and into work.  However, society has changed enormously in recent years and the old pattern of children following their parents' line of work, whether it was a trade or a business, no longer exists.  Children now encounter an amorphous society.  In view of this, insufficient work has been done on the transition from school to work.</P>
    <P>We need much more flexible systems than we have at present.  We must think in terms of progression for individuals and in linking the various agencies involved, whether it be education, training such as FÁS, and the world of work.  In this regard I welcome the recommendation in the NESF report that there should be a cross-departmental committee to deal with those issues as they relate to the different Departments.  I hope schemes and plans will be drawn up which will address the problems of the young people concerned.</P>
    <P>Given the rate of change, we urgently need a national survey of the skills required by the workplace. For example, a couple of recent newspaper headlines referred to staff shortages being the main challenge facing tourism and to too many vacancies in the catering industry.  In view of this, we need more flexibility within the training system and I support the proposal in the report that 15 to 17 year olds should have access to CERT courses.  While there are problems of insufficient remuneration, many young people with innate skills in this area should be trained.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to get people back into VTOS before the age of 21 if they missed out earlier on an education.  The report also recommends that the Youthreach programme should have proper certification.  Many of those involved in the programme continue to have difficulty getting employment because of certification difficulties.</P>
    <P>FÁS is a crucial factor in this area and we should not decry it.  According to its end of year statement, FÁS in the midwest put 12,000 people through its hands in 1996.  It takes a variety of approaches, including working with employers with regard to the training needs of their employees, the community employment schemes and the provisions of a number of programmes in its various centres, such as Shannon and Raheen.</P>
    <P>However, sometimes young people who drop out of school do not get into these courses because they lack basic requirements.  FÁS will have to be more flexible in providing accessible training courses.  Many of these young people drop out at 15 or 16 years of age and do not come back into the system to sign on or gain access to programmes until they are 18.  We must target these young people and the training area is likely to be the most productive in establishing patterns of work.  They should go into training programmes as soon as they leave school.  There should not be a haphazard approach to young people who drop out of school, but a direct link between the schools, the local employment service <Col N="233" /> and FÁS.  I support Senator Kelly's call for local employment services to be extended throughout the country.  That service is ideal for these young people because it tends to have locally based offices and the schools should be obliged to notify the local employment service or FÁS so that these young people can be reached. Many of them do not have the skills, the self-confidence or the motivation to go to these agencies and a formal system of identifying them is needed.  They should not necessarily be forced into doing something they do not want to do, but it should be as easy as possible for them to get into these courses.</P>
    <P>The unemployment rate is coming down.  It is now 11.8 per cent, which is quite an improvement on the past.  The number of young people in school is also going down so we should be able to deal with this problem if we set up the systems.  I am not as negative as some of the other speakers appear to be.</P>
    <P>We must deal with the specific issues such as CERT, access to FÁS courses, the LES and links between schools now rather than leaving them until next year or the year after.  On community employment schemes, I have seen an advertisement for one relating to the Limerick Charter 800.  It involves community arts, street performance and costume-making.  It would be perfect for young people but they cannot apply because they are not eligible for community employment until they are older.  They should have access to community employment schemes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State conveys the importance of dealing with these points to her colleagues.</P>

Having observed all sides and the three stands, it is unfortunate that the forum's deliberations take place behind closed doors and that the public do not get a flavour of what goes into the reports.</P>
      <P>It may surprise people to learn that 100 people contributed to this document.  I would have said that number included the best brains in the country until I remembered I was one of them.

      <P>What has happened to the LES scheme?  The Minister of State and I have spoken about this and it has been one of the great disappointments of the last two years' deliberations on unemployment and school-leaving.  The local <Col N="234" /> employment scheme is a good concept and I have tracked its progress over the last two years.  It is a combination of the community, employers, educators and various State agencies at local level to identifying employment needs and the unemployed in their midst, then mentoring on a one-to-one basis.  If that scheme were as effective as we hoped it would be, it would have made a considerable dent in unemployment figures and given hope to youngsters all over the country.  If the scheme is still in operation, will it be expanded and will resources be allocated to it?</P>
      <P>There were seven drafts of this report, which may suggest to some the old cliché of the camel being designed by a committee, but in the end we agreed to it.</P>
      <P>A pet subject of mine, sport, is covered by part of the report, which states:</P>
      <P>The Forum notes that in a recent survey of 84 young unemployed people in the inner city, 12 per cent of males and 2 per cent of females expressed an interest in training and sports coaching.  However, according to a recent survey of 365 second-level schools, 67 per cent stated that they had no sports coaches, while 98 per cent provided sports as an extracurricular activity.</P>
      <P>In the public debates following the murder of Veronica Guerin last summer, all agreed that crime among young people was not exclusively a social or justice problem but was also an educational one.  In that context, and as a sports plan was launched by the Government yesterday, the Minister of State should take that element of the report to heart in her discussions.  There is a view shared across the political divide and by academics that if we could adequately resource sporting education with more teachers and facilities at schools level, especially in the areas of deprivation to which Senator O'Toole and others referred, it would help concentrate the minds of youngsters away from anti-social activities.</P>
      <P>Other speakers referred to the staggering figure of 1,000 youngsters who do not go to second level education and have no qualifications other than what they learned at primary school level. What happens to them?  Where do they go? Senator Ormonde highlighted the problems for those in the 15 to 18 years age group.  There seems to be a vacuum in officialdom as far as this group is concerned.  They are among the group who progresses to anti-social activities and end up as long-term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that a more imaginative approach could be taken to the national literacy schemes which Governments undertake.  As a broadcaster I have visited Nashville in Tennessee. Despite the international perception of it being the home of country music its main industry is bible making.  I have met people there not just from the music industry but some who have moved from music to politics.  Over the last decade the state of Tennessee has adopted a very imaginative literacy programme.  They harness <Col N="235" /> role models in the music industry on a <i>pro bona</i> basis to do public service announcements and general media activities targeting the socially disadvantaged who have slipped through the system at first level and who cannot read or write or whose literacy and numeracy skills are limited.</P>
    <P>On a regular basis they carry out campaigns which involve, for example, asking Garth Brooks, an international star, to record a number of pro-educational advertisements using the language of the young to say: &ldquo;It is not cool to be unable to read.  Do you not understand that you will be unable to watch the subtitles on MTV or read your favourite music magazine?&rdquo;.  The Minister should adopt a similar attitude in Ireland by using role models from Boyzone to Manchester United's Ryan Giggs.  An imaginative approach should be taken rather than the sterile, conservative approach of putting some advertisements in the newspapers and hoping for the best.</P>
    <P>In the course of preparing the NESF report we discovered that CERT, probably the most successful State agency in that it has a 100 per cent placement record, cannot be accessed by those under 17 years of age:</P>
    <P>The forum recommends that the existing lower age limit be amended to allow 15 to 17 year olds to participate on CERT courses.  The arrangements for such training could form part of the Youthreach Programme.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister to take this recommendation on board.  It seems a simple recommendation although the forum report later says that there might be a conflict because the White Paper on education proposes that the school leaving age be raised to 16.  This is a policy matter but I am sure some accommodation can be reached in the context of 15 new hotels being built in Dublin and the extreme skills shortage in this area.  It is an opportunity for young people who like the leisure and hotel industry and who see it as something to which they can relate.</P>

      <P>I am glad that I have waited until now to intervene in the debate as I have had the opportunity to listen to the very constructive contributions, echoing the contributions of all parties represented in the forum.</P>
      <P>Everybody has made the point that today's early school leavers are heading towards becoming tomorrow's long term unemployed unless we intervene.  The earlier we intervene the more effective it will be.  Ensuring that the main stream school system serves youngsters with educational disadvantages and social handicaps must be the primary concern.  We also need a response that will identify the young people whom main stream school has not served.  The school's role is not simply turning out academic geniuses.  It is responsible for serving all children whatever their abilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> Thirty per cent of those under 30 who have left school before the junior certificate are long-term unemployed.  That is a higher proportion than an equivalent earlier generation.  The relative handicap facing early school leavers is much worse for today's young people than it was a generation ago.  This is a serious matter.  The early school leaver with no qualifications is three times more likely to be long term unemployed than a school leaver with the leaving certificate and eight times more lightly to be long term unemployed than a graduate.</P>
    <P>One of the most effective things we can do is to hold young people in school by making the school system serve them.  I pay tribute to the work Senator Quinn has done in chairing the group on the leaving certificate applied which is a recognition that the leaving certificate curriculum must reach out and serve people who have different kinds of abilities as well as those who are good at conventional subjects.</P>
    <P>The determined effort to invest in education and to hold young people in school is paying off. However, as this report illustrates, we still have a long way to go and it is important to keep this issue on the political agenda.  I am very pleased with the all-party support for the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>In the past four years the number of people staying on to leaving certificate has increased from 74 per cent of the age group to 84 per cent. The number of early school leavers has halved from 5,000 per year to 2,500.  This is still a big problem and we cannot become complacent. However, these positive results have not happened by accident.  We need to develop the work already being done such as investing in pre-schools. Research into the Helpstart programme in the United States shows that a person with pre-school education is more likely to stay in school for longer.  Investment for the first time in pre-school education in disadvantaged communities is a very important part of an anti-unemployment policy.  It holds children in school and ensures that they stay on to a point where they are sufficiently qualified to get jobs when they leave.</P>
    <P>Another significant programme is the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative.  Senators Ormonde and O'Toole spoke about a scatter gun approach. There is a choice to be made between doing something for every school and doing something in the schools where there is most disadvantage. Some of Senator O'Toole's members threatened to go on strike because there were no reductions in pupil-teacher ratios in every school as distinct from focusing help on schools where there was disadvantage.  We have a real choice as to whether we want to do something for everybody which means much less for the schools which are disadvantaged or whether we are prepared to bite the bullet and do more for the schools where there is disadvantage.  The 25 urban and 25 rural Breaking the Cycle programmes are not enough but if we try to do it for 4,000 schools we are <Col N="237" /> missing the point that we need to concentrate resources if we are to make a real difference.</P>
    <P>The demographic dividend has been used to employ more remedial teachers, reduce pupil-teacher ratios, increase funding to schools in disadvantaged areas, increase the number of Youthreach and community training workshop places and develop the leaving certificate applied and home school liaison.</P>
    <P>Early school leavers are disproportionately drawn from families and communities which are disadvantaged, where 55 per cent of parents are out of work and where there may be no books, or tradition and maybe no value on education in the home.  Therefore, an important part in encouraging young people to stay on in school is involving the parents.  Home-school liaison is very important.</P>
    <P>The heads of a School Attendance Bill are to go to Government in the very near future.  It will raise the school leaving age to 16.  It will also assign responsibility which is one of the points made strongly in the report and for which I have argued very strongly as a member of the committee which wrote the report.  When youngsters drop out of school, schools should be given the responsibility of following up these children to see if the parents have moved house or if they have been re-enrolled in a different school and to ensure they are referred to appropriate services. That is proposed in the School Attendance Bill.</P>
    <P>Research done by Damien Hannon of the ESRI shows that the transition to second level is a dangerous drop out point for young people.  The fact 900 to 1,000 children do not make that transition is extremely significant.  Senator Kelly chaired the final stages of the task force on travellers. Most of those young people are traveller children.  There is a culture among the travelling community that girls, in particular, leave school once they make their Confirmation.  We need to address that issue because we are not doing these young people a service by validating that as a cultural practice.</P>
    <P>Damien Hannon's research shows the importance of school plans in terms of a whole school approach to the child.  The school plan is being built into the new education reforms.  As regards discipline which focuses on suspension, if a school expels the child causing trouble we are sending a signal that we do not want them in the school system, at which point the child will not come back.  We need a different approach to discipline, one which holds these young people in the school system.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting EU-funded project in Cox's Demesne in Dundalk where children are referred to this particular house.  They follow a school curriculum and do not have to wear school uniforms.  Instead of discipline resulting in them going on the bounce or sitting at home watching videos, there is an alternative structure which deals with these children who may have other problems.  Often children who drop out may be in trouble at home or have difficulty getting on <Col N="238" /> with teachers and have not managed to make the transition from primary to secondary school.  We need to look at the pressure points at which young people drop out and ensure schools have appropriate policies and that we are not penalising children and forcing them out of the school system.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the question of signing on at 18 years of age.  The report talks about offering young people alternatives to signing on the dole.  Since last October a programme comes into effect when an 18 year old has been out of work for six months.  It tries to direct them into alternative programmes of intensive guidance counselling, work experience, training and so on.  I strongly believe that programme should begin the first day a person signs on and not six months later, particularly for those who face long-term unemployment.  Young people who have dropped out of school early need that intervention the first day they appear at the dole office and not six months later.  Young girls who get pregnant often do not go back to school after having their babies.  Schools need to be alert in this regard and should encourage them back into the school system.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say the Government has appointed an interdepartmental working party to report back to it in six weeks on the recommendations, so there will be action in this regard.  I will lend my weight to that because it is something about which I, and I believe all Senators, feel strongly.  We need to ensure schools serve young people with problems better and that Youthreach centres and community training workshops, which are picking up youngsters who drop out, are better resourced and that more places are provided.</P>
    <P>During the debate the point was made that youngsters who end up in prison are disproportionately drawn from those who cannot read or write, left school with no qualifications and who face enormous handicaps.  They are not only drawn from young people in disadvantaged communities but from those whom the education system has failed.  If we want to reduce and nip crime in the bud, we must provide special help at an early stage and hold these children in school by giving them educational experiences which are worthwhile and equip them with the tools to make their way independently in the world.  As Members stressed, those basic tools are reading and writing, because one cannot access education unless one can read and write.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators mentioned the role of FÁS.  Recently, I launched the good practice guidelines for FÁS for recruiting people to apprenticeships which were worked on with the apprentice employer organisations.  I made the point at the launch that a person does not need a leaving certificate to do an apprenticeship but five passes in the junior certificate.  A person may also become an apprentice if they are a graduate of a Youthreach course.  I asked employers not to engage in qualification inflation as regards young people for whom apprenticeships would be <Col N="239" /> extremely suitable and would match their talents and abilities.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter spoke about the embarrassment caused by under-performance being a factor in youngsters dropping out of school.  Teachers need to be sensitive in this regard.  Often teachers find it easier to deal with children who are motivated and are performing well.  An example of a whole school is one which reaches out to all children. Every child should be valued whether they are troublesome, weak or heading towards six or seven A's in the leaving certificate.  The school must draw out the full potential of all children.</P>
    <P>There will be opportunities with the demographic dividend.  Those aged 17 years who are in fifth or sixth year and doing their leaving certificate represent the peak of the birth rate and in two years time they will have left the school system. More resources will become available even if we do not commit an extra penny to education. I believe the first call on those resources must be to those young people whom the system has failed to date and to early school leavers and potential early school leavers.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock spoke about the application of school attendance rules.  There are no school attendance officers outside urban areas and the gardaí, who have other priorities, must fulfil this function.  I hope the School Attendance Bill will address this problem by appointing education welfare officers who will encourage parents and schools to work together for children whom the school system as failed.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked about the local employment service.  There are now 18 areas, including the original 12 partnership areas plus Kildare and Clare.  Last week the scheme was extended to Clondalkin, Ballyfermot, Blanchardstown and Drogheda and is based on a criteria of disadvantage. The intention is to implement the scheme nationwide.</P>

      <P>The scheme has been extended to four further areas this year.  The advice given by the interdepartmental group, on which the unemployed were represented, was to take it step by step and to get it right rather than going into something blindfolded which did not work.  To some extent, the reason the forum recommended a local employment service was that the FÁS services were not meeting the need. It is important to do the job right and to learn from mistakes.  An evaluation is being done by Forfás on the local employment service, which is almost complete.</P>

      <P>The appointments made by CERT highlight the need to ensure that young people, particularly those who have dropped out of the conventional school system, have access to training.  CERT training programmes will be available.  The Youthreach and community training workshop programmes do a lot of work in the area of catering and similar skills and in the foundation year they also offer a second chance to learn literacy and basic numeracy skills.  That is extremely important because without those skills people cannot even begin to access the world of work.  They also place much emphasis on personal development because young people who drop out of school often have extremely low self-esteem or a chip on their shoulder and employers will not believe in people who do not believe in themselves or who see themselves as failures of the system.  They do not need their disabilities, handicaps or failures to be noted, rather they need their abilities to recognised and validated.  I agree that Youthreach should be certified and that will be a priority in the new Teastas.</P>
      <P>I believe we have by and large succeeded in cracking the problem of short-term unemployment for people with skills.  An additional 150,000 jobs have been provided in this economy during the last four years and last year one in ten of new jobs in Europe were created in Ireland.  The most difficult area is that of long-term unemployment, which is linked with low skills.  We must attack this on two fronts.  First, we must try to re-integrate today's long-term unemployed into the world of work by building up their skills, providing them with personalised help and guidance and ensuring that employers are willing to take on people who are ready for jobs.  That task has been given to the local employment services.  It is slow, painstaking and must be done on an individual basis.  It is not a matter of providing a system and making individuals fit into it; one starts with the individuals, who often have many difficulties, and changes the system to cater for them.  The second part of the job is preventing the flow into long-term unemployment.  The key is to prevent early school leaving and to invest in the potential of young people who are currently leaving school early, are likely to leave early unless we do something about it or have already left school.  That is the great employment challenge we face as we head into the millennium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report and congratulate Senator Kelly and Senator O'Sullivan for bringing it before the House.  I am glad the Minister mentioned the leaving certificate applied because it is both a huge opportunity and the secret for success.  Its first graduates will not emerge until June so as yet we cannot show examples to prove it is a success, but I am enthusiastic about the scheme.  It will succeed because the key factor is motivation.  If we manage to make youngsters <Col N="241" /> want to go to school we will succeed.  That may sound like an airy-fairy dream but it is possible if we use the leaving certificate applied.</P>
      <P>I am in the supermarket business; a large supermarket employs perhaps 200 people and deals with 20,000 customers and 10,000 products. The manager of a supermarket has a big, tough job.  A number of managers in my company do not have a good traditional leaving certificate yet they are brilliant at the job.  The traditional leaving certificate measures one's academic ability to take a three hour exam after two years of study and to write down everything one knows about a topic.  Some people are not necessarily good at sitting in an exam hall but may be brilliant at doing things and we see many examples of such successes around the world.</P>
      <P>I am excited about the leaving certificate applied because I have seen young people blossom and grow through finding they are good at doing something.  The new examination identifies and continually assesses a person's strengths.  A student does not wait for two years but is assessed during the period; only one-third of the total mark depends on the examination.  The student gets the results as he or she goes along during fifth and sixth year.</P>
      <P>A supermarket manager has to communicate in writing but it is much more important for him or her to be able to communicate orally.  That talent is not measured in the traditional leaving certificate, apart from a couple of language subjects. The new leaving certificate applied also gives students the experience of work, which is hugely valuable when they approach future employers. The students have passed an exam which is certified by the Department of Education, so the employer knows it is a real leaving certificate; but they also have the experience of work, which is an extra benefit.  There are many types of intelligence other than academic ability and the leaving certificate applied concentrates on those.  The real achievement is that people develop because they have been identified as successful.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the economic aspect of dropping out, as many of those who leave school have the alternative of simply not attending.  I did not realise until recently that students had to pay £46 to sit the leaving certificate.  The overall revenue to the Department of Education from examination fees is £6 million out of the total budget of £2 billion.  That £46 fee is a hindrance to many people doing the leaving certificate, so could we consider dropping the charge in order to encourage people to finish school?  As the Minister said, many of those who drop out are financially disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is already clear that the distinctive approach of the leaving certificate applied can have a dramatic effect on the motivation of young students. In school after school that I have visited, teachers have told me that the leaving certificate applied students have by far the best attendance record and are the most punctual, because they are <Col N="242" /> motivated to learn.  Yesterday morning, a young student from the Mercy Convent in Sligo, Ms Georgina McLoughlin, was interviewed on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; and spoke with great enthusiasm about what the course can do.  She is just one of many who have found it worthwhile to go to school and would not have found it attractive otherwise.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to continue her work. The objective of this report is to conquer the problem of early school leavers and thereby tackle youth unemployment and I am delighted that steps are now being taken.  There is a long way to go but we are moving in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this useful and welcome debate.  Most of us are baffled that, despite our huge economic success, huge numbers of young people cannot get employment.  Not only that, many highly educated and qualified young people cannot get experience of work.  We have two problems.  First, massive numbers of young people leave school early without qualifications and are not suited to the positions which are currently available.  Second, there is a mismatch in that highly qualified people are holding down jobs which less qualified people might take.  At present, young graduates are holding jobs for which they are overqualified and which could be done by less qualified personnel.  This has created a bottleneck which is not helping the economy and not helping to obtain the full benefit from people who are highly qualified.  I know of three young people with degrees who were forced to emigrate recently because they could not find job opportunities in Ireland, particularly in the computer business.  This is unfortunate.  In spite of the media hype about the availability of jobs for computer graduates, I am aware that several students who qualified this year went from agency to agency and company to company and were, in the main, very badly treated by companies.  They gave them no indication of whether they would get a job.  These companies continue to advertise even though there are no jobs available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion to check with several companies in the high technology area in the mid-west region and found, to my disappointment, that in spite of the so-called boom in the computer business, many companies did not have vacancies for computer graduates.  I noticed recently that the Government is taking steps to train people for technical jobs.  Quite a number of graduates in my region, from the University of Limerick complain that they have been forced to take jobs which could be done by technicians.  Companies are now endeavouring to train technicians so they can <Col N="243" /> avoid paying high salaries to computer engineers. This is an area which must be examined very carefully and very soon, otherwise further problems will arise in that we will be producing graduates for whom there are no jobs.  They will be forced to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the work of the forum.  It is very important and useful because anything that will give us an indication of how we should proceed in this area would be very useful to us as Members of the Oireachtas.  I am baffled as to where we should go from here.  In spite of all the announcements and pronouncements about jobs in the last year, I am still contacted every weekend by young people wanting to know where there are job opportunities.  It is frightening and it is important for the Minister to determine as soon as possible the current position on young graduate unemployment. The report has put forward a number of very important initiatives which, at a cost of £12 million, are relatively cheap.  If £12 million can go some way towards solving this problem, it will be a small price to pay.</P>
    <P>This report clearly identifies that there is a definite link between lack of education and poverty, crime and drug abuse.  There is a grave onus on the Government to find some mechanism to bring together the various professionals from areas such as education, health, social welfare, finance and so on.  The Government must find a formula to give effect to the recommendations in this report.  It must identify precisely who are the unemployed and where they can get jobs.  This is a very serious issue which, in my view, will deteriorate further.  It is also very depressing in view of the country's economic success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say ties in closely with what Senator Daly said.  We must be very careful not to encourage people into what was traditionally viewed as straight academic education. Education is splendid in itself and I would be very much in favour of seeing young people progressing through second and third level education where possible.  However, we should also look at more imaginative areas of education. Senator Quinn's initiative has been very important as are Senator Daly's comments about graduates depriving unskilled people of jobs.  If I were an early school leaver who was not employed, I would just pull the sheets over my head and stay in bed if I had to listen to all the talk about our affluent, booming economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was given the following figures on unemployment from the Higher Education Authority.  Of all primary graduates in 1995, only 52 per cent of respondents were in some form of employment by April 1996.  A further 40 per cent had proceeded to do higher degrees, a phenomenon which was unknown ten years ago when only about 10 per cent proceeded to do higher degrees.  Of those who were employed, 21 per cent were employed overseas, and 50 per cent were employed in the private services so we have <Col N="244" /> no idea whether they were working in banking or in pizzerias.  Most of those employed were in the eastern region.  The Higher Education Authority received an 80 per cent response rate to their questionnaire and of those with postgraduate degrees only 70 per cent went straight into employment.  There is a very serious problem here.</P>
    <P>With regard to salaries, there seems to be a notion at the moment that people are very highly paid in Ireland.  Of people with primary degrees, 21 per cent were earning less than £9,000 per annum, 15 per cent were earning between £11,000 and £13,000 and 22 per cent were earning salaries between £13,000 and £15,000.  There were very few in jobs which were paying high salaries.  We must be careful to tell unskilled people that they are not necessarily being offered very low paid jobs when people with degrees may not be earning that much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply and my fellow Senators for an excellent debate. We were broadly in agreement and had a very full debate.  There is a problem and we must recognise it for what it is and adopt a three pronged approach to solving it, as the Minister mentioned.</P>
      <P>First, we have to look at children of four and five years of age who are likely, ten years on, to become early school leavers and we must seek to prevent them leaving school.  We are doing that through the Early Start Programme.  Second, we need to look at the current ten and 11 year olds and recognise that they will be potential early school leavers, in a couple of years.  We must put in place procedures within the schools to ensure that children stay in school for the maximum length of time.  We must ensure that the school responds to their needs and gives them skills that will allow them to take their rightful place in the world of work.  The School Attendance Bill will help in that regard.</P>
      <P>The third prong concerns those students who have just left school.  Their needs must be addressed before the habit of being unemployed becomes too deeply ingrained; they must be retrained and given the confidence and skills to allow them to participate in the workplace.  I recognise what Senator Daly said about the problem of graduate under-employment.  However, one of my biggest fears is that as those graduates start to find their rightful place in the workforce as, for example, engineers rather than shop assistants, their places will not be filled by unskilled Irish people.  I suspect there will be an inflow of highly educated people from other countries who will be prepared to work for low wages.  It is already happening in the catering industry where people are coming from Africa and elsewhere.  We should share our wealth with people from Africa but not while we have unemployed young people who are facing a less than adequate life.  We should look after our own first.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="245" /> I thank the Minister of State for the news that the interdepartmental group will report in six weeks.  Hopefully, that will lead to positive action.

      <P>These amendments, and the subsequent amendments to sections 16 and 20, were sought by the interim panel after the Bill had <Col N="246" /> passed all Stages in the Dáil.  Its proposals were the subject of detailed consultations with my Department and with the parliamentary draftsman. I am satisfied that the amendments are necessary for reasons which I will explain as each amendment arises.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendments Nos. 2 and 3, the panel sees it as essential to expand the existing definition of &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeree&rdquo;.  The reason for this is that the former is defined as the person who makes an offer, while the latter is defined as a company which is the subject of an offer.  When one looks at the definition of &ldquo;offer&rdquo; in the Bill, one sees that it is defined as an offer made to the holders of securities.  The effect of these three definitions is to limit the applicability of the terms &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeree&rdquo; to a situation where an offer has been made.  In other words, neither party comes into existence until an offer is made.</P>
      <P>The problem with anchoring the definitions of offeror and offeree to the point where an offer is made is that the panel wishes to regulate for an entire range of scenarios and to be able to make and impose rules, rulings, directions and so on on the offeror and the offeree in respect of certain of their actions taken prior to the stage where an offer is actually made.</P>
      <P>What the panel has, therefore, requested is that the definition of &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeree&rdquo; be redrafted to take in all stages, literally between the point of conception of an offer right through to the making of such an offer.  The revised wording in amendments Nos. 2 and 3 takes account of the concerns of the panel.</P>

      <P>This section concerns the power of the panel to impose charges.  The amendment is purely technical.  The original text remains unaltered.  The necessity for the change arises from a certain ambiguity created by the existing layout of the text which could be read to imply that the panel should make rules under section 8 in respect of charges to be imposed in relation to proceedings of the panel, whereas the clear intention is that the panel be enabled to make charges in respect of the lodging with it of documents in the two specified situations.  They are in accordance with rules under section 8 or any proceedings of the panel.</P>
      <P>In any event, it would be inappropriate to have, or to appear to have, a provision for rules in relation to proceedings of the panel in a section relating exclusively to the powers of the panel to impose charges in order to finance its activities. Besides, section 11(1) already provides that &ldquo;the panel shall conduct proceedings and hearings in such a manner as it may determine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 makes it clear that rules under section 8 do not have to have any provisions in relation to proceedings of the panel. The effect of the amendment is to set out the last two lines of section 16(1)(d) as new separate sub-paragraph 16(1)(e).  The amendment is purely technical.</P>

      <P>Section 24 of the Bill currently provides that, subject to the provisions of any enactment or rule of law, the panel may indemnify its officers in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by them in the carrying out of their duties.  In line with the practice of the London panel, the Irish panel wants to be able to take out insurance policies in respect of its officers and so forth against possible legal actions <Col N="248" /> against them for defamation outside of this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>However, the panel believes the provisions of section 200 of the Companies Act, 1963, prohibits it from taking out such insurance.  This provision is essentially seen as preventing a company from taking out insurance to indemnify an officer of the company from liability for a specified event &mdash; for example, negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust.  Any policy of that nature taken out by a company is rendered void except in the restrictive circumstances set out in the section.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the panel's functions, it is important that we remove any doubt about the capability of the panel to take out such insurance. However, the solution I have arrived at in amendments Nos. 5 and 6 does not amount to a disapplication of section 200 of the 1963 Act in respect of the panel.  It will be seen that the solution involves a slight amendment to the existing subsection (4) and provision of a new subsection (5). The proposed solution is acceptable to the interim panel.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - The Ulster Canal.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  The presence of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht <Col N="250" /> underlines its importance and I am delighted he could attend.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to continue with the feasibility study for the Ulster Canal as quickly as possible.  My main interest in the canal derives from its heritage and tourism aspects.  When one looks at tourism figures for Ireland one sees that County Monaghan has always propped up the list. The county is always at the bottom of the earnings league in the tourism sector.  There is good reason for that.  Monaghan does not have flagship projects which can be used to attract tourists.  It has no major selling point.  It has beautiful countryside with its drumlin hills and valleys and a myriad of lakes, most of them small.  We have what we call a mountain, the Bragan Mountain, which most people would call a hill.  For those reasons, the Ulster Canal project can make an enormous impact in Monaghan.  That is why we are so interested in it.</P>
      <P>Some people might say the money spent on the canal would be a waste and should be spent on land drainage or something similar.  Though not very widespread, there is a school of thought in Monaghan town that there is a conflict between the canal and a proposed inner relief road in so far as the routes of the canal and the inner bypass for the national primary road cross.  There is, therefore conflict in Monaghan town about the location of the canal as regards an inner relief road.  However, the Minister will agree that this is not an insurmountable problem.  Having drawn his attention to it, will he ask his Department to examine the issue to ensure the canal is not in conflict with the development of the inner relief road which is essential to the town of Monaghan?</P>
      <P>I have been selling this idea for some time and had a little problem doing so initially.  People did not immediately appreciate the potential value of that canal to the town.  Monaghan, as an industrial area, is heavily dependent on traditional industry and does not have any modern information technology industry.  Many of the industries it has do not have a high added value either.  However, good employment is being given and most of it is generated from our own resources &mdash; natives doing their thing and employing others to help them do it.  We are brilliant at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many visionaries in Monaghan who would be of the same mind as the Minister with regard to the development of the canal.  It has some wonderful features.  It links the Erne system through Clones and Monaghan town to the doorway of Belfast.  It is truly a cross-Border project. If the Minister could rebuild this canal he would do a wonderful job for County Monaghan and neighbouring counties north of the Border as well.  A water link would be established between the important Erne system and Lough Neagh.  It would put us in Monaghan in a position where we could sell the county as a tourist resort.  Many people in the county are working extremely hard &mdash; the hotel owners, the B&amp;B operators, the guest house owners &mdash; and are making a living and employing substantial numbers of people in <Col N="251" /> tourism, but they do not have a wonderful selling point such as this canal.  I hope the Minister's study is completed at the earliest possible opportunity so that we can see what the position is.</P>
    <P>Bits and pieces of the canal can be seen around County Monaghan.  Some of it still exists but, as it has been out of action for the last 90 years, it is natural that parts of it have been filled in and other parts broken up, but all the important elements still exist.</P>
    <P>The canal was built in 1841, but there were many problems with it and it was closed for a period in 1860.  The level of water in it was unsatisfactory from day one.  In 1865, the canal was again closed for repair work.  By the time it reopened, some important elements of it, such as the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, had been abandoned.  It was a catastrophe from the beginning; but, with modern technology and the will to achieve it, the canal can be rebuilt to give County Monaghan an opportunity to compete with other counties as a tourist resort.  Given the way we operate in Monaghan without any flagship project, the Minister can be assured that it will make a huge return over the years on whatever investment is required.  I look forward to his response as I know he appreciates how important it is to us.</P>

      <P>Tá fíorchaoin áthas orm gur tugadh seans dom labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo agus tá mé buíoch don Seanadóir.  I have listened with interest to what the Senator had to say and am pleased to have this opportunity to respond.  I appreciate the sensitivity of the subject, the feeling with which he spoke about Monaghan and his anxiety to have it develop.</P>
      <P>The general issue of the development of canals is something of a chicken and egg situation.  When investment in canals is raised, some ask if we have demonstrated a tourist use of them.  However, tourists cannot use them if they are not developed and the argument proceeds from there.  My Department is fully committed to the development of the inland waterways of this island.  The Government, with the assistance of the European Union through the Regional Development Fund, has provided over £22 million for the waterways development programme in the period 1994-9. One should think about that: £22 million spent over five years creates an opportunity for a new kind of recreation amenity for heritage and tourist use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing specifically with the subject of this debate, I wish to inform the House of the current status of the waterways programme.  To date, the Grand Canal has been substantially upgraded and improvement work on the Barrow is proceeding.  Work on the Royal Canal is also continuing with a view to having it opened to the Shannon by the year 2000.  At present, it has been rewatered for over 90 per cent of its length. Although it is not yet open to navigation, it is <Col N="252" /> widely used for fishing, walking and canoeing.  It will be noticed from that the multi-purpose recreational usage to which our canals are being put. We have retained consultants to design the seven bridges between Mullingar and the Shannon and plan to commence construction on the largest of these, at Mullingar, in the autumn.  When these bridges have been constructed, a major section of the linked waterway network will have been put in place.</P>
    <P>The Senators are well aware of the attraction of the Shannon.  It is our premier waterway and has been a major tourist attraction since the 1960s.  The boat hire market continues to expand each year.  To help this development, we are continuing to invest in new destinations and enhanced facilities along the Shannon.  This year we are extending the navigation through a new canal towards Boyle, County Roscommon, along the River Suck to Ballinasloe, County Galway, and carrying out major developments in Limer ick city in conjunction with Shannon Development and Limerick Corporation.  Outside the connected network, we also have projects starting in Tralee and Galway this year which again will add to the tourism attractions in both locations.</P>
    <P>In 1994, the connection between the Shannon and Lough Erne was reopened.  Formerly known as the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, this waterway was renamed the Shannon Erne Waterway as it linked the two best known waterways on this island.  The growth in the traffic through this waterway has exceeded all expectations and there were times last summer when it was running at practically full capacity.  The area through which it flows has benefited from the increased tourist revenues and I compliment the local people who are so enthusiastic about the waterway and have facilitated and guaranteed its success to date.  The completion of the Shannon Erne Waterway allowed the connected network to be expanded further and visitors can now travel from Dublin to New Ross, Limerick and Enniskillen by water.</P>
    <P>When the Royal Canal is completed, the last major unnavigable section in the interconnected network will be the Ulster Canal.  This canal is situated in the counties of Armagh, Fermanagh and Monaghan.  It was originally constructed in the early part of the 19th century at a total cost of £232,000.  It provided a navigable link between Lough Neagh and Lough Erne thereby connecting the northern system of waterways to the southern network, including the Shannon.  It never carried a great deal of traffic and has in fact been disused since 1929.  Since its abandonment, it has gradually deteriorated and is now in a very derelict condition.  Adjoining landowners have filled in long sections of the waterway and many bridges with very little headroom were unfortunately constructed in times when people were not as far sighted.  Water supplies to the canal have been diverted to the extent that it is now virtually dry in the summer.  However, long stretches of the canal in the counties of Fermanagh and Monaghan <Col N="253" /> are intact, although heavily overgrown with trees and scrub.  I confess to a great sense of sadness at the idea of a waterway being abandoned and a sense of excitment as we turn again to making it live again.</P>
    <P>The canal is over 70 kilometres long, contains 26 locks and is traversed by 84 bridges.  Towns and villages served by the canal are Charlemont, Moy, Blackwatertown, Benburb, Caledon, Middletown, Monaghan, Smithborough and Clones.  The canal cross section is quite narrow except in the reach near the River Finn.  The top width of the canal was about 10 metres or less. Where the canal is built along drumlin contours it is much narrower, being partly cut into the upper slope of the drumlin and embanked on the lower slope.  There are several sections, embanked on both sides where the canal is carried at a higher level than the adjoining lands.</P>
    <P>In a scoping study carried out jointly by the authorities on both sides of the Border three major areas of difficulty were identified.  First, there is a lack of headroom at the bridge on the M1 motorway over the River Blackwater downstream of its confluence with the canal.  Second, there are problems associated with the canal through Monaghan town where there are a number of low level crossings over it.  The Monaghan inner relief road also encroaches on the canal and there are some buildings built partly on the line of the canal.  My staff have already been working on the resolution to this problem and we will continue to do so because it is not a choice between one or the other or beyond anyone's imagination to construct a solution.</P>
    <P>The third problem identified was the securing and maintaining of an adequate water supply to the canal.  However, many of the original bridges, locks and aqueducts were of sound construction, a monument to the wonderful craftspeople who built them.  Those that have survived interference or alteration, and there are several, are generally in good condition, although much overgrown with trees and silted up.  It is now proposed to undertake a full scale feasibility study which will endeavour to identify solutions to these difficulties and will also include a cost-benefit analysis and an environmental impact assessment of the project.</P>
    <P>The waterways service of my Department and the rivers agency of the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland set up a steering group to oversee the project, with the rivers agency taking the formal role of the client on this occasion.  The study was advertised in the national press and the EU journal late last year and expressions of interest were received from over 90 firms.  Over 30 of these submitted more detailed proposals at the next stage of the process and these are now being assessed.  A detailed brief for the study has been prepared and this will be sent to the selected firms for their detailed proposals and pricing.  When this has been completed the contract for the carrying out of the feasibility study will be awarded.  It is expected <Col N="254" /> that the study will last for about ten months and it should be completed by early 1998.  The waterways service's contribution to the study is being supported by INTERREG II.  Funding for the restoration itself will be considered in due course in the light of the findings of the feasibility study.</P>
    <P>Restoring the Ulster Canal would provide a navigation for cruisers and pleasure craft between Lough Neagh, Lough Erne and the Shannon system. On the Erne and linked Shannon system there are over 3,000 pleasure craft of various types.  The reopening of the Shannon-Erne waterway has considerably enhanced the appeal of both the Shannon and the Erne as well as adding attractive destinations to each.  The extension of the Erne navigation to Lough Neagh would again link all the connected waterways of this island and increase the potential of the integrated network for tourism, leisure and development and for the use of the people of the area.</P>
    <P>This feasibility study is another example of the excellent co-operation between the waterways service of my Department and its counterpart in Northern Ireland, the newly established rivers agency of the Department of Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter because of the concern among farmers and employees of Henshaws meat factory which was closed at Christmas.  Limerick city has always been closely associated with the meat business with plants such as Mattersons, Clover Meats and O'Mara's all of which are now closed.</P>
      <P>The present meat plant was built in 1973 to facilitate the slaughter of cattle, sheep and pigs. It operated originally as a municipal abattoir.  In November 1986, Peter Henshaw, a Dublin man who also had a meat plant in Finglas, north Dublin, acquired the abattoir from Limerick Corporation. For the next six years the company supplied meat to domestic markets.</P>
      <P>In 1992, work commenced on a £1.25 million upgrading of the plant and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry approved it for the provision of export beef and lamb.  Three EU inspections were carried out since it was first licensed and some deficiencies were noted.  A further £750,000 has been spent rectifying these deficiencies.  However, despite numerous requests for grants and other assistance, no State funding has been provided.  On 6 December 1996, the company was informed by local senior veterinary inspectors that the decisions had been made to withdraw their services from 3 January because the plant did not comply with EU Directive 497.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite considerable expenditure and renovations over the last couple of months the abattoir still remains closed.  Over the years the work force has increased from 13 in 1986 to its present level of 140 employed in procurement, slaughtering, boning, processing, dispatch, administration, distribution, sales and merchandising. Credit must be given to Henshaws for creating so <Col N="255" /> many jobs in Limerick.  The company supplies a range of customers, including Ireland's leading supermarkets, butchers, caterers, local institutions and wholesalers.  Its products have been sold in Europe, the Middle East, Russia and Japan and sales personnel have been recruited in France and the UK.</P>
    <P>The temporary closure of Henshaws means there is no meat factory operating in Limerick. This is not good for competition.  As a result of price fluctuations, farmers, especially those involved in beef and winter fattening, depend on competition to get the best prices for their finished produce.  The lack of competition due to the closure of Henshaws means that farmers in the Limerick area receive much less for their cattle than they did before Christmas.  I warned the Minister that this would happen.  The prices obtained since Christmas mean that the slaughtering premium is of no benefit to farmers as they are getting 8p less per pound.  I do not know whether the fall in prices is a result of a cartel between the factories but farmers are very frustrated.</P>
    <P>In response to this, farmers organised a protest march led by the IFA in Limerick on 29 January 1997.  The march was well attended by farmers from Clare and Limerick and some of the Henshaws workers.  However, the night before the march, Mr. Henshaw received a telephone call from Michael Miley, programme manager to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. Mr. Miley advised Mr. Henshaw that none of his employees should take part in the march.  This was a peaceful march, yet the Minister's office was advising people not to take part in it.  Three employees of the factory who are friends of mine, one of whom won hurling honours with Limerick, have lost their jobs.  It is a sorry day when people are threatened with the loss of their jobs for taking part in a march.  It would mean that democracy had gone out the window.  Because of this and the magnitude of the problem created by this closure, I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to immediately reinstate his staff so that the slaughter line will reopen and allow the plant to function properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the legislative position in relation to the premises and then to describe the situation there at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1992 the premises was registered with the Department as a cattle and sheep slaughtering premises under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930.  At the same time it was granted an export licence.  The premises was also approved to slaughter and cut up meat under the relevant EU directive on the conditions affecting <Col N="256" /> intra Community trade in fresh meat, as transposed into national legislation.</P>
    <P>As an EU approved premises it is subject to various obligations both general and specific in relation to its approval and as regards the hygiene of the staff, premises and equipment, ante-mortem health inspection, post mortem health inspection, and slaughter, cutting and meat handling hygiene.</P>
    <P>Staff of the Department are deployed at the premises to ensure compliance with those obligations and to provide an export health certification service.  The basic purpose of this system is to protect public health and to ensure a safe product fit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>This premises and other EU approved premises are also subject to ongoing regular inspection by veterinarians from the European Commission and inspections took place in March and November 1993 and in August 1995.</P>
    <P>I will not dwell in detail on the contacts and correspondence with the firm arising from those European Commission inspections, visits by veterinarians of the Department and day to day contacts by Department staff based at the premises. I can, however, summarise the position by saying that all the necessary measures required to maintain the premises in compliance with the requirements were not taken during the period up to the end of 1996.  A situation was arrived at where it was no longer acceptable that slaughtering at this plant could be allowed to continue.  The reasons for this were made clear to the firm on a number of occasions and a detailed list of the deficiencies was provided to them.</P>
    <P>Certain improvements were carried out over the Christmas period.  In the light of that work, the Department restored a service in the meat cutting part of the premises.  As regards slaughtering, however, there is an amount of further work to be done before a slaughtering service can be provided by the Department.  The firm has been kept fully informed on an ongoing basis of exactly what needs to be done and the situation is being kept under continuous review.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns both of the livestock producers in relation to outlets for their production and of employees at the premises processing that livestock.  However, the House will understand that the protection of public health is paramount and that no service will be done to the interests of the industry overall if the highest standards are not observed.  Quite simply we cannot afford to take any short cuts.  The requirements which must be met have been set out clearly and once my Department is satisfied that this has been done the full inspection service will be restored.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 February 1997.</P>
