      <P>I have received notice from Senator Connor that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to make a statement on the derailment at the weekend on the Athlone-Westport railway line near Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to address the structures and operation of small abattoirs.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>As is customary I call the Leader of the House to pay tributes to President McAleese.  I will then call one speaker from each group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs. Mary McAleese on her inauguration yesterday as the eighth President of Ireland. Mary McAleese is someone of whom we can be proud and she is capable of performing the important ambassadorial functions of the presidency. With her style, grace and obvious intelligence, President McAleese will ably represent Irish people at home and abroad.  Given the opportunity she can make a mark similar to that made by her predecessor, Mrs. Mary Robinson, on behalf of the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Closing the divide between the two traditions on this island has been the dominant political objective for many great figures in Irish history. In her inauguration speech our new President pledged to address this task with vigour and, <Col N="642" /> being a native of Ulster, she is particularly qualified to do so.  Yesterday we got a glimpse of the skill and dedication she can being to her role as peacemaker.  In her address President McAleese was conciliatory, unthreatening and completely honest when she set out her aspirations for the future and stated that the challenges are awesome but so too are the rewards.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that President McAleese will meet the many obstacles ahead with grace, charm and a unique style.  I wish her husband, Martin, and children every success in the future.  As they cross the threshold of Áras an Uachtaráin, they will carry with them the nation's best wishes.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to Deputy Spring, former Leader of the Labour Party, who led his party with great distinction for 15 years.  Deputy Spring made a magnificent contribution as Leader of his party and during his two terms as Tánaiste.  One of the achievements for which he will be remembered is the great role he played in promoting the current peace in Northern Ireland.  Deputy Spring is a great friend and I wish him, his wife and family well.  I look forward to listening to his future contributions in the Dáil on behalf of the people of his constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader's warm and sincere words of commendation and praise for President McAleese.  Members who had the honour and privilege to be present at yesterday's inauguration in Dublin Castle were hugely impressed by her enormous sense of presence and style and the dignity and energy she brought to that wonderful occasion.  Everyone was greatly moved by the eloquence of her address.  On behalf of my party, I wish President McAleese every success during the coming seven years.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat taken aback by the Leader's tribute to Deputy Spring.  I thought tributes were paid only when people left the House or left politics.  However, I think Deputy Spring knows how highly I regard him and I will say no more at this stage.</P>

      <P>Tá sé an-éasca a bheith ar chomhaigne le Ceannaire an Tí faoi an Úachtarán nua tofa atá againn.  Tá inti meascán de na rudaí go léir a théann le chéile chun an tír seo a chur le chéile.  In many ways President McAleese is the embodiment of many of the complexities of our society in terms of its problems, its different traditions, its differing traditions within traditions and differing views of how the future should be handled within as well as between traditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I was not a proposer or supporter in the election, I have every confidence in the quality of the work she will do.  I had the privilege of knowing her long before her political aspirations became known.  I had the privilege of working with her and I know her to be a woman who will carry out the job of representing all of us of different traditions with dignity, considerable skill, insight and a good deal of humour.  The <Col N="643" /> things she was responsible for adding to the ceremony were wonderful and brought great life and vivacity to it.  Having children in the Castle yard was a wonderful innovation which added to the sense of a new and different presidency.  I am happy to associate me and my Independent colleagues with the Leader's tribute.</P>
    <P>There is little more that anybody can say about Deputy Spring.  I am still always astonished at those who did not appreciate his sense of humour and those who did not appreciate the man's kindness on many issues.  He is a man of extraordinary courtesy.  As he said, it is funny to be attending your own funeral and it is funny to be paying tribute to somebody who is younger than many, if not most, of us in this House as having effectively completed one part of his political career.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the House and the leaders of the groups in congratulating President Mary McAleese on her election and on the quality of the inauguration ceremony. Those of us who were privileged to be present were most impressed by her fine, broadranging speech in which she covered all aspects of the traditions on this island and emphasised what she would do to build bridges to bring people together.  I have known President McAleese for 20 years in a personal capacity and I have always considered her to be an extremely capable person. She will be our President, an ambassador abroad and a tremendous person at home who will give dignity to that Office.</P>
      <P>She has, as she said, created history; she is the first President from Ulster, and that is to be welcomed. There have been Presidents from Connacht, Munster and Leinster but she is the first from Ulster.  That, in itself, is symbolic.  The previous President, Mary Robinson, who was a very fine President, created history by being the first woman President, so precedents are being established. I look forward to the next seven years with the present incumbent.</P>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the House and the other speakers in paying tribute to Deputy Spring, who has been Leader of my party for the past 15 years, a man who became Leader of the Labour Party at the tender age of 32 after 18 months in the Oireachtas.  To lead a party such as the Labour Party, which at the time was divided ideologically and contained strong personalities, was a daunting task.  He brought it together and wrought it into a party which has been pulling together as a political organisation over the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> He was Tánaiste in three Governments and was a particularly fine Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He contributed enormously to the peace process in the previous two Governments and that will probably be his greatest legacy on the international scene.  He is well known at home and abroad as a statesman.  He is a clear-thinking, humorous and witty individual and it is only now that the pressures of office have left him that the full extent of his character is being seen.  I wish him well in the new freedom and time he will have for himself and his family.  No doubt he will remain in the other House and hold high office in future Governments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a privilege to attend yesterday's historic proceedings in Dublin Castle and to hear the words of our new President.  When the House paid tribute to our outgoing President, Mrs. Robinson, I said she would be a hard act to follow and in this morning's newspapers Senator Hayes made a similar point in a fine analysis of President McAleese's speech.  On the basis of what I heard in Dublin Castle yesterday and saw during the campaign, I am confident that the new President has the qualities required to follow soundly in the footsteps of President Robinson and to progress the work done during her term of office.</P>
      <P>In our new President we have someone who understands but does not underestimate the scale of the challenge facing her and the country as she seeks to bridge a gap, which has existed for a considerable time, between those she described as &ldquo;the comfortable&rdquo; and &ldquo;the struggling&rdquo; in our society.  Those remarks send a powerful message to these Houses and we must listen to and act upon it.</P>
      <P>Her words on the peace process and reconciliation on this island pointed a way forward and she is in a powerful position to advance that cause, even within the constitutional constraints which surround her office.  Anyone who doubted her ability to reach out to the Unionist tradition on this island will have taken great courage from her inauguration speech, which clearly demonstrated a willingness to engage in the wound healing and bridge building which must underpin the peace process.  It was also important that she recognised the sacrifice made by many thousands of Irish people during two world wars, and the part that tradition plays in the fabric of our society and history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recalling the words of the late President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, President McAleese said her presidency would not have policies but would have a theme.  She has signalled her intention to use her Office to maximum potential in the search for lasting peace on this island, the achievement of greater social justice, the promotion of Ireland as a modern, dynamic country, firmly in its stride, and for the creation of a country confident and at ease with itself.  Anyone who was there yesterday could not but have been impressed by her words.  She has made a good <Col N="645" /> start to her presidency and I look forward to her addressing these Houses to expand on some of the themes she outlined yesterday.  I wish her, her husband and her children every good wish and God's blessing during her tenure in the Áras.</P>
    <P>We all recognise Deputy Spring's stature as a politician of the highest calibre within the Houses.  There was a famous occasion, regularly mentioned, when he dropped the ball during a rugby international but it is fair to say that he almost never took his eye off the political football. His party and the country owe him a great debt.  I wish him well in what he does in the future.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3 and 6, motion 7.  We will take the Report and Final Stages of item 1; item 2 is a procedural motion to be taken without debate at the conclusion of item 1; on item 3 the contributions of spokespersons will not exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators will not exceed ten minutes.  If the item 3 is not concluded at 6 p.m. it will resume at 8 p.m. Item 6, motion 7, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty with the Order of Business in that I cannot agree to a ten minute time limit for speakers on the Second Stage of an important Bill.  It is not acceptable. Fifteen minutes is the minimum to which we can agree; spokespersons should have at least 20 minutes.  It is an important Bill and, although there are not many speakers offering, confining them to ten minutes is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>At what time will the House adjourn this evening?  I presume it is intended to conclude Second Stage of the Europol Bill, 1997.  I will not be present for the debate but will it be open ended?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader of the House facilitate debate on a motion to discuss the contribution of teachers to the development of society and the economy?  Senator Ross raised a matter of great importance last week.  The reason I seek a discussion on the matter is that it has come to my attention that, having spent 12 years in school, many people are inclined to talk back to their betters, so to speak.  This is a matter of great discomfort to stockbrokers, editors, the landed gentry and the like.  It is a matter we should consider seriously.  I have sympathy for Senator Ross because it has been noticed that people with country accents are going for jobs in competition <Col N="646" /> with west Brit types.  We should examine the impact on society in this regard.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to abuse my contribution to the Order of Business but there is a threat to the oligarchy.  Pol Pot began by assassinating the teachers, the professionals and the academics and if people such as Senator Ross ever got into power I fear they might begin the same process.  We should examine the impact of education on the development of society.  I am sorry Senator Ross is not here to contribute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose the following amendment to the Order of Business: &ldquo;That item 5 on the Order Paper be taken before item 1&rdquo;.  The net effect of this would enable the proposed Private Members' Bill dealing with the problem of unfinished estates throughout the country to be printed and debated in Labour Party Private Members' time.  Will the Leader agree to this reasonable request to have the Bill printed?  If so I will withdraw my proposed amendment.</P>
      <P>There is great concern among the TEAM Aer Lingus workers, particularly the Aer Lingus staff working there.  Will the Leader contact the Taoiseach on this matter and secure a commitment that the Taoiseach's undertaking given to the workforce before the last general election with regard to the letters of guarantee will be honoured by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise the Leader has a substantial list of business to be taken by the House before Christmas.  However, I ask him to arrange a debate on the funding of local authorities and to request the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to attend.  Because of the changes taking place in local authorities and the various demands on them, the House should get an update on the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> local government and the national Administration.  Such a debate is paramount because the structure on the ground is changing, for example, road workers are no longer employed by local authorities.  I seek a debate on the allocation of funding which would be valuable for all local authorities.  It is the responsibility of the House to initiate that type of debate and to give leadership to local authorities that Members represent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to make time available to discuss the fact that over 500,000 people in Ireland have literacy problems.  This is of major concern, particularly to people who provide literacy skills.  Will the Leader indicate to the Minister for Education and Science the disappointment of many people that he or the Minister of State at his Department did not attend a conference in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham last <Col N="647" /> week which discussed responses to this problem. The view at the conference and elsewhere is that there is an anomaly in the funding provided by the Department because £250 million is being spent to make people computer literate but only £250,000 is being provided for literacy programmes. A debate in the House might clarify the agenda and the Minister might respond more positively to those who are endeavouring to promote literacy.  I hope the Leader will make time available to discuss this matter in detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole.  I am equally critical of a treble jobbing stock-broker, editor and Senator criticising the tax paying sector of the economy which is well known for its hard work and contribution to society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that aspect as an aside.  It is important the Leader accepts the amendment.  The House constantly discusses giving more power and scope to Senators.  One such way is to deal with legislation initiated by individual Members.  We should applaud the fact that a Senator has produced this Bill and accept it with open arms.</P>
      <P>There are protesters outside the gates of Leinster House today from the area of Lough Muckno who oppose the sale of 600 acres in Castleblayney which is currently being used as a leisure park. They want the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to ensure that Coillte retains this land in State ownership so the people of the locality can continue to enjoy it.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs about a report published recently about Roisín McAliskey?  This report is the result of an inquiry which found that there is no factual basis for the arrest, detention or extradition of this lady, and it has also warned that unless this case is dealt with and she is released, it will have a serious impact on the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inquiry was chaired by Mr. Ramsey Clarke, a former Attorney General of the United <Col N="648" /> States.  Can the Leader convey to the Minister that Mr. Clarke's report concludes that the case against Ms McAliskey is politically motivated?  This is a frightening scenario that suggests Lord Denning's &ldquo;appalling vista&rdquo; is being revisited on another Irish citizen, a young mother suffering very severe ill health.  The Minister should ask if Britain has forgotten the outrageous miscarriages of justice perpetrated in its name against Irish citizens.  The cases of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four are still alive in the minds of Irish people.  Given the concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is it possible to get the facts about the oil spillage in Cork harbour last week?  We got different information about what was spilt, but nobody seems to be giving all the facts.  This is serious, and a reply should have been given before now.  The Minister responsible, whether the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or the Minister for Public Enterprise, should inform this House or the Dáil urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I dissociate myself from the manner and tone of the attacks on my colleague, Senator Ross.  I did not agree with what he said about the teachers.  It was a clever stunt which got him what he wanted &mdash; newspaper headlines.  However, it is unfortunate that a Senator is attacked in his or her absence, and I think it is against the rules of the House.  The Cathaoirleach can guide me in this matter, but it is not done to refer to a Senator's absence, and it was wrong to permit it. The glancing references to landed gentry and &ldquo;West Brits&rdquo; are not in tone with the dignity of this House either, and I regret them.  I also dissociate myself from Senator Ross's remarks last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Children Bill, 1997, is item 4; I assume that indicates it will be taken very soon.  Will the Leader indicate whether it will be taken this week or in the next fortnight?  I support my Labour Party colleagues' call for the publication of the Local Government Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill and I hope the Leader agrees to this.  I also support the comments regarding the development in Lough Muckno.  I raised a similar matter on the Adjournment last week regarding the use of EU funding to desecrate Carton House.  It seems that here again EU money potentially is being used in a manner that is undemocratic and that it removes the right of free access from citizens to <Col N="649" /> this beautiful part of the country.  I strongly support what my colleague, Senator Costello, said about trying to get the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources involved, particularly since it appears no environmental impact study was carried out.</P>

      <P>I want to protest not about today's Order of Business &mdash; I have no problem taking Second Stage of the Europol Bill, 1997 &mdash; but about the intention to finish tonight at 10 p.m. and then pass the Remaining Stages of the Bill tomorrow morning.  We should have learned that if we rush through legislation, we do not expect the Government to listen to what we have to say. It is only a week since we rushed through an amending Bill on criminal justice after &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; legislation was introduced a few months ago.  If we do not get our act together, this House will not earn the respect of the nation.  We need not look for reform from outside because it is in our hands.  When we plan to pass legislation within a week with no time between Second and Subsequent Stages, we do ourselves a disservice.  We should not do this in future.</P>
      <P>As regards the millennium bomb, I read today that many computers are unable to cater for the changeover from 1999 to the year 2,000.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment on 12 March. The then Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment promised that she would ask Forfás to consider establishing a national task force and an information awareness campaign.  I read in the newspapers today that seven out of 16 Departments in Britain have failed to complete the costed action plans to tackled the problem.</P>
      <P>The reason it is important is traffic lights and blood transfusion units, for example, which are linked to computers will cause trouble on 1 January 2000.  In March the Minister said action was being taken and promised something would happen but I have not heard about anything since.  I am worried by what has happened in Britain where seven Departments did not reach their targets. I ask the Leader to draw the Minister's attention to the urgency of this matter.  Rather than raise the matter on the Adjournment again, I ask that attention be given to this matter so the nation will be able to respond to this problem.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader facilitate me and other Members by asking the relevant Minister when the task force recommendations on the travelling community will be implemented?  This also ties in with previous remarks on unfinished <Col N="650" /> estates with which I would like to be associated. Those of us who represent greater Dublin areas, in particular, badly need a debate on the travelling community and, in some cases, the settled community.  The situation is desperate.  The task force report has been gathering dust for two years.  My esteemed colleague, Senator Quinn, spoke about task forces, which I often think are a waste of time as they sometimes take three years to complete a report with no results.  In this case, it is crucial that we do something about this escalating problem.</P>

      <P>I recently read of the reported confession of a former member of the Algerian secret police regarding atrocities committed.

The man's evidence is disturbing because it seems that some of the worst atrocities committed against a civilian population in any country in recent times may have been perpetrated by Government forces. This merits a question from the Minister at international level.  If it is proven, there should be a debate and a decision should be made at international level.</P>

      <P>On the points raised by Senator O'Toole and Senator Jackman, there is no difficulty having a debate on the work of teachers.  Lough Muckno was raised by Senator Costello and Senator Norris.  This matter could be dealt with in Private Members' business or on the Adjournment.  I assure the House that the Minister will contribute to whichever is convenient.  There is a substantial amount of legislation coming before the House between now and Christmas and this should be borne in mind when Members call for various debates on the Order of Business.  If the House wishes, I can set aside a special day for debates.</P>
      <P>I have considered Senator Seán Ryan's request in relation to item 5 and I have no objection to it.  I am only too pleased to accede to Senator McGowan's request for a debate on local authority funding, which will take place before the Christmas recess.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Murchú and Senator Finneran expressed concern about Róisín McAliskey's situation and asked me to bring it to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I will do so immediately after the Order of Business and I will then contact the Senators.</P>

Perhaps the Whips might discuss this matter after <Col N="652" /> the Order of Business to see how we can facilitate Senator Quinn's request.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge asked for a debate on the report of the task force on the travelling community. Perhaps that could be taken in Private Members' Time.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it might be helpful to make a few remarks on the Bill, which I am delighted to have the opportunity to bring before the Seanad on Report Stage.  I wish to give Senators a brief outline of the Bill which I introduced on Second Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is the largest single piece of legislation in the history of the State.  It consolidates the law <Col N="653" /> relating to income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  It is widely recognised and accepted that these three taxes have a large measure of integration and interdependence.  For example, income tax and corporation tax share a close commonality of rules and concepts, and capital gains tax rules are applied for the purposes of charging corporation tax in certain instances.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the first consolidation of tax law since the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That Act was, as the title suggests, confined to income tax.  Since 1967, we have seen the introduction of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, and the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  These three codes of law have been amended annually, and on occasion twice or even three times a year, in various Finance Acts and other fiscal legislation.</P>
    <P>There are, in all, currently 40 separate Acts containing income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax law.  In addition, much of the legislation introduced in recent years has been increasingly complex in nature.  There is no doubt that the difficulties of interpretation and administration which users of the tax code experience have been compounded by the absence of consolidation.</P>
    <P>Since the last consolidation of income tax law in 1967 the legislation governing income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax has grown to over 2,000 separate sections and some 50 related Schedules.  The Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997, has succeeded in reducing this vast volume of legislation to 1,104 sections and 32 Schedules. What is even more important, from the point of view of the users of this legislation, is that the Bill organises all this law in a coherent and logical way so that one is able to navigate one's way around the legislation with a confidence which was not possible in the past.  I know Members of both Houses and others have commented on that welcome feature of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of a consolidation Bill is to consolidate all the existing statute law on a particular subject or subjects.  I ask Members to note that the only permissible amendments are ones which remove ambiguities and inconsistencies from the Bill, substitute modern for obsolete or inconvenient machinery, achieve uniformity of expression in the Bill, or adapt the Bill to existing law and practice.</P>
    <P>A consolidation Bill may not make any substantive amendments to the law.  It must also be certified by the Attorney General as a consolidating measure.  The Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997, has been certified by the Attorney General as such.  I assure Senators that this Bill makes no substantive changes in the law and has been certified by the Attorney General as such.</P>
    <P>It may be a matter for comment as to why this mammoth task has been undertaken if it does not make any changes in the law.  However, this is to miss the point; the Bill will deliver many benefits to the business community, tax practitioners and administrators, legislators and, to an extent, the public at large.  It will transform the way in which <Col N="654" /> accountants, tax practitioners and the legal profession deal with their clients' affairs, allowing them to ensure that the services they offer are efficient and cost effective.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also have a significant impact on young people who are training in these professions, by simplifying their research tasks.  As I have already stated, one of the principal benefits of consolidation will be to reduce the volume of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax by almost one half.  There are other important benefits which I want to bring to the attention of Senators.  All income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax legislation will now be available in a single up-to-date Act, in a coherent, orderly and more simplified format.  The legislation will be more accessible and user friendly to the business community, tax practitioners and Members of the Oireachtas.  This will be of particular advantage to smaller firms of tax practitioners and smaller businesses.  As part of the consolidation process a significant amount of deadwood and obsolete material has been eliminated from the tax code and there has been considerable simplication in content.  All future changes to the taxes involved should be capable of being slotted into the Consolidation Act by amendment, an important feature which has been widely welcomed. Our tax legislation will be more coherent to foreign advisors and the task of future simplification of the tax system will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>It is also intended that the Taxes Consolidation Bill will be available in CD-ROM format when the Bill is enacted.  To assist in the consideration of the Bill the Revenue Commissioners arranged to have a document entitled &ldquo;Outline of Provisions&rdquo; published with the Bill.  This very useful outline gives a brief straightforward description of each of the sections of the Bill and should be a useful aid to Members in their examination of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Revenue Commissioners will be publishing detailed notes for guidance on the legislation as soon as possible after enactment. This publication will also be made available on CD-ROM.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into 1,104 sections comprised in 49 Parts, dealing with different aspects of the income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax codes.  However, in order to facilitate the reader and to simplify the language and presentation, a number of novel features are introduced. These features include the concept of &ldquo;superheading&rdquo; or families of related subjects, the placing of definitions in all cases at the beginning of provisions, the elimination of archaic language and of the old fashioned and complex device of &ldquo;provisos&rdquo; to qualify the meaning of a section.</P>
    <P>To assist readers, the Bill is accompanied by a memorandum, as required by Standing Orders, which shows the enactments which are proposed to be repealed by the Bill and the sections of the Bill in which these enactments are reproduced.  If a particular provision has not been re-enacted in <Col N="655" /> the Consolidation Bill an explanation will be found in the remarks column of the memorandum.</P>
    <P>I would like to record my appreciation of the time and effort Deputy Michael Ferris obviously spent in examining this Bill.  He tabled a large number of amendments to the Bill, some of which were ruled out of order and others which could not be accepted.  However, quite a number of the Deputy's amendments were accepted and improved the form of the Bill by removing inconsistencies without affecting the underlying legislation. It was due to the Deputy's efforts that we had a constructive debate and a thorough examination of the Bill in the Standing Joint Committee. My thanks also to those Senators who participated as members of that committee.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on the record my appreciation of the time and effort of everybody involved in this project.  Initially, as Senators will be aware, a five year time frame was envisaged.  It is a testament to the efficiency and professionalism of the Revenue Commissioners that the Bill is now before the House.  On other occasions I have acknowledged the tremendous work done by the committee, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the private sector.</P>
    <P>I also wish to commend the work of Mr. Liam Hennessy, who chaired the committee.  He has subsequently moved on to greater things but I am glad to see he is so interested in this area that he is here today to see the legislation's final passage through the House.</P>
    <P>I congratulate and commend the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who had the foresight to embark on this project.  He announced it in his budget speech in January 1995.  It has been a tremendous achievement by all concerned in such a short space of time.  It proves that if the systems and structures are put in place there is great capacity within our own staff, in its various guises, to deliver the highest quality of excellence in the public service.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 79, line 37, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;continue to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State on his lucid introduction to the Bill and for the initiative which was taken initially by the Department of Finance under my colleague the former Minister, Deputy Quinn.  Perhaps this type of consolidation could be suggested to other Departments who may follow the same line.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform might do something similar to the <i>Code Napoléon</i> in France which had the effect of consolidating a vast array of criminal legislation in that country. It extended to influence the entire criminal legislative system of other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the largest single item of legislation in the history of the State.  It has meant that previous provisions have been reduced by approximately <Col N="656" /> half of what they would have been, although it is still daunting legislation to read through.</P>
    <P>My remarks on the amendments are within the terms of reference the Minister of State outlined as regards what is permissible for amendments, removing ambiguities and inconsistencies from the Bill, substituting modern for obsolete or inconvenient machinery, achieving uniformity of expression and adapting the Bill to existing law and practice.</P>
    <P>This amendment is within the terms of the first permissible criteria of removing ambiguities and inconsistencies from the Bill.  The provision in question ceased to apply in 1986 so in simple literal terms it cannot cease to apply again.  It is illogical for something to cease to apply on successive or consecutive occasions.  If it no longer applies it cannot cease to apply.  The provision, as worded, does not, for that reason, express existing law as it implies that section 2(4)(b)(vii) of the 1985 Act currently applies.</P>
    <P>This is a tidying up amendment.  It would be simply more accurate to say that the 1985 Act &ldquo;shall continue to cease to apply&rdquo; because it already applies.  It would appear to be a more specific and logical terminology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this point.  As I am sure he is aware, the amendment is a repeat of one discussed on Report Stage in the Lower House.  It relates to section 7 of the Bill which consolidates the provisions of section 112 of the Finance Act, 1986.  That provided for the application of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, to certain taxation statutes.  In order to apply the provisions of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, to tax law, section 112 of the Finance Act, 1986, provided for the formal cesser of the provision in the Age of Majority Act, 1985, which had prevented such application &mdash; namely, section 2(4)(b)(vii) of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this formal cesser, the amendment now proposes that the words &ldquo;shall cease to apply&rdquo; in section 7(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Bill be replaced with the words &ldquo;shall continue to cease to apply&rdquo;.  The concern would seem to be that as section 2(4)(b)(vii) of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, ceased to apply back in 1986 when the underlying legislation was enacted, it cannot cease to apply again if it already no longer applies. <Col N="657" /> The difficulty I have with the Senator's amendment is that it seems to suggest the legislation contained in the Taxes Consolidation Bill is in some way new legislation.  As I have already pointed out, this is not so.  The Bill consolidates existing law.  Section 7 of the Bill, as drafted, faithfully replicates the underlying legislation, namely, section 112 of the Finance Act, 1986. Legislation is always current and should be read as current.  Accordingly, the phrase &ldquo;shall cease to apply&rdquo;, while having effect back in 1986, has equal effect in 1997.  For those reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made it clear to the Senator that what was clear in 1986 and what it referred to, which was current in 1986, is equally current in 1997 because we have just consolidated the existing legislation.  Therefore, I will not be accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made by the Minister of State that what we are talking about is consolidation legislation and we are bringing together all the existing legislation.  Therefore, this is restating the present situation.  However, what is actually in the text of section 7 refers specifically to the Age of Majority Act, 1985, which states that &ldquo;accordingly, section 2(4)(b)(vii) of the Act shall cease to apply&rdquo;. While, obviously, it has been incorporated into the Taxes Consolidation Act, which consists of all the legislation's provisions that have been enacted, and that it is new legislation in that sense, nevertheless this proviso refers specifically to an Act of 1985.  The form in which it refers to it, &ldquo;that is shall cease to apply&rdquo; as of now, is as though it is something new.  However, in the context of the wording before us it certainly would in logical English be better to have it clearly incorporated that this would continue to cease to apply because the Act is referred to.</P>
      <P>I know what the Minister of State is saying in relation to this new legislation.  Nevertheless, within that the logic of the argument would be that the continuation of the cessation should be applicable.  I know we are dealing with points of ambiguity and expression, but it seems to me that the amendment would be more accurate than the explanation given by the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat everything I have said to the Senator.  I understand precisely the point he is making.  However, the implication in his amendment is that insertion of the words implies that something has been changed when nothing has been changed.  There is no need to do it.  If some future Finance Act contained sections which referred back to that and which made changes, it would be relevant in the context of that legislation.  However, the Attorney General considered that there is no change in this consolidation legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 97, line 39, to delete &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to achieve uniformity of expression.  The expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; is used more widely in the Bill, for example, it occurs in sections 73 and 830.  On Committee Stage, the Minister outlined that the present terms of expression &mdash;&ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; and &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; could be used. However, as the purpose of these amendments is to achieve uniformity we should agree on one term of expression.  It is unsatisfactory to use two terms.  What is the difference between &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; and &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;?  Is it legal or geographical?</P>
      <P>Was the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs sought regarding the formal terminology to be used when describing our neighbour?  What is the justification for using two formats in this consolidation legislation, the purpose of which is to avoid ambiguity and repetition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are intended to achieve uniformity of expression by substituting the term &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; for &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; wherever it occurs in the Bill.  The point has been made that the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; is used more widely in the Bill.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the aim of these amendments, there may well be good reasons why the Oireachtas has used slightly different versions in the past to describe what, at first sight, might seem to be the same thing.  We should, therefore, be careful in making changes in case we inadvertently make a substantive change to the underlying law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 seek to amend the provisions of section 29 of the Bill which modify the charge to capital gains tax in the case of gains arising to resident or ordinarily resident individuals who are not domiciled in the State from the disposal of assets which are situated outside the State and the United Kingdom.  I am informed that the parliamentary draftsman's office has advised that replacing the expression &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; with the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; could, in certain circumstances, result in a slight change of the meaning of the underlying legislation.  For example, what would be the status of the United Kingdom's areas of the continental shelf, or even the territorial seas of the United Kingdom?  In this connection, I refer Senators to section 276 of the <Col N="659" /> Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act, 1992, which is the United Kingdom equivalent of our Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, where the territorial sea of the United Kingdom is deemed, for all purposes of the taxation of chargeable gains, to be part of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In the light of this provision, it is arguable that using the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; in Irish legislation instead of the term &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; may, in some instances, have the effect of excluding such areas from the scope of the legislation, thereby changing the existing law.  In view of the possibility of these amendments making a substantive change in the law, which is outside the remit of consolidation, I must oppose them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister of State's statement that there may be slight changes in meaning between the two expressions.  However, I have not received a satisfactory clarification as to why one is substantially different from the other.  I would have thought that the continental shelf of the United Kingdom would imply the same as the continental shelf of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that the totality of the United Kingdom would be expressed in whatever geographical description is referred to.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to resolve the degree of ambiguity in using the two terms.  I always understood they were synonymous. However, I cannot argue against the advice received by the Minister of State that there may be a slight difference in the implications of whichever terminology is used.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for his protection. As already stated, the purpose of amendment No. 6 is to remove ambiguity and inconsistency. References to the law, particularly the tax law, relating to a country may be different in respect of individual sectors because tax often applies in a state, federal and regional capacity in the same country.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 was tabled because it is not correct to refer to the tax laws of a country where the country in question has a number of subordinate jurisdictions or territories.  The original amendment proposed by the Minister on Committee Stage referred to a &ldquo;territory&rdquo; and he criticised that term, which is acceptable.  Nevertheless, the amendment under discussion seems to be satisfactory in that it proposes the use of &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;country&rdquo; because the former term is more aptly applied to that to which we are referring.  For example, a country such as Ireland may have a single tax system while another utilises the multiple system of state, federal and regional taxation to which I referred earlier.  If one refers to a &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;country&rdquo;, one is being more accurate, unambiguous and consistent.</P>
      <P>It appears that this country or jurisdiction &mdash; the two are synonymous when discussing Ireland &mdash; is moving towards ring-fencing or designating local authority funding in terms of motor taxation. Therefore, forthcoming legislation may contain reference to a sectoral type of tax which would not be applicable in the same fashion.  In that context, it would be more appropriate to specify that we are referring to the jurisdiction in which tax is paid rather than to the country involved.  As already stated, there can be internal divisions of tax within a country but the jurisdiction within which it applies is specific.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments relating to sections 200, 487, 826 and 828 are being discussed together and their purpose is to achieve uniformity of expression in the Bill by substituting the expression &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; for references to &ldquo;state&rdquo; or &ldquo;country&rdquo;.  Amendments of a similar nature were discussed in detail by the Joint <Col N="661" /> Standing Committee and on Report Stage in the Lower House.  On those occasions, the amendments proposed to substitute the expression &ldquo;territory&rdquo; for references to &ldquo;country&rdquo; and &ldquo;state&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As Senator Costello pointed out, it is always desirable to achieve uniformity of expression in legislation.  However, sections 200, 487, 826 and 828 of the Taxes Consolidation Bill faithfully replicate the underlying legislation.  Hence, in some cases the word &ldquo;country&rdquo; is used while in others the word &ldquo;state&rdquo; is used.  Senators Costello, Gallagher, O'Meara and Seán Ryan now propose that the word &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; be substituted for the words &ldquo;country&rdquo; and &ldquo;state&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;country&rdquo; can mean a geographic area of a nation or state with its own government while the word &ldquo;state&rdquo; can mean a nation, commonwealth or organised political community under one government or such a community forming part of a federal republic.  On the other hand, the term &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; can be construed as having a much wider meaning than those of &ldquo;state&rdquo;, &ldquo;country&rdquo; or &ldquo;territory&rdquo;.  For example, it can mean any legal or other authority.  There is ample precedence for reference in legislation to the term &ldquo;state&rdquo; when referring to other countries such as in Article 29.3 of the Constitution which contains the phrase &ldquo;in its relations with other states&rdquo;.  Moreover, if we take the amendments proposed to lines 16 and 17 of page 1132 of the Bill which deal with the negotiation of double taxation treaties with foreign states, I am of the firm view that the existing references to &ldquo;state&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign state&rdquo; should remain.  A &ldquo;head of state&rdquo; in the context of the head of a foreign state and the negotiation of international treaties has an international currency.  The alternative phrase &ldquo;head of a foreign jurisdiction&rdquo; would at best be a somewhat awkward construction and at worst open to question.</P>
      <P>Regardless of how desirable it may be to achieve consistency in the Bill, to accept the amendments could run the real risk of making a substantive change to the underlying law.  As the House is aware, we cannot make new law in the context of the Taxes Consolidation Bill.  Therefore, we cannot take the risk of accepting amendments which could undermine the status of the Bill as a consolidation measure.  Changes of the nature being sought by Senators Costello, Gallagher, O'Meara and Seán Ryan would be best pursued by way of substantive alteration of the law through the vehicle of the annual Finance Bill.  In other words, the Senators are free to table similar amendments to future Finance Bills. However, in the context of this Bill, I must oppose the amendments for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State provided definitions of &ldquo;country&rdquo; as a geographic area, &ldquo;state&rdquo; as a nation under government and &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; as a wider legal entity.  However, I am of the opinion that the definition of the term &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; is narrower because it is defined by law <Col N="662" /> whereas the term &ldquo;country&rdquo; defines a geographic area and is not a legal definition.  The expression &ldquo;state&rdquo; is a legal definition in terms of it being an area under government.  I am not sure how the term &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; is taken as having wider implications because I believe it is more specific.</P>
      <P>With regard to future Finance Bills and the suggestion that new law might be created by using such terminology as &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo;, the full repercussions and implications of which may not be understood if it were not used in the past in the context of the tax laws, that is a moot point which I will take on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's response.  I am aware that the definitions are quite complicated but I have no doubt that there are differences involved.  The term &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; is very broad and contains wider implications than the words &ldquo;country&rdquo; or &ldquo;state&rdquo;.  For example, a jurisdiction can extend to mean any authority such as a county council or a controlling body such as the medical council.  There are many additional possibilities contained under the definition of &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo;. We communicated with the Revenue Commissioners on this issue and their strong view is that the words &ldquo;country&rdquo; and &ldquo;state&rdquo; should not be changed because &ldquo;state&rdquo; has an international currency in treaty negotiations while &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; does not.  This confirms that it would be unwise to proceed with the amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 1346, line 20, to delete &ldquo;a felony or misdemeanour&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an offence&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove ambiguity and inconsistency and to achieve uniformity <Col N="663" /> of expression.  As the Minister outlined, that is the criteria for these amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997 which abolished the offences of felony and misdemeanour, was enacted on 22 April 1997 and came into effect on 22 July 1997 so references to felony or misdemeanour in existing law should appropriately be to an offence.  The amendment, therefore, reflects existing law.  In any case it would be wrong to refer in a Bill to categories of offences which have been abolished, as in this case.  No change in the intended scope of the section is involved.</P>
    <P>The distinction between felony and misdemeanour was abolished in the 1997 Act other than in cases where, with reference to Article 50 of the Constitution, a Member of this or the other House might be arrested for a felony or misdemeanour on his or her way to the House &mdash; the offences of treason, felony or misdemeanour were the only exceptions.  Now that most recent amending legislation has become law, I do not see why the Taxes Consolidation Bill should still refer to these two offences, felony or misdemeanour.</P>
    <P>Section 1070 states that the Tax Acts shall not affect any criminal proceedings for a felony or misdemeanour.  Why not replace that with &ldquo;any criminal proceedings for an offence&rdquo; and bring it into line with this year's legislative development?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of clarification, the amendments which were ruled out of order were not ruled out of order by me or the Department but by the Chair.</P>
      <P>The point the Senator raises in amendment No. 24 and his other amendments are interesting and they are a valuable contribution to the debate.  I hope my explanations are clear.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to replace the references to a felony or misdemeanour in section 1070 with a reference to &ldquo;an offence&rdquo;.  The amendment is prompted by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997.  Section 3(1) of that Act provides for the abolition of all distinctions between felony and misdemeanour.  While section 3(2) establishes that in all matters on which a distinction had previously been made between felony and misdemeanour, the law in practice in relation to all offences will be the law in practice applicable at the commencement of the Act in relation to misdemeanour.</P>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment for a number of reasons.  First, the amendment is inappropriate in that the Criminal Law Act, 1997 did not come into operation until 22 July 1997 while the provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Bill will commence with effect from 6 April 1997.  The amendment would, therefore, operate, if accepted, on a retrospective basis for a period in which there would have been a distinction between felony and misdemeanour.  As such, the amendment proposes to make a substantive change to the underlying law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> Second, the Criminal Law Act, 1997 did not abolish the concept of felony and misdemeanour <i>per se</i>; it abolished all distinctions between the two concepts.  It further provided that where there was previously a distinction made between felony and misdemeanour, including the mode of trial, the law and practice in relation to all offences will be that appropriate to a misdemeanour.</P>
    <P>In the light of the actual wording of the Criminal Law Act, 1997, it is too simplistic to take the line that felonies and misdemeanours have been abolished.  As I have just outlined, this amendment could have the intended result of changing the current law.  As such, the amendment, if accepted, could impact adversely on current efforts to bring criminal proceedings in the area of tax evasion by obscuring and casting doubt on what is the correct legal position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>When the other House debated the Criminal Law Act, 1997, my understanding was that the intention was to abolish the two separate categories of offence, felony and misdemeanour, and incorporate them in the term &ldquo;offence&rdquo;, that it was not just the distinction but the use of the terminology which was being abolished for all future criminal law cases and Acts. What the Minister had to say in that regard is unclear to me.</P>
      <P>On the point that the Criminal Law Act, 1997 comes into operation on 22 July 1997 whereas the Taxes Consolidation Act will apply from 6 April 1997, if it is true that there might be a period where we could run foul of the new Act and there would be distinctive offences of felony or misdemeanour, I will take the Minister's word for it if the unintended result of changing the law would be to allow somebody to escape because we did not have an exact definition which applied at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>I seek further clarification on whether the concepts of felony and misdemeanour have been integrated into a single offence or whether we have simply abolished the distinction.  Are we still operating with the terms &ldquo;felony&rdquo; and &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo;?  I had thought that we were abolishing the words &ldquo;felony&rdquo; and &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo; as legal terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point the Senator has made and I want to be clear on it.  We have actually only abolished the distinction between them.  The concept of each term exists in its own right but the abolition of the distinction between them was the only impact of the Act to which I referred earlier.  I hope that clarifies the matter.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on a job well done.  This is a fantastic piece of work. There was a thorough discussion of the Bill in the Joint Committee but as I am not a Member of that committee I was not in a position to attend the meetings.  I welcome the Bill and pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Ferris, who is proud of having had 97 amendments accepted.  He is pleased that the Minister was generous enough to accept those amendments and hopes he will be included in the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i> for his achievement.  It is also historic that the Department and the Minister showed such openness in allowing discussion and accepting amendments when they add to the Bill.  The same openness was shown today.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be the first legislation to be signed by our new President.  The legislation is, therefore, doubly historic in that it is the largest single Bill ever enacted.

It was a remarkable achievement.  I thank Senators, especially Senator Costello, for their commitment to and interest in the Bill.  That approach was taken on all sides of both Houses. The Bill will be of great benefit to us as legislators, to the professional bodies and to small businesses which we want to assist as much as possible by removing much of the difficult language and red tape which are barriers to the speedy making of decisions.  We did not intend that President McAleese should have to sign such a formidable Bill following her inauguration yesterday but it does show the interest of both Houses in bringing forward valuable legislation.

    <Title>Europol Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Europol Bill is an enabling Bill allowing Ireland to ratify the 1995 Europol Convention and related protocols.  The convention provides a framework for law enforcement co-operation in the field of international organised crime.  It provides for the <Col N="666" /> establishment of Europol on a statutory basis to facilitate the exchange of information and intelligence between the law enforcement authorities of the member states of the European Union, and to carry out in-depth analyses of the crimes within its remit.  Europol's central objective will be to assist member states in preventing and combating serious organised international crime affecting two or more member states.</P>
      <P>As a small island nation on the periphery of Europe, we might like to regard ourselves as in some way immune to or removed from the full effects of international crime but he reality is different.  There is reason to believe that our geography lends itself to Ireland being used by highly organised criminals as a gateway to and from the rest of Europe, thus leaving us particularly exposed to all forms of international crime. This is especially so in the area of drug trafficking, where Ireland's extensive coast line has been used for the importation of large quantities of illegal drugs for use not only in this country but also in other European countries, causing untold misery and sometimes even death to our young people.  Also, we are recently beginning to see Ireland becoming a focus for illegal immigrant smugglers.  It is all too clear to us that a small country cannot tackle these problems effectively on its own.  We need to share information and intelligence with other countries regarding the operations of these criminals, their <i>modus operandi,</i> their networks and the routes they use.</P>
      <P>Organised crime, particularly crimes such as drug trafficking which generate large financial profits, are especially hard to combat.  These criminals have vast resources at their disposal, often exceeding those of countries.  They are versatile and exploit weaknesses or loopholes wherever they exist.  They have the resources to employ skilled people and to use a sinister carrot and stick approach, by way of bribery and threats, to overcome any obstacles in their way.  It would be naive to think such ruthless criminals could be defeated by anything other than an energetic, pro-active and multi-faceted approach, embracing effective international co-operation and a zero tolerance policy in this country.  My policy includes both of these elements.</P>
      <P>The ratification of the Europol Convention, on which I will elaborate further, will be a milestone in development of co-operation between the 15 EU member states in the fight against international organised crime.  It will not only enhance the flow of information and intelligence but will give significant added value to these through in-depth analysis with the aid of a sophisticated computer system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As any police or customs officer will tell you, access to intelligence and information is essential for the tackling of organised crime, be it on a domestic or an international scale.  It is absolutely crucial when crime goes beyond national boundaries. Criminals exploit differences in our legal systems.  They use sophisticated aliases.  They develop complex trafficking routes, often zigzagging <Col N="667" /> through several countries, to avoid detection. National boundaries are no obstacle to them.  In fact they are one of the tools which they use to defeat the law enforcement authorities.  We must fight back.  The pooled information which Europol will have and the added value which it will give to it through in-depth analysis of criminal organisations, their <i>modus operandi,</i> their ever changing trafficking routes and their personnel will be of major assistance to the member states.</P>
    <P>The convention also includes provisions which will enable Europol to give information to and receive it from international organisations, for example Interpol, and countries outside the EU subject to certain safeguards.  This will assist in tackling crime on a world scale.  This is of considerable importance and particularly relevant in tackling drug trafficking and money laundering. With the exception of synthetic drugs and home grown cannabis, the illegal drugs abused in the EU are produced outside the EU.  In the case of money laundering vast sums of money can be transferred in a matter of seconds by electronic wire transfer, not only from one country to another but through several countries and an intricate series of financial companies.  Ratification of the Europol Convention will be a significant step in tackling these crimes.</P>
    <P>With regard to international co-operation, I wish to congratulate the Garda and to express my appreciation for its vigilance which resulted in very significant seizures of drugs at the week end at Enfield, County Meath, and Dublin Airport. Such operations depend on international co-operation and highlight its importance.</P>
    <P>The fight against crime on the international front is complemented by the Government's zero tolerance policy at home.  The concept of zero tolerance is above all else directed at positive action against serious criminals, especially those involved in the drugs trade and organised crime generally.  My objective is to provide the Garda with the means, equipment and manpower to investigate all crimes.  My aim is to ensure that all crimes are investigated, where possible detected and, where the interests of justice and society so require, prosecuted.  The victims of house breakers, burglars and car thieves do not regard these crimes as trivial or minor and neither does the Government.</P>
    <P>I take seriously the duty of the State to protect the citizens' right to live in peace free of the fear of criminal intrusion.  The worst form of intrusion at this time is generated by the bosses of drugs and other organised crime.  They blight and often destroy young lives and, thereby, sentence entire communities in city and country to an intolerable existence.  Recent research has shown that drugs are responsible for up to two thirds of all crime.</P>
    <P>The Government's zero tolerance approach is about action on the ground and by way of legislation to curb the activities of drug dealers and other serious criminals.  The citizens demand that <Col N="668" /> and are entitled to it.  I want zero tolerance to meet that demand in full.  The Government is committed to providing 1,000 more prison spaces in two years; increasing Garda numbers to 12,000 over the next few years; giving agency status to the prison service and the courts to help them function more efficiently; encouraging various Garda operational initiatives to strengthen its hand in fighting serious crime and an imaginative legislative programme on which I will expand.</P>
    <P>I am determined to fine comb the criminal laws to remove every obstacle to fast, efficient and fair administration of justice and to close off loopholes being exploited by criminals.  As legislators we must ensure that the fight against crime is enhanced by our work.  I will publish shortly the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, which will contain measures on speedier trials; minimum sentences in relation to serious drug trafficking offences; the initiation by the courts of inquiries into the assets of persons convicted of drug trafficking and allowing technical evidence to be given by gardaí by certificate to courts, thus freeing up their time to attend to other duties.</P>
    <P>In the context of the war we have launched against crime I wish to refer to the unprecedented increase in the Estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the increase is an unprecedented 10 per cent.  Funding for the Office of the Minister will be increased by 20 per cent; the Prisons' Vote will increase by 18 per cent; the Garda Vote will increase by 5 per cent; the Garda capital Vote will increase by 80 per cent and the Courts' Vote will increase by 31 per cent.  In monetary terms the total increase is £73 million.  These are real increases in public spending in the Justice area for which the Government and I make no apology.  The Government has identified crime as an issue of major public concern and the two parties in Government are delivering on their pre-election commitments in this regard.</P>
    <P>An extensive programme of reform of the criminal justice system is under way.  The announcement today of the figures for the 1998 Estimates underpins an unprecedented programme. In plain language, the Government is putting its money where its mouth is with regard to tackling crime and inequality.  The Estimates include provision for new prisons at Portlaoise, Castlerea and Clover Hill as well as a new women's prison at Mountjoy prison and a new wing in Limerick prison.  There is provision for prison staff to man these institutions.  There will be three new probation and welfare service centres.  A new courts service will be established, there will be additional courts refurbishment and a major programme of computerisation for criminal and civil case tracking.  There is provision for a continuation of high profile Garda operations such as Operation Freeflow, Operation Dóchas and Operation Cosantóir, which is aimed at protecting elderly people in remote rural areas in the west.  There is provision to continue the accelerated recruitment to the Garda Síochána as promised <Col N="669" /> and for computerisation in the Garda.  Provision is also made for a witness protection programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to equality there will be additional funding of £1.176 million over the 1997 figure for the Legal Aid Board and £2.415 million for the Department's equal opportunities child care programme for the purpose of meeting the commitments in this area outlined in Partnership 2000 and the Government's action programme.  An amount of £700,000 will be available to the Irish Council for People with Disabilities to facilitate action to improve the position of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>These proposals and the provision made for them will give urgent effect to a number of commitments contained in the Government's programme in the context of the zero tolerance policy, particularly, although not exclusively, against drug pushers and other serious criminals.  There is an imaginative legislative programme to back up the resources which will be made available to the enforcement authorities.</P>
    <P>Other criminal law reform Bills which I propose to publish in this session or early next year include a Bill to deal with child pornography. This legislation was promised by my party in advance of the general election.  There will also be Bills to amend the law in relation to criminal insanity and to enable Ireland to co-operate with the International War Crimes Tribunal.  Another Bill will deal with the UN convention against torture. Work is also underway on legislative proposals to deal with the substantive law on fraud. Extradition treaties with Canada and South Africa are being negotiated and work has begun on the preparation of legislation to enable Ireland ratify two EU conventions relating to extradition, one on the procedures to be applied where a person consents to extradition and another on improving and simplifying extradition arrangements between member states.  A discussion paper to review the law on sexual offences is being drawn up.  I hope this will lead to a full debate in society about the need for a register of sexual offenders.  In addition, a review is ongoing of criminal law issues relevant to the fight against crime.  Where the need for legislation is identified, it will be introduced without delay.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Europol Bill, the approach taken is to give the convention and its two subsequent protocols the force of law in the State and to provide for certain ancillary matters.  The Bill, therefore, is comparatively short.  For ease of reference the convention and protocols are appended to the Bill in both English and Irish, the texts being equally authentic in both languages.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the detail of the sections, I intend to outline the background to the drawing up of the Europol convention and then to concentrate on the provisions of the convention and its subsequent protocols.  The creation of the Single Market and the breakdown of borders in the European Union has facilitated an unprecedented <Col N="670" /> increase in cross border crime.  Just as honest law abiding citizens can move from one country to another in the Union, so too can Europe's top criminals.  The Justice and Home Affairs Ministers of member states were acutely aware of the need for compensatory measures to prevent the exploitation of this free movement by criminals and to protect their citizens against organised crime.</P>
    <P>This led to a decision to establish Europol by the European Council at its meeting in Maastricht in December 1991.  From November 1993 onwards work on the draft convention continued within the structures provided for in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.  In December 1993, the European Council meeting in Brussels decided that Europol would have its seat in The Hague.  It was some considerable time, however, before agreement could be reached among EU member states on Europol's precise role and powers.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, and in anticipation of the time it would take for the convention to be concluded and ratified, the European Drugs Unit &mdash; the EDU &mdash; was set up by ministerial agreement of the then 12 member states.  The purpose of the EDU was to allow information to be exchanged concerning, initially, illicit drug trafficking and associated money laundering activities involving two or more member states.  Its mandate was extended in March 1995 by the European Council to include illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances, crimes involving illegal immigration networks and trafficking in stolen vehicles.  These crimes are of major concern to EU member states as they are frequently committed by the same organised criminal groups.  Often the same trafficking routes and distribution networks are used by unscrupulous criminals who will smuggle into and around the EU drugs, people, stolen vehicles and radioactive substances, all for financial gain.  The aim of the criminals is to get their hands on the vast sums of money which accrue from these criminal activities. The EDU's mandate was further extended in December 1996 to include trafficking in humans, following the horrific paedophile incidents in Belgium which were uncovered last year.</P>
    <P>The EDU, now in its fourth year of operation in The Hague, has led to considerable successes, particularly in combating drug trafficking and money laundering.  However, the EDU was only ever meant to operate as an interim measure, with the result that it operates on a far more limited basis than will Europol under the convention. Its most obvious drawbacks are that it has no legislative status and it cannot store personal information.  Once in force, the convention will effectively replace the EDU.  The advantages of supplanting the EDU with Europol will include not just giving it a firm statutory basis for its activities or the ability to store personal information but the provision of a sophisticated computer system, access to and analysis of pooled <Col N="671" /> data and liaison with countries outside the EU and with international organisations.</P>
    <P>Once the convention is in force, Europol's initial remit will cover illicit drug trafficking, trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances, illegal immigrant smuggling, motor vehicle crime, trafficking in humans and associated money laundering activities, that is, the forms of international crimes already covered by the EDU.  In addition, it will develop specialist knowledge of the investigative procedures of the relevant authorities in the member states, provide advice on investigations, provide strategic intelligence and prepare general situation reports.  Within two years at the latest of entry into force, Europol's remit will be extended to terrorism.  Furthermore, there is provision in the convention for Europol to take on a wide range of other forms of serious organised crime at the discretion of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Regarding how Europol will achieve its objectives, I emphasise that Europol is established to operate as a non-operational team with the primary tasks of facilitating the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities and carrying out detailed analyses in relation to the crimes within its remit.  I mention this because, as some Senators are aware, it is likely that the role of Europol in the field of law enforcement co-operation may in the future be enhanced arising from provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty agreed by the Intergovernmental Conference last June and signed by member states last month.  Any developments concerning the extension of Europol's competence would, however, require in the first instance consensus or unanimity among EU member states and, second, they would have to be dealt with by way of completely separate legislation.  They do not, therefore, affect the passage of this Bill since it is concerned with giving the force of law to the 1995 convention as it stands.</P>
    <P>The convention, in article 8, provides for member states to forward information to Europol concerning persons who are suspected of having committed or taken part in criminal offences in respect of which Europol is competent, or have been convicted of such offences, or in relation to persons who there are serious grounds for believing will commit such criminal offences in the future.  In addition, Europol is to be informed of the means used in committing crimes, suspected membership of criminal organisations and criminal convictions of such persons.</P>
    <P>The information will be collated by Europol in a central computerised data base consisting of three elements.  The first element will be an information system with a restricted and precisely defined content which allows rapid reference to the information available to the member states and Europol, or, as it is sometimes referred to, an outer ring of information.  The second component will concern more sensitive information, a so-called inner ring of information comprising work <Col N="672" /> files for the purposes of analysis containing comprehensive information.  Lastly, there will be an index system containing certain particulars from the analysis files.  Specialists will analyse the information with a view to making connections and arrive at an overview, the results of which will then be forwarded to the member states concerned.</P>
    <P>Member states will send liaison officers to Europol who will assist in the exchange of information and analysis work.  Each member state must also set up a national unit to act as the centralised contact point for all relations with Europol. The liaison officer will represent the interests of his or her particular national unit.  This is a formalisation of the arrangements which at present exist for the EDU.  This system operates not only to communicate information but the liaison officers are also a valuable tool in overcoming problems which may arise between member states, for example, because of having insufficient knowledge of each others' legal systems.</P>
    <P>In addition to liaison officers representative of each member state, Europol will employ analysts who will be under the Europol director's authority. The director will be appointed by the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs and will be accountable to it.  There will also be a management board comprising representatives of all the member states of the Union.</P>
    <P>Europol will only be as good as its information. It is imperative that adequate safeguards are in place to guarantee the confidentiality, the security and the accuracy of information exchanged and shared.  In this regard the convention lays down extensive safeguards.  It acknowledges that particular attention must be paid to the privacy rights of individuals and the protection of their personal information.  It requires that, as a minimum, each member state must ensure a standard of data protection at least as high as that required by the 1981 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data.  That convention is implemented here by the Data Protection Act, 1988.  In addition, each member state must appoint a national supervisory body to monitor independently, under national law, the communication of personal data to and from Europol. There will also be a joint supervisory body to monitor the activities of Europol as a whole to ensure that the rights of individuals are not violated by storage and processing of personal data.</P>
    <P>Rules governing liability are laid down in the event of damage being caused by unauthorised or incorrect use of data.  Finally, confidentiality is also protected by rules governing the dissemination of sensitive information and the obligation of discretion imposed upon employees of Europol and liaison officers.</P>
    <P>There are two protocols to the convention, the first being the protocol on the interpretation of the convention by the European Court of Justice. One difficulty which delayed the finalisation of the convention was the failure of member states <Col N="673" /> to agree on whether the European Court of Justice should have a role in relation to the Europol Convention.  The protocol solved this outstanding problem by giving member states the option to declare to accept or not the interpretation of the convention by the Court of Justice by way of preliminary rulings.  For those member states who did opt to accept the Court's jurisdiction, they could make a further declaration setting out the circumstances under which the jurisdiction of the Court would operate in their respective countries, that is, either at the request of all national courts or at the request only of courts against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy.  We opted for the latter course so as to ensure, as far as possible, that there will be as little disruption as possible to the progress of a criminal trial once commenced.</P>
    <P>The second protocol on the privileges and immunities of Europol, its organs, its deputy directors and employees is needed for the practical application of the Europol Convention once it enters into force.  The purpose of the protocol is to grant Europol and all those acting on its behalf the same type of privileges and immunities as are usually granted to international organisations.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that, in addition to the two protocols to which this Bill will give the force of law, there are a number of other legal texts necessary for Europol's actual operation.  These deal with implementing measures concerning the rights and obligations of liaison officers, staff regulations, rules for analysis of data, confidentiality rules, rules of procedure of the joint supervisory body, Europol's budget, Europol's headquarters agreement between it and the Netherlands, and bilateral agreements between the Netherlands and member states concerning privileges and immunities of liaison officers and their families.  Of those, still to be finalised are the confidentiality rules, the rules of procedure of the joint supervisory body and the headquarters agreement.  All the measures must be formally adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council before Europol can take up its activities. However, while the legal texts are a prerequisite to Europol's entry into force, they are not necessary to the ratification process, and each member state can proceed with ratification of the convention and its two protocols without the various implementing measures being finalised.</P>
    <P>That raises the question of when the convention will enter into force and when Europol will actually take up its activities.  Its entry into force is dependent on all 15 member states having ratified it.  As of now it has been ratified by only two member states &mdash; the United Kingdom and Spain - but several more ratifications are expected during the coming months.  I intend that, likewise, on the enactment of this Bill, Ireland's ratification procedure would be concluded before the end of the year.  This would keep us in line with the European Council's stated aim of ratification by all member states before the end of 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> I will not spend an inordinate length of time on the provisions of the Bill since the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill contains quite a detailed commentary on the individual sections and their related provisions in the convention.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted in the Bill is to give the convention and the two protocols the force of law in the State.  Section 2 contains this core provision of the Bill.  Section 3 is concerned with the national unit which will act as a centralised unit within the Garda Síochána for the channelling of information and intelligence to and from Europol. The section proposes that the unit be headed up by a garda of at least chief superintendent rank and that it operate under the authority of the Garda Commissioner.  The assignment of staff to the unit will not be confined to members of the Garda Síochána however.  The Bill enables the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to appoint non-Garda personnel to be members of the unit, after consultation with the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Finance and any other Minister, as considered appropriate, and, in relation to officers of Customs and Excise, with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Officers of Customs and Excise clearly have a very important part to play in relation to certain types of crime within Europol's remit.  I will, therefore, give attention to the appointment of a Customs and Excise officer to the national unit as soon as this legislation is passed so that such an appointment will come into effect as soon as the convention comes into operation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the sending of liaison officers from the national unit to Europol.  Again, liaison officers need not necessarily be members of the Garda Síochána and could potentially, for example, be members of Customs and Excise.  In the case of non-Garda members of the national unit, this section provides that they will be sent only after consultation by the Commissioner with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, in the case of an officer of Customs and Excise, on the nomination of the Revenue Commissioners and, in the case of other members of the national unit, on the nomination of such other Minister, as considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a technical provision amending certain sections of the Garda Síochána Act, 1989, so as to apply them to members of the Garda serving with Europol.  Sections 6 and 7 are concerned with data protection.  The main purpose of section 6 is to apply the Data Protection Act, 1988, to relevant provisions in the convention subject to modification where necessary.  As I already mentioned, the 1988 Act gave effect to the principles contained in the 1981 Council of Europe convention on data protection, which is the standard of protection laid down by the convention.  Section 7 designates the Data Protection Commissioner for the purposes of the convention so that he will be empowered to monitor implementation of the data protection provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> Section 8 gives Europol corporate status so as to enable it to enter into contracts and other commercial relationships and to sue and be sued in the courts.  There is provision in section 9 for the application of the Official Secrets Act, 1963, to provisions of the convention which impose obligations of confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the protocol on the interpretation of the convention by the European Court of Justice, section 10 provides that judicial notice shall be taken in this country of any ruling or decision or expression of opinion by that court. There is provision in sections 11 and 12 for the making of ministerial Orders, to be laid before both Houses, which appear to be necessary and expedient for carrying out the convention.  All matters of substance pertaining to the convention and its protocols are covered by the Bill and the purpose of the provisions in sections 11 and 12 is merely to enable incidental requirements to be met from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 13 contains the standard expenses provision. In this regard, the financial arrangements for Europol provide for annual estimates to be drawn up and approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  The budget will be financed from member states' contributions which are determined by reference to a formula of the percentage of GNP attributed to each.  While additional cost will arise in respect of Europol's new computer system, in the absence of experience of operating the convention it is impossible to say what level of contribution we will have to make. Some indications, however, may be gained from our current contributions to the EDU's budget. The EDU budget for 1997, when savings made last year are taken into account, is ECU 7 million, 0.7 per cent of which we pay for from the Garda Síochána Vote.</P>
    <P>The convention is a desirable measure which will provide a weapon to us and our EU partners for combating international organised crime.  It will provide for greatly enhanced co-operation among the 15 at a level commensurate with the threat posed by the increasingly sophisticated techniques of today's organised criminals.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which was drafted by the previous Minister, Deputy Owen. I am delighted the Minister has brought it forward in its original form.  He may be assured it will not receive a negative response from this side of the House, as it might have if our roles were reversed.  This is necessary legislation resulting from our obligations under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A section deals with justice and home affairs and co-operation between member states.  This arises from the opening of borders between the 15 members states, although there were only 12 when the treaty was signed.  Crime is no longer a national phenomenon.  Organised crime is transnational and involves huge sums of money, <Col N="676" /> sophisticated technology and an extraordinary level of ingenuity and cleverness.  Opening borders, in accordance with the Single European Act and the treaty on greater European union, leads to the easier movement of people, goods and services between members states but it also enables criminals to ply their trade with greater ease across borders and transnationally.  This response, which we support, has its genesis in the Maastricht Treaty and involves the gathering on computer and sharing of information between the police forces of the Union.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will press the Justice and Home Affairs Council to move forward because Europol will probably not come into force until late next year as there must be a three month waiting period after the last country has ratified the convention.  I ask the Minister, assuming he remains in office that length of time, to press the Justice and Home Affairs Council to ensure that we go further and that the war against transnational crime is better facilitated by agreements between member states.</P>
    <P>This country should take the initiative in this area.  We made drugs our priority during our presidency of the EU and we should continue in that vein.  I am talking about hot pursuits across state boundaries, as happens in the United States. Obviously, this would not apply to Ireland but to France and Germany and any other countries with a contiguous border with a fellow member state.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the availability of evidence. The same crime may be committed in several countries, for example, France, Germany, Ireland and Denmark.  When bringing somebody to trial, it is important the court system accepts evidence made available by witnesses in each member state.  It is extremely important we continue down this road because the war against crime and the type of criminal with whom we are dealing will not be won until we have such ease in prosecuting these people and making them amenable to the courts and the law.</P>
    <P>I refer to high profile crimes, usually fraud, which have been committed here by individuals in the past 15 to 20 years.  Some years ago RTÉ did an interesting investigative programme in its &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; series on a number of high profile criminals who committed major fraud and absconded particularly to Spain where, as we saw from the television footage, they lived the high life.  The Cathaoirleach will know that one of those people came from our county.  I understand the rules preclude me from naming him in the House because he may not be able to defend himself. He defrauded farmers of about £2.5 million and absconded to Spain.  In 1982 there was a warrant for his arrest on foot of a firearms charge in County Limerick, yet in 1992 he was able to commit another major fraud by defrauding an elderly lady in this city of a substantial sum of money. Proceedings have been instituted in the High Court for his return from Spain to make him amenable to the court system in this country.  It <Col N="677" /> is difficult to understand how this man can use every type of legal stratagem in the Spanish legal system to prevent his return.  He is like all other high-profile fraudsters, who defrauded people and institutions of millions of pounds and absconded to Spain to live the high life.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe Spain is still a member of the European Union.  These fraudsters rob people of moderate means.  A small farmer is in financial ruin as a result of the activity of this individual.  I hope this Bill will result in the apprehension of such people and that there will be no high-profile criminals living abroad in a member state of the EU where they are not amenable to the Irish courts.  Witnesses could be sent and evidence provided to a Spanish court to try them there if that is what needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the Estimates and the increase of £73 million in the Department's Vote.  This is in line with the substantial increase provided for by the former Minister of Justice last year.  Much of that £73 million is needed to pay for measures initiated by the previous Minister. The Minister said a new prison is being built in Castlerea.  We all know the history of Castlerea Prison which was officially opened last October. There are 50 prisoners there and a second high security unit is under construction which must continue to be funded.  This is not a new prison. Castlerea Prison was popular locally, which is unusual, and we are disappointed that when announcing the creation of further prison spaces a few months ago, the Minister did not identify Castlerea as a site for a further 150 prison spaces. The Castlerea site is the largest prison compound in the country.  There are 25 acres of land within the tutelage of its new walls.  The high security block under construction is being merged with one of the old hospital blocks to form a &ldquo;T&rdquo; shape &mdash; I hope they are not called &ldquo;T Blocks&rdquo; after H Blocks.  There is another hospital block which could have been used to house 150 to 200 more prisoners.</P>
    <P>This is not a parochial point.  An enlightened approach was taken in buying enough land to allow for recreational facilities on this site.  It does not compare with the fetid awfulness of Mountjoy where the majority of the prison population has a drug problem which is not addressed and where there is no proper recreation outside its prison blocks.  I do not believe we can tackle crime solely by providing more prison spaces or that the approach should only be based on punishment. The genesis of crime has to be examined.  Eighty per cent of crime in this city is drug-related.  What are we doing about the drugs problem?  Often those who commit crimes are ill.  I know that victims, who suffer horribly, may have difficulty understanding this.  However, we must understand the nature of the crime and the unfortunate person who commits it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is unusual for a Fianna Fáil Minister in that he has taken a hard line on crime, which to a great extent I congratulate.  He is <Col N="678" /> unlike some of his predecessors.  I mentioned a Minister in the 1980s who would not use the word &ldquo;inform&rdquo; on a television programme because of its connotation.  If I have a criticism of the current Minister it is that he is often too hardline.  I welcome the provision of minimum sentencing in the Criminal Justice Bill.  However, the Minister should be careful not to cross the line by infringing on citizens' civil rights.  There is a feeling that the law needs to be strengthened, with which we all agree.  However, one can go too far with this argument and I counsel the Minister to be careful. We will oppose the Bill if the civil rights of the individual are infringed upon by new draconian legislation.</P>
    <P>We do not have any difficulty in dealing with the hardened criminal or with the horrible phenomenon of vicious urbanised crime.  The incidence of crime is lower now than three years ago.  In the hysteria generated about crime figures, we often lose sight of the fact that a greater percentage of crimes of both a summary and indictable nature are reported and we are getting better statistics.  The Department of Justice discussion paper, <i>Tackling Crime,</i> was rubbished by the Minister at the time of its publication in May 1997 &mdash; perhaps he will tell us if he continues to do so and whether the document has any status in his Department.  According to this paper, 487,340 summary offences were reported to the Garda in 1992.  In 1993 this figure increased to 562,260; it decreased to 500,747 in 1994 and to 478,733 in 1995.  I have no reason to believe it increased significantly in 1996.</P>
    <P>In 1992, 95,391 cases of indictable crime were reported to gardaí.  This increased to 98,979 in 1993, to 101,036 in 1994 and to 102,484 in 1995. The 1996 provisional figures, which may now have been made official, were down to 100,894. While the figures are worrying by European and international standards, we are in a better position than five years ago.  What has changed is the amount of violence and viciousness accompanying criminal activity, such as the recent rural phenomenon of attacks on the elderly living alone in isolated areas.  I welcome the Garda operation to deal with these attacks.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this the last time I spoke on a justice and law reform issue, but the point cannot be made often enough.  Almost 80 per cent of crime occurs in Dublin and Cork but that does not take from the horrific nature of some rural crime which often does not receive the reportage it deserves.  Gardaí in rural areas are not able to respond to criminals who come from the cities or large urban centres to prey on people, usually old age pensioners, who live alone on isolated roadways. There have been a number of horrific cases, including murders, in my county.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure there is a sufficient number of gardaí in our towns and villages.  No Garda station should have fewer than two gardaí.  It is useless having one garda doing an eight hour shift because this means there will be no cover for 16 hours of the day.  I live in an area where there is <Col N="679" /> only one garda.  His work may take him outside the area.  If criminals know that towns, villages and the surrounding countryside are unprotected, they will take advantage of it.  Gardaí must be based in these areas.  The people who carry out such heinous crimes must be made aware they will meet a garda on the beat if they decide to attack an elderly lady or couple on an isolated roadway.  I am not trying to score political points. I am sure Senator McGowan agrees with me as he comes from a county similar to mine.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us what he means by zero tolerance.  The Fianna Fáil general election manifesto states that given the threat the nation faces, it is important that the Government's attitude to crime is clear cut.  In Fianna Fáil's view there are no insignificant crimes today. Does the Minister mean summary or indictable offences?  Many summary offences are minor, while indictable offences relate to serious crime. The manifesto also states that no crime, no matter how small, is insignificant and that there is a definitive connection between lesser and more serious crimes.  The Minister is obviously talking about summary and indictable offences.  I ask him to define zero tolerance.</P>
    <P>The manifesto also deals with other issues related to crime and drugs.  Nine promises are made under the heading drugs and rehabilitation. What action has the Minister taken on each of these nine promises to tackle the drugs problem and what progress has been made?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this informative debate.  Zero tolerance is an ideology to which we should all aspire.  We would love to see a crime free society.  The communist regime in Russia believed it could achieve that but, unfortunately, it did not happen.  Zero tolerance is a good concept which sends a message to all criminals that this Government and Minister will not tolerate intimidation of people, particularly the elderly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that an extra £73 million will be made available in the Estimates to combat crime.  The last Minister made a mess in this regard.  Crime is spiralling and that is why we must introduce this Bill to tackle drug trafficking.  It is laudable that the Minister is spending extra money providing more prison spaces.  It is an indictment of our society that we must lock people up.  Over the next two years there will be in excess of 3,000 prison places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement to spend more money recruiting extra gardaí.  The green man system in small rural barracks has not worked.  I agree with Senator Connor that many rural Garda stations are being demanned.  The number of gardaí in west Cork has decreased by eight or nine in the past ten years.  Drug trafficking is a problem in the areas around west Cork and Kerry because of our coastline.  However, the Garda station in Bantry is outdated, although this is the responsibility of the Minister of State at the <Col N="680" /> Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen.  Bantry is probably the biggest town west of Cork city, yet its Garda station is like something from the 1940s and 1950s.  I levelled this criticism also at previous Ministers and Governments.  In a recent serious crime on Mizen Head, a station closer to Cork city, 60 or 70 miles from the scene of the crime, had to be used.  Garda manpower in Bantry has decreased and the technology is outdated.  This should be rectified.</P>
    <P>As an area, west Cork is as rural as Donegal, Roscommon or Mayo.  The green man is not a proper substitute for a garda on the beat and its operation should be examined, although I am not saying it should be abolished.  Members of the public do not make sufficient use of it and it is not very effective.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that criminals are becoming extremely sophisticated and, regardless of whether we like it, it has been proven over the years that crime pays.  Some criminal gangs have international operations with access to the best technology and, as the Minister said, huge sums of money and their trafficking of drugs, among other items, can undermine the security of various states.</P>
    <P>The European Drugs Unit was a temporary measure and the purpose of this Bill is to ratify the Europol Convention and give legal force to the existing situation.  As a result of the Maastricht Treaty and the Single European Act, the borders between the 15 member states have, in effect, been removed.  The primary purpose of that move was to ensure freedom of movement between member states.  Unfortunately, it has also enabled drug barons and other criminals to have free access to those countries.  The implementation of this legislation, in conjunction with the existence of a European police force, will assist us in that regard.  Drug trafficking is the greatest scourge in our society.</P>
    <P>Illegal immigrants are being shipped from country to country.  One of the greatest disasters in the last 20 years has been the development of major paedophile rings.  The Minister and the previous speaker referred to what has happened in Belgium.  The Italian police force recently uncovered an international ring in which children from China, Japan and Thailand were being trafficked through the European Union to be abused in Great Britain, the rest of Europe or America. It is a scandal that innocent children are being trafficked through the EU, including possibly this country.  I welcome the expansion of the operations of Europol to include this regrettable trade, which is morally much more serious than drug trafficking.  It is also welcome that the operations of Europol will encompass international terrorism and the illegal trafficking in cars and other items.</P>
    <P>Ireland has, unfortunately, been a gateway for the trafficking of drugs into Europe in the past ten or 15 years.  There has been a number of incidents in my area over the past ten years, some of which were successfully intercepted, off the coasts <Col N="681" /> of Kinsale, Courtmacsherry, Schull and Castletownbere. We have a huge coastline with many accessible harbours in areas which are too remote to be policed properly.  I compliment the Garda and Customs and Excise officers who have had major successes in the interception of large consignments of drugs.  As a result of those interceptions, such illegal trafficking seems to have moved to the west coast, with recent incidents off the coast of Clare.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that the present and previous Ministers have tried to tackle this problem, only about 20 per cent of the drugs which land in this country are intercepted.  It would be more than welcome if this Bill and Europol could go some way towards addressing this issue.  Given the huge volumes of marijuana, cocaine and other drugs which have been intercepted here, and those which go undetected, it is obvious they are not all for use in this country but are shipped to Great Britain, France and other parts of Europe.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Europol is to assimilate information at an international level.  We will have a national unit which, as the Minister said, will be headed by a garda not below the rank of chief superintendent, and will be staffed by members of the Garda Síochána with the possible back-up of Customs and Excise officers and others.  This is important because each of the 15 member states will have their own national network, with a central body based in Europe with a database of all criminals who fall under the remit of Europol as set out in the convention and protocols. That development must be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Great Britain and Spain have already enacted legislation to implement the convention and protocols. I hope this Bill will become law before the end of this year.  However, as my colleague pointed out, Europol will not be fully recognised by the EU until 90 days after the last member state has ratified the convention, which may take another 12 months.  However, by urging the ratification of the convention and passing this Bill, we will play our part on the greater European stage in assisting the fight against drug related and other crimes.</P>
    <P>Article 8 of the convention requires member states to forward to Europol information concerning persons suspected of having committed crimes so that a proper database can be established to assist the European fight against drugs and related crimes.  It is hoped that Europol will be as effective as Interpol, if not more so.</P>
    <P>The other important point the Minister emphasised was the liaison between member states and between the various national units throughout Europe.  This is crucial.  Up to now we had good will in the Europol drugs unit and among the various countries.  This new liaison which will have force of law in all 15 European Union countries will make it obligatory for each country to have its own unit to collect information on various criminal activities, to correlate that information, to liaise with a central body and to provide a system <Col N="682" /> by which the police, the courts, governments and administrations in the various jurisdictions, with officials of Customs and Excise and other agencies of the State who are out to tackle crime, will be working hand in hand to ensure that things like drug trafficking, terrorism, the illegal transportation of children, illegal immigrants and aliens can be combated.  This is a most welcome move.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of debate.  The Minister, for example, has indicated that he intends to bring in a new criminal justice Bill to deal with the question of mandatory sentences for certain drug offences.  This too must be welcomed.  I am sure that when this Bill comes before the House there will be a very full debate from all sides.  I understand my colleagues' observations with regard to the rights of the individual.  Certainly they must be protected, but there is a cancer in our society, which has been getting worse for the last 20 years, of drugs and drug related crimes.  It is a sad statistic that 80 per cent of crimes are drug related.  Drugs of various descriptions are available in every village and town throughout Ireland.  Sometimes we are afraid to admit that places like west Cork, Mayo, Donegal or Kerry are not free of drugs but regrettably this is the case.  Drugs are becoming more and more accessible. Ruthless and well organised criminals throughout Ireland and Europe have networks to distribute these drugs.  This is something we must tackle.  If the Minister espouses zero tolerance but needs extra legislation, better manpower in the Garda Síochána, more prison spaces, more sophisticated technology etc., then so be it.</P>
    <P>Most members of the Garda Síochána passing out now are very well educated.  The day of the big burly Garda on the beat is gone.  We are picking highly intelligent, well trained young people who, when they come through their courses in Templemore, are very capable of serving the people.  More gardaí should be available and I am glad that the Minister has decided to increase Garda numbers.</P>
    <P>While we are aware of crime in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and the bigger cities we must also protect the less privileged and the old people who live in very remote areas, I fully concur with my colleague, Senator Connor, when he says that we forget the elderly and under-privileged in rural Ireland.  In the Minister's fight against crime he should take a serious look at the questions of rural crime and the demanning of rural Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his contribution.  He has a number of Bills in the pipeline over the next few years because I believe he will be in office for quite some time.  I trust that this Bill will be accepted and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I share my time with Senator Quinn who wishes to speak for only five minutes?  I may not take 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much that needs to be said has been said but I would like to say some things that I do not think <Col N="683" /> have been fully ventilated.  I would like to pick up two elements in the Minister's speech.  First, he said that the victims of house breakers, burglars and car thieves do not regard these crimes as trivial or minor and neither does the Government; I can concur.  I had a burglary in my house the day I returned from South America about two or three weeks ago and I would like to place on the record my congratulations to the Garda Síochána for a very efficient job of detective work.  The police from Fitzgibbon Street were supplied with a description of the man involved, they apprehended him and he confessed to the crime.  However, I do not particularly want this man to go to jail.  I think it would be a complete and utter waste of taxpayers' money.  I would like him to do something constructive in the community and to be forced by the law to make amends by doing something positive.  On this subject I am less impressed than most of my colleagues with the statement that the Government's programme includes the provision of 1,000 more prison spaces in the next two years.  I wish this money was invested in areas like the north inner city in decent housing, decent education and decent job opportunities.  If this massive investment were diverted into resources for the deprived and marginalised areas of our cities then, I am convinced we would halve the level of crime.</P>
    <P>The business of the war against drugs is a nonsense. It will never be won.  We have seen this all over the world.  The United States, which spearheaded this notion of the &ldquo;battle against drugs&rdquo;, has thrown money at it and simply increased the profits of the mafia.  There is only one way to undercut the scourge of drugs and that is to destroy the economic base by deregulating drug use and by establishing a system of quality control. I recognize this as a global view and that this would have to be looked at on a Europe-wide, if not a world-wide basis.  It is, at the end of the day, the only system that will work.  Speaker after speaker has indicated that, despite the intensive war on drugs, the problem is increasing and multiplying all the time.  It is obvious that we are losing this war and I believe that we are losing it because we are fighting it the wrong way.  It is just like Prohibition.  All we are doing is increasing the profits of the drugs barons.</P>
    <P>I also have very grave reservations about this Bill.  I acknowledge the need to establish some kind of network of information and co-operation among police forces throughout Europe and I can well understand the reasons people decided to set up Europol.  The rationale for creating it seems to be that the opening of frontiers between the states of the European Union requires a co-ordinated response from the police forces and it is argued that organised crime can now operate transnationally, right across borders, without hindrance, and move money laundering activities from place to place with ease.</P>
    <P>A number of other factors exist.  The collapse of the Soviet Union has introduced the new <Col N="684" /> threat of the trafficking of nuclear material, vehicle crimes and the growth of organized crime in the former Soviet domains.  Anybody who had travelled in Scandinavia or in eastern Europe recently will have become aware of the massive penetration of the Russian mafia into all the countries that border the former Soviet Union.  I recognize the existence of this difficulty.  Then there is the emigration and spread of the Italian mafia, increases in drug trafficking and the emergence of organized illegal immigration networks.</P>
    <P>The response which is considered by this instrument is to create a modern, computer based information system with a central capacity for analysing intelligence.  That is fair enough.  Let us look at the process by which we have arrived at this.  One immediately starts to get worried because of the absolute lack of transparency and accountability in the entire process from day one. This Europol agreement was forged, initiated and brought to its present state without any reference to national parliaments or to the European Parliament and that must worry people.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament was not consulted under Article K.6 of the Maastricht Treaty at any stage during the two years of negotiations over the convention's content.  This Article explicitly states that the Council should consult the European Parliament on the principal aspects of activities and ensure its views are duly taken into consideration. At the meeting of the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers held in Luxembourg in June 1994 it was decided that the European Parliament should only be given a copy of the draft convention informally, specifically to avoid the requirement to consult it formally.  It is a significant problem that we were actually obviating the requirement for democratic accountability.</P>
    <P>Other difficulties include the fact that there does not seem to be any clear definition of what constitutes organised crime.  There is a suspicion that what is being got at here is the principle of transnational criminal activity of whatever seriousness.  It is not really serious organised crime all the time; it can go down to comparatively petty offences.  This is worrying, particularly where there is no proper definition.</P>
    <P>The Meijers committee which met in Utrecht in the Netherlands told a House of Lords inquiry into Europol that &ldquo;A member state might have to provide information about behaviour which under its own law was not criminal&rdquo;.  That is surely something that ought to give anybody interested in human and civil rights pause for thought.</P>
    <P>The report by the House of Lords on Europol came to the conclusion that crimes appear on the list not because they are the most serious offences but because they are particularly transnational in character and therefore require a transnational response.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by suggestions that the type of information that may be gathered by this pan-European <Col N="685" /> police force includes information data on race, sexuality and politics.  Perhaps the Minister can comment on this.  A draft regulation on work files for the purposes of analysis being discussed by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers would allow Europol to hold information on a person's sexuality and political opinions.</P>
    <P>Setting out the rules to be followed under Article 10.1 of the Europol Convention, the regulation, Article 4.3, enables Europol to hold information on 3.1 ethnic origin, 3.2 political views, 3.3 religious views, 3.4 information on health, and 3.5 information on sexuality.</P>
    <P>This has to do with people who are suspected criminals.  What has happened to the old notion that a person is innocent until proven guilty?  If we can compile this kind of dossier and information on people who are merely suspected of crimes &mdash; including information on their sexuality, health status and political opinions &mdash; we should be careful, bearing in mind the behaviour of some police forces, in particular the French, who frequently flout their own domestic law in pursuit of suspected criminals.</P>
    <P>I remember a period in Germany ten or 15 years ago when the <i>Berufsverbot</i> was in operation throughout the civil service.  Under this rule information of this kind was stored and could be retrieved by the authorities.  It was used against the careers of people employed in the German civil service.  For example, although homosexuality had been decriminalised, information on people's sexual orientation was stored and was a bar to employment.  The individual, however, had no recourse to access his or her file.  We must have this kind of accountability.</P>
    <P>The Europol force is able to withhold from individual citizens any data relating to them if they could affect the proper performance of Europol's tasks.  That is a broad definition which would make it difficult for an individual to get proper access to information about them that is contained in files.  I regard that as a worrying factor.  I would like the Minister to address these points and come up with some answers for the House.</P>
    <P>On the question of data protection, the Meijers committee argued that &ldquo;since Europol could store data received from non-member states or through circuitous channels, there were serious risks of inaccuracy, and the right to information might well be illusory&rdquo;.  If a senior committee of experienced people believes that the right to information becomes illusory because of the serpentine nature of this legislation, we ought to be careful.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that national parliaments are not permitted the right to amend this protocol.  We either accept it or reject it and it is obvious that it will be accepted.  As a national parliament we are being asked to rubber stamp something that takes away or seriously diminishes the human rights of our citizens.  This is worrying in European terms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> Article 19 of the Europol Convention deals with the right of access.  Article 19 starts out well and appears to be positive but then, bit by bit, it whittles away all the apparently positive elements contained in the beginning.  An application by an individual for access to data must be made to the competent national authority, which in the United Kingdom is the Data Protection Registrar, which will refer it to Europol which will reply directly to the individual.  Such requests must be dealt with within three months.</P>
    <P>Article 19.3 implies that an individual can apply for access to the data held on them not just in their home member state but in any member state, that is, a United Kingdom citizen or an Irish citizen could apply to the German or French data protection authorities.  Where the member state has data access laws, and some countries including Italy and Greece do not have such laws, the request can be turned down &ldquo;if such a refusal is necessary to: 1) enable Europol to fulfil its duties properly; 2) protect security and public order in the member state or to prevent crime; 3) protect the rights and freedoms of third parties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Further reservations then apply to each of the three levels of the Europol computer system: where it relates to the &ldquo;information system&rdquo;&mdash; Article 8 &mdash; no data can be given unless the member state which entered the data and the member states which the data concerned agree, and they may refuse; where data has been entered by Europol, i.e., from a third party, the member state affected by the data has to agree and is allowed to reserve the right to refuse to comply; and for data in the &ldquo;work files&rdquo;&mdash; Article 10 &mdash; there has to be a consensus among Europol, member states participating in the analysis and the member states affected.  If there is not a consensus then &ldquo;Europol shall notify the person that it has carried out the checks, without giving him or her any information which might reveal to him or her whether or not he or she is known&rdquo;.  This needs a good deal of examination and causes me considerable concern.</P>
    <P>Articles 20 to 22 concern the deletion, correction and review of data files.  If a citizen feels that he or she is misrepresented factually in this material, surely the ability to retrieve and alter it is crucial.  Article 20 appears to go some way but when one starts to read it one realises, once again, that progressively the rights and entitlements are whittled away.</P>
    <P>Readers of the full convention will sometimes find themselves referring backwards and forwards to different provisions.  Such an instance occurs in Article 21.3. This says data referred to in &ldquo;point 1 of the first subparagraph of Article 10(1) may not exceed a total of three years&rdquo;.  The said &ldquo;point 1&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Persons as referred to in Article 8(1)&rdquo; [qualified by reference to Articles 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3]. Article 8.1 covers people &ldquo;suspected of having committed &ldquo;or where there are serious grounds &ldquo;for believing [they] will commit.  .&rdquo;. As if this is not complicated enough, Article 21.3, which appears to set a time limit of three years, <Col N="687" /> then sets a quite unique provision: &ldquo;Each time limit shall begin to run afresh on the date on which an event leading to the storage of data relating to that individual occurs&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;event&rdquo; is nowhere defined &mdash; again a lack of definition &mdash; but appears to refer to any significant new input of data on people &ldquo;suspected&rdquo;. So we have it, endlessly running on in three year jumps.</P>
    <P>I have considerable worries and concerns about this because of the way in which emerged the lack of democratic accountability, the apparent intention to obviate parliamentary control either at European or national level and the apparent desire to place the operation of Europol above and outside the operations of the European Court of Justice.  I understand, however, there has been some small move in these directions, in particular in the storage of what seems to be tendentious material about people's political opinions, religious views and their sexual orientation.  For these reasons, I urge the Minister and the House to carefully consider the provisions in the Europol convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It forces us to realise how the world is changing, especially in the areas of technology and the ease with which it is possible to cross borders.  There are almost 15 different approaches to drug trafficking in Europe.  We have taken a strong view on this issue and the great strides made in the last 15 months by the Garda Síochána should be applauded.  By contrast, the French consider the Dutch to be too liberal.</P>
      <P>We must find ways of using weapons to compete against drug traffickers who cross borders and against those criminals who use the benefits of technology.  The main justification for this Bill is that it deals with this issue.  It is also to be welcomed for its approach to the area of information. While we do not need a European FMI at present, because it would amount to a supranational police force, it may be necessary at a future date.  At present, neither Europol nor Interpol amounts to this and there is no indication that this Bill is a move in that direction.</P>
      <P>Europol is essentially about the sharing, coordinating and speeding up of the flow of information between national police forces.  The better this is done the better we will move against drug traffickers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we must be realistic in recognising that all policing involves some dilution of civil liberties we must be vigilant in ensuring that we strike the right balance between the needs of policing and the preservation of these liberties.  Consideration of a measure such as this in our Legislature should be deliberate and accompanied by a wide ranging national debate.  It is regrettable that the passing of this Bill, like the legislation on the bail referendum, has not received the public attention it deserves.  Similarly, one of the reasons the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality amounted to <Col N="688" /> bad legislation was there was no national debate. It was not understood and the poor turnout in the referendum is indicative of this.</P>
    <P>I supported the bail referendum on the basis that, on balance, it was the right thing to do. However, it was not right that such an important change to our legal system should have proceeded without a national debate.  The referendum raised a fundamental issue which is also a feature of this Bill &mdash; the need for informed agreement when important changes are made, especially those affecting civil liberties.  We should not sleepwalk where our fundamental freedoms are involved.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill is broadly acceptable. Doubtless it could be improved.  Given the war on crime, the benefits are probably worth the price. There is a danger that the Bill may start us down a slippery slope which we may later regret. However, the best defence against that is the public attitude to such legislation.  As legislators we should be unwilling to consider Bills of this kind except in the context of a national debate about the issues involved.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It appears at an important time for this country. There is an escalation in organised international crime, including drug trafficking and money laundering. More recently, evidence has emerged of paedophile rings and trafficking in illegal immigration.</P>
      <P>The involvement of highly organised gangs, with their local networks, in these areas pose big challenges to states.  They are engaged in lucrative operations and there are huge incentives for them to continue to develop and become more sophisticated. They have intricate networks and routes available to them and can afford to use modern technology and advice to avoid the laws of states by exploiting loopholes.</P>
      <P>In view of this, the challenge they pose is beyond the scope and resources of individual states.  They can only be effectively tackled at international level.  The Bill proposes a framework that will facilitate the speedy flow and exchange of information, analysis and co-operation and will provide a European focus for tackling international crimes in an organised way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the significant initiatives announced by the Minister which are in the process of preparation. I am not surprised that he has introduced them at this early stage in his term of office.  He had an active record in Opposition and introduced 13 Bills, some of them significant and important.  Some were accepted by the then Government, others were adopted and reintroduced under a different guise. <Col N="689" /> On the question of the Minister's initiative regarding 1,000 extra prison places, I support a policy of inclusion which targets those who feel alienated.  The President referred to this in her inaugural speech yesterday.  The Taoiseach has promoted social inclusion as one of the major policies of the Government.</P>
    <P>However, we should not live in a fool's paradise. We should not believe that providing resources for an additional 1,000 prison places and targeting programmes of social inclusion will, in the short to medium term, result in the disappearance of hardened criminals who are marauding our streets both as individuals and in gangs. Those who purport this are naive.  We must confront these gangs and criminals.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann invites the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to outline to the House the new initiatives he proposes to take to curb the on-going carnage on the roads; and also to outline the steps he proposes to have taken to effect a substantial reduction in the number of road accidents, fatal and otherwise.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This issue has plagued me for a long period.  Anyone who cares to search the records of the Dáil will be aware that while I was a Member of that House, Question Time never passed without my tabling a question to the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, urging him to take action to curb the level of slaughter and carnage on our roads.</P>
      <P>This level and that of other EU member states &mdash; I accept we do not have jurisdiction in other countries but we might set them a good example &mdash; is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue.  There were 453 fatal road accidents in Ireland in 1996. This represents an increase of 4 per cent on the previous year.  In addition to this horrifying catalogue of death, 13,319 people were severely injured or incapacitated for life on our roads during the year in question.  The National Roads Authority estimates that the cost of all road accidents in Ireland in 1996 was approximately £455 million.  That is a horrendous amount of money which could be used for other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main aim this evening is to stress our complacency in respect of this frightful loss of life.  In the past five years more people were killed on Irish roads than were killed in Northern Ireland since the beginning of the Troubles in 1968. When one considers the extent, nature and scale of the effort invested in reducing the number of killings in Northern Ireland and promoting peace there and the lack of effort invested in reducing deaths on our roads, there is an apparent incongruity <Col N="690" /> regarding our immunity to the level of road deaths.</P>
    <P>During the past ten years, the equivalent of the population of a small Irish town has been wiped out annually on our roads.  Behind the statistics, however, are the harrowing human stories of bereavement and loss &mdash; children left without parents and parents left without children.  I have received telephone calls from many parents who tried to describe the feeling of seeing a young daughter or son, full of life and expectation, going out to attend a social event and later seeing them lying dead in a morgue.  That is a horrendous experience for any parent but it happens frequently. It is difficult to understand the grief, pain and anguish unless one has direct personal experience of such tragedies.  The sad thing is that each of these deaths is unnecessary and all of them could be averted.</P>
    <P>What action is being taken to enable us to prevent these tragedies and avert needless deaths and injuries?  In recent weeks the AA stated that road safety standards in this country are a national disgrace.  Chief Superintendent John O'Brien, the head of the Garda Traffic Bureau, stated that the largest single factor behind road deaths in Ireland is the mindset of the driver behind the wheel.  The NRA underlined this statement when it estimated that four out of every five recorded deaths are directly due to driver behaviour.  If we are to effect a significant reduction in the number of road deaths, we must begin by altering the mindset of motorists through driver education.  We must seek to radically and fundamentally alter the attitude of drivers. I believe this can be done.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago a courageous Minister, in the face of stern opposition from vested interests, introduced what were regarded as severe drink driving laws.  There was uproar from many quarters but the Minister in question had the courage to carry on and put in place what are, by any standards, reasonable rules in respect of drink driving.  That had a profound effect on people's attitudes, particularly those of the young, to driving.  It is seldom if ever that one will find a young person who drinks and drives.  The culture of drink driving has been changed for the current generation of young people and I hope the next generation will be influenced by their forebears.</P>
    <P>What is required is a change in drivers' attitudes. They respect, and comply with, speed restrictions.  If the young drivers whom I praised for their responsibility in respect of drink driving had the same sense of responsibility with regard to speeding, our outlook on this issue might be different.  We must seek to re-educate these people and there must be rigorous and comprehensive enforcement of all traffic laws and regulations. It is a proven fact that excessive speed is a major cause of all road accidents and this must be stamped out.</P>
    <P>However, it must also be stated that slow moving vehicles can be a major cause of road accidents. <Col N="691" /> Every week I witness the mayhem caused by such vehicles.  In a typical and not uncommon scenario, one might see a vehicle pulling a horsebox at the head of a tailback of traffic sometimes a quarter of a mile long.  The vehicle in front is driving at 35 miles per hour on a road which has a speed limit of 60 miles per hour.  The traffic builds up behind until one driver, who must make up time and is at breaking point, loses his patience, makes an effort to pass out a number of vehicles, misjudges the distance and the proximity on an oncoming vehicle, and causes a major multiple car crash.  That is a direct result of a person travelling at a speed which should only be tolerated on the hard shoulder.  There has been a law in North America for more than 40 years in relation to slow vehicles as well as one on vehicles travelling at excessive speed.  When we consider speed as a factor in causing road accidents, we must also take that into account.</P>
    <P>The point I want to stress above all others is the need to publish the equivalent of a White Paper, an education document on driving schools, driving education and how the driving test is administered.</P>
    <P>In the past driving schools have been set up in the most haphazard way.  A person who has failed his or her driving test can come out of the testing centre and drive his or her car on the open road. We are enormously careless and casual about how we formulate driver education and about the test.  Next year all vehicles will be tested for road worthiness and vehicles of a certain age will be tested subsequently every second year, but is it not ironic that we will test drivers only once?</P>
    <P>I acknowledge and am grateful for the new initiatives already announced by Minister Molloy. More than anything, I ask him for an increased emphasis on driver education and on altering the attitude of drivers.  In particular, I ask that a White Paper on driver education be published to form a discussion document from which we can formulate better procedures and practices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is aware of the severity of the situation on our roads at present and we all have different ideas about why things have been so bad recently.  We must bear in mind the huge increase in the number of vehicles on the roads over the past few years and it looks as though this trend will continue over the next few years.  Therefore, it is incumbent on us to do what we can to make the roads safer.</P>
      <P>Many roads are in bad repair and I am happy to say there is a programme in place to improve them.  The improvements to the major routes over the past few years are to be welcome and I would like to think these measures will be continued over the next few years.  Every Member is aware of areas which are in need of improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to accidents, we must also bear in mind the huge number of people who are injured and maimed for life and the long-term effect this has on the families involved.  Senator Quill spoke <Col N="692" /> about young people going out for the night and their parents not seeing them again until they see them in the morgue.  The same arises in the case of children whose parents are involved in an accident. We must do all in our power to prevent this happening.</P>
    <P>Accidents will always occur but we must do everything to reduce the number of accidents.  We need to spend more on safety.  I acknowledge that we must control public spending but a balance must be struck.</P>
    <P>Several measure can be adopted to improve the present situation at relatively little cost, one of which is the enforcement of the traffic laws.  The Garda continue to do a good job but it needs to refocus its efforts and use modern technology to reduce the speed of traffic.  One measure which would make a big improvement if it were implemented is the greater use of cameras on the roads.  When this measure was tested on the M25 around London some years ago it reduced the level of fatalities by 40 per cent.  It involved a cost, but how do we value a human life?  We must stop and think about that.</P>
    <P>The gardaí have other duties but regular speed traps are necessary throughout the year.  We have seen how effective the gardaí have been in controlling the level of drink driving and the Christmas campaign in recent years has been very effective.  Younger drivers in particular will not drink and drive.  That is the type of education about which Senator Quill spoke earlier.  We need the same level of enforcement with regard to speed and this can by achieved be encouraging young learner drivers, in particular, not to speed.</P>
    <P>There are also black spots.  A 12 year old boy was killed on the road just outside Carlow town at a point at which there have been 26 accidents over the past few years.  If there are black spots, we need to deal with them before somebody is killed.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann invites the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to outline to the House the new initiatives he proposes to take to curb the ongoing carnage on the roads; and also to outline the steps he proposes to have taken to effect a substantial reduction in the number of road accidents, fatal and otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We must also bear in mind that many road accidents take place on short journeys very close to home.  These accidents are not always fatal but we need to educate drivers that young children should not sit in, or stand on, the front seat.  We have all let this happen in the past. We know we should not do so and we need to be stopped by the Garda to make sure we do not repeat the practice.</P>
      <P>Driving tests should be stringent on young and old alike, but we should be obliged to re-sit the test every few years because circumstances change.  People may be on medication, for instance, and this can affect their driving. Insurance companies take that into consideration. Why should it not be taken into consideration in the context of the driving test?</P>
      <P>I want to put some emphasis on the quality of the roads being built.  No doubt the road surfaces are improving and this has led to smoother driving technique.  It is much easier to control a car under those circumstances.  Lane markings have been improving and I would like to think that would continue because in foggy conditions, in particular, such as those we are experiencing at present, it is terribly important to have good lane markings, which do not cost a great deal.</P>
      <P>Sign posts are important also.  I recall a road accident in Carlow a few years ago in which a young engaged couple were involved in a head-on collision with two German visitors.  Three people were killed and the young girl was left paralysed for life simply because the tourists were driving on the wrong side of the road.  We need proper signposting throughout the country so that visitors realise that we drive on the left.</P>
      <P>Another situation arose last night when I was looking for parking.  I saw the &ldquo;P&rdquo; sign but the arrow was covered by a clearway sign.  That is ridiculous. A little common sense is all that is needed to prevent accidents which occur where you must slow up, stop the traffic and somebody runs into you from behind.  We can prevent all these accidents with a little thought.</P>
      <P>A number of weeks ago I mentioned the need for a bypass around Carlow town.  The Minister is aware of my views on this and as long as the bypass is not built I will continue to talk about it. At that stage I said it was time to christen the new bypass but I sincerely hope it will not become an old age pensioner before its christening.  The road is badly needed because 15,000 vehicles travel in either direction through a housing estate in the town and four times a day school children cross the existing road at two points.  We must do something about this now.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Quill and her colleagues on tabling this timely motion.  In the past, fatal road accidents were associated with <Col N="694" /> drink driving but in recent years a new phenomenon has entered the equation, speeding.  Excessive and unsafe speed, not merely breaking speed limits, is one of the most frequent contributory factors to fatal road accidents.  I am a non-driver but I am often a passenger while my wife drives. She usually drives at close to the 70 miles per hour speed limit on motorways but a frightening number of cars overtake her.  The National Safety Council states that speeding ranks ahead of drink driving as the most common contributory factor to road accidents.  While the community condemns drink driving, respectable people admit to and even boast about speeding without condemnation from their peers.  The unpalatable truth is that driving too fast for safety is socially acceptable rather than being regarded as criminal lunacy.  The challenge facing society is to make speeding totally unacceptable and I await with interest the Minister's views on how we can turn society around on that issue.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána recently implemented Operation Lifesaver in an attempt to reduce road accident numbers and it met with some success. Like Senator Gibbons, I would like the Garda to have the assistance of speed cameras such as those erected on the M25 motorway around London. The installation of 400 cameras on that road has substantially reduced the number of fatal accidents, particularly pileups.  Dublin will face a similar position shortly; if the C-ring is completed without speed cameras being installed, there will be serious accidents on that road.  The Minister should factor the installation of cameras into the cost of building the road, because they are necessary for public safety.</P>
      <P>When people are found guilty of speeding they should be dealt with quickly by the courts and the fines should be substantial.  We should make speeding totally unacceptable.  If a person is found guilty his licence should be endorsed and if he commits the same offence again his licence should be taken away.  The greatest penalty that can be imposed on a motorist is to remove his licence for a period.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate Senator Quill on bringing this important issue before the House.  It merits more time than we can give it this evening and we should have a full debate on this subject because we are all appalled by the current level of carnage on our roads.  There are several contributory factors, including excessive speed, drink driving, defective vehicles and careless driving.  I was trying to obtain accident statistics but I could not get a breakdown of the type of vehicles involved in road accidents.  The numbers and dates of accidents are available, as are the number of fatalities, but I could not discover whether those accidents involved cars, motorcycles, bicycles or articulated trucks.  Reading the newspapers, one cannot ignore that heavy vehicles are involved in many serious accidents.  They are colloquially known as &ldquo;artics&rdquo; but they are really mobile <Col N="695" /> warehouses.  They are not equipped with the facilities needed for our roads.  On the continent heavy vehicles must be prevented from emitting spray on wet days.  If it is raining these trucks are enveloped in vapour and fog.  If a driver wants to overtake a truck he cannot see anything, and if there are two or three trucks together it is impossible to move forward.  These trucks should be fitted with a device which will shield cars from the spray.  The Minister should carefully examine this aspect of road safety.  Anyone driving behind a truck on a wet day can observe this spray and if it was prevented it would help reduce the numbers of serious accidents.</P>
      <P>This is only one factor but if we analyse all the factors and deal effectively with them we will get somewhere.  We are all appalled by what is happening but few practical suggestions are made.  If we look at all accidents, break them into different types and analyse what contributes to them, we may make progress.  My area of concern is the spray caused by trucks on wet days.  All trucks on the continent must be modified to prevent this spray.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for consideration of this important motion which we all support.  Statistics have shown that in recent years, particularly since 1987, the number of fatalities on our roads has remained static at about 450 per year.  Prior to that the number of fatalities was significantly higher, in the range of 600 per year, so clearly steps have been taken to improve matters somewhat.  We must learn from those steps to reduce the figures significantly because even one road death is one too many.  It is also worthy of note that we are in line with the EU average for the road deaths <i>per capita,</i> although we are probably above average in terms of vehicle numbers.</P>
      <P>Drivers account for most of the fatalities on the roads, pedestrians account for about 30 per cent, which is an alarmingly high level, and passengers account for the remainder.  There appears to have been a significant increase in single vehicle accidents which raises a range of issues, in particular, driver behaviour.  We must address our attention to that issue.  Enforcement is another important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Road improvements could play a role in improving the record of road accidents.  While there is an allocation of about £1 million from the National Roads Authority to improve road markings, traffic route lighting and to provide a better standard of lighting generally, the resources devoted to these areas should be increased.  As Senators have indicated these are frequent contributory factors to road accidents. The local authorities have a fundamental role in this regard and many of them have improved <Col N="696" /> sight lines in their areas and have implemented a range of other initiatives.  The remit of local authorities in regard to road safety should be widened and extended into the realm of enforcement. Consideration might be given to separating the responsibilities for law enforcement and traffic control and policing.  Local authorities might engage traffic rangers or police to operate on a county or regional basis.</P>
    <P>Of the various aspects of behaviour which are significant in the level of accidents, speeding is at the top of the list.  Speed limits are often set without assessing a realistic level.  One passes through many villages which have 30 miles per hour limits where a 40 or 50 miles per hour limit would be adequate.  These limits are applied as a status symbol for the villages rather than for the purpose for which they are intended &mdash; to ensure safe driving.  This practice tends to bring the system of compliance with the law into disrepute.</P>
    <P>Greater use should be made of the 50 miles per hour speed limit which is rarely, if ever, used. There are stretches of county roads which have 60 miles per hour limits where it would be dangerous to drive at that speed, yet one also finds wide sections of national primary routes which may have two or three lanes where the same limit applies. Speed limits might be revised upwards on the motorways.  However, in doing so we must ensure full enforcement of the law.  If we can foster an attitude of visible and active enforcement we may get a higher level of compliance.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion that offenders should suffer greater consequences for breaches of the traffic code.  A points system might be applied whereby people caught speeding would incur a certain number of points and those reaching a certain threshold of points would have their licence suspended or withdrawn.  Such initiatives will improve road behaviour.</P>
    <P>With regard to pedestrians, the laws on the use of visibility aids, such as armbands, should be enforced with greater vigour.  As a third of road fatalities are pedestrians we should focus our energies on that sector.  It will take a combination of improving driver behaviour and greater enforcement of the law to bring about the improvements we seek.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank Senator Walsh for sharing his time with me.  The number of road deaths has increased over the past few years and the problem is becoming serious.  There may be many approaches adopted to tackle the problem.  The road network is not of a sufficient standard to cope with the volume of traffic using it.  Year on year the volume of traffic on the roads increases as car ownership increases.  The Garda does an excellent job, particularly in built up areas where the introduction of on the spot fines has reduced the number of speeding violations.  However, the Garda should not have to spend time enforcing speed limits when other, more serious crimes demand attention.  Vehicles should have a mechanism <Col N="697" /> fitted to prevent them exceeding the maximum speed limit.  This would reduce speeding on the roads which causes so many accidents.</P>
      <P>There should be greater education in schools on road safety for pedestrians because about 30 per cent of road fatalities are pedestrians.  Young people seem inclined to walk in front of traffic without a thought.  Drivers are supposed to be able to stop their vehicles at any speed when somebody simply walks in front of them.  That is unfair behaviour by the pedestrians and might be tackled through road safety education aimed at young people.</P>
      <P>There must a large of injection of funds aimed at upgrading roads, particularly with the increasing numbers of heavy vehicles being used to transport goods.  The Government, the local authorities, the Garda and all other interested parties must work together to tackle the serious problem of road deaths.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Senators who tabled the motion for giving the House an opportunity to discuss the most important subject of road safety. The Government has given me special responsibility for promoting road safety and I will carefully note all the points made during the debate in reviewing the road safety programme that has been in operation and seeking to formulate the new strategy in this area to which the Government is committed.</P>
      <P>In 1996, 453 people died in road accidents and so far this year over 400 people have died on our roads.  That Members of the House were tragically involved in those numbers has brought home to us the reality of fatal road accidents and the need to redouble our efforts to reduce them. Society should not be willing to pay such a high price for the use of our roads.  I welcome, therefore, this opportunity to speak about the Government's intentions in this vital area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month was a bad one for road safety.  Provisional figures indicate that 48 people died in <Col N="698" /> October.  In response to this deterioration and to the public and political concern which it evoked, the Taoiseach with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, recently took the unprecedented step of convening a high level meeting on road safety.  This meeting was attended by the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, myself, senior personnel of Departments concerned and road safety agencies, including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána, the National Safety Council, the National Roads Authority and the Irish Insurance Federation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's message to those of us mandated with responsibility for road safety was that the current situation was unacceptable.  He identified road safety as an urgent public health issue and one which the Government is determined to address, if necessary, with improved instruments and increased resources.  At that meeting, the high level group on road safety was mandated by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to prepare a national strategy for road safety, under my direction as Minister of State with responsibility for road safety.  This is a new and critically important initiative.  A national strategy will provide better co-ordination and prioritisation of existing road safety activities and a platform for new initiatives. It will provide a full opportunity for assessing, and if necessary redirecting, our efforts to give better results.</P>
    <P>The new road safety strategy will review all aspects of existing arrangements, measures and approaches.  We will look to build on and improve our current performance in terms of education and promotion, enforcement, the regulatory environment and other critical factors.  This is the first time a structured and systematic approach has been taken to road safety policy in Ireland. A similar strategic approach has been adopted by some of the countries in Europe with the best road safety records, including the Netherlands and Sweden, and I am confident that it will benefit Irish performance considerably.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady, and in recent times a very marked, increase in the total amount of travel on Irish roads.  This has risen from 18 billion vehicle kilometres in 1978 to around 34 billion in 1996.  Thankfully, road accidents and fatalities have not risen in direct correlation with this trend.  In fact, road fatalities over the 18 years decreased from 628 in 1978 to 453 last year. However, economic growth is undoubtedly a factor in the gradual increase in road accident numbers during the 1990s.  For example, our road system in 1996 carried the same traffic volumes that only three years previously had been predicted for the year 2000.  This is creating obvious problems for transport policy and administration on all fronts.  However, the most critical challenge as we face into the new millennium is to keep road fatalities and injuries down in the face of increases in road traffic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> In facing this challenge and seeking new solutions we should not underestimate the impact and importance of measures taken up to now.  I acknowledge the excellent work which has been done and which continues to be done by Departments and the road safety agencies.  Successful measures have been adopted in the following areas among others.  Recent regulations have improved vehicle safety standards in such areas as an increase in tyre thread depths, compulsory fitting of seat belts on all car seats &mdash; many people are still not aware that this includes front and rear seats &mdash; and fitting of speed governors in heavy goods vehicles.  A comprehensive restructuring of drink driving law was carried out under the 1994 and 1995 Road Traffic Acts.  Combined with high profile publicity and enforcement, this has led to a remarkable change in public attitudes and behaviour on this critical issue.</P>
    <P>In relation to road infrastructure, my Department published a manual in 1996 on low cost remedial measures for accident blackspots and a comprehensive traffic signals manual for the guidance of local authorities.  Major improvements have been made to road infrastructure and by the end of this year £3 million will have been spent by the National Roads Authority on their programme of low cost safety measures at 290 high accident locations on the national network. The NRA will complete work within two years on signage and delineation of the entire national primary route network and will complete within the next three years a programme of erecting signs on approaches to over 200 primary schools on all national roads at a cost of £1 million.</P>
    <P>In the area of driving instruction, my Department has been active in seeking to improve standards. We have worked with the Irish Insurance Federation and the professions to develop better arrangements for ensuring quality service from driving instructors.  Central to these efforts has been the introduction of a voluntary register of driving instructors which was established in June last year and which has been supported financially by my Department and the Irish Insurance Federation.  The aim of the scheme is to improve the standard of instruction generally with the objective of improving driving standards, thereby making our roads safer.</P>
    <P>New improved standards on the compulsory wearing of safety helmets by motor cyclists and pillion passengers have been introduced.  This was in response to the disproportionately high involvement of motorcyclists in road accidents. More work needs to be done to improve safety in this group of road users.  My Department has therefore recently requested the NRA to carry out a special analysis of motorcycle accidents in the past five years and to examine all the factors involved.  The results of this analysis will be used to assist and inform decisions by the regulatory, enforcement and education agencies.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, comprehensive new traffic regulations came into force on 1 October <Col N="700" /> this year.  These regulations consolidated and updated existing legislation and introduced new provisions.  These include enabling local authorities to prohibit the parking of heavy goods vehicles in residential areas, provision for the issue of disabled person's parking permits which apply nationally and making it an offence to park in a disabled person's parking bay without the necessary permit.  The regulations also make it an offence to stop or park at a school entrance where the prohibitory road marking has been provided.  On the spot fines for speeding offences were introduced by regulation almost a year ago.</P>
    <P>Regarding enforcement, every year the Garda Síochána make thousands of arrests and there are over 250,000 prosecutions for road traffic offences.  I welcome the establishment of the new Garda National Traffic Policy Bureau which was given the specific task of assisting in the reduction of road accidents.  I commend the Garda on the implementation of Operation Lifesaver which is being extended on a phased basis to all parts of the country.  That operation is a high profile enforcement initiative with particular emphasis on the key driving offences which cause road accidents. In the lead up to Christmas, the Garda and the National Safety Council will liaise to maximise the impact of this operation.</P>
    <P>The National Safety Council has in the last ten years invested heavily in media and other promotional activities aimed at increasing public awareness of road safety and preventing and reducing accidents.  In response to the recent serious situation, the Government has made an additional grant of £50,000 to the National Safety Council for increased promotional activity up to the end of this year.  The council's most recent advertising campaign, launched last month, focuses on speeding.  There is no doubt that speed is one of the primary factors in fatal road accidents. It is reported in &ldquo;Road Accident Facts 1996&rdquo; that, where a contributory action was specified in accident reports, the primary contributory action in fatal accidents involving at least one driver was &ldquo;exceeded safe speed&rdquo; in 41 per cent of cases.  The new campaign appeals to all drivers, but especially to young males, to stop the serial killer inside themselves.  It is a particularly hard-hitting advertisement and that is what we need.  I was pleased to note the welcome for the campaign in the media from colleagues.</P>
    <P>The objective of the campaign is to make excessive and inappropriate speeding socially unacceptable.  We would all like to see a situation where it is no longer acceptable to boast in company about excessive and inappropriate speeding or about exceeding prescribed speed limits.  A level of social unacceptability has now been very valuably and justifiably achieved in relation to drinking and driving.  A similar culture change as regards speeding is critical to improving road safety in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The activities and actions which I have described generally have a national focus.  However, there is much going on at local level and being achieved <Col N="701" /> through the co-ordination of road safety efforts at city and county level.  Working groups or committees have been established by most of the larger local authorities which have adopted the national multi-agency approach to solving the road accident problem.  I welcome the joint efforts being made at local level by local authorities, the Garda, health boards, road user groups and other organisations across the spectrum of interest in the issue.  It is important for those of us acting at national level to acknowledge this work being done at county, city and community level.  I encourage Senators to network with local authority road safety committees and be fully associated with and support their work.</P>
    <P>This leads to the individual road user who ultimately holds the key to solving the road accident problem in a very significant way.  It is road user behaviour which dictates the level of deaths on our roads.  Road users must take their responsibilities seriously and consider the consequences of their actions.  That applies to all drivers in relation to drinking and driving, speeding, seat belt or helmet wearing.  It applies to pedestrians walking on unlit roads in dark clothing without armbands or other reflective markers, to crossing roads in towns and cities without due regard to vehicle traffic and to walking in any place having consumed alcohol.  We are wasting our time if our focus is only on Departments and agencies.  We need public support for our actions and that support needs to be nurtured and encouraged on a continuous basis as we face the challenge of reducing the numbers and effects of road accidents.</P>
    <P>The time has come for all of us to be more proactive on road safety.  Society is demanding more action and is questioning the price we pay for the great dependence we have on road transport. The prevention and reduction of road accidents must be given a new impetus.  I am determined, as the Minister charged with that responsibility, to achieve this.  That is why the Government has directed that a national road safety strategy should be prepared and developed in the shortest possible time.  Mindful of the acute human tragedy involved in road accidents, I look forward to co-operation in taking this important work forward.  I would be pleased to come back to the House to debate the national road safety strategy when it has been formulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and also welcome the fact that he has been dedicated to this task.  This debate is worthy of recognition because of recent carnage on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree fundamentally with everything that has been said.  The problem about road deaths is one of attitude.  We do not have the right attitudes to go with a society that, for the first time, enjoys a large car ownership.  Road safety is the responsibility of several different arms of the State, and it is falling between them.  It is attitude that results in failure to co-ordinate our efforts and results in murderous behaviour on the roads.  That behaviour seems socially acceptable, whether it is driving <Col N="702" /> with drink taken or driving at reckless speed. I recognise that a change has occurred regarding alcohol.  Teenagers have a different attitude to that of 20, ten or even five years ago.  I hear young people say they will not drive because they will be drinking.  However, it is attitude that makes us fatalistic, treating road deaths as an inevitable price of progress, when there is nothing inevitable about this carnage.</P>
    <P>We need only look at the United Kingdom which has a much more intensive level of car use. Our road death rate is twice as great as theirs. The fault lies with us because of our attitudes. This is what needs to be tackled, and I am delighted the Minister of State recognises it.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest and admit that our efforts to change attitudes on road safety so far have brought very little results.  We tend to blame the Garda for the high accident rate yet we seem to approve of frustrating its efforts.  It was good last year to see a commitment in Dublin to make the traffic flow.  There was a change in attitude.  We supported the Garda efforts to make the freeflow system work.  It was a minor, temporary measure which will resume next month, but it shows that attitudes must change before anything else does. I have a modest suggestion to make regarding the war against attitudes.  It is based on the fact that part of our problem is we think road deaths are inevitable and we do not accept that there is anything much we can do about them.</P>
    <P>However, we should pull out all the stops and prevent fatal road accidents for a single weekend. If we could all row together and achieve that, then our perceptions and attitudes would begin to change immediately.  We could get a weekend free of deaths if we focused on it.  If we concentrated all our efforts on just one weekend, had a massive publicity campaign focusing on just that target, making it socially unacceptable to take any of the risks that result in accidents, it would create an occasion like the Telethon fund raiser. I am always wearing my retailer's hat, and when one has a promotion it attracts attention for a weekend.  If it is spread over months, people lose interest.  The Telethon weekend attracts attention and focuses people.  We should have people making an effort for one weekend to do everything that the National Road Safety Council suggests, such as pedestrians wearing light-coloured clothes and drivers not breaking pedestrian lights.  We can be equally bad pedestrians as we are drivers. Cyclists should wear helmets.  We have achieved much with motor-cyclists.  If one goes to other countries one sees large numbers of motor-cyclists who do not wear helmets, but one seldom sees a motor-cyclist not wearing a helmet in Ireland.  That attitude has been changed over the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>If we could achieve that over one weekend, we would turn the corner towards success.  We would show that this rising trend is not inevitable and that we can do something about this problem.  With that changed perception, we could start to build on <Col N="703" /> that success.  Attacking this problem decisively will take great national will, for example, it will require the will to pass and implement tougher legislation but there is no point legislating if citizens do not support the legislation.  At present people do not support legislation.  They do not understand it and are not committed to it.  If we could change public opinion we would have created the necessary basis for a much tougher legislative régime than that which exists.  If we revere human life as much as we say we do, then we should at least try.</P>
    <P>Last year I was visited by a Japanese retailer.  I asked him how his thousands of stores had succeeded and what made him different from other retailers.  He thought for a little while and then said that whether you believe you can or you cannot do, you are right.  If you believe you can win a football match, then you are likely to do so but if you say you do not have a chance, then you will not win.  We must change our attitude and believe we can tackle and solve this problem.  If we have such an attitude, we can succeed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue.  Those of us who spend time driving on our roads know only too well what a frightening experience it can be at times.  Many of the roads on which we travel are not in a fit condition to meet the bustling demands of modern day traffic. Some of our roads are in such a state of disrepair and neglect, particularly in the west, that they constitute a menace not only to drivers but to pedestrians and cyclists.  Even the most careful and skilled driver travelling within the legal speed limit can lose control of a vehicle on a road with a worn out treacherous surface, too many bends and which is too narrow.  Upgrading our road system to the much higher standards we find in other European countries is the fundamental prerequisite to reducing death and injury from car accidents and is an essential step to creating an environment of relative safety on the highways. Improvements are being made and funds from the EU have helped to give us better and safer roads but progress at a faster pace is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of vehicles on our roads is increasing at a breathtaking rate bringing a correspondent increase in the danger element.  We can get an idea of how dangerous our roads are from the recent statistics quoted earlier.  Last year 454 people died in road accidents, an increase of 4 per cent over the previous year.  More than one person each day was killed on our roads.  In the same year, the number of people injured increased by 5 per cent to 13,319.  According to provisional estimates, 403 people have been killed on our roads so far this year.  The heaviest concentration of deaths, which shocked us, occurred over a two week period when 28 people were killed.  This is a truly horrendous statistic. We should not forget that these statistics are more than figures tabulated on a piece of paper &mdash; they represent people whose lives have been <Col N="704" /> violently taken from them in a shocking tragic moment and who leave behind their loved ones who remain broken hearted for the rest of their days.  The atrocious condition of our roads has contributed to many of these accidents but there are other serious factors involved in the seemingly endless carnage.</P>
    <P>In these enlightened times one would think that nobody would sit behind the wheel of a car after drinking alcohol, yet each day there is an endless parade of people coming before the courts on drink driving charges.  It is more than irresponsible for somebody to drink drive, it is one of the most contemptible crimes because the driver not only puts himself or herself in danger but is a lethal threat to others on the road.  If we can apply the words &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; to anything, it should be to drink driving.  It is important to remember we are in the lead up to Christmas when people are often tempted to drive after two, three or four drinks.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago there was a foolish campaign against drink driving which used the catchphrase &ldquo;two will do&rdquo; which meant one could get behind the wheel of a car after two shots of whiskey or two pints.  It missed the point that even with one drink a person's ability to drive is impaired more than at any other time.  The inflexible rule should be not to drink and drive.  When one sees the madness on the roads, it is easy to understand why groups of women in America have set up the mothers against drink driving campaign.</P>
    <P>Speed is another killer when a driver is not even under the influence of alcohol.  Excessive speed is no excuse even if a person is rushing to catch a train or plane.  Nowadays Irish roads are being used as if they were drag strips and racecourses with motorists tearing along as if they were racing in the <i>Grand Prix.</i> Although I will probably be accused of being sexist, I suggest men are the main culprits of reckless driving.  Some seem to be transformed into aggressive macho creatures who must put the boot down in a power trip regardless of the dangers to others on the road.  An insurance statistic supports this assertion.  It has been suggested that speed was the main factor in some of the dreadful car accidents which claimed so many lives recently.  That does not surprise me nor I am surprised by suggestions that car engines should be regulated to prevent people exceeding a certain speed.  I do not believe mechanical regulation is practical or would be acceptable to motorists no matter how desirable.</P>
    <P>A radical change in the mindset of motorists who believe they have a God given right to travel at ridiculous speed without the slightest regard to the lives of others would bring about a climate of safety on our roads.  More severe enforcement of driving laws are needed to get this message across so people will know what they are doing is criminal. Other similar measures, such as those announced by the Minister this evening, are welcome. Ideas relating to advanced driving tests and tuition should also be looked at.  The points system for those caught committing driving offences <Col N="705" /> should be examined.  I welcome the initiatives taken by the Minister's Department.  As we approach the end of the year I hope we will see a reduction of 20 to 25 per cent in the number killed on our roads daily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud my Progressive Democrat colleagues, in particular Senator Quill, for tabling this appropriate motion.  Over the years Senator Quill has shown an interest in the number of road deaths.  It is only a few weeks since we spoke about a fellow Senator who died in tragic circumstances.  That accident occurred on an open road and the cause was speeding, not by the Senator in question but by others who were apparently acting in an irresponsible fashion.  Last week there was another near tragedy when a school bus on the Chapelizod-Lucan bypass turned over while trying to avoid a wandering horse.  These two instances brought to our attention the horrific prospect of deaths on our roads and the potential for a greater tragedy.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there were 48 road deaths this October which exceeds the corresponding figure for last year.  With over 400 deaths already this year, if there is the same number of deaths in November and December, we will have far exceeded last year's total figures.  This would be a tragedy considering the new initiatives which have been introduced &mdash; the National Traffic Policy Bureau and Operation Lifesaver, both under the auspices of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>We face a severe test in coping with the carnage on our roads.  The total number of deaths in 1996 was 453, in 1995 the figure was 433 and in 1994, 404.  As regards the number of speeding convictions over the same period, in 1994 the figure was 32,293, decreasing in 1995 to 30,805 and in 1996 to 29,132.  There is an obverse ratio in that while the number of deaths is increasing, the number of speeding convictions are decreasing. How can this contradiction be explained?  Is speeding the main cause of death?  Are there statistics to back this up?  Do we have enough information from the scenes of fatal accidents to confirm this?  Is the corollary of this that law enforcers are remiss in bringing cases before the courts or are the courts too lenient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of deaths in the past couple of years is well in excess of 10 times the murder rate.  In 1996, 42 people were murdered and 453 people died on the roads.  If the murder rate increased to anything around this level, there would be a huge outcry and demand for immediate action.  The Government's powers and resources to stem this tide would have to be examined.  However, the figures are stark and the number of deaths on our roads horrific.  The situation in Northern Ireland was similar.  Far more people died each year from fatalities on roads than in the Troubles.  However, the public imagination seemed to be concerned with deaths caused by the Troubles.  If terrorists claimed the lives of 453 people annually on roads in the Republic, what legislation would be introduced?  What powers would be given to the appropriate <Col N="706" /> authorities to deal with it?  The public outcry to ensure their implementation would be colossal.</P>
    <P>In the courts, speeding is dealt with as a summary offence, carrying a maximum fine of £150 although the judge has the discretion to endorse a driving licence following a conviction.  This is seldom utilised unless there is evidence of dangerous driving or a serious accessory problem. Should we deal with this matter as a summary offence and should there be a fine of this nature?  Should an endorsement be made compulsory?  The human tragedy is colossal and cannot be estimated financially, but the economic loss in terms of insurance and capital fallout is estimated at about £850,000 for each fatality.</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem and despite recent measures the trend is getting worse.  As we are in the process of reforming local authorities and giving them extra funding, perhaps they should be given responsibility for the policing of traffic.  Dublin Corporation will take control of traffic policing and we have already appointed a director of traffic. However, is it appropriate for the Garda which has responsibility for dealing with all criminal elements, to be burdened with parking, traffic and fines?  We should consider a traffic police force and perhaps we might make more progress.</P>

      <P>It is worrying that there are so many fatal and serious accidents they sometimes no longer warrant a mention in the headlines. Last week I heard someone say: &ldquo;Anyone who drives faster than me is a lunatic and anyone who drives slower than me is a nuisance&rdquo;.  This highlights the attitude we all have &mdash; that we are the best drivers on the road and that many of those around us need a few lessons.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons for the increase in road carnage.  These include the improvements in our roads and road surfaces in the past number of years.  A greater influence is the increase in the number of car models available.  The days are gone when &ldquo;bangers&rdquo; could be seen on our roads, which is possibly due to the car scrappage scheme.  However, there is no doubt that an increase in car size and power has a great deal to do with speeding.  The car seems to have become an extension of the home, particularly in urban areas.  It is a dressing room, beauty salon, barber shop, reading room, office and disco.</P>

      <P>One also sees people driving while using mobile phones, reading the newspaper, shaving or putting on lipstick.  There is often music blaring in the background so one wonders how they have time to concentrate on driving.  I am sure I could also be accused of doing some of those things while driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair to constantly blame young people for causing problems on our roads.  However, young people take numerous driving lessons and, in some cases, two or three driving tests, so they are probably better equipped than the older generation <Col N="707" /> to drive a car.  Many older people have developed bad habits over the years and I often see them changing lanes without indicating.  Perhaps refresher courses should be introduced for drivers.  There is no doubt that young people have greater access to cars than they did a few years ago.  They now seem to get cars on their eighteenth birthday.</P>
    <P>Drink driving continues to be a problem in rural areas and the older generation seems to be the greatest culprit.  The younger generation appears to be more responsible and they will always order a taxi or arrange for somebody to drive.  It is often the person who goes to the local pub for a pint and then stays for two or three who will attempt to drive home.  The roads in my area are dangerous at any time of the night once the local pub is closed.</P>
    <P>Speed is also a problem.  We all exceed the speed limit at times.  It is as if people cannot get from one place to another fast enough.  Greater emphasis must be placed on law enforcement if we want to prevent the carnage of our roads. There are certain places in my county where I will slow down because I expect to see the gardaí.  A Garda presence has a great influence, particularly in rural areas.  While I welcome on the spot fines, I would increase them and, after a number of offences, confiscate the licences.  The only way to teach people a lesson is through their pockets.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent launch of the television advertisement which brings home to people that anybody can be a serial killer.  This will be of benefit but it is not a long-term solution.  We must educate our children and young people about their responsibility towards pedestrians and cyclists. There is no doubt this is a problem in urban areas. We need to enforce the regulations and to hit motorists where it hurts most, their pockets, while at the same endorsing their licences.</P>

    <P>Everybody in this House has numerous gripes about driving.  Deputies, Senators and public representatives clock up much mileage each year. People seem to undergo a personality change when they sit behind the wheel of a car or use a telephone.  When the two are combined, it is a lethal cocktail.  We have all seen the gentleman driving his car at high speed while talking on his mobile phone.  He is probably not driving the car, but aiming it at the road to the detriment of everyone else.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle said that speed kills.  It does not matter if a person is hit by a car at 20, 50 or 100 miles an hour because the damage I have seen in this city's casualty departments is extensive.  The lucky people &mdash; I say this with caution &mdash; are probably those who are killed.  As part of their driving education, learner drivers should be taken to the national rehabilitation centre in Rochestown Avenue to see what happens people who survive car crashes with their faculties severely damaged, or to St. Mary's in the Phoenix Park which has a unit for young, damaged people who can no longer look after themselves.</P>
    <P>The statistics have already been mentioned. Comprehensive radial routes out of Dublin city are being introduced at the moment, one of the features of which are bicycle lanes.  Anybody who cycles, as I do, realises that if a lorry travelling at over 40 miles an hour passes within a couple of feet of them they have very little hope of not being dragged under the lorry.  We are proposing to paint bicycle lanes on the streets but we need to physically separate such lanes from motorised traffic.  Anyone who wants to see the ultimate lunacy should go to the Four Courts on the north quays of the Liffey where a bicycle lane, on which I have cycled, has been painted inside a bus lane. Buses in the city can travel at speeds of up to 60 miles an hour.  In fact, buses were clocked travelling at 70 miles an hour on the Clonee bypass. Cyclists can feel the pull of such buses, from which they are separated by only a painted line. This is ridiculous.  We should either have no cycle lanes or physically separate them from motorised traffic.</P>
    <P>Many elderly pedestrians have no comprehension of the danger in which they place themselves, especially on unlit country roads at night.  I do a fair amount of driving in the country and, as the Minister said, such people wear dark clothing on unlit roads and one has to brake to avoid them, even when travelling at 30 miles per hour.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of motor vehicle testing which will be carried out by an independent body.  This body will have no car repair function but will examine cars and provide a list of problems to be solved.  I hope their first priority will be car lights.  I am sure when Members drive home to their constituencies this weekend they will encounter the &ldquo;one eyed bandits&rdquo;.  These are <Col N="709" /> the drivers of cars which have only one headlight on, usually the inside headlight.  They are either too careless or mean to get the outside headlight fixed.  These people do terrible damage on the roads because other drivers have very little time to take evasive action.</P>
    <P>Road accidents are caused by a multiplicity of factors, including speed, drink, carelessness and bad manners.  There seems to be a rising incidence of bad manners on the road.  One sees white knuckled drivers rushing to work who grind their teeth as they try to get ahead of other cars.  Road courtesy should be an integral part of any training scheme for drivers.</P>

      <P>I hope some of my observations will help the Minister and those who are trying to make our roads safer.  I probably cover more mileage than any other Member in driving the 220 miles between my home and this House every week.  I spend about 15 hours a week driving a car.</P>
      <P>Newspaper photographs of car accidents in which at least one car is completely mangled tell us quite clearly that speed kills.  It is not always the case that both cars were speeding but if one car is speeding it will damage the other car involved in the accident.  There is also no doubt that one cannot drink and drive.  It is suicidal to drive a car after drinking.  I have seen people do many stupid things on the road over the course of my travels.</P>
      <P>Every year we spend a great deal of money on roads and they are improving.  However, many serious accidents do not occur on bad roads but on ones which have been improved and widened. For example, a number of horrific accidents have occurred on the road from Adare to Newcastlewest. No accidents should occur on that road which is 50 yards wide.  It is difficult to understand why there have been at least three head-on collisions on that road which has enough room for eight lanes of traffic.  Such accidents are probably caused by slow drivers who refuse to move from the centre of the road.  I also blame fast drivers and those who drink and drive, but we must take into account slow drivers who hog the middle of the road and refuse to let anyone pass them without crossing the line.</P>
      <P>The Minister should assess the standards applied to those taking a driving test.  Such people can usually recite the rules of the road backwards, but they are rarely required to drive any faster than 30 miles an hour because they are usually driving in a town.  Has any driver ever been tested in conditions where they had to drive at 50 or 60 miles an hour?  As soon as they leave the driving tester they drive home at 60 miles an hour.  They are not capable of driving at such speeds because they do not have enough experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also favour the compulsory testing of cars.  The first test should be carried out on headlights. At least 75 per cent of night-time drivers <Col N="710" /> do not realise they have glaring fog lamps on at the rear of their car.  It is crazy that I have to drive to Dingle for six hours behind glaring red lights when there is no fog whatsoever.  More than likely when there is fog they will not have them on at all and you will run into the back of their cars.  We have all seen cars with loose lights. These are spot lamps that are put on after the car is bought.  You would think people were trying to dazzle rabbits with these lights.  One of the lights points at the sky and the other straight in your eye.  The lights are bouncing because they are loose.  When you look at the cars of these speed merchants it is like Christmas with a type of fairy lights whizzing around the back window continuously. Let us get rid of the embellishments on cars and all these crazy lights that run all over the back window and indeed the front window in cases.  They should be banned.</P>
    <P>I always thought that there was a law whereby the only notices permitted on the windscreen of a car were the tax and insurance discs.  Some of the windows of articulated trucks are so dotted with all sorts of stickers that the drivers are looking out through a little hole to find the way.  I would like to see Garda checkpoints at night to check people who are not dipping their lights.  I drove a lorry for seven years and I know that lights do not bother lorry drivers.  They are up so high that it makes no difference to them so they let whatever is coming have the lights because they are going to see the road anyway.</P>
    <P>There is a big difference in the speed at which lorries and buses travel.  If an articulated lorry stops at high speed it will, more than likely, jack-knife. If you try to stop a truck with 30 tons on it trundling down at high speed you cannot do it. Trucks often pass me on the dual carriageway at 60 or 70 miles per hour and they travel in convoy as well.  You think when you go to pass one out you are safe and all of a sudden there is another one and there is not room to pull in.  It is time to put the foot down &mdash; not on the pedal but on the drivers.  I welcome all that the Minister is doing. I hope that this debate might save even one life because this has been a bad month for accidents. Instead of being put off the road for speeding would it not be better to have some sort of sticker where for two years, if drivers were caught exceeding 50 miles per hour, they would be pulled up.  That would slow them down fairly fast.</P>

      <P>At the outset I want to thank all of the Members who contributed so well to this debate and to say that, as a result, a number of very practical and good ideas as to how this problem could be tackled have been put before the Minister.  I have no doubt but that these ideas will become part of the new national strategy of which the Minister spoke.  I particularly want to thank the Minister for coming this evening.  I am very encouraged by the fact that the Government has taken this issue so seriously since its formation and that this Minister, in particular, has been given the responsibility for this issue with a view <Col N="711" /> to effecting a sizeable reduction in the number of road accidents, fatal and otherwise.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago the same Minister tackled water safety and put in place a strategy that yielded tremendously good results.  I am looking forward to the same measure of success with his new road safety strategy.  It is important that there is a very comprehensive and integrated approach to this problem.  That is why I am glad we are not just making an odd stab at it now and then when an accident occurs and forgetting about it until the next accident happens.  I am glad that the Minister is setting about this in a totally planned and scientific way.  He has said that he would be willing to debate the national road strategy in this House.  I look forward to that and I hope he does so.  At the end of the day, the Minister knows that it is enforcement that counts.  We can have the best strategy in the world but unless that strategy is implemented rigidly and comprehensively we will not get the type of results that we all want.  It is important that we have not alone the strategy but the resources and the will to implement it.  That is the key.  I hope this will happen very soon and that in his current term of office the Minister will see this through to the point where fatal road accidents are an abnormality and something to be wondered at rather than something that happens every day.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of driver attitude.  The single most important challenge that we have to face is to bring about a fundamental shift in the attitude and skills of those behind the wheel.  If we can do that then we will succeed.  It will take time, patience and skill but I would like to see that happen. That, more than anything less, would be a formula for success.</P>
      <P>In a number of schools, in transition year, there are some driving and road safety programmes as part of a young person's essential education.  It is just as important for a young person to learn to become a safe and competent driver as it is to master any of the many technologies they now need to make a successful career.  I would like to see driving skills and road safety as an essential element in transition year in schools.  That is where you start.  If you get at people when they are young and influence their attitudes at that point then you will hope to succeed.  The three elements that are the cornerstone of any strategy and policy are education, enforcement and engineering. I have every confidence that this Minister will effect an enormous improvement and that we can look forward to better times when our roads will not be graveyards for so many people but places where people can drive and walk in safety and comfort.</P>

      <P>Before I adjourned the debate I was discussing the options between rehabilitative and punitive measures.  A Senator on the other side of the House stated that there were options but, in fact, there are not as we all know.  A long-term strategy, such as that supported by the Minister and the Government, is a wide ranging rehabilitative programme targeting various communities.</P>
      <P>In the short and medium terms, however, a punitive programme of imprisonment for those most guilty has to be pursued and expanded to relieve communities under siege.  Communities throughout the country, rural and urban, are being ravaged by the scourge of drug abuse. According to this evening's papers the evil princes of darkness are using urban cowboys on horseback to promulgate their evil deeds for phenomenal gain.  They must be put out of circulation, as must those who co-operate with them.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined a series of commendable initiatives.  I want to refer in particular to his proposal to revise the Juvenile Justice Bill to take account of the problem of child pornography, which is becoming endemic.  I want to castigate the previous Minister who, even though she brought in commendable legislation to deal with drug trafficking and money laundering, failed miserably in the area of juvenile justice.</P>
      <P>When challenged in the Lower House as to what was being done about preparing legislation on juvenile justice, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, said nothing had been done.  I told him that was totally inaccurate.  A number of Deputies, including the present Minister, served on a crime committee chaired by Senator Quill who was then a Deputy.  We did a phenomenal amount of work but despite all that the previous Government failed abjectly over a two year period to address the question of juvenile justice and simply ran away from it.  Despite posturing and repeated promises from both the former Taoiseach and the former Minister for Justice, no such legislation was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The expectations of those living in rural areas are high because, even before the Minister was appointed, people were aware of his determination, concern and knowledge of the problems.  His appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was welcome to those who must fight the drug barons.  I compliment the Minister for a positive and determined campaign.  Criminals know the resources of the State will be applied to make things more difficult for them.  The Minister is committed to his job and is determined to obtain results.  I have total confidence that he will be successful.</P>
      <P>The county I represent has a more difficult problem in this regard than the rest of the country because in addition to the problems experienced in rural areas and cities, we have 100 miles of a long Border which runs from Derry to Dundalk, including all the difficulties concerning those who cross the Border illegally.  It is an area which is nearly impossible to police.</P>
      <P>Today, I received a fax from Letterkenny which contained an article from the <i>Derry People</i> of 7 October 1997.  The headlines in the newspaper are alarming and, while they may be used to highlight the problem, I hope they are not true. The article stated that:</P>
      <P>A former member of the recently established cross-Border anti-drugs group described as highly alarming comments by the head of the Northern Ireland drugs squad that his hands were tied in dealing with problems because members of the Special Branch exchanged free passage of drugs for information on terrorists.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that any responsible police force worthy of the name would allow that to happen. Whatever the interest in securing information about paramilitaries, I do not believe that a policeman would allow drugs to pass as a price for obtaining information on criminals.  Nevertheless, that is alarming information which makes life difficult for those who, like the Minister, are legislating. People will never accept that a legislative system can solve all the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is quite a bit of scaremongering which makes it more difficult to put such a policing system in place in rural areas.  This concerns those who run discos, dances and other functions in the Border areas.  Often in discos and such like boys <Col N="714" /> and girls are asked if they would like something to cheer them up as a way of getting them to take drugs.  Policing this scene is a major job.</P>
    <P>We must support the Minister in his campaign to clean up the drugs scene.  The newspaper headlines only tell us about the big drug hauls, but there are Garda successes every day involving the capturing of smaller quantities.</P>
    <P>The use of plain clothes gardaí represents the best effort in the fight against drugs.  Will the Minister consider deploying a drugs squad on the Border which will undertake searches?  Travelling recently from County Donegal I saw a garda take possession of a cattle trailer and was delighted to note gardaí deploying spot checks on all kinds of vehicles.</P>
    <P>Many small Garda stations have been closed in my county yet it has now been suggested that there is a need for gardaí to return to the beat on foot or on bicycles.  While that is good in theory, it is no longer feasible in practice.  However, the Minister should consider using more plain clothes gardaí as it is the only way he will be successful.</P>
    <P>We must allay the fears of those living in rural areas.  It is not uncommon for people to have automatic security lights at the front and rear of their homes.  Other kinds of costly security systems, which are perhaps necessary, are now in place in rural areas where people live alone.</P>
    <P>The Minister's determination will help convince people that we are all in this together.  If the public is to be safe the Minister must be successful. The issue is far too serious to become a political football.  Any politician who does not take seriously concerns about policing, drugs and crime is out of touch.  They should get priority funding and I hope the Minister will get sufficient funds to successfully put the drug barons and criminals in rural Ireland out of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a fellow county man and constituency colleague I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his important and difficult ministry.  There can be no doubting his bona fides regarding zero tolerance and positive action against serious criminals whether involved in drugs or engaged in organised crime.  His intent is beyond reproach.</P>
      <P>The country has learnt to great cost that criminality does not lack mobility.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to provide an additional 1,000 prison spaces within two years, to increase Garda numbers to 12,000 over the next few years, to encourage various Garda operational initiatives and to strengthen the hands of the Garda in fighting serious crime.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also serious and well intentioned in his resolve to close off any loopholes which are exploited by criminals.  I look forward to the promised criminal justice legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demanning of Garda stations is not customer friendly and does not inspire confidence. Gardaí must be brought back to rural areas because crime has become increasingly prevalent. <Col N="715" /> The severe beatings of elderly people is an example.</P>
    <P>The gardaí deserve great credit for their recent drug seizures and I welcome the extra facilities which this legislation will give them in fighting the drugs menace in the future.  The purposes of the Bill are to facilitate the exchange of information between member states; to obtain, collate and analyse information and intelligence; to notify the competent authorities of the member states without delay, via the national units of information concerning them, of any connections identified between criminal offences; to aid investigations of the member states by forwarding all relevant information to the national units and to maintain a computerised system of collected information.  I welcome this, but I sound a note of warning regarding the maintenance of a computerised system of collected information.</P>
    <P>Some of the experts on computer hacking are versatile.  Arising from that, there are two possible causes of concern.  One refers to possible breaches of constitutional rights.  We are blest with a written Constitution which respects the liberty of the citizen and personal and privacy rights. There is the possibility that we could subject the citizens of this State to less stringent protections which pertain in other states where our constitutional values are not so effectively protected. Persons in this country may have effective remedies in constitutional law against possible breaches of data protection procedures, but can such remedies be effective in a European context?</P>
    <P>The second cause for concern refers to breaches of data protection.  Living in the cyber age, where there is a huge amount of information at our fingertips, increasing use of computerised systems to gather, store and distribute data about individuals may have adverse implications for various persons.  There has been a high level of compliance by data compilers and data bureaux with principles which seek to promote fair and honest dealing in respect of the gathering, storing, use and disclosure of personal data.  I take it that all our European partners have implemented the data protection directive.  If he has not already done so, I am sure the Minister will address this issue in his reply.</P>
    <P>The scope for reform in this area might relate to the need for a more stringent checking system in respect of the type and amount of information stored.  The probable fault of this legislation is the lack of independent scrutiny by specialists in the field of data protection &mdash; namely, the Data Protection Commissioners &mdash; of information which is passed on from this country.  Another shortcoming of the Bill lies in the absence of a definite cut-off in terms of the types of crimes covered.  A broad ambit is given regarding the type of crimes in respect of which Europol will have competence to retain information.  The main provisions of the convention allow for progressive development of the types of crime which will be covered.  There <Col N="716" /> should be some control over the progression of that development because there must be a cut-off point.  Combating terrorism and unlawful drug trafficking can be justifiable but an extension into crimes involving motor vehicles might not be.</P>
    <P>That said, I welcome the Minister's intent and the Bill.  It is highly desirable that a measure to further combat organised and serious crime should come before the House.  I support it fully on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will spare the Minister my speech on why, instead of providing a further 1,000 prison places, he should expand the probation service and give it proper resources.  However, in a debate of this sort I must revisit my speech concerning trafficking in women and children throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>Members' contributions have concentrated on the drug trafficking element of crime in Europe. However, as the Minister stated, it is important to recognise that where drug trafficking occurs there will also be trafficking in women and children. The latter has become a multi-million pound criminal operation and there is evidence that it is being committed throughout the world on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>There are elements of the Europol Bill to which one could raise objections and it is regrettable that there has been little public debate about its provisions.  However, despite my reservations, I support the Bill.  I attended the 1996 conference on the sexual exploitation of children which was held in Stockholm.  The declaration brought forward at that conference stressed the essential need for co-operation between police, customs officials and judicial and social welfare authorities at national and international level. Travel is now so much easier that it is ridiculous to tackle such problems on a national basis. Therefore, information must be shared between various countries.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Bill will include provisions to stop trafficking in people.  It is extraordinary that this new form of slavery is so widespread that every country recognises the need to legislate against it. When the Europol drugs unit was established at the end of 1996, it was quickly agreed that trafficking in people in addition to trafficking in drugs must also be included under its ambit.  This is an unfortunate development but it is recognised in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about a number of aspects of the Bill.  The Minister referred to Interpol in his contribution but I can find no reference to it in the Bill.  It is essential that the lines of communication between the newly established Europol and Interpol should be clear.  At present, there are units of Interpol in each country and it would be a great pity if there was a lack of communication between these units and their counterparts in Europol.  I am sure the Minister has not forgotten this and I hope it will be emphasised when the Bill is enacted and implemented.  If it is not, the two agencies might run in parallel to each <Col N="717" /> other and there could be a lack of co-operation and co-ordination.  We must also avoid the duplication of manpower and resources, which is vital to the success of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill seems to be concerned in the main with what is coming into the European Union and not with what is going out of it.  Clandestine emigration seems to be stressed more than the trafficking of people into the European Union and within it.  Emphasis does not seem to have been laid on what is going out of the EU.  This is important because last week's newspapers reported the case of a Chinese child who was discovered by an alert policeman at Milan Airport. The child was travelling on a Japanese passport and in the company of a Chinese woman to Miami.  I do not know the legislation under which the authorities managed to stop the child's journey. It was later discovered that the operation was run by a paedophile ring which exploits Chinese children by shipping them through Italy to the United States.  Will Europol be in a position to deal with such cases?  The child involved was not entering Italy but was merely being shipped through that country.  Will the Minister indicate whether Europol will be empowered to deal with this sort of activity?  As far as I understand it, the policeman could only arrest the woman and child because they were travelling on false passports.  It is important that the legislation be designed to deal with such cases.</P>
    <P>Mary Banotti, MEP, liases in cases where children are abducted from their native country to another jurisdiction.  I accept that these are often family situations but the tragedy affects everyone involved.  The world is a large place.  How carefully will Europol monitor this?  For example, last year children from Ireland were abducted and brought to Western Samoa and they only returned home with great difficulty.  Will consideration be given to those abducted and brought out of Europe?  Will the Minister provide assurances that the emphasis will not merely be placed on people entering Europe?</P>
    <P>The Bill places a certain amount of emphasis on the expansion of the European Union into central and eastern Europe, including the Baltic states.  These countries appear to have a pre-accession pact so that their authorities will be in co-ordination with Europol before they enter the Union &mdash; they may not do so for many years.  It is important to remember that huge numbers of people are trafficked from eastern Europe into western Europe because they are less recognisable and more easily hidden than, for example, people from the Far East.  Approximately 500,000 women are annually brought into western Europe.  I do not know how many come from eastern Europe but this is a major operation.  One must hope that Europol will be given vast resources because it will not be easy to tackle this huge task.  The Schengen Treaty has made a major difference in respect of the movement of people.  However, we must be careful that we do not merely focus on the movement of goods such <Col N="718" /> as drugs, laundered money, etc.  We must remember that the movement of people is equally important.</P>
    <P>The training of the police force will be vital. What resources are being provided to train the police to deal with language problems?  This is a serious problem for refugees, especially with the change in the criteria by which people can be stopped either on the Border with Northern Ireland or at ports or airports.  People can have great difficulty trying to explain themselves if they are not English speakers.  I heard on the radio, for instance, that people with strong Belfast accents were not recognised by the police on a bus in Northern Ireland the other day; how much more difficult would it be for refugees?  I am not asking that all the should be able to speak the Serbo-Croat dialects, but it is important that we try to make available language facilities for the police when they deal with these problems.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris, in particular, spoke about the right to privacy of data on computer.  The rights of individuals are precious to all of us; this is another area on which it is a pity there has not been more debate.  The data on computer are not nearly as important as to whom they are accessible. I know careful safeguards are being given but I would query how the confidentiality of the data will be maintained, knowing that already there has been difficulty with the data collected by Interpol.</P>
    <P>Many people got excited about starting a database on people who have committed crimes associated with children &mdash; paedophiles.  Will there be any reference on this international database to such crimes or must the person be found to have committed a crime in another country before they will be on the database?</P>
    <P>There is much for which these databases could be used that would be very useful.  For example, they could be used to put together a centralised register for missing children.  This is very important because children are abducted from one country to another.  The advent of the Channel Tunnel, for instance, has made it so much easier to abduct children from Ireland to the common travel area in England and on into continental Europe before taking them further. The setting up of such an international register would be important.</P>
    <P>Many young people who disappear are never placed on any register.  Sometimes their families think they are sleeping rough in a large urban area and if they have come from State homes, it is not noticed that they have gone missing.  It is important to remember that nine of the people who were murdered by Frederick West in England had not been reported missing.  There are many good things which this register could bring together.  The lack of co-ordination and co-operation between countries has been a great deficiency in the past and I am sure the Minister will address this important area.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of paragraphs in the explanatory memorandum to which I want to <Col N="719" /> refer.  First, there is no mention of Interpol in paragraph 15, which states that each member state's national unit will be the sole liaison body between Europol and national authorities.  I hoped there would be a mention of the international element there, that we must look at more than the European situation.</P>
    <P>Second, it appears from paragraph 17 which deals with section 3(6) that there seems to be a reticence to place Customs and Excise officers in these units immediately.  I realise the Minister is appointing the national unit under the Garda Síochána but the procedure seems fairly cumbersome. Surely these people should be in the first line of defence.  The commissioner will have to get permission from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance but what happens if the Minister for Finance says &ldquo;No&rdquo; because it is a lean year?  I would have preferred more emphasis to be put on the Customs and Excise personnel because they will be the first line of defence.  Unless we can ensure that they are given a prominent position, I do not know how well the unit will do.  The Minister might address that matter too.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is rather cumbersome.  According to paragraph 22 of the explanatory memorandum, Customs and Excise officers can only be sent after the Garda Commissioner has consulted with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and any other Minister, such as the Minister for Finance, as appropriate.  It seems a tedious way to involve some of the most important people in getting this unit up and working.</P>
    <P>This has so much to do establishing communication and co-ordination between the European police forces that I will support the Bill even though I know our civil rights must be carefully guarded because they are easily eroded.  Nowadays there are elements of crime which cannot possibly be addressed on a national basis.  For example, every day English girls arrive from Madrid on the way to some other country carrying drugs.  This is not a situation which could be tackled on a national level.  I am glad the Bill was introduced but I wish there had been more public debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This Bill appears very comprehensive and necessary.  Like previous speakers, I support it and commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any legislation which enhances the powers of the forces of law and order to bring to justice drug barons and international criminals must be supported.  At the same time we must be careful that in so doing we are not diluting the abilities of the Garda Síochána, which is doing a first rate <Col N="720" /> job at present with reduced resources when one considers the technology which criminals now have at their fingertips, in what are often extremely difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not see any provisions in the Bill telling us from where the money is coming to pay for the additional manpower which will be necessitated by this Bill nor did I hear mention of it.  I presume the introduction of this Bill came about because we are fulfilling an obligation to our European partners and European legislation.  Nevertheless, it is good legislation and must be supported.</P>
    <P>The collation of data on computer, to which Senators referred, which will make the job of catching the abovementioned criminals more efficient, must be supported.  However, one must also express a degree of alarm when one reads articles such as that in a local newspaper to which Senator McGowan referred.  Whether the article was true or false, we must take these matters seriously and investigate them.  If we are to enact legislation which will collate a great deal of personal data on computer, we must be mindful of the fact that some police forces may not be so well meaning and the data may be used for the purposes of political oppression.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is doing a first rate job under difficult circumstances but we have an obligation to enable it do an ever better job.  Rural Garda stations are often fitted with a &ldquo;green man&rdquo; but this is not working.  We must get the garda out of the motor car, into the community, on to the roads and if necessary back on his bike, even if it is a motorbike.  The presence of a garda creates security in a community and encourages respect among the young.  When young people see gardaí passing by in cars they do not have the same respect for them as we did growing up.  I cherish the day when the local garda, priest or school master could give a young person a cuff across the ear for misbehaving.  That day will not return but we must provide a substitute.</P>
    <P>This legislation will bring us into line with our European partners, although I hope the new agency does not cut across the duties of Interpol. The Bill must be sensibly and sensitively operated. We must we careful not to dilute the work of our current police force and that the Bill does not become a double-edged weapon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill the provisions of which must be examined within the wider context of European integration.  Ten years have passed since the Single European Act and four years since the Treaty on European Union, at which time we saw considerable scepticism about Europe in general and, in some countries, European integration.  This was due to the emergence of severe economic and social problems which seemed too difficult for anyone to settle. The first of these was unemployment, especially in many economies which were not managed as well as ours; the second was organised crime, including drug trafficking, arms dealing, computer crime, pornography, etc.  It is quite clear <Col N="721" /> that unless these problems are addressed &mdash; if they prove capable of solution &mdash; the process of European integration may be halted or even reversed.</P>
      <P>Reasonable gains have been made through integration and no one wants these to be lost. Most people agree that no one state can solve these problems on its own.  This is especially true regarding organised crime, which has a trans-European dimension and must be tackled on that basis.  One task which has been identified by the European Council is a new security order, which is being addressed by this Bill.  In the Dáil debate on 30 September, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I intend to take seriously the duty of the State to protect the citizen's rights to live in peace, free from the fear of criminal intrusion. Time and again I have said that in the hierarchy of obligations, the obligation of a sovereign Government to protect its people and its property is a superior one.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason I support this Bill.  The priority of the protection of European citizens is being advanced at both European and national level.  We must tackle crime and this is one of the best ways to do it.</P>
      <P>However, although I am a committed European and support the Bill, I have certain worries about it.  What does the man in the street know or feel about a pan-European police force?  No debate has taken place in the media on this.  It is all very well to see on television an FBI man overriding local police and cleaning up a mess, but how would an Irish citizen react to a German, French or Italian policeman in Cahirciveen or Killybegs?  It is incumbent on us to discuss the legislation and promulgate its provisions to a much wider audience.  This must be part of an ongoing effort to help the public understand the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am also worried about the intelligence gathering provisions.  How will this information be stored and in what detail?  Will it be kept forever or will it be disposed of?  On a recent BBC television programme, a police chief admitted to having 30 million people on file, including anyone who attended an Aldermaston march, who was a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament or Amnesty International or who had been involved in university politics.  Big Brother has gone a little too far.</P>
      <P>One provision of the Bill mentions a monitoring body.  Who will be the judge of this?  How will this person access information and know whether rights are being violated without becoming involved in an ongoing judicial process?  The Bill also provides that information will only be stored if that is strictly necessary.  Who will decide that?  Will it be the monitoring body?  Article 10 of the convention states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Europol, in addition to data of a non-personal nature, may store, modify, and utilize other files . concerning . persons who might be called on to testify in investigations <Col N="722" /> . persons who may be victims of the offences . contacts and associates, and . persons who can provide information on the criminal offences under consideration.</P>
    <P>That is extremely wide.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister's attitude to crime but some of the Bill's provisions are frightening and if we discussed them at length I am sure they would be modified.  Article 19 states:</P>
    <P>Where the law of the Member State applied to provides for a communication concerning data, such communication shall be refused if such refusal is necessary to:</P>
    <P>(1) enable Europol to fulfil its duties properly .</P>
    <P>What does &ldquo;properly&rdquo; mean in that context &mdash; does it mean &ldquo;efficiently&rdquo; or &ldquo;effectively&rdquo;?  It is a rather vague word.  A provision of Article 19(5) seems to require correction; it states:</P>
    <P>Europol, in close co-operation with the national authorities concerned, shall carry out the checks and notify the enquirer that is has done so .</P>
    <P>I presume that should read &ldquo;it has done so&rdquo;.  It may not make much difference but it could give rise to a constitutional problem if it is not corrected because this is a far-reaching Bill.</P>
    <P>Why are the headquarters to be in the Netherlands?  There may be a good reason for it being there rather than in Dublin.  The convention states that Europol's employees shall enjoy the privileges and immunities necessary for the performance of their tasks.  That is also vague and can be interpreted to stop anyone investigating any steps taken in this regard.  The list of other crimes which can be added include the trade in human organs and tissue, computer crime, the illicit traffic in endangered animal species, and the illicit traffic in hormonal substances and other growth promoters.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill with wide-ranging effects for our population, more so than is realised even by those who have read it cursorily. It has huge implications for private citizens whose rights are affected even in a small sense.  The Minister may not agree but it is a strong Bill.  I am aware of the need for this body because I know the results of drug taking and organised crime &mdash; we see them world wide.  Nevertheless, we must be careful not to move too far to the right.  I do not suggest the Minister would do that but I share the fears of other Members in that respect.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill.  It is necessary because society unfortunately demands such action and we cannot be found wanting.  As the Minister said in the Dáil, the protection of the citizen must be paramount in our endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the points made by Senator Lydon.  I welcome this important Bill which is unfortunately necessary. <Col N="723" /> It marks our responsibility to our European neighbours in the context of our membership of the EU.  We have a responsibility to translate EU conventions into domestic law and, in a wider context, to play our part in combating crime at European level.</P>
      <P>It is only when one examines the Bill that one realises this process has only begun.  The process is difficult and legislation such as this must be debated in a more public fashion.  We repeat frequently that the public needs to be included in debate on legislative matters such as this but I have not heard any proposals for mechanisms to ensure such inclusion.  Senator Norris said that the European Parliament was not consulted on this legislation.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that the convention &ldquo;. provides for progressive development of the types of crimes in respect of which Europol will have competence&rdquo;. Therefore, this is just a starting point. I hope the European Parliament will be included in debates on such matters in the future.  There has been criticism of the recent referendum on Cabinet confidentiality to the effect that people should have known more about the issue and the Government should have ensured they had more information.  I await with interest its response to that because it is a matter which relates not only to this but to other issues.</P>
      <P>When one examines the tasks which the convention accords to Europol they appear fairly straightforward.  They include facilitating the exchange of information on crime between member states; to obtain, collate and analyse information and to notify the competent authorities. One might consider that it is a minimal task until one examines the terms of the convention.  It is frightening to see the extent of what it involves. It takes on something of a Big Brother connotation in which Europol will have a large collection of data on crime and individuals.  The only reference to protection in the legislation is that the powers of the Data Protection Commissioner will be the means by which a person will be protected. I do not suggest that the Data Protection Commissioner does not perform a good job. However, what are the resource implications for that office as a result of this legislation?  Will the service be upgraded?  Will additional staff and other resources be made available to ensure that the onerous duty this legislation places on that service will be carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great care and attention must be paid to the collection, storage and use of information.  We live in a technological age.  It is one thing to have information collected at national level but it is quite another to have it collected at European level.  What will a citizen be able to do if he or she finds out that information has been collected in an incorrect manner?  How will he or she access that information and ensure it is corrected?  I imagine this will be a far from simple task and will prove an onerous exercise for an ordinary <Col N="724" /> citizen, especially when it concerns a body based in The Hague.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a comprehensive review of his legislative programme on crime and I thank him for that.  His speech dealt with many matters related to crime but I was disappointed that he did not take the opportunity to raise the issue of violent crime against women, the level of which is frightening.  We seem to have become immune to news of women being murdered.  When a murder occurs, an automatic assumption is made that the woman was attacked by a member of her family or somebody living with her.  There is a higher level of tolerance in society for crimes committed in a domestic context.  If a man hits his wife in the home it is considered less serious than if he hits a stranger in the street.  I am sure the Minister shares my view that crime against women is the lowest level of crime and must be abhorred.  The Minister has an important position and at every available opportunity he should state his abhorrence of violence against women.  I was disappointed he did not refer to it in his speech.</P>
    <P>This legislation and other crime related legislation, of which we have seen a lot in recent years, comes against the background of great social change.  We have found it necessary to update our legislation, give more powers to the Garda and create agencies such as the Criminal Assets Bureau to deal with the increasing professionalism of criminals.  We are no longer at a point where we can happily sleep in our beds at night knowing we live in a peaceful society.  Unfortunately, we do not.  I do not wish to exaggerate the point and I am aware that crime in rural areas is not at the same level as in urban areas.  However, we must recognise that the drugs problem is one of the greatest scourges we have faced.  The murder of Veronica Guerin shook out of us whatever complacency we may have had about the professionalism of drug pushers and the international nature of crime.</P>
    <P>Change is necessary.  Legislation must be updated constantly and the resources available to those who fight crime on our behalf must be reviewed constantly.  The Criminal Assets Bureau and the proceeds of crime legislation, both of which concepts originated with the previous Government, are to be welcomed.  We have already witnessed their necessity and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to zero tolerance and I was glad to hear him flesh out what appeared an empty promise in an election context.  He said that the concept of zero tolerance is &ldquo;. directed at positive action against serious criminals .&rdquo; and that his &ldquo;. objective is to provide the Garda with the means, equipment and manpower to investigate all crimes&rdquo;.  I welcome that commitment.  The Minister also told us that he takes seriously the duty of the State to protect the right to live in peace, free from the fear of criminal intrusion.  He said his approach to zero tolerance involves action on the ground and legislation to curb drug dealers and other serious <Col N="725" /> criminals.  He said the citizen demands that and is entitled to it.  He wants zero tolerance to meet that demand in full and he set out the Government programme in that regard.</P>
    <P>However, the definition outlined by the Minister falls far short of what it should be because zero tolerance of crime must include zero tolerance of its causes.  Legislation, more gardaí on the streets and more prison places will never get to the root of crime or eliminate it, they will only contain it.  Strengthening the powers of the Garda against drug pushers is only one step.  Where are the comprehensive treatment centres for drug users which are required?  Where is the multifaceted strategy for dealing with the disadvantage and alienation of the victims of drug pushers?  Drug dealers can do almost what they like in vulnerable communities which feel abandoned. Where in the Minister's policy is the plan to assist those communities?  There is no easy answer to this issue but I want to hear the Minister talk about zero tolerance against poverty and deprivation and the powerlessness which such communities feel, particularly in the face of the power of drug pushers.</P>
    <P>It was said earlier that crime is a cancer.  I agree with that but the zero tolerance policy outlined by the Minister is only sticking plaster when much more radical treatment is required.  It is correct to declare war on crime, but that really means declaring war on poverty, disadvantage and exclusion.  These phrases have become clichés but Members understand what they mean because these problems do not only affect urban communities.</P>
    <P>In some communities an increasing number of children start life with little opportunity for a good education.  Their parents may be already under pressure due to community or personal problems and the community and schools cannot provide the necessary support mechanisms.  Such children do not look forward to secure jobs, careers or futures.  These children are vulnerable to the drug barons.  Dealing with the supply of drugs is only one side of what I concede is a very complex problem.  In this time of economic plenty, we should not forget those communities. When we have money to invest we should put them first because that investment will pay off in the long term.</P>
    <P>The fight against crime cannot be won overnight. It is a long-term struggle against disadvantage and exclusion.  It involves putting money into schools and not only towards extra prison places and more gardaí on the streets.  It is about more remedial teachers in schools and communities feeling better about themselves and feeling part of society.  This gives them the strength to fight criminals and drug barons.  Such communities would be better served if we took time out to consider the long-term, multifaceted strategic approach which is required to support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed to this good debate.  Before responding to the points raised, I wish to make some general comments on the Bill and the measures the Government is taking on the domestic front to deal with serious crime.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the first to be introduced in the Oireachtas concerning a convention drawn up within the structures provided for in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.  I am pleased to be associated with it because it marks the beginning of a strengthened statutory approach to law enforcement co-operation between Ireland and our EU partners.  We know that today's criminal organisations do not confine their activities to any one country.  We are also aware that national measures no longer suffice on their own to stem the tide of illegal drug trafficking and other pernicious forms of organised crime.  A joint strategy at European level, encompassing exchange of tactical and strategic information on organised criminals, is a crucial weapon in the fight against this modern day scourge.</P>
      <P>The convention has as its legal basis Title VI of the Treaty on European Union which establishes the framework for co-operation between EU member states in the fields of justice and home affairs.  Article K.1(9) of Title VI lists as one of the areas of common interest police co-operation for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including, if necessary, certain aspects of customs co-operation in connection with the organisation of a Union wide system for exchanging information within a European police office, Europol.</P>
      <P>Under Article K.3(2), the Council may draw up various instruments, including conventions, which it shall recommend for adoption to the member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  Of the various instruments capable of being drawn up under Article K.3(2), the conventions are by far the most legally binding on member states.  The existence of the Europol convention is an important control in relation to the activities of Europol.  It sets out in detail the functions of Europol, liaison officers and member states.  It also provides a number of important controls on various aspects of Europol such as on its activities generally, its computer system and finance.  The management board which will be composed of one representative of each member state will, <i>inter alia,</i> unanimously agree the Europol implementing regulations, exercise control regarding Europol's computer system and take part in drawing up Europol's annual budget.  The management board will also oversee the performance of the directors' duties and take part in the appointment and any dismissal of the director and deputy directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention contains detailed rules designed to prevent any abuse of Europol's computer system, including rules on security of data and rectification of incorrect data.  In addition to <Col N="727" /> a national supervisory body in each member state which will monitor independently under national law the communication of personal data from Europol, the convention provides for an independent joint supervisory body which shall have the task of ensuring that the data protection rights of individuals are not violated.  With regard to finance, Europol's annual budget must be approved unanimously by the Council and an annual audit will be carried out on expenditure by a joint audit committee comprising three members appointed by the European Union Court of Auditors.</P>
    <P>The EU Court of Justice will have jurisdiction in almost all member states including Ireland on the interpretation of the convention by way of preliminary rulings.  Persons affected by any operational activities of law enforcement officers of member states which may arise from the work of Europol will be able to take a case in the national courts.  As I pointed out, Europol is a non-operational team.  The convention, therefore, provides extensive safeguards in relation to the important task it entrusts to Europol.  Early ratification of the convention by Ireland will send out a clear signal to our EU partners of the importance we attach to co-operation in the fight against drugs and organised crime.  It is only fitting that the convention should be ratified by us without delay because successive European Councils have underlined the need to step up the fight against organised crime.  As a practical step in that regard, I urge ratification, at the earliest possible date, of the convention.  In June this year the European Council in Amsterdam stressed the key role to be played by Europol in the fight against organised crime and reiterated the priority it attached to the ratification by all member states of the convention and its protocols before the end of 1997.  Domestically, the Government is taking the tough measures needed in the fight against organised crime in line with the policies set out in the Action Programme for the Millennium. My Department and I are engaged in ongoing consultations with the Garda Commissioner and other interests to see that the Government's action programme is realised as quickly as possible.  This will involve a combination of action on the ground and legislation.</P>
    <P>The recently published crime figures show an increasingly effective and efficient police force. The figures for last year show a drop of 2 per cent in the number of indictable offences, a continuing fall in the level of armed crime and an increase in the detection rate.  The tough new legislative measures, in particular the Proceeds of Crime Act, which I initiated last year while in Opposition, the consequential establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau and the work of the Garda national drugs unit and Garda bureau of fraud investigation have collectively contributed to the first reduction in the crime level in seven years.  The significant drug seizures last weekend are an example of the valuable work being done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> The fight against crime is a relentless one, and this Government will not let up on it.  We will ensure that resources are applied in the optimum way within the Garda Síochána so as to enable the successful implementation of the strategies set out in the action programme.  We will not hold back in allocating resources where they are necessary. I formally inaugurated the Garda support unit and its establishment marks the achievement of a technical objective for the force in meeting the challenge of organised criminals.  The unit is equipped with the latest flying aids, a twin-engine helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft, at a cost of £5 million to assist in implementing strategies to combat organised criminal gangs, drug trafficking and other serious crimes.  I also recently authorised a new witness security programme which is being put in place immediately.  This will afford the criminal justice system the opportunity of obtaining crucial evidence from first-hand witnesses.</P>
    <P>Regarding prisons, I am providing an additional 1,000 prison spaces in accordance with our programme so that persons convicted in the courts can expect to serve their sentences.  I have obtained Government approval for the construction of a new 400 place prison at Portlaoise.  My Department is now assessing submissions of interest for the design, building and finance package for that new prison.  The involvement of the private sector in the planning, construction and financing of this facility is a welcome innovation which the Government believes will guarantee the taxpayer gets the best possible value for money.  I am confident the new prison will be completed within two years so as to reach the target of 1,000 extra prison places to which we committed ourselves.  Work is proceeding as quickly as possible on other prison building projects such as the construction of 55 places at Limerick Prison's D Block, 137 places in Castlerea Prison, 400 places at the new remand prison at Clover Hill/Wheatfield and 80 places at the new women's prison at Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor suggested we go further with co-operation in the fight against crime and make provision for hot pursuit.  In addition to the Europol convention, work is being done on the Naples 2 convention to enhance co-operation between customs authorities in member states.  Discussion is also taking place on enhanced mutual assistance between police and judicial authorities in member states.  In addition, two extradition conventions have been signed at EU level in order to facilitate and improve the extradition arrangements provided for in the 1957 European Convention on Extradition.  The first of these, the EU Convention on Simplified Extradition Procedure, was formally adopted by all member states on 10 March 1995.  It deals with the procedure to be applied when a person consents to extradition. The second convention, the EU Convention Relating to Extradition, was formally adopted by all member states on 27 September 1996.  This convention improves and simplifies extradition <Col N="729" /> arrangements between member states.  Work on the preparation of legislation necessary to enable Ireland ratify these conventions has begun in the Department, and I will bring these proposals forward as part of my legislative programme as quickly as I can.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor expressed concern about those who have committed fraud and who have escaped the court system both in this country and in the country in which they live.  I will deal first with extradition in respect of EU countries and other countries.  Ireland's extradition arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland are governed by the simplified extradition procedures in Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, while our extradition arrangements with countries other than those are governed by Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965.  In addition, Ireland is party to the 1957 European Convention on Extradition and to a number of other conventions, mainly in the aviation field, which provide for extradition for specific offences comprehended by those conventions.</P>
    <P>Apart from our arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland under Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, an order was made applying Part II of that Act to the following countries, which were parties to the European Extradition Convention: Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. With regard to countries not party to the European convention, orders have also been made applying Part II of the 1965 Act to the USA and Australia following the negotiation of bilateral extradition treaties with those countries.  I recently approved an amended draft of an extradition treaty with Canada which has been submitted to the Canadian authorities.  I have also conveyed my approval of the opening of negotiations with the Republic of South Africa on a draft extradition treaty between our countries.  A new draft order to apply Part II of the 1965 Act to a number of additional European countries which have become party to the 1957 European Convention is being prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The countries concerned are Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that before extradition is sought, a suspect must have been charged with the extraditable offence, convicted of such an offence or there must be sufficient evidence to justify charging the person with an extraditable offence.  The decision to proceed with making an extradition request for the purpose of bringing a person before the courts on criminal charges is one for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent in the exercise of his functions.  I understand that among the issues considered by the DPP in each case is whether sufficient evidence exists to enable criminal proceedings <Col N="730" /> to proceed should that individual's extradition be secured.</P>
    <P>With regard to fraud offences, to which Senator Connor referred, work is underway on legislative proposals to deal with the substantive law of fraud.  This is a fundamental and far-reaching reform of the law on fraud and dishonesty generally which will consolidate and update existing offences, develop new ones and ensure that this vital area of criminal law fully reflects modern conditions, which it is clearly very important that our law on fraud does.  That must be a chief objective of legislation.  The fraud legislation will also enable the EU convention on fraud against Community funds to be ratified.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan asked if Europol will assist the Garda and the customs authorities in protecting our coastline against drug importation.  Europol will result in significantly improved intelligence and information, which is the key to the detection of drug importation.  As we saw from the major seizure of amphetamines, cocaine and Ecstasy tablets last weekend, good intelligence enables law enforcement authorities to target their resources and cut off trafficking routes.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan and other Senators referred to the green man system in Garda stations.  The green man is a communications system that consists of a unit outside Garda stations which are not open 24 hours per day.  If people come to the station when it is closed, they will be able to use the communications system to get in contact with a Garda station which is open.  The green man was never intended to replace gardaí - it is merely a communications system.  I would also disabuse Members of the notion that the green man is a Martian.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris expressed concern about the lack of a role for the European Parliament in relation to the Europol convention.  It is worthwhile referring to the provisions in the convention regarding the European Parliament.  Article 34 of the convention provides that the Council presidency will forward a special report to the European Parliament each year on the work of Europol.  The European Parliament shall be consulted should the convention be amended in any way.  The Council presidency or its representatives shall, with respect to the European Parliament, take into account the obligations of discretion and confidentiality.</P>
    <P>In addition, the provision in Article K.6 of the Treaty on European Union will apply.  Under this article the presidency and the Commission are required to regularly inform the European Parliament of discussions in the areas covered by Title VI of the treaty, that is, co-operation in the fields of justice and home affairs.  The presidency is obliged to consult the European Parliament on the principal aspects of activities in these areas and, indeed, ensure the views of the European Parliament are duly taken into consideration.  The European Parliament may ask questions of the council or make recommendations to it.  Each <Col N="731" /> year the European Parliament holds a debate on progress made in the areas covered by Title VI.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also expressed concern about the right of access to data, the danger of incorrect data being held and the type of information being held, including information on race, sexuality, etc. I will first address the safeguards to ensure the system will not be abused.  Europol provides for many safeguards to ensure its computer system will not be abused.  These relate to the standard of data protection, restrictions on access to data by users of the system, rules regarding the use of data, time limits for storage and deletion of data files, security measures to prevent unauthorised access and an arrangement whereby each national supervisory body has an overseeing role. An independent joint supervisory body will have the task of ensuring that the rights of the individual are not violated.</P>
    <P>As regards the standard of data protection, each member must ensure a standard of data protection which at least corresponds to the principles of the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 on the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) and which takes into account Recommendation No. R (87) 15 of the committee of ministers of the Council of Europe of 17 September 1987 concerning the use of personal data in the police sector.  There can be no communication of personal data to or from a member state which does not have these data protection rules in force.  Europol is also obliged to take account of these principles.</P>
    <P>Access, access to the information system will be restricted to the national units, liaison officers, the director, the deputy directors and other empowered Europol officials.  More restrictive rules apply to the analysis files under Article 10 of the convention where only Europol's analysts will be authorised to enter data into and retrieve data from these files.  Under no circumstance can Europol's systems be linked to computerised systems other than those of the national units.</P>
    <P>On the rules on the use of data, personal data retrieved from the system may be transmitted or utilised only by the competent authorities of member states in order to prevent and combat crimes falling within the competence of Europol and to compact other serious forms of crime. Europol may utilise such data only for the performance of its task as referred to in Article 3 of the convention.</P>
    <P>As regards the time limits for the storage and deletion of data files, data, whether computerised or manual, will only be held by Europol for as long as is necessary for the performance of its tasks.  The need for continued storage will be reviewed no later than three years after the input of data.  A decision can be taken to continue storage otherwise the data in question will be automatically deleted.</P>
    <P>As regards data security in respect of automatic data processing at Europol, each member state <Col N="732" /> must implement the data security measures specified in Article 29 of the convention to ensure the integrity of the system so there is no unauthorised access to it, etc.  These measures specifically provide for control in relation to equipment access, data access, data media, storage, users, communication, data input and transport.  In addition, member states must provide for recovery in case of system failure and ensure that the system functions without fault and operates in such a way as to preclude the corruption of data.</P>
    <P>Each member state shall designate a national supervisory body to monitor independently, in accordance with its respective national law, the permissibility of the input, retrieval and communication of personal data by a member state to Europol and to examine whether this violates the rights of the data subject.  In addition, an independent joint supervisory body shall have the task of reviewing the activities of Europol to ensure that the data protection rights of individuals are not violated.</P>
    <P>As regards the collection of data and the ethnic origin, political and religious views, health and sexuality of individuals, the Europol convention provides for the collection, storage and processing of data necessary for the performance of Europol's tasks only.  Article 10.1(5) of the Europol convention states that personal data relating to racial origin, political opinions, religious and other beliefs as well as personal data concerning health or sexual life as listed in Article 6 of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, 1981, will not be collected, stored or processed unless strictly necessary for the purposes of the file concerned and unless it supplements other personal data already entered on the file &mdash; in other words, personal data as listed in Article 6 of the convention on data protection will not be held on file unless data is already held on a particular individual which relates to a criminal offence for which Europol is competent and unless such additional information is considered strictly necessary to the task of combating, analysing and preventing a criminal offence which falls within Europol's remit.</P>
    <P>On access to information being refused, the position is that, in accordance with Article 19 of the convention, any individual wishing to establish whether Europol has data relating to him or her or to have such data checked can do so by making a request, free of charge, to the national competent authority in any member state.  The request will only be refused where it is considered that such a refusal would be necessary to enable Europol fulfil its duties properly, to protect security and public order in the member states, to prevent crime or to protect the rights and freedoms of third parties &mdash; in other words, considerations of such a serious nature that they cannot be overridden.  This provision is similar to Article 5 of our Data Protection Act, 1988, which provides for restrictions on access to data kept for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating <Col N="733" /> offences in any case in which the access to such data would be likely to prejudice the matter.</P>
    <P>I will now address how a person can get data rectified.  If it emerges that the data held by Europol is incorrect or that the storage of such data is in contravention of the convention, it must be corrected or deleted.  Member states which are recipients of such data will be informed and obliged to correct or delete the information accordingly.  An individual can also ask Europol to correct or delete incorrect data concerning him or her and Europol must delete or amend such data and inform the inquirer accordingly.  Where the inquirer is not satisfied with Europol's reply or where a reply has not been received within three months, he or she may refer the matter to the joint supervisory authority.  If it emerges that data contained in Europol paper files is incorrect, Europol is also obliged to correct it.  As with automated data, an individual has the right to ask Europol to correct or destroy paper files concerning him or her.  In addition, the inquirer can also object to the inclusion of a note.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to Europol not being amenable to the European Court of Justice.  The European Court of Justice has an interpretative role in respect of the Europol convention.  It does not have a role in relation to any EU institutions or staff similar to the role national courts have in respect of national institutions and their staff.  It should be borne in mind that the convention provides that the immunity of Europol and its staff from national jurisdiction shall be lifted in certain circumstances.  It should also be borne in mind that the Europol convention does not give Europol an operational role.  I note that Senator Norris agrees with my view that burglaries, etc., are not trivial.  However, he thinks the offenders should not go to prison but should do something positive, such as community service.</P>
    <P>As a corollary to my prisons building programme, I am considering a number of initiatives for the greater use of alternatives to custody in cases where this is appropriate.  The introduction of legislation providing for the attachment of earnings in the case of non-payment of fines and debts and the expansion of the community service scheme are two such initiatives which warrant active examination.</P>
    <P>I am open to considering all appropriate solutions and I am anxious to harness all views in tackling the crime problem, including those of people working in the field and ordinary law abiding citizens.  That is why I recently announced the setting up of a crime forum which will facilitate an open and public debate involving all sectors of our society on the reality of crime, its causes and remedies.  It will assist the community in contributing to the formation of crime policy and the establishment of a broadly based crime council.  I will shortly announce the composition of the forum, its format and when it will take place.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to the poor condition of Bantry Garda station.  Considerable <Col N="734" /> work is under way on the improvement of Garda stations and I will take note of the Senator's concerns regarding Bantry.  A sum of £3,441,000 is provided in next year's Estimates for the maintenance of Garda stations.  This is in addition to the provision in the Vote of the Office of Public Works for building new stations.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn on the importance of Europol and this Bill.  I also agree with Senator Henry and Senator Haughey that there must be co-ordination between Interpol and Europol. This matter is being addressed by the EU to ensure there is no duplication between both organisations.  Senator Henry also raised important issues regarding the trafficking of children and women.  This type of crime is within Europol's remit and Europol's role will not be limited to the importation of such persons into the EU.  It will also deal with the trafficking of women and children out of the EU.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan expressed concern about the security of the Europol system as regards hacking. However, the Europol convention contains specific provisions to ensure the integrity of the data system and that there is no unauthorised access to it.  These measures include preventing unauthorised persons from reading, copying, modifying or deleting data stored and ensuring persons only have access to data covered by their authorisation.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey asked about funding for Europol.  In accordance with Article 35 of the convention, the sharing of the cost of Europol between member states is determined according to the ratio of a member states' GNP to the total sum of the GNPs of all the member states.  The ratification of the convention will facilitate the provision of a sophisticated new computer system for Europol and the expansion of its remit to include terrorist activities within two years of the entry into force of the convention.  Any other crimes agreed on unanimously by the Justice and Home Affairs Council in accordance with Article 2 of the convention would also impact on the cost of Europol.</P>
    <P>Article 2 provides that where it is proposed to include additional crimes other than terrorist activities in Europol's remit, the management board of Europol must first set out the budgetary and statutory implications.  While increased expenditure will be incurred on Europol following ratification of the convention, Ireland will be liable for only 0.7 per cent of it based on the current proportion of GNP.  Ireland's contributions to date to the EDU are as follows: in 1994, £9,810, in 1995, £17,008, in 1996, £31,379 and in 1997, £36,190.  Since 1996, all member states have contributed to the setting up of Europol's computer system.  Ireland's 1996 and 1997 contributions to this system are £5,629 and £10,870, respectively. In addition, Ireland bears the cost of the Garda liaison officer with Europol and the cost, apart from salary, of another member of the Garda Síochána who is employed by Europol as a systems development officer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> Senator Henry expressed the view that the provisions in the Bill, as described in the explanatory memorandum, relating to the appointment of Customs officers to the national unit and as liaison officer to Europol, were cumbersome.  I agree with the importance of the role which Customs officers will play in relation to Europol.  I introduced amendments to the relevant sections of the Bill to deal with the concerns of the Revenue Commissioners.  I will give attention to the appointment of a Customs and Excise officer to the national unit as soon as this legislation is passed.  I hope this satisfies the concerns of Senator Henry and other Senators.  The appointment will come into effect as soon as the convention comes into operation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara asked that resources be made available for the data protection commissioner's office.  Staffing of that office is subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance, but I assure the Senator that if, following the entering into force of the convention, extra resources are required in the office, I will do what I can to ensure they are made available.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon expressed concern about the provisions in the convention for the Europol computer system.  I have already pointed out the safeguards in the convention as regards data protection. Europol's information system is the backbone of the Europol computer system.  It holds records relating to individuals who have been convicted or suspected of having committed criminal offences within Europol's competence or who give serious grounds, under national law, to believe they will commit such an offence.  Data held includes personal data of a limited nature and additional data which can include details of criminal offences, alleged crimes, suspected membership of criminal organisations and convictions relating to criminal offences in Europol's competence.</P>
    <P>In addition to the information system, Europol allows for the creation of temporary work files which can be set up for variable periods of time for the purpose of analysis only.  Analysis is defined in the convention as the assembly, processing or utilisation of data with the aim of helping a criminal investigation.  These files can contain more comprehensive data.  However, data will not be held on file unless they specifically relate to a criminal offence for which Europol is competent unless such information is considered strictly necessary to the task of combating, analysing or preventing an offence which falls within the remit of Europol.  Member states communicating data to Europol can only do so where the processing of such data is also authorised by national law.  Data will not be held if it is not considered necessary for the performance of the tasks for which Europol has been established and will only be held for as long as is necessary for the performance of such tasks.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan and Senator O'Meara referred to crimes against the elderly and against <Col N="736" /> women in domestic circumstances.  While this is not an omnibus Bill, I join with them in unreservedly condemning such crimes.  I take this opportunity to advise those who might be considering taking advantage of long winter nights to attack vulnerable elderly people in their homes that if they are convicted of such an offence they will serve the full term of imprisonment imposed by the court, excepting remission.  There will be no temporary releases for such people, although there are difficulties in relation to prison accommodation. If people attack vulnerable elderly people in their homes, there will be serious consequences if they are convicted and sentenced in the courts.</P>
    <P>As regards the need for additional gardaí to which Senator McGowan referred, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to provide an additional 1,200 gardaí over a five year period to ensure there will be an adequate Garda presence throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt comprehensively with the points raised by Members.  I thank them sincerely for their courtesy, efficiency and worthwhile contributions on Second Stage.  I look forward to any suggestions on how to improve the legislation on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent an hour at the site of the derailment on Monday.  The Dublin Westport train left Heuston Station last Saturday at approximately 8.30 a.m. It derailed at the level crossing between Curry crossroads and Ballymurray crossroads at approximately 10.30 a.m. It was travelling between 50 and 60 miles per hour and there were 180 passengers in five carriages.  There were two other carriages, a dining car and a generating unit.  The train derailed because of track failure.  There have been a number of rail accidents, but few have been caused by track failure. <Col N="737" /> The exceptions were those which happened at Ballycumber a couple of years ago and at Ballyseedy near Tralee.</P>
      <P>A fish plate, which is a flat flange type piece of metal used to join the sections of the track, fractured which put the track out of alignment.  The wooden sleepers over the next several hundred metres shattered as the 100 tonne train careered forward.  All the passenger carriages careered off the line and crashed into the siding.  Most of them were seriously damaged.  The locomotive, the generating unit and the dining car remained on the track.  Miraculously, no passengers lost their lives, although a few were injured.</P>
      <P>The rails are dated and have the initials of the Great Midland and Western Railway on them. The fish plate that fractured was built in 1926. The sleepers which disintegrated into matchwood were at least 30 years old and some were decayed to the extent of 50 per cent.  The Minister was at the site on Sunday and I am sure she will agree with me.  The rails which disintegrated and twisted into corkscrews of scrap metal were put in place in the late 1920s.  That railway line was built between 1862 and 1866 when it reached Westport and Ballina.  The line was realigned in the 1920s but it has not been replaced since then.</P>
      <P>Every stretch of railway line from Athlone to Westport with its spur from Manulla to Ballina, which is approximately 90 miles, is in the same condition.  It has the potential to disintegrate and to derail a train full of passengers.  Every metre of it needs to be replaced with modern continuous welded track.  Its 19th century signalling system, which is powered by paraffin oil, also needs to be replaced.</P>
      <P>The Minister is sitting on a time bomb.  I ask her to ensure that an independent inquiry is carried out into this incident.  The chief inquirer should not be from the Department of Public Enterprise or from Iarnród Éireann.  I want a report on the extent of decay in those sleepers and on the degree of metal fatigue in the rails and the components such as the fish plates and bolts which hold the system together.  Any safety officer worth his salt could only recommend that the line be closed.  The Minister will have a civil war on her hands if a safety officer concludes that it must be closed due its condition unless something drastic is done urgently.  Every chamber of commerce and other organisation in every town from Athlone to Westport and from Manulla to Ballina will be up in arms, and rightly so, if the railway line has to be closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, that stretch of track was not included in the programme of peripherality for transport and received no investment as a result. CIÉ has huge borrowings currently as a result of its programme to renew lines, by up to 80 per cent in some cases, which is grant aided through Structural Funds.  Its borrowings cannot be further extended without putting the company into further serious financial difficulties.  Therefore, the Government must intervene directly.  I hope provision has been made to fund this in the <Col N="738" /> Estimates which were published today.  I do not want her to give the reply which she gave to the Dáil today which was full of meaningless banalities. I have made specific assertions tonight which I want the Minister to address directly.</P>
    <P>I understand from the best informed experts that it costs £250,000 to renew one mile of track with continuous welded rail.  It costs £2 million to renew or realign one mile of a national road.  It is imperative that the funding be provided.  If £10 million were invested the risks on that railway line would be reduced by 50 per cent.  I hope the Minister will tell us that she will invest at least that amount in the railway between now and this time next year.  My fear is that if a safety officer were to report now on that railway he could only recommend one option.</P>
    <P>We all had a narrow escape in the sense that no one was killed, although some people were injured.  However, if this railway does not immediately receive the remedial attention it needs another accident will occur.  I hope the Minister will have a positive reply.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Connor for sharing his time.  I understand this matter was debated in the other House and I join with all speakers in expressing our sympathies to anyone injured in this unfortunate accident and wish them a speedy recovery.  We were lucky on this occasion.  If the train had travelled a further 300 or 400 yards or if the accident had occurred on Friday it might have been more serious and resulted in loss of life.  We are blessed that was not the case.</P>
      <P>We are here to debate what happened and what can be done to resolve the matter.  We must consider the events leading up to the accident. The railway line from Dublin to Westport has been neglected.  I find it difficult to accept Senator Connor's innuendo that the present Minister might be responsible in some way.</P>

However, others did have the opportunity over <Col N="739" /> the last three years to deal with the decay of 50 per cent of the wooden sleepers and the metal fatigue of the railway line.  I am perturbed that over those three years nobody in Government, or none of those who responded on behalf of the Government in Iarnród Éireann, brought that matter to public attention or provided moneys for reasonable maintenance, such as the replacement of decayed lines or sleepers.  What happened from 1995 to 1997 should be firmly laid at the door of the last Government.

      <P>Earlier today I outlined the situation relating to last Saturday's accident on the railway near Roscommon to my Cabinet colleagues and, subsequently, to the Dáil.  I responded to seven Deputies at great length.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to this House on the subject.</P>
      <P>I received a report on Monday last from my railway inspecting officer who visited the scene of the accident on Saturday.  I met the chairman and senior executives of Iarnród Éireann yesterday.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for me to place the time, etc.  of the accident on the record.  On the basis of that report and those discussions, I understand that at about 10.30 a.m. on Saturday, 8 November 1997, the 8.25 a.m. passenger train from Heuston to Westport was derailed between Knockcroghery and Roscommon town.  The initial point of derailment was approximately 250 metres beyond Curry level crossing with various sections of the train coming to a halt over the next 500 metres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The train in question, thanks be to God, comprised a modern 201 class locomotive, the most modern type locomotive going, and several modern Mark 111 carriages which were instrumental in the eventual safety of those involved.  The locomotive remained on the track but all the carriages were <Col N="741" /> derailed and the train divided with the result that the front of the train travelled 400 metres beyond the point where the four rear carriages came to rest.  There was extensive damage to the track and the rolling stock but damage to the carriage interiors was minimal.</P>
    <P>At the time of the derailment there were 180 passengers on the train, exactly half of the capacity of 360.  Following the accident 15 passengers were taken to Roscommon; 11 were treated in the casualty department and discharged; four were detained mainly for observation and two of the patients have been discharged this evening.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the emergency services responded promptly.  Iarnród Éireann has established an internal joint inquiry board to investigate the circumstances of the accident.  It began its work yesterday.  The report will then be reviewed by my Department's railway inspecting officer.  Until the report is available it will not be possible to give a definitive explanation for the accident.  However, I understand that the evidence so far points to a broken rail joint as the the cause of the derailment.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, because the rails on the section of track in question are approximately 70 years old, concerns have been expressed that, in the absence of an accelerated track renewal programme, there are fears about safety.  I would like to reassure the House on this point.  Where older equipment is in use on a railway system trains are operating safely as a matter of course thanks to Iarnród Éireann's ongoing programme of renewal and maintenance backed up by a system of regular inspections.  For example, while the railway lines from Athlone to Westport and Ballina are not eligible for benefit under the EU funded mainline rail investment programme,</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not submit them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the EU did not agree with proposals then put forward.  I am advised that Iarnród Éireann has spent close to £5 million on renewal work on this line in the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The company also has plans to replace further sections of jointed track on the line with modern continuous welded rail.  In addition annual maintenance work on the line is carried out at a cost of about £1.4 million as part of an overall maintenance programme costing over £25 million per year.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for rail safety is a matter for Iarnród Éireann under legislation and I have been assured that it is the company's main priority.  Implementation of any necessary safety-related measures, whether at the location of Saturday's derailment or elsewhere on the rail network, is a matter for the company to undertake from its overall resources at its disposal.</P>

      <P>During my discussions with Iarnród Éireann yesterday I emphasised the paramount importance of safety in all aspects of the company's operations and I said that luxury coaches and speed were not of prime importance. What was of prime importance was safety.  The safe operation of trains involves a complex interraction between a range of factors including track, rolling stock, signalling, level crossings, operating speed and, above all, safety policy and practice.</P>
      <P>A number of studies and reviews are already under way which will provide an input into Iarnród Éireann's efforts to improve rail safety. Before last Saturday's accident my Department had already commenced a review of Iarnród Éireann's safety policy and practice and, at my request, CIÉ is already preparing investment plans for both the mainline and suburban networks which will take account of railway renewal and signalling requirements.  At the request of my Department CIÉ, with the assistance of independent consultants, is also undertaking a review of rolling stock policy.  The lessons which will emerge from Iarnród Éireann's investigation into last Saturday's derailment will make an additional contribution to the company's safety review process.</P>
      <P>Can I say that we are very lucky, thanks be to God.  We do not say &ldquo;thanks be to God&rdquo; often enough.  It seems we are afraid to say the word &ldquo;God&rdquo;.  The potential for danger in this situation was very great indeed.  Thanks be to God it did not happen.  Three matters contributed to the relatively happy outcome of the matter.  One was the fact that the train was only half full; the second was the high embankment where the incident happened.  A huge high embankment, just for a limited period, provided a buttress for the train when it went off the line, and third the carriages were of the most modern.  A very serious investigation is being carried out by Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>I asked for comparative studies in European rail network safety terms.  The last deaths occurred in 1983 in Irish Rail when five people were, sadly, killed in County Kildare and there have been, sadly.  some level crossing deaths too. In European terms the safety of Irish Rail and those who travel on it is about second or third from the top.  I say this as a matter of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pay tribute, as did Senator Finneran, to the people who drove that train.  I have spoken to the driver on the telephone.  He kept a very cool head in very difficult circumstances.  I have spoken to those who worked on the train.  They, too, maintained a very calm exterior and so did the passengers in a hugely challenging situation. The emergency services operated very promptly and, thankfully, all the passengers have left the hospital.  I want to convey my thanks to Sister Devaney and her colleagues for the very calm and courteous way they dealt with queries and with the people themselves.  I spent a considerable time there on Sunday.  I have impressed on <Col N="743" /> Iarnród Éireann the need for their constant surveillance of safety.</P>
    <P>When we think of the numbers who die on the roads each year &mdash; 400 already this year &mdash; we realise that those who travel by train have a relatively good experience.  That is not to say that we can ever be sanguine or tranquil because one must always be on the alert.</P>
    <P>The spending plans of CIE and how they regularise their budgets are, under legislation, their business.  They get a block subvention from the Government of the day and they decide where the emphasis will be placed.  There is a subsidy sub-head and how they operate it is their own business.  I have spoken to CIE and it is committed to doing all in its power to upgrade.  To do what is required to make every single line a continuous welding line with proper signalling and carriages throughout the country would cost £275 million immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>About half what you are spending on the roads this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>And that would only be one factor.  There would also be proper carriages, proper signalling, proper infrastructure and all the needs of a modern railway system.</P>
      <P>I commend all who worked so hard at the scene of that accident last Saturday and I have emphasised to Iarnród Éireann and to all sectors of CIÉ that their emphasis on safety must be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to provide some historical background to this matter.  The Irish Butchers' Association represents approximately 400 abattoir owners.  They slaughter fewer than 1,000 cattle units per annum in premises which have been adapted and licensed for this use under the Abattoirs Act, 1989, and extended by the EU Fresh Meat Directive 64/433.  The regulations were amended again by EU Council Directive 91/497.  These regulations are relevant to the debate on the current situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By their nature these abattoirs are small units providing for a small throughput.  The majority are simply used to supply butchers' shops in their immediate locality.  They are located throughout the country, largely in rural areas, providing a necessary outlet for farmers from whom abattoir owners buy produce for slaughter and sale to <Col N="744" /> local markets.  For the majority of abattoir owners this has been the procedure for generations.</P>
    <P>From 1989 abattoir owners were required to bring their premises up to standards required by the regulations to which I have already referred. These regulations required a radical overhaul of abattoirs.  The 1989 regulations required abattoir owners, without grant aid or tax incentives, to adapt their premises to comply with extensive EU regulations.</P>
    <P>The 1989 regulations applied the same standards to large meat factories and small abattoirs without any derogation or exemption.  This gave rise to the complications we have now.  The only allowance given to abattoirs was that each owner would be allowed a maximum of five years to bring their premises up to the required licensing standard.  In the meantime owners were permitted to provide a service if they were attending to upgrading works.</P>
    <P>The message to abattoir owners was clear &mdash; if they did not bring their premises up to standard they would be closed down.  Because many abattoir owners were unable to bring their premises up to that standard due to financial constraints, they were closed by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Members of the Irish Butchers' Association represent all abattoir owners who brought their premises up to the hygiene standards required under the 1989 regulations and who received licences from the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>Structural standards must be observed by all abattoir owners involved in the production of fresh meat, including small abattoirs.  The legislation provided for derogations for small abattoirs and there were extensive discussions with the Department at that time.  Exemptions from some of the requirements of the 1991 EU directive were granted to small abattoir owners whose throughput capacity did not exceed 1,000 cattle units per annum.  The Department wrote to each abattoir owner explaining the position and invited them to advise the Department of their throughput.  More importantly, the Department advised them of the special and generous conditions for approval which were already applicable under the Abattoirs Act.  This is the kernel of what is involved.</P>
    <P>The Department pointed out in no uncertain terms that provided each abattoir owner complied with the 1989 regulations they had nothing to fear concerning further works or requirements because the 1989 regulations equated to the 1991 EU Council Directive.  Relying on this advice and the assurance given by the Department and its officials, IBA members continued their work and spent a total of £17 million bringing their premises up to the required standards without grant aid or other financial assistance.</P>
    <P>Having completed the works required under the 1989 regulations and having received assurances from the Department, IBA members were licensed and, as such, they were happy that their future livelihoods would be secure.  Having spent <Col N="745" /> substantial sums of money on their abattoirs, the meat market received a serious blow in 1995, 1996 and 1997 as a result of the BSE crisis.  This put enormous financial pressure on all sectors of the beef industry and more significantly on the small operators who had spent substantial sums on their premises.</P>
    <P>Large abattoir owners with a throughput in excess of 1,000 cattle units per annum, were able to obtain substantial grant aid for upgrading their premises to EU levels.  Many of the small abattoirs supplying small butchers' shops, however, face financial ruin as a result of BSE.  No assistance has been given to them despite the fact that practically every week support measures are provided for other sectors in the beef industry.  In a recent decision, to quote one instance, the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers shared out 500 million ECUs among 15 member states in exceptional aid for the immediate restoration of the beef sector following the BSE crisis.  Not one penny, however, was given to the small abattoirs for local market supplies.  No financial assistance and no programme of revitalisation was provided for local beef or lamb markets supplied by the Irish Butchers' Association.  Nothing has been put in place despite the fact that EU regulations govern a programme for the promotion and marketing of beef and lamb with financial assistance from the EU.</P>
    <P>This small boutique-type industry, which has been in existence for over 150 years and currently employs 5,000 people, is on its knees because it cannot meet the regulatory requirements due to financial problems.  The Irish Butchers' Association recently received a letter from the Department of Agriculture and Food stating that it is not in a position to provide financial assistance. This is unfortunate.  We must address this problem which has been there for some years.  The responsibility does not lie with the Minister, although he will have to take up the cudgels on behalf of small abattoir owners who have incurred costs of approximately £17.5 million in upgrading their premises.</P>
    <P>They are now being obliged to overhaul their premises to suit new requirements by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  This will cost a further £20 million because the works already completed will have to be scrapped and restarted to accommodate new requirements.  Many premises cannot be adapted structurally to the new regime.  Abattoir owners would not have undertaken the works in the first instance, under the 1989 regulations based on the advice of the Department, if they had been made aware that further requirements would be needed later.  No advice or representation was made by the Department at that time concerning the possibility of further works.</P>
    <P>The Irish Butchers' Association has already voiced its objection to the Department and since late 1996 it has been advised that no grants, tax incentives or other financial assistance will be given.  The IBA has been told that unless its <Col N="746" /> members' premises are brought up to the required standards they will be closed down.  This motion calls on the Government to address this matter.</P>
    <P>Consumers throughout the EU are entitled to have a high level of hygiene in all abattoirs, irrespective of their throughput.  This requirement is to be applauded.  Ireland has a long tradition of local abattoirs supplying fresh meat to rural and urban communities.  In the main, these premises were in private ownership although some of the large urban communities deferred by having a central public abattoir.  In all cases the central abattoirs have been closed by local government and have either been demolished or sold to private butchers.  The primary reason was the cost of running them.</P>
    <P>Virtually every town in Ireland has immediate access to its own privately owned abattoir, something which should be safeguarded.  It is essential that the following measures be taken by the Department to provide assistance to small abattoir owners to prevent them going out of business. Funding must be provided for any further works which have to be completed, whether to comply with EU Directives 91/497 and 95/23 or any further directives the EU may introduce.  In the case of small abattoirs, the EU has the option to reconsider derogation granted in 1991 and this year.  The funding required would be through special measures by way of grant assistance to support this sector of the beef industry together with tax incentive measures to provide appropriate financial assistance to abattoir owners to help prevent financial ruin.</P>
    <P>Rural communities are dependent on individual livestock producers who tend to produce their needs directly from their local areas.  The presence of a private based abattoir plant provides the livestock producer with a ready outlet for his produce &mdash; the live animal.  Concentrating animal slaughter in a limited number of large abattoirs will result in the creation of a virtual monopoly which will be detrimental to the interests of the consumer and the livestock producer.  It could be construed as contradicting the spirit, if not the letter, of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, to prevent such a monopoly and to provide open and free competition it is essential that smaller abattoirs are not closed down under EU Directive 64/443, as amended and extended, but are allowed to continue to service the needs of the local community.  If this does not happen, the consequences for the farmer will be that the only outlet for his produce will be the larger export factories.  This will lead to a monopoly leaving farmers, especially small farmers, at the whim of the large factory owners with regard to price and slaughtering.</P>
    <P>This is the biggest danger if EU Directive 64/443, as amended and extended, is to be implemented without financial assistance being given to the domestic abattoir from the EU and the Government.  Some 80 per cent of the fresh meat consumed on the Irish home market comes <Col N="747" /> from small and medium sized domestic private abattoirs.  If this directive were to be complied with and no financial assistance given then a large number of private enterprises would cease, thereby abandoning the meat trade to a small number of large abattoirs within Ireland.  This will not only fix the price for export but it will also fix the price paid to the producer for every bovine, sheep and pig in Ireland.  In addition, it is natural to assume that large abattoirs could fix this cost on all meats going to the retail outlets resulting in the control of the retail price of meats sold in Ireland.  That would be serious.</P>
    <P>A precedent has already been set by the EU by giving financial assistance to large abattoirs. The Department is aware that EU Structural Funds were obtained for large abattoirs in the last five years.  Action is required in the interest of small abattoirs.  I hope the Government will address the matter.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Finneran on raising this matter.  I raised it on the Adjournment some weeks ago.  When I was last elected to the Seanad in 1987 I was appointed by my then party leader in the House to be spokesperon on Agriculture.  The first legislation I had to deal with was the Abattoirs Act.</P>
      <P>The high street butcher services us all.  He must ensure that the standard of his premises is the same as abattoirs which slaughter for the export trade and are heavily subsidised by grant aid from the EU.  In view of this, Senator Finneran calls on the Government to assist the butcher.</P>
      <P>However, I refer the Senator to page 103 of the Fianna Fáil general election manifesto, which is presumably Government policy.  The third paragraph states: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil in Government will provide an incentive package to assist the necessary upgrading of abattoirs as a component of the overall emphasis on food quality and food safety.&rdquo;  Will the Minister elaborate on this in her reply and indicate the kind of funding which family butchers will receive?</P>

      <P>I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, who extends his apologies to the House.  He had an outstanding commitment.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment I met a group representing small abattoirs and the butchers' association on two occasions in 1992.  They were upset about the requirements laid down in 1989 and in the EU directive of 1991.  The introduction of new demands is untimely and presents them with difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food met the <Col N="748" /> committee of the small abattoir group today to discuss the report of an expert group on the structures and operations of small abattoirs.  There was a comprehensive discussion of the various issues as well as some recent developments affecting the beef sector as a whole.  Among the issues raised were works carried out to their abattoirs to date and further works which may be required.  The Abattoirs Act, 1988, was enacted to address public health concerns regarding the production of meat in local abattoirs, the aim being to ensure that meat produced in these premises met the same high standards for public health as that produced in the large plants which were subject to EU rules.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the Single Market, EU rules for meat production were extended to all meat producing premises, including small abattoirs. Following the visit of a EU inspection team in 1994, it became clear that regulations adopted in 1989 did not comply with EU requirements and it became necessary to amend the 1989 regulations pursuant to our obligations under the treaty. These amendments were circulated recently to all involved, including small abattoirs.  The Minister will continue the consultative process on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also recognises the economic difficulties for small abattoirs of complying with the requirements of the Abattoirs Act.  Nevertheless, there is the need for adherence to the highest standards in food, which is recognised by all.  If the consumers will not purchase there will be no sales.  Small abattoirs run by local butchers know their customers and know how to service and deal with them.  They are an essential part of the local trading requirement of an area.</P>
    <P>The move in all sectors of industry is towards rationalisation of facilities to improve competitiveness. Forbairt is in the process of undertaking a study on this.  Small abattoirs now face enormous competition from supermarkets while the changing pattern of food consumption and BSE have also brought their own difficulties.  They must develop a strategy for their continued survival which takes into account economic realities as well as changing consumer patterns and demands.  On the positive side, with the ever increasing emphasis on traceability and product labelling, small abattoirs are well placed to comply with those demands.</P>
    <P>As the submissions cover a wide range of issues, the Minister has arranged for his officials to meet representatives of the committee in the coming days to deal with these matters.  I suggest that the points raised during this debate form part of those consultations and I will ask my colleague to take account of the views expressed by Senators Finneran and Connor.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 November 1997.</P>
