      <P>I have notice from Senator Sherlock that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give urgent consideration to have the plans for a new vocational education committee school at Summerhill, Mallow, expedited.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to immediately rescind his decision to suppress prompt publication of new outbreaks of BSE, in view of the damage this decision is causing to the international credibility of the Irish beef industry.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Honan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to immediately address the unconfirmed reports that the Laois-Offaly area could lose the Europeat plant whose development has the potential to bring 500 permanent jobs to the area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to have the Suck Valley catchment area included in the new EU category of extremely disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for a new fire station in Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Sherlock's and Quinn's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion <Col N="1646" /> of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3 and there will be an additional item on a supplementary Order Paper which will be circulated later.  Item 1, statements on Northern Ireland, will be taken from now until 1 p.m. with 15 minutes per speaker and the Tánaiste will speak during the course of the debate, not at the beginning. There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. until 4 p.m. and item 3 from 4 p.m. until 4.30 p.m.  There is an error in the Order Paper.  The name of Senator Sherlock should also be attached to that motion and I will arrange for that to be done.  The arrangements for this item will follow the same pattern as last week.  There will be short statements of not more than four minutes per person.  That item will conclude at 4.30 p.m. and then there will be a motion to establish a tribunal of inquiry into the Dunnes Stores payments.  The terms of reference of that tribunal will be circulated later in the day.  I suggest that the debate should last one hour, as will be the case in the other House, from 4.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. with not more than ten minutes per speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for item 3 which is very relevant.  Progress has been made in the last 24 hours.  The fact that we are in a position to debate this issue, which is of real importance, bears out what was said yesterday during the debate on the reform of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>How does the Leader intend to circulate the wording of and other matters relating to the item which will be on the supplementary Order Paper?</P>
      <P>It will have been noticed and we, on this side of the House, are pleased that the European Commission has taken on board an issue raised by the Fianna Fáil Party last year in Private Members' Time which is the televising of national sporting events.  The Commission is at last coming to grips with the idea of one individual taking over the worldwide rights to the televising of sporting events and we welcome that.  It is interesting to note that the statistics given were ones we mentioned last year.  How could RTÉ or any other national station compete with the Murdoch group when it reports £130 million six month profits and offers substantial amounts of money for the television rights to sporting events?  We would welcome the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Government responding in a positive way to the Commission's lead and seeking support for its efforts to ensure that the televising of national sporting events are not handed over to a single individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the appalling vista of a nurses' strike next week comes ever nearer, are the Leader and the Government happy that agreements on emergency services which have been agreed at national level are now in place and ready for <Col N="1647" /> operation at local level should this unfortunate strike happen next week?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Order of Business. Like Senator Wright, I am glad the Leader has tabled the motion on Sellafield.  It is essential that the objections and concerns of this House are made known publicly and especially to those within the United Kingdom involved in this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with the Order of Business and welcome item 3 on the Order Paper.  Will the Leader confirm in relation to items 3 and 4 that we will have an opportunity of speaking?  Time is short and numbers may not allow us to speak within such a short time.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright spoke about the impending nurses' dispute.  As this is the last sitting day before the strike takes place, I ask the Leader to exhort the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, to pull out all the stops in an effort to avert this strike which will have a catastrophic effect on the health services.</P>
      <P>I gave notice to raise a matter on the Adjournment but I have not been fortunate in getting it raised either yesterday or today.  The situation has changed since and I ask the Leader to exhort the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, to state whether or not the midlands peat station will go ahead and to ensure all efforts are being made in his Department to that end.  There seems to have been a tardiness in the Department which has led to today's situation.  Doubt has been cast over it becoming a reality and that would be most unfortunate for the entire midlands region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome a report published by the Department of Finance on the review of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I ask the Leader, therefore, for a short debate to allow us to bring into the public arena what actually goes on in the DPP's Office.  I welcome the fact that the office is willing to publish a report for the first time in 1997, because one of the points made in the Department of Finance report is that the public has a poor knowledge and understanding of the workings of the Office.  In two cases which came to my attention as a public representative members of the public had been at a loss to know the reason for a particular decision and have felt undue influence had been put on the Office to avert the course of justice.  Therefore, it is important that this issue is raised in the public arena.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I ask the Leader when we can have a substantive debate on the prison service and its associated problems?  Many people have been disturbed over the past number of months and years because of what has been happening in the prison service.  This has been brought home to a bigger audience over the past <Col N="1648" /> couple of weeks because of the two television programmes from &ldquo;The Joy&rdquo; which were more than disturbing.  I am not sure whether this should be raised on the Adjournment but it would be better if there was a substantive debate on our approach to prison reform and the attitude of society towards people.</P>
      <P>The matter was brought home to people not only during the week after &ldquo;The Joy&rdquo; was broadcast but when a person who was fined £39,000 for an offence involving angledust opted for prison rather than pay the fine.  What will happen is that he will go to prison for a week or two and he will not have to pay the fine.  This was a case where the judge felt he was worse than a drug dealer.  It is a disgrace that there are such situations.  There is a dichotomy between my first point and this one about the farmer.  In the latter case, it is the same as if I was in business, somebody did not pay his debt to me, he opted for prison and, by doing so, eliminated the debt.</P>

      <P>I ask the Senator to put a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have a substantive debate on the prison service and related matters?</P>
      <P>Second, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment to ban bull-bars from all four wheel drive vehicles.  A substantial number of people are buying four wheel drive vehicles at present and they all have bull-bars in front.  Some of them have been involved in accidents but these bull-bars were only designed for off-road use.  If one is driving at night, these bull-bars obscure the vehicles front lights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>These vehicles are higher on the road than normal cars.  If one is driving on the Naas Road at night, they come up behind at 70 miles per hour and the driver knows that one must pull over because they have bull-bars.  Their drivers are aggressive in their attitude.  Will the Leader ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment to ban bull-bars on any vehicle unless it is being used on the farm, which was the purpose for which they were designed originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on health insurance because yesterday's newspapers stated that VHI subscribers could face paying for operations in hospitals.  Such headlines are becoming too frequent.  They appear every two or three months.  We should have a debate on the matter because when the VHI was set up the annual premium was fixed and one heard no more about it until the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>B'fhéidir go mba chóir go mbeadh an freagra ar an cheist seo ar eolas agam cheana Féin.  Does the Leader know if a deadline has been set by the Minister for Education for the report of the committee she has established <Col N="1649" /> to inquire into the status of institutions in the regional technical college sector, which, as he knows, is a matter of great concern to all of us involved in higher education.  I am not going to make a speech on the matter but the degree of dismay, confusion and uncertainty which has been caused by the way things have been handled recently is most unfortunate.  The sooner there can be clear headlines for decisions, the better for everybody concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Lee in his request for a report on the regional technical colleges. There is great dismay and anger in the community at present.  Some people feel Waterford regional technical college was chosen without proper investigation.  That report is needed as it will bring balance to the debate and help progress the situation of regional technical colleges in third level education.</P>
      <P>I also join in the call for the intervention of the Minister for Health in the impending nurses' strike.  I appreciate and agree with Senator Wright that emergency services must be provided and the Minister must satisfy himself that that will be the case.  I also ask that the Minister would use his good offices over the weekend even at the eleventh hour to have this strike averted.  I know from my clinics that there is great worry in the community about this and the Minister owes it to the public, particularly at a time when the fallout from the Christmas flu is still apparent, to intervene to try to resolve this matter.  I ask the Leader to take to the Minister for Health the call from this House that he intervene personally in this dispute to avert this strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to fulfil a promise I made to several nurses, not just in my area but throughout the country, who called or wrote to me in the past week.  This has been quite unprecedented in my experience.  I join with my colleague, Senator Finneran, who has put it so well but I extend that request to the Leader because, as far as I can ascertain, nurses are not just angry and confused, but feel isolated and marginalised from this political system of which we are so proud and privileged to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Senator to put a question?  We are not debating this matter on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put the reason for this anger in context and convey the strength of feeling among ordinary nurses who feel victims of the system when in the past couple of weeks they have seen a public service increase of staggering proportions under the Partnership 2000.  As somebody said to me yesterday, this increase has come to people who are doing nothing other than just turning up for work for the next three years. There is no return and yet the nurses are being put in a position of having to give up many of <Col N="1650" /> the things which are attributed to their particular work.  All I wish to do is join with others in this House.  We would be failing in our duty as politicians if we did not convey the strong sense of outrage, confusion, and particularly isolation from the political system, which nurses feel at this time.  I join Senator Finneran in strongly urging the Leader to convey the strength of feeling to the Minister for Health.  The buck stops with the Minister for Health.  Ultimately, he must make decisions and I pray those decisions will be made within the next couple of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague's call for an urgent debate on the prison system.  I believe I speak for everyone when I say that many people feel the prison system is falling into disrepute.  It is a sad day when approximately 20 prisoners are being released from Mountjoy Prison each day. Obviously, this crisis &mdash; there is no political point to be made here &mdash; did not arise overnight.  The Garda, those involved in prosecutions and judges feel frustrated when they see those who have gone through the system and who have been convicted back on the streets in a matter of days or weeks.  The Minister for Justice said legislation on the organisation of the prison service was forthcoming. At what stage is that legislation?  I support Senator Lanigan's call for a debate on the reform of the prison system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the talks taking place to resolve the nurses' dispute success.  However, I am gravely worried that those involved in the talks will not be capable of averting a strike mainly because those indirectly involved in this issue are not in discussion.  I am concerned that health board managers must report back to the Department of Health.  That is not the way this strike can be resolved.  It is important that the Minister for Health become directly involved.  I support Senator Wright and others who requested that an initiative be taken by the Minister to try to resolve this dispute and avoid the virtual closure of hospitals next Monday. Recently, the Taoiseach indicated in a constructive speech that this dispute should and must be resolved.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to contact the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and, indeed, the Minister for Finance, who has the biggest responsibility in resolving this issue, to ask them to become directly involved.  Welcome and all as the discussions are, they are not in a position to bring about a resolution of this matter because it is a third party type of arrangement where reports must be made to the Department each afternoon after the discussions.  It is important that the Leader discuss this with the Minister for Health and, if necessary, with the Taoiseach, to see what action the Government is taking to resolve this matter before it gets out of hand next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Wright, the text of the motion will be circulated <Col N="1651" /> by way of Supplementary Order Paper to all Members this morning.  I agree with the Senator on the undesirability of any group having a monopoly on major sporting events.  We had a useful debate on this last year when Senator Mooney and others raised that issue.  I would be happy to have such a debate again in the near future.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan asked if she could contribute to this afternoon's debates.  That is not a matter for me but for the Cathaoirleach.  However, I am sure it would be the wish of the House that Senator Honan be heard on both these issues and be accommodated.  Senator Wright, Senator Honan and others raised the nurses' strike.  I will convey the record of what was said on today's Order of Business to the Minister for Health.  Every effort is and will continue to be made to avert a strike which nobody wants and is in nobody's interest. At this stage all we can do is give those who are trying to avert that strike our full support.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan raised the issue of the peat station.  I, and I know she did yesterday, conveyed her concerns to the Minister.  He will be in a position to come to the House to discuss the matter in the near future.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelly raised an interesting point on the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Her point was valid in that there is a lack of public knowledge on what such offices do.  There may be a great deal of ignorance and misunderstanding as a result.  I am not sure if a debate would help that matter.  It may be that such offices must become more proactive in explaining to the public what they do.  However, it is a valid point which I will bear in mind.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan and Senator Mulcahy raised the question of the prison service.  The Department of Justice will produce two major Bills in the coming weeks and these issues can be raised in that context.  However, if the Senators feel there is a need for a specific debate on the prison service, I will arrange one later in the session. Senator Lanigan raised the question of bull-bars and I will convey his concern to the Minister for the Environment.  Senator Calnan again called for a debate on health insurance.  It is important that we have such a debate and I will see if one can be arranged.  Senator Lee and Senator Finneran raised the question of a deadline on the committee inquiring into the future status of regional technical colleges.  I have no information on that but I will get some.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Northern Ireland: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have an opportunity to discuss the current situation in Northern Ireland.  Over the past number of months we have seen the steady decline in the level of hope and progress towards a settlement in Northern Ireland.  The talks in Stormont seem to be dragging on without going anywhere.  There is no <Col N="1652" /> great evidence of a sense of generosity or imagination on the part of those present or a sense of the urgency of problems that must be addressed. We can take little hope from that or from the public exchanges between the various groups in Northern Ireland.  We are looking at a situation which is grim and which shows no sign or potential to change dramatically in the near future.  The only comforting thing at present is that people are not being killed, although it is not for the want of trying.  For whatever reason, the carnage we had become so accustomed to in the past has not been a feature of recent times.  Let us hope that remains the case.</P>
      <P>There are two fundamental problems in the way of progress at present.  The first is the current attitude of the British Government.  It would appear to an informed and fair-minded observer that as far as Northern Ireland is concerned the British Government closed that file last December.  In the run up to the general election, the British Government has decided it does not want to alienate the Unionists on whom it depends for its continued survival in the House of Commons.  It may need the support of the Unionists if there is a tight margin after the forthcoming general election.  Politically, that may be understandable.  However, it has meant that important decisions which should be taken at present are being shelved for fear of alienating the Unionists.  I am not saying the Unionists have abused the position of power in which they find themselves; they have, in many ways, used it sparingly and have made few demands.  The position has led to a paralysis of will on behalf of the British Government, which is one of the great problems facing us.</P>
      <P>We can see this in a variety of ways, particularly in the British Government's reaction to the North commission report on the future routing of parades.  This was a sensible and courageous report that was published in good time to avert difficulties, problems and explosive points which we all know lie ahead in the coming year.  The marching season has not yet started; it begins at Easter and continues through the summer.  Now is the time to put these proposals into effect to see if a rational solution can be found to this problem which caused so much grief, distrust and bitterness last year and which is tailor made to be exploited by those who have no interest in any solution.  Sadly, the British Government has failed to act on this report.  It has its own reasons for deferring it, although they do not help the situation and they do not indicate a sense of goodwill on behalf of the British Government.  The first major problem facing us is the current attitude of the British Government and the fact that it appears to have closed the file on Northern Ireland since last December which will not be reopened until after the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second major problem facing any progress in Northern Ireland is that it is difficult to believe in the goodwill or the truth of what we are being <Col N="1653" /> told by Sinn Féin and the IRA.  There is an IRA ceasefire but a number of attempts have been made to break it.  There have been various shootings and attempts to fire mortar bombs which, thankfully, have not resulted in loss of life. However, that was not the IRA's intention.  It will only be a matter of time in the current circumstances before there is a serious loss of life and the infliction of great damage.  There is convincing evidence that the IRA is as active now as it ever was in gathering intelligence, putting together arsenals and preparing for a major onslaught.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe that people with bomb factories, who are gathering arms and are engaged in covert intelligence operations, have peace on their mind or see peace as an essential part of any strategy.  We may have the continuance of the odious strategy of the armalite and the ballot box.  However, that is not a strategy on which any democratic party can do business with these people.  Peaceful, non-violent methods are not an optional extra; they are at the core of any attempt to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland.  It is impossible for democratic politicians to trust or to work in good faith with people whose bona fides on the question of violence is clouded not just in confusion but in bad faith. Until the IRA and Sinn Féin become unambiguous in their attitude to the use of violence, it will be difficult to make any real progress.  The omens are not good at present.</P>
    <P>Things are bleak in the North at present with the imminence of the marching season and we must anticipate a difficult period ahead.  It is particularly disappointing that the British Government has failed to address the issues raised in the North commission report to deal with events as predictable as any event in the calendar. It is difficult to engage the British in serious dialogue on those matters.  Sadly, as has been the case year after year and decade after decade, domestic political considerations have taken priority over the need for movement in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be entirely negative.  The past number of years have seen a huge growth in the number of practical things being done to encourage co-operation, friendship and economic functional co-operation between both parts of the island.  However, other things can and should be done.  It is imperative, for example, to press ahead with the reform of the RUC so that it is transformed into a police force which can command the allegiance and support of a majority of the Nationalist community as well as the Unionist community.  RUC reform would represent goodwill in tackling one of the key irritants in the Northern problem.  The same could be said for the parades.</P>
    <P>Last week we had an interesting debate on Bloody Sunday, which is hugely symbolic.  Many respected Unionists, including the editor of the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> and politicians like Mr. Ken Magennis, admit that a terrible injustice was done <Col N="1654" /> to the people of Derry on that day 25 years ago. What is to stop the British Government from reopening the files and having an inquiry to state publicly what we know happened on that day? An apology from the British Government to the people of Derry would at least be seen as a gesture of goodwill and it would cost little to do so. If it does not do that, we should not hesitate to make all the evidence in the archives of the Department of Foreign Affairs public so that at least we go some way towards trying to establish the full truth of what happened on that day.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the British Government has done enough to give parity of esteem to the use of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.  The Irish language has, perhaps, a greater significance to many people in Northern Ireland than it has in this part of the country because it is a symbol of nationality and hope.  More should be done to encourage and facilitate the use of Irish.  Streets should be named in Irish as well as in English, if people so wish, and Irish should be used in official business.  Likewise, appointments to public bodies should be used in an inclusive way.</P>
    <P>We must make every effort to ensure the continuation of economic and cultural co-operation and of the process of twinning towns.  We should also imbue in the people of Northern Ireland the strong sense that we want a peaceful, non-violent resolution to the problem.  We are not imperialist; we do not have any designs on taking over Northern Ireland.  We must build up a basis of trust on which small progress can be made.  We will not see agreements between the Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland to resolve the problem in the foreseeable future.  That is not possible in the current climate, although it may happen in six months or in one year.  In the absence of such a possibility, it is vital to continue with reform in Northern Ireland and with cross-Border co-operation between both parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stagg, to the House.</P>
      <P>I represent a party which has made progress in negotiations with the British Government.  Unfortunately, we are at a standstill at present because the Government and those who represent the Government have failed.  I do not intend to use my time to make a political speech because I must co-operate with those who differ from me in religion and politics.  That guides me to speak only what I believe to be the truth without insulting anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the past two years have been an absolute disaster.  If I did not believe that before entering the House today, the Leader of the House, Senator Manning, confirmed it for me in simple language when he stated that the British Government closed the file on Northern Ireland last September.  I believe he is being generous. The Leader must be aware, as are the majority of Irish people, that the British Government closed <Col N="1655" /> that file when the present Irish Government came to power and it stopped dealing with an Administration that was very positive about putting the case and representing those in Northern Ireland who are hard pressed.  That is obvious to everyone.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House but the Tánaiste is not present.  Deputy Spring will make his contribution later before immediately departing again.  The Tánaiste's speech is already written and, in my opinion, his contribution will not be valued by the House.  It is not the type of contribution that should be made in a crisis situation.</P>
    <P>This House is entitled to be worried, as is the Bishop of Derry, about the British Government's lack of awareness of the concerns of the people of Ireland, North and South, in respect of the innocent people who were murdered 25 years ago.  It would be easy for the British to recognise that they made a mistake in murdering innocent people in a situation that was already inflamed by the divisions in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>My primary focus rests largely on our methods of diplomacy and negotiation with the British. The Tánaiste is inhibited by the megaphone diplomacy of telephone calls between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, both of whom are concerned about forthcoming elections.  There is no delivery or commitment from the present Irish Government and everyone is aware of that fact. There is no confidence, hope or action.  I could speak for well in excess of the time available on this matter.  No one understands the current attitude adopted by the British Government.  The Leader is correct to note that it has closed the file on Northern Ireland.  In doing so, he is not paying a compliment to representatives of the Irish Government who are involved in negotiations with their British counterparts.  However, at least he is being honest in recognising the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>Later today the Tánaiste will meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, but no one expects that meeting to be anything other than a cosmetic exercise.  The Tánaiste has been treated with complete disrespect, whether by David Trimble, Sir Patrick Mayhew or others.  It is not so long ago that Mr. Trimble stated he did not have time to meet the Tánaiste to discuss the fundamental problems of Northern Ireland.  He stated that if the Tánaiste contacted him again he would make time available to meet him.  I asked the Tánaiste what he said to David Trimble when he finally met him and he informed me that his comments would be unprintable.  However, that is small talk and there is no evidence of the Irish Government negotiating from a position of strength.</P>
    <P>In the Downing Street Declaration, the British gave a commitment that the Irish Government has a contribution to make and a part to play in the problems of Northern Ireland.  However, that is completely dead in the water at present because progress is not taking place.  That is the <Col N="1656" /> greatest crisis we face because it is fair game for the Provisional IRA to be active in the knowledge that others are not taking action and negotiations are not taking place.  I deplore the IRA for its violence and lack of commitment to implementing a ceasefire.  The IRA has imposed an unacceptable and unbearable situation on Northern Ireland.  Those who make their living from small businesses in Northern Ireland have been forgotten during the current hostilities.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to negotiating a settlement is non-existent.  I could provide several examples of this but I do not have time to do so.  Her Excellency, the US Ambassador to Ireland, visited County Donegal on 9 January last to meet a north west cross-Border group.  The Tánaiste was also invited to attend this meeting but we received a reply from his office which stated &ldquo;Unfortunately, Mr. Spring will not be able to attend.&rdquo;.  I could cite other examples but time is against me. I have in my possession several letters seeking commitments from the Tánaiste but he was not interested.  I wonder why that is the case?  The Tánaiste lives in County Kerry where most people are very positive and have a Nationalist outlook.  I am obliged to inquire if he has lost his commitment to the process.</P>
    <P>Later in the debate the Tánaiste will make a positive speech but there will be no substance behind it.  I can only surmise that the damage has been done by the megaphone diplomacy of telephone calls between the Taoiseach and John Major, who has obviously asked his Irish counterpart to &ldquo;play it soft&rdquo; until after the British general election.  That is the current agenda.  Nothing is happening, a vacuum has come into existence and the IRA has taken up the running.</P>
    <P>Everyone has their agenda and people have informed me that 100,000 jobs have been created. However, in a document hot off the presses, the IDA states that only 17,725 jobs were created. Will the Minister of State inform the Tánaiste that only 152, or 0.86 per cent, went to the west, Connacht and Counties Donegal and Clare?  The reason for this largely originates with the deprivation visited upon the Border counties and neglect on the Government's part toward developing industries and providing jobs in the southern Border counties.  The one clear element that can be seen from this is the consistency of neglect.  The Tánaiste could not make time available to meet a north west cross-Border group, the only one of its kind, North and South, which represents all political and religious denominations.  When celebrating 20 years of trust and co-operation, that group received a short letter from the Tánaiste to state that he could not attend.  A price is being paid not only in Northern Ireland but also in the Republic, where jobs are not being created.  I am forced to believe the IDA's report in that regard.</P>
    <P>The American influence is very important but it has not been properly cultivated.  The Leader correctly recognised that the British have closed the file but, unfortunately, I believe that the Americans have also closed it because the pressure <Col N="1657" /> to act has been removed.  I do not know whether John Major has influenced the Americans but I am reasonably sure he influenced the Irish Government to play it soft.  The American input into problems in Northern Ireland has slowed down.  I do not accept that is occurred because President Clinton lost interest after the election.  There is a serious commitment from the American people but that has not been translated into action on the part of the President's task force on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Americans have played a major role over the last five to ten years.  Numerous American trade missions have visited the North.  They landed in Belfast, Newry, Armagh, Derry and Enniskillen and finally had dinner with the Taoiseach or Tánaiste in Dublin Castle on the way home.  The Tánaiste has failed to recognise that it was important for those trade missions to meet public representatives in the South and in the six southern Border counties.  This did not happen. No American trade mission who visited Northern Ireland met any public representative from the six southern Border counties, who are at the bottom of the pile when it comes to job creation.</P>
    <P>I can give examples to prove beyond doubt that the area is utterly neglected by the present Government.  It does not seem to be concerned. There are 12 counties which do not have a Minister, including the six southern Border counties. When I raise this I am told that Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Carey, is an able Minister who is looking after it.  Why is there no Minister of State from the southern Border counties?  Deputy Harte was a Minister in a previous Government, as was Deputy Nealon.  They were not seen as suitable although they had a knowledge of what was happening on the ground.</P>
    <P>There is no effort to focus on the problems of Northern Ireland.  There is no bland statement that can prove to the people on the ground that the Government is concerned with making progress or giving a commitment.  The Government must take responsibility for the current trouble and the hopelessness of the situation.  There is a vacuum, and the IRA is once again taking the initiative.</P>
    <P>I totally condemn the IRA.  Last Tuesday I attended the opening of the Strabane Canal Basin by the chairman of the International Fund for Ireland.  Two million pounds was spent on this necessary development for a town that has unfortunately topped the European unemployment list, percentage wise.  While the chairman of the international fund and the Secretary of the Department of the Environment were speaking, those who class themselves as Provisional IRA. Sinn Féin or whatever brand of nationalism they claim, interrupted.  I thought to myself how stupid they are &mdash; they are the very people who need this development in Strabane.  They are so stupid they could not recognise that they would reap the benefit from it rather than those on the platform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> Anyone who is on the ground can see what is happening.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, this is my first visit to the Seanad since you have been elected to high office.  I congratulate you and wish you well in the exercise of your functions.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate which is the latest in a series of valuable Seanad debates on Northern Ireland, and to place in context the current priorities of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> Every month of the calendar includes the anniversaries of significant days in the history of conflict on our island.  Some of these events happened long ago &mdash; as long ago, indeed, as 1690. As we know, that does not dull their capacity to inspire both celebration and division.  Many others are more recent, and are unambiguously painful to recall, for example, Enniskillen; the Abercorn Restaurant; the Birmingham, Monaghan and Dublin bombings; and Bloody Sunday, which was commemorated last week and of which I shall speak later.  In addition, of course, virtually every date recalls in some home a private, personal grief, otherwise largely forgotten by most of us.  Nor should we forget that each great collective tragedy, the subject of our common remembrance, is composed of many individual tragedies.</P>
    <P>This Sunday, 9 February, marks the first anniversary of the ending of the IRA ceasefire and of the Canary Wharf bomb, which took the lives of two innocent and uninvolved young Londoners. None of us will ever forget what we were doing when we heard the news, or our reactions of disbelief, shock, anger and personally, of profound shame and sadness.  I was returning from a visit to Washington, where I had been briefing President Clinton on our proposals to promote agreement on a framework for negotiations, part of the slow, difficult process of building agreement brick by brick.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the outrage of Canary Wharf was threefold.  First, we made absolutely clear that the use of violence to achieve political objectives remains unjustifiable and intolerable, not only to us but to the people of Ireland.  We immediately ended ministerial level contact with Sinn Féin, and insisted that only following an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire could it participate in the negotiating process.  We also sought to ensure that the response of our security forces to the renewed threat of paramilitary violence was as resolute and effective as it could possibly be.</P>
    <P>Second, however, we continued to emphasise that the involvement of Sinn Féin in political dialogue, while dependent on an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire, in our view remained highly desirable from all perspectives.  We made every effort to address the legitimate concerns of republicans and to facilitate their transition to the democratic arena should they make it possible for themselves to do so.</P>
    <P>Third, together with the British Government and the political parties, we sought to create a process of political negotiation which would be comprehensive in scope and fair in its procedures, and capable of achieving, through substantive debate, a lasting and balanced political settlement which the people of both parts of the island could democratically endorse.  Throughout the past year, these three elements of our approach have remained constant and we have worked consistently to advance them.  I am to meet the Secretary <Col N="1660" /> of State this evening as part of that ongoing endeavour.</P>
    <P>There is no point in denying that it has been in many ways a difficult and disheartening year.  The heady optimism of 1994 and 1995 seems like a distant memory.  Following the IRA and loyalist ceasefires, the deep-frozen certainties of conflict appeared to be melting away.  We celebrated the reality of peace and in a few short months witnessed its power to transform the economic, social and psychological landscapes.  Now, the old poisons of violence and sectarianism have bubbled up to the surface once again.  There is a powerful sense of unease and uncertainty at all levels, from the streets to the boardrooms.</P>
    <P>Over the past quarter of a century nobody would have become rich in Northern Ireland by betting on optimism.  The Government remains convinced, nevertheless, that there are rational grounds for a continuing determination to work for peace and agreement.  Our objective remains a comprehensive agreement, based firmly on the principles set out in the Joint Declaration and expanded upon in the Framework Document, encompassing all the core relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between the British and Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>In our analysis, a lasting political settlement is intimately connected with the achievement and consolidation of peace.  We frankly think that the former is more likely to be achieved and sustained alongside the latter, although this has not prevented us from engaging fully in the present stage of the talks process.  We are determined to secure progress through whatever avenue is realistically open at any given time.  That is why we have continued to emphasise the potential value of an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>Quite unforgivably, acts of violence continue. The prospects for a new and unequivocal ceasefire are depressingly uncertain.  Despite our revulsion and disappointment, however, the imperative of peace remains compelling.  Quite literally, there is no rational alternative in so far as the republican movement is concerned.  Martin McGuinness said last Sunday that there was nowhere to go other than the negotiating table. It has been made abundantly clear that only through a renewed ceasefire will Sinn Féin get there.</P>
    <P>A restoration of the IRA ceasefire would be the right decision morally, politically and economically. If set out in convincing and unequivocal terms, and consistently observed, it would have the capacity to break the current stalemate and create renewed possibilities.  On the other hand, a continuing failure to respond explicitly to the manifest desire of the people for peace, above all if punctuated by fresh atrocities, would cumulatively destroy belief in the very concept of an inclusive peace process.  Trust has already been severely damaged, and will take time and effort to restore.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1661" /> There are those who say that our strategy has been naive and based on miscalculation and that the door should be slammed for good on the possibility of Sinn Féin's participation in talks. My own assessment is that this analysis fails to give due weight to the very strong desire for peace which is manifest on the ground in and throughout the island, and which the republican movement must know they cannot afford to ignore indefinitely.  As a democrat, I also believe that those who support Sinn Féin have a right to be represented in talks once the fundamental democratic ground rules are satisfied.  Even if I were wrong, however, how could this be more decisively demonstrated than in the clear light of democratic debate?</P>
    <P>If, as many Unionists fear, republicans, once in talks, failed to honour their commitments to peace and democracy, and sought to exploit force or the threat of it, then this would be laid bare for all to see.  And it is surely when confronted, face to face, and every day, with the desire of the representatives of a great majority of our people for a reasonable compromise, that any party will find it hardest to justify an unyielding and absolutist position.</P>
    <P>The necessity of a sustained loyalist ceasefire is also absolute.  The loyalist leadership have set out their own fresh political vision, and made a most constructive contribution to the talks so far.  It would be tragic if their capacity to articulate politically the views and needs of their community were to be lost because of a recrudescence of loyalist violence.</P>
    <P>Those who have been accustomed to violence need to know that the political alternative is not an abstraction but a reality.  That, in turn, requires all constitutional politicians to overcome their understandable fears and inhibitions and to demonstrate in practice the validity and potential inclusiveness of the political path.  In our situation, there is a particular onus on the Governments, which have the political resources and psychological space, to keep open the bridge out of violence to the democratic arena without relaxing our own standards or compromising our principles.  It is vital that others make clear that they, too, will automatically and rapidly engage in serious dialogue if and when there is a complete unequivocal and lasting restoration of the ceasefire. But this does not in any way lessen the prime responsibility for the restoration of the ceasefire which rests fairly and squarely on the IRA.</P>
    <P>Last June, the two Governments put in place a talks process involving themselves and nine political parties, with provision for the entry of Sinn Féin following an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire and subscription to the Mitchell principles.  The talks are based on fair and carefully negotiated rules, and are chaired with skill, impartiality and great patience by Senator George Mitchell and his colleagues.  Progress to date has been tortuously slow despite the best efforts of the Government which is fully committed to doing all it can to make the talks work.  We <Col N="1662" /> have been bogged down in consideration of the decommissioning of illegally held weapons, a vital objective but one which, as the Mitchell report underscored, is likely to be attained only in the context of substantive and inclusive political negotiations.  It is essential that we overcome this hurdle.  The way forward mapped out by Mitchell is the only plausible and realistic one.  So far, it is regrettable that those who are most vocal on the need to proceed without Sinn Féin have done least to make progress in that format a real possibility, and have continued to focus so unblinkingly on precisely that issue, decommissioning, where practical progress without Sinn Féin is least likely.</P>
    <P>We are continuing to explore the questions which have dominated the talks since their inception, and we fully support all continuing efforts to consolidate and build on what has already been agreed.  It is clear, however, that electoral considerations are predictably ever more decisive in the minds of many of the participants.  Inevitably the imminent British general election will lead to a brief pause in the talks.  We are considering, therefore, how best to prepare the ground for a renewed and reinvigorated process of negotiation following the British election so that we can pick up the threads as soon as possible thereafter.  It is important that we maintain the framework which was so carefully and painstakingly constructed and, at the same time, overcome initial hurdles and get to the real heart of the issues.</P>
    <P>The significance of the forthcoming election should not be exaggerated however.  In both Westminster and Dublin there has been a high degree of bipartisanship and there is firm cross-party agreement on key principles and structures. The fundamentals of our situation and the outlines of the settlement we all know is needed will not be decisively altered by any eventual changes in the political balance.  That is why an immediate restoration of the IRA ceasefire would open the way for the rebuilding of confidence on all sides and provide the platform for a revitalised negotiating process.</P>
    <P>The Unionist community should for its part draw confidence from the objective strength of the situation.  The principle of consent and all that flows from it, including the commitment to a referendum on any proposed settlement emerging from talks, represents a fundamental and unshakeable protection of their essential position &mdash; one which is guaranteed not just in legislation and international law but in the political realities on this island.</P>
    <P>The real challenge for unionism remains this: having failed, in the long run, to achieve stability and security through exclusion and the politics of dominance, is it capable of acting on the reality that they can only be achieved through inclusion and the politics of equality and mutual respect? We seek not domination but partnership, not uniformity but diversity.</P>
    <P>There are many challenges ahead.  The publication of the report of the Independent Review <Col N="1663" /> of Parades and Marches has focused attention on the parades issue and the prospects for this year's marching season.  The start of the marching season is less than two months away.  We must use that time as productively as possible to ensure that the events of last year are not repeated.  We must work to ensure that July 1997 is not remembered as another doleful anniversary of confrontation, mistrust and disillusion.  The parades issue is undoubtedly a profoundly difficult one.  Its significance has been enhanced by the perception on the part of both communities that the validation of their rights and identities turn on the outcome of contentious parades.  Rather than seeing contentious parades as the product of a complex process involving demographic, social, cultural and local factors, they are now regarded crudely as a contest of wills.  Approached from this angle, the marching season becomes a series of events whose outcomes determine the winners and losers.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the 1996 marching season will be remembered as disastrous on many fronts. The state of community relations deteriorated, mistrust and suspicion grew, confidence in the rule of law was dealt a serious blow and doubts about the impartiality of the RUC and the authority of government were encouraged.  The debate on the parades issue and its resolution has been enhanced by the publication of the report of the North review.  Its recommendations are considered, comprehensive and thoughtful.  They have been arrived at after extensive consultation with those most directly involved in the parades issue, those whose views command support and, through a series of public attitude surveys, with the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In formulating their recommendations, the members of the review have clearly paid heed to the results of these consultations.  The review found that the overwhelming majority of people in Northern Ireland and in both communities believed that disputed parades should be subject to mediation.  A similarly overwhelming majority wanted a binding decision made by someone else should accommodation not be possible.  The most popular choice for third party determination was an independent commission.  I say this to underline the fact that the broad thrust of the recommendations reflect the clear wishes of both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>One may have reservations on points of detail. There are areas which have yet to be clearly defined either by the parades commission or by statutory instrument.  There are ways in which the determinations of the commission may be reversed.  The circumstances in which this occurs are to be subject to statutory guidelines yet to be established.  The way in which this turns out in practice will have a direct bearing on the credibility and authority of the parades commission. Clarification is required on the precise relationship between the law on defying determinations and the operational independence of the RUC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> However, the recommendations in their general thrust are sensible and constructive.  They offer a viable mechanism for dealing with the contentious parades.  Perhaps most importantly they allow for a dynamic interaction between the particular and often highly sensitive circumstances of individual parades and the rule of law as determined by a dedicated, independent statutory body.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I have urged the British Government to act on the North review.  It is a matter for concern that it has indicated its intention to begin only a partial implementation of the review's recommendations despite the widespread support for them in Westminster.  This issue will be discussed in our ongoing contacts with the British Government and I will also have the opportunity of discussing this issue more fully at the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>The Government is keenly aware of the trepidation and anxiety which is widely felt in Northern Ireland about this year's marching season.  No effort should be spared to avoid a repeat of the trauma of last year which cost Northern Ireland so dear in terms of community relations, trust and confidence in the rule of law and economic development.  The Government will leave no avenue unexplored in our efforts to ensure that 1997 is remembered not as a &ldquo;ground-hog day&rdquo; of bleak familiarity but rather as the point at which the parades issue was steered away from the brink.</P>
    <P>We have been familiar over the years with the commemoration of one of the most traumatic events in Northern Ireland's history, the events remembered as Bloody Sunday.  The 25th commemoration of those events is somewhat different in that it coincides with the presentation of new information and re-evaluations of what actually happened.  This information adds significantly to the many doubts which have been expressed, including by successive Governments, about the methods and conclusions of the Widgery tribunal. It adds considerable, indeed compelling weight to the calls of the victims' relatives to have the report and its imputations of the victims' guilt repudiated.  This new information warrants examination and assessment.  My Department is currently doing just that.  The Taoiseach and I have urged the British Government to do likewise and will be conveying to them the specific points we believe most relevant to that exercise.</P>
    <P>If controversial and violent events of the past, including Bloody Sunday, can be reassessed and re-evaluated objectively and in a non-partisan spirit of truth and justice, then we can begin to bind up the wounds of the past and bring them to a close.  If remorse can be expressed for violent deeds, then the prospect of eventual reconciliation &mdash; and I believe that reconciliation of our different traditions lies at the core of Irish Nationalism &mdash; and lasting peace can be significantly advanced.  It is part of the necessary process of establishing a lasting commitment to <Col N="1665" /> peace and the political process.  The call for an official apology has crossed the community divide in Northern Ireland.  It is one which should be listened to and acted upon.  I hope that in future years we may commemorate the events of Bloody Sunday as a tragic chapter of our history which has been brought to a just and dignified close. Our concern must be to redress the wrong to the memory of the victims and to the feelings of their families, not to rekindle the anger or relive the horror of those events.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, it is only through a lasting political accommodation that it will be possible to create a genuinely new beginning for all of us in these islands.  While in the coming months there will inevitably be a brief interval required by electoral politics, we must not lose sight of the many assets we possess in terms of the work already done and the extensive common ground in principle on the way forward.  A renewed ceasefire would do more than any other act to place us in a position to make full use of those assets; but generosity, courage and vision are needed on all sides.  We must work, North and South in the two islands, for the kind of &ldquo;consensus society&rdquo; so eloquently described in the North review &mdash; one built on mutual understanding, which celebrates cultural diversity, in which citizens have a more secure sense of belonging, and in which conflicting interests are accommodated.  The history of 1997 need not and should not be another chronicle of wasted time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was impressed by the Tánaiste's speech.  He is correct when he says that generosity, courage and vision are needed on all sides and he has shown these virtues in considerable measure in what must often seem to be an intractable problem, particularly in the context of the marching season.  I join with him in hoping that the recommendations of the North review will be fully implemented by the British Government.</P>
      <P>I wish to correct an opinion I uttered during our last debate on Northern Ireland.  I then engaged in a blistering attack on the editorial style and content of <i>An Phoblacht</i> as I remembered it from some years ago.  I was contacted almost immediately by the editor of <i>An Phoblacht</i> who sent me a series of recent editions of the newspaper so that I could examine them with a view to making a further comment.  Having read six recent issues, I am glad to say that it no longer contains the type of violent, intolerant, racist language for which it was so remarkable a number of years ago.  It is only fair that, having attacked it, I should correct my earlier position.  However, there is still a highly partial and one-sided account of Irish political life in which the British army, the Irish Government and conventional politicians are regularly lambasted while there is no hint of criticism of the republican movement and of the activities of the Provisional IRA.  This concerns me because until we get a balanced debate within the republican movement it is going to be very difficult to move forward.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1666" /> Certain questions are raised by recent actions of the republican movement.  Some time ago it was clear that John Hume was considering an electoral pact in the forthcoming British elections. It is easy to see in constituency terms why this view should be taken in a normal situation. However, it is not a normal situation.  Recently the Provisional IRA entered a children's hospital and fired rounds of live ammunition, some bullets hitting an incubator, which, luckily, was empty at the time.  However, small infants could have been killed.  This is an outrage against any code of decency, yet there was nothing in <i>An Phoblacht</i> critical of it.  In addition, there was little to indicate that the position of the SDLP regarding an electoral pact had been completely abandoned.</P>
    <P>We have suggestions, which have been confirmed by some republican sources, that the IRA considered the political assassination of Mr. Hume during the 1980s, considerations to which Mr. Adams was party to.  How can John Hume or the SDLP contemplate an electoral pact with Sinn Féin in these circumstances?  Even if they did so contemplate for purely pragmatic purposes, what would that say to the Unionist community? If you are going to sup with the devil you need a very long spoon.  The Unionist community would take a very particular view of this circumstance.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that there are so many closed minds, especially in Northern Ireland.  The two communities do not appear to have a bridge; they appear to live in hermetically sealed islands.</P>
    <P>There are also closed minds on the republican side.  I listened to Vincent Browne's radio programme last night.  His guest was Mr. Kevin Boland and he said remarkable things about the involvement of senior Irish politicians in the Arms Trial.  He named some in circumstances which lead me to wonder if there will not be at least one libel action in the offing.  Mr. Boland was asked by Vincent Browne about the actions of his father, Harry Boland.  He was a member of the Government which was in power when an IRA man, George Plant, was arrested.  Mr. Plant was acquitted by an Irish jury in an Irish court. He was immediately rearrested and subjected to a military tribunal which found him guilty.  He was shot within a short period of time.</P>
    <P>Vincent Browne asked Mr. Boland how he put this into context with his suggestion that British justice was corrupt.  Nothing of which the British Government was guilty in the past, Mr. Browne said, had been as outrageous as this intervention and miscarriage of justice by the Executive.  Mr. Boland was unable to see that point.  It was another instance of the closed mind that unfortunately exists in Irish politics.</P>
    <P>It is important that this House not only develops restraint in the language we employ when discussing Northern Ireland but also attempts to develop whatever links continue to exist between the two parts of Ireland.  It is extremely important that persons from a background such as mine &mdash; a member of the Church <Col N="1667" /> of Ireland with, in the past, a southern Unionist perspective &mdash; should attempt to reach out to our co-religionists in Northern Ireland and indicate that there is a genuine concern on our part for the well being of the inhabitants of all the island.</P>
    <P>It is particularly worrying, as we enter the marching season in Northern Ireland, that disturbing noises are emerging about what is planned, particularly for the church blockade in Harryville.  This weekend 24 marching bands from all over Northern Ireland will assemble there and, according to the <i>Irish News</i>, one of the persons orchestrating the event will be a convicted murderer who is named in that newspaper. Is the RUC taking an investigative interest in the background of this man so he may be prevented from implementing the worst of these excesses?  I look to the authorities in Northern Ireland to prevent sectarian clashes.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we support the call for an inquiry into Bloody Sunday.  That call has been made not only here but in Westminster.  Last week this House unanimously passed a resolution supporting the Tánaiste in urging the British Government to implement such an inquiry.  That must have strengthened the Tánaiste's hand in dealing with the British Government.</P>
    <P>I call upon the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland to reconsider its boycott policy. It is a nasty, long lasting weapon and by implementing it that community is importing into the social body a deep rooted and long lasting malignancy.  I have heard people speaking on the radio about targeting Protestant businesses in Northern Ireland on the basis that a member of the family was involved in the Orange Order. That appears to be dangerously close to guilt by association and I ask them, despite their pain, to reconsider this policy in light of the long-term damage it will do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for allowing me to share his time.  Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of Canary Wharf and it is fitting that we should learn one lesson from what happened that day.  Canary Wharf should teach us for all time that Sinn Féin/IRA, or whatever else they wish to be known as, cannot be trusted.  The ceasefire which was pronounced to be all but permanent &mdash; that word was not used but the impression was given that it was permanent &mdash; broke down courtesy of nobody but IRA/Sinn Féin.  It was no good for them to come onto the airwaves, which unfortunately they can still do, and say it was the British Government's fault. The British Government did not place the bomb in Canary Wharf or on the Strand or anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem we face today is a problem of policy. If we agree, as the Government appears to, that Sinn Féin/IRA will be allowed into talks once there is another ceasefire, how do we believe them?  Words to Sinn Féin/IRA mean something different from what they mean to us. <Col N="1668" /> I have a great deal of sympathy with those who demand decommissioning first.  The only way to ensure Sinn Féin/IRA do not shoot and murder people when they feel like it after pronouncing a ceasefire is to remove their arms.</P>
    <P>The lesson of Canary Wharf is simple: the so-called peace process is dead.  There is a failure in this part of the country and in the United Kingdom to acknowledge that.  Nobody can blame people who so enthusiastically desire peace for clinging to the hope of the peace process continuing.  However, look at the peace process and what happened during that process.  It was a trick and it did not work.  It was a peace process on one side while the other side said: &ldquo;You can have peace for as long as we decide to give it to you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I regret the weakness of Government policy since Canary Wharf.  The Government's reaction, while genuine and understandable, was to cut off ministerial contact with Sinn Féin/IRA but to maintain civil servant contact.  The difference is a matter of semantics.  It means that the Minister for Foreign Affairs does not talk to Gerry Adams but a civil servant in his office does and he relays the messages.  The Government insists that this is a dramatic change in policy.  In fact, Sinn Féin's input into and contact with Government Buildings is probably just as great now as it was before Canary Wharf.  It just means it does not speak to the same person on the telephone.  That is not a policy change or reaction.</P>
    <P>The other response was to tell Sinn Féin it could not be involved in talks unless there was a ceasefire.  That was not a change in policy either. It was a gain for the Sinn Féin position because that had not been the case beforehand.  Irish and British Government policy is that, provided there is a ceasefire, which nobody believes will be a real ceasefire, Sinn Féin/IRA can join the talks.  That is not acceptable because the moment they become involved in talks they will remain there as long as they find them acceptable and when they do not find them acceptable they will bomb Canary Wharf or somewhere else.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge that the peace process is over.  We must acknowledge that President Clinton, John Major, various Irish Governments, Taoisigh and Foreign Ministers, John Hume and virtually every Member of this House were duped by Gerry Adams because for genuine reasons they sought peace and wanted to believe him. They were wrong and the proof was in Canary Wharf this time last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if there is any benefit in having this debate but I am delighted it is taking place.  We have had similar debates before and there are times when one feels that we are only addressing ourselves.  The same statements are made by the same people in this and the other House over the years yet there does not seem to be any advancement in the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Ross when he says that we should learn from what happened in Canary <Col N="1669" /> Wharf and 25 years ago in Derry.  The inference is that we should learn from the past but I am afraid that history has never taught lessons for the present.</P>
    <P>Conflicts are brought to an end for a variety of reasons.  In some cases it is military might, in others it is passive demonstrations. At the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last week we heard from Angolan spokespeople that it was exhaustion which ended a most horrific civil war. The UNITA representatives said that they could not see the war starting again because the people are too tired.</P>
    <P>The value of this debate is to ask those with violent tendencies to think again because their actions will not achieve anything.  The problem is that no one seems to know what the end is.  That applies to both communities and it is very hard to wean people off violence once they have become involved.  It is not like weaning a child off its mother's breast and onto solid food &mdash; when someone has killed once it is easy to kill a second time because there is no trauma involved.</P>
    <P>Members of both Houses and the public need to look at Northern Ireland as a part of this country and society.  During the so-called peace, people from &ldquo;republican areas&rdquo; in the South went to the North on holidays for the first time in many years.  They found it was no different from Kerry or Clare and that the people were humble, ambitious and had the same aspirations for their families as we have in the South.  There should be more such visits instead of publicised political trips.  If people regarded this country as an entity and saw the beauty of the people and the place, a genuine and long lasting peace could emerge in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be involved in a slanging match with any other Senator about whether Sinn Féin/IRA should be regarded as separate entities. We should not create hate figures on the Nationalist or Unionist side, that will get us nowhere.  We must try to achieve a genuine coming together of minds and the end should not be the federalisation of Ireland or the creation of a single political entity.  The Mountains of Mourne will continue to sweep down to the sea no matter what kind of government we have on this island, as will the mountains in Kerry.  To sing songs about them does nothing but provide good entertainment at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The people of the island must be brought together.  This is a very simplistic view but people forget that the most simplistic ideas are the way forward.  One does not teach a child the entire alphabet in one lesson or educate someone by providing them with Roget's Thesaurus on the first day.  People seem to think that this can be done with regard to peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that we categorise the people in Northern Ireland &mdash; if someone is Protestant they are Unionist, if they are Catholic they are Nationalist, if they are a member of Sinn Féin or the UVF they are a murderer.  People became <Col N="1670" /> members of Sinn Féin for different reasons, it might have been because of Bloody Sunday or because a relative was killed or some political event.  Equally, there are multiple reasons for people joining paramilitary organisations. However, when they do, the consequences spread out like ripples in a pool.  If we label these people as terrorists we do everyone a disservice.</P>
    <P>Anyone who thinks that the bombings in Canary Wharf and Manchester helped to resolve the problems of Northern Ireland is very wide of the mark.  The reaction to the Manchester bomb in Kilkenny was one of horror and the people of Kilkenny and Ireland have become closer to those in Manchester as a result.  The majority of those working in Canary Wharf could not care less who planted the bomb and they do not accuse the people of Northern Ireland of it.  What matters to them is that their jobs were lost and two of their friends were killed.  No matter where the extremists who planted the bomb came from it would have caused equal horror.</P>
    <P>Some people say that this Government and its predecessor did not do enough.  However, the Government is making a genuine effort to resolve the problems in the North, on this island and in Anglo-Irish relations.  These efforts will continue no matter who is in power.  As a member of Fianna Fáil I might not always like the manner in which the Government is acting, yet most people would feel that a conciliatory effort is being made.  That effort is not attempting to achieve dominance over the people of the North but a genuine accommodation between all sides to the equation.</P>
    <P>Whether there is a ceasefire in place at present, it must be said that the violence in the North is not at the same level as it was in the past.  Every day that passes during which nobody is killed is a day of which we should be glad.  It is irrelevant to me whether this is called a ceasefire.  For the people in the North, to be able to say that nobody was killed because of a political act in the preceding 24 hours is like an alcoholic saying &ldquo;I am not drinking today&rdquo;.  Each day must be taken as it comes; that is the only way there will be a genuine ceasefire.  Somebody must decide &ldquo;I won't kill or maim anybody today&rdquo;.  If people just think about the maiming and the killing, a more genuine effort will be made by everybody.  If people decided not to join extremist organisations because of past horrors and instead urged others not to react, not to join such organisations, then perhaps an effective peace could ensue.</P>
    <P>The people of North and South can commingle all over the world but it seems that when they return to small communities in the North of Ireland, suddenly the tensions and the past are rekindled and when they return to their own homes in Britain or America or wherever, they are suddenly Irish again.  They are not Catholic Irish, Protestant Irish, Republican Irish or Unionist Irish &mdash; no distinction is made, they are simply Irish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> What I say here will not make any difference to the situation but perhaps somebody here will come up a sentence in this debate which might encourage people to think about the realities of life in Northern Ireland and the problems which face the young people there.  The young people in the North are well educated, and judging by their exam results, they do considerably better than their counterparts on the British mainland. The difficulty is that when they are asked what their plans are when they leave school, too few of them say they are going to stay in the North as doctors, nurses and so forth.  Too many are saying that, though they are glad of the education, they want to get out of the closed societies in which they live.  Unless that attitude changes the future for the North is bleak.</P>
    <P>If people decide to be extreme in their statements about terrorists, they do nothing to support the peace process.  I abhor violence, murder and terror and I have seen the results of many horrific incidents in other countries.  I ask people to refrain from making extreme statements because extreme statements can be as violent as extreme actions.  I hope that this debate will be of some benefit to the people of Northern Ireland and the island as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I had the opportunity to listen to Senator Lanigan because it was a much more balanced contribution from the Fianna Fail Party on this issue than the first contribution. One of the points I was going to make was that I hoped that in the lead-up to the election in Britain, candidates in Northern Ireland would not be provoked into making extreme statements or, indeed, into being either more Unionist or more Nationalist than they would normally be in the heat of an election campaign. I reiterate that point now.  I am sorry such a speech was made in this House this morning because it is not characteristic of the other contributions made in this House on Northern Ireland. I regret the contribution Senator McGowan made because I feel that it was as much geared to the concerns of his own constituency as to making a positive contribution here to solving the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Suggesting that this Government is not doing everything it can to find a solution, or that its actions are in contrast to the previous Government, is very negative and is not in accordance with Senator McGowan's party leader's approach in the Dáil and in the general debate on Northern Ireland.  Senator Lanigan has presented a much more balanced case on his party's behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject Senator McGowan's comments about the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach.  They have clearly been making every effort.  The fact that the Tánaiste was prepared to go to Northern Ireland yesterday, although the trip was called off, through no fault of his, and that he is going today instead, is an indication of how seriously this Government takes the Northern Ireland issue. <Col N="1672" /> Progress has been difficult because of the lead-up to the general election in Northern Ireland. Everybody acknowledges that.</P>
    <P>Steady work has been done by the contribution of this Government in the setting up of the talks in Northern Ireland, in legislating on the transfer of prisoners and the preparation of legislation in relation to decommissioning.  These two practical steps were taken by this Government.  With regard to the North report and the Bloody Sunday issue, our Government has taken a strong stand urging the British Government to implement the proposals in the North report, to reopen the inquiry on Bloody Sunday and to give a full apology to the families of those concerned. It is very unfair to suggest that this Government is not doing everything it can.  As for the invitation to go to the North that was produced by Senator McGowan, I would assume that if you were inviting somebody as busy as the Tánaiste to attend a meeting you would make the invitation in plenty of time and check in advance if he was available.</P>
    <P>I am also surprised at Senator McGowan's suggestion that the Americans have closed the book on Northern Ireland.  That is anything but the truth.  President Clinton indicated quite clearly his ongoing support for the process, as has ex-Senator Mitchell and the many other Americans who have given a strong commitment to Northern Ireland which I think is ongoing.</P>
    <P>It is true that the lead-up to the elections in Northern Ireland, and in Britain in particular, is a serious problem which has meant that there has been British Government inaction which we all regret.  There are some steps that can be taken. On the question of violence and the IRA, I would support what has been said by Members in this House that we should urge them again to call a ceasefire, particularly in light of the anniversary of the Canary Wharf bombing.  We should urge the IRA to discontinue the acts of violence which mercifully have not resulted in deaths in the recent past but which could easily have done so. I urge that they would cease those dangerous activities that continue to divide the communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I suggest that some progress can be made on a number of issues &mdash; parades in the North report, policing, boycotting and Bloody Sunday.  On the parades, the British Government could take some action in relation to the North report.  It has said it is going to consult again and I regret that.  As the Tánaiste said, the North commission had consulted widely before publication of the report and I believe that further consultation is unnecessary after its publication.</P>
    <P>The British Government can at least begin to put the processes in place whereby the North report could be implemented.  There are legislative procedures that need to be set in place; there is also the procedure referred to by the Tánaiste with regard to the responsibilities of the RUC versus the responsibilities of an independent commission in relation to parades.  Preparatory work <Col N="1673" /> can be done in that regard.  Mo Mowlam, the British Labour Party spokesperson on Northern Ireland, said that, if her party got into office next time and this necessary preparatory work were done before the election, she felt she would be in a position to implement the North report before the marching season began and mistrust between the communities arose.  Whether it be her party or the Conservative Party which gets into power in Britain, if this necessary work is done now it will be possible to have an independent body making decisions on parades before the marching season.  Unfortunately, that season seems to be coming early this year as a parade is planned for next week outside the Harryville church.  I urge intervention at this stage.  I understand a number of bands are planning to march past the church. While it is a predominantly Protestant area, if the parade is provocative, it should not take place.  I urge whoever can intervene to do so.</P>
    <P>Another report suggested an independent police authority in Northern Ireland and preparatory work should be done on that.  Boycotting is a negative, racist and unchristian practice and anyone who indulges in it should consider their position and stop immediately.  It does no good, drives wedges between communities and should be stopped.  I have referred to Bloody Sunday for which there should be a full apology and a reopening of the inquiry.  It is clear from what the Tánaiste said this morning that that is what our Government is pushing for.</P>
    <P>In the lead up to the election campaign, leaders in the North, Britain and here can either be positive or negative in what they say and do.  I urge that they be positive and that whatever can be done in the various areas to which I have referred should be done.  There should be a positive rather than a negative attitude and necessary work in terms of bringing communities together should be done rather than driving wedges between communities.</P>
    <P>President Clinton said in his recent inauguration speech how valuable diversity was in his community and that if the idea of diversity as a positive factor in American society were ever lost, they would lose a great deal.  Diversity must be seen as a positive factor in Northern Ireland as well.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Leader's belief of who is mainly responsible for the current state of the peace process.  I would not place the British Government's lackadaisical attitude first but the IRA's.  The British Government deserve condemnation for the way it has put this issue on the back burner.  There are many democratic considerations involved.  The IRA's violent stance and its unsatisfactory manner of conducting its ceasefire mean that it is easily the leader in this.</P>
      <P>It is not widely known that Mr. Blair denies the citizens of Northern Ireland the right to vote British Labour, yet he and his party are odds on to be the next British Government.  His answer which he gave to me when I asked him this age old question outside Queen's University was that his sister party was the SDLP.  It is not mine, however.  I cannot go along with its aims and objectives nor can any of my colleagues in the old Northern Ireland labour movement.  Not a single trade union is affiliated to the SDLP which would in itself rule it out for my support.  What message is sent to Protestants in Northern Ireland if Mr. Blair will not allow the soon to be governing Labour Party organise in part of its jurisdiction?  It means that in time, be it long or short, there will be no need for a British Labour Party or anything else British in the North of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Senator O'Sullivan say that Mo Mowlam has plans to implement the North report.  However, an article by Mr. Blair in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> was so bland that it would be impossible to work out what plans his party has for Northern Ireland.  I fancy it would be put on the back burner until it sorts itself out.</P>
      <P>We should not ask for an unambiguous statement from Sinn Féin regarding its link with violence because it is a complete waste of time and does not help.  No one seems to heckle the loyalists for the same reason.  They will not condemn violence.  They use the same formula of words as Sinn Féin.  This is not productive.  However, contact should be maintained with Sinn Féin.  I strongly believe this because I am very much in favour of sitting around a table to discuss matters and am prepared to overlook religious differences to get the Unionists to sit down with their political opponents.  I am in favour of maintaining contacts no matter how unpleasant the background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under its current leadership, the RUC will rapidly return to its peacetime position.  Ronnie, the current leader is excellent.  To start using Christian names may make them think I am too close to the RUC.  The Unionists suspect this, if one gives a clue of this sort.  Not only am I a Senator but I am close to the RUC.  The RUC will recruit vigorously from the Nationalist population given the right climate and the claim displayed on lampposts near the Border by Sinn Féin that the RUC is a Protestant wing of the Unionist paramilitaries will no longer apply.  If a Roman Catholic joins the RUC, he is in danger of having his head blown off.  Having prevented Catholics from joining, Sinn Féin then accuses the force of being predominantly <Col N="1675" /> Protestant.  It is a bit of a joke if one can bring oneself to smile at such things.</P>
    <P>No one should move from the current position on decommissioning, which is that it should occur as talks progress.  That is a firm line which makes sense.  Like Senator Lanigan, I have been in more than one war.  I was a combatant towards the end of the communist ELAS uprising in Greece in 1945.  There was no decommissioning then.  Weapons were laid down and the matter settled in discussions afterwards.</P>
    <P>I have made it my business to travel this country for 17 to 18 years and talk to the people.  If people know me for anything, that is what they know me for.  I have drawn conclusions which are not reflected in the Government's policy on either side of the House which is that the people of this island do not want unity.  They do not want it now, suddenly or gradually.  They simply do not want it.  They want an internal settlement.  It is fine to keep the three strands moving towards that but the people want an internal settlement. No one ever says that, but I have never been told anything else in my travels and I have spoken at fora, in public houses, in bookies' shops, at racecourses and to the high, low and middle.  That is what everyone tells me and those plain words should find their way from here to the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another unsatisfactory matter is that the Combined Loyalist Military Command has not been given its proper due for the wonderful tolerance and forbearance it has shown in the face of a deliberate attempt by the IRA to drag it into the troubles.  We should never forget the difficulties the loyalist paramilitaries are having in holding this ceasefire, but they are holding it and they deserve every credit for it.</P>

      <P>It appears that substantial progress must await the outcome of the Westminster election.  However, even in advance of the election there is room for confidence building measures on all sides.  First and foremost, the IRA needs to reinstate the ceasefire and give appropriate assurances as to its permanence.  A restoration of the ceasefire would transform the situation and allow not only the political process but the process of economic regeneration to get back on track.  A new ceasefire must put an end not only to so-called &ldquo;military&rdquo; operations but also to the punishment beatings and steady intimidation which creates a climate of fear and reinforces polarisation.  People in the southern part of the country are beginning to realise that IRA violence and the threat of such violence is effecting the potential of the tourism boom which coincided with the ceasefire to a great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> The British Government also has a chance to build confidence and restore trust by initiating a new inquiry into the events in Derry on Bloody Sunday 25 years ago.  Recent revelations have indicated beyond any reasonable doubt that the Widgery inquiry was, at best, incompetent.  At worst, it represented an orchestrated cover-up. The lack of confidence in the Widgery findings has compounded the bitter legacy of Bloody Sunday. There is an urgent need to re-examine all the available forensic evidence and eyewitness accounts and put the conclusions on the public record.  This is not simply a political matter; for the victims' families it is a deeply personal matter.</P>
    <P>A new inquiry in which all can have confidence would enable the families to finally close this chapter and, on a wider level, would help to restore confidence in the even handed administration of justice.  Following the most recent revelations, renewed concerns have been voiced not just in the Nationalist community but also in a large section of Unionist opinion, and I hope the British Government will act on these concerns so that the matter can finally be laid to rest.</P>
    <P>The Westminster election is likely to take place in May.  One matter which cannot be put on the long finger until then is a resolution of the parades issue.  Nobody in Northern Ireland can afford a repetition of last Summer's disastrous events.  The establishment of an independent parades' commission, as recommended by the North report, represents the best hope of an accommodation between the right to free assembly and the right of local residents to freedom from intimidation. The British Government should act now to put in place the key recommendations of the North report rather than allow themselves, once again, to be overtaken by events.  None of these confidence building measures are dependent on the outcome of the Westminster election and all of them will go a long way towards giving the people of Northern Ireland and these islands in general some hope of a return to peace.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Sherlock for sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>Recent revelations about the events of Bloody Sunday have made it a major issue again.  Reasonable people are asking that the British Government make clear, for once and all, that a major error was made on that day.  Without going into all the factors which led up to it, there was evidence beyond all doubt that, as was suggested the other day, inexperienced British Army troops and other factors led to one of the major tragedies in Northern Ireland over the past 26 years.</P>
      <P>We must bear in mind that there have been many major tragedies there, some of which were planned to precision and left many people dead, injured and maimed.  We cannot forget the injury to feelings and to the mind which are the hardest to heal.  It takes time to heal the wounds of the actions of men of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the international goodwill across Europe, America and the world which was generated <Col N="1677" /> by the cessation of violence still pertains, and that is something which the paramilitary organisations involved in violence should bear in mind.  There has been major disappointment at their actions.  People feel let down and wonder who to believe anymore.</P>
    <P>However, it must be recognised that the loyalist ceasefire has held and the Government has not received credit for that.  Much credit was given to the previous Government when the IRA ceasefire was announced but the other ceasefire has held against much provocation.  We must maintain a balanced approach and this Government, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs have done so.  That is what it is about from our side.</P>
    <P>It is easy at times for somebody, depending on the political party to which they belong, to say that this Government is not doing enough.  That is politics.  However, we must see beyond that. We have a more responsible role to play because the prospect of all out violence in the North is something which nobody wants to entertain.</P>
    <P>The marching season led to a major change in the overall atmosphere in the North last year and it must be teased out, anticipated and planned for in time this year.  Last year's head on confrontation cannot be allowed to happen again because it sent bad feelings across the North and affected communities in all areas.  It put matters back a couple of years and is something that must be watched closely this year.</P>
    <P>The fruits of peace for 18 months was evident both North and South.  It involved an important economic factor.  People enjoyed the peace of mind which was lacking for 25 years and they spoke out about it.  The paramilitaries must be commended for giving peace, but it is something to which all communities are entitled.  Violence and terrorism have not delivered settlements in parts of the world where they occur.  While we may be pessimistic, we must also be optimistic. Peace must prevail and communities must live together.  For the good of the people, historical factors and individual political ambitions must not get in the way.  There is always a temptation among politicians, especially in the run up to elections, to say things which do not help the atmosphere in a place where there has been much violence, death, heartbreak and destruction.  I hope the optimism will continue, that people of goodwill on this island will continue their efforts to bring the two communities together to look towards a future of peace and prosperity and that those in Europe, America and elsewhere will continue to help us internationally.  We are talking about the people's future.</P>

      <P>Next weekend will mark an anniversary which none of us wishes to celebrate.  It is one year on from the ending of the IRA ceasefire which, after 18 months of great hope and optimism, led to such despair.  Despite the difficulties facing the peace process, the hope of peace for so many in Northern Ireland was shattered by the explosion in Canary Wharf.  Some 12 months on we have seen many sad incidents which have given us cause for despair rather than hope. However, where Northern Ireland is concerned, we can never lose hope because by doing so, we are handing over the future of Northern Ireland to the men of violence who are willing to fill the vacuum created by the absence of political talks and a political process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed to read last week that David Trimble and William Ross had written to the British Foreign Office complaining about the frequency of our President, Mary Robinson's, visits to the North.  The future of Northern Ireland as it faces the 21st century is an issue which should be exercising their minds rather than complaining about the visits of our President and seeing them as their number one priority.  This came the same week as the publication of the North report on contentious parades and marches which was immediately long-fingered by the British Government, <Col N="1679" /> another sad development.  We want courage not cowardice from the British Government when facing such a difficult period in the North. There is no reason the British Government could not proceed immediately with the key proposals in the North report on parades and marches and appoint a parades commission to replace the RUC as a body empowered to decide on disputed routes in the North.  The peace process is so fragile that it cannot sustain another Drumcree.  By announcing a further eight weeks of consultation on the commission's proposals, a repeat of last year's events is likely.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we cannot expect any ground breaking decisions on the North so close to a British election.  That is a great tragedy for many people in Northern Ireland.  Politicians of every party in this House have called on the Provisionals to abandon their campaign of violence and to reinstate their ceasefire.  I support the calls for the reinstatement of the ceasefire, but I would go further by asking the leadership of the IRA what they expect to achieve by continuing their campaign?  What is the purpose of it?  What will it gain in practical political terms by continuing the campaign which it could not achieve by peaceful negotiation with all parties involved in the conflict in the North?  Continuing with violence for another 25 years will condemn another generation of Catholics in many areas in the North to a life of social exclusion, long-term unemployment, kangaroo courts and punishment beatings.  Is that all the republican movement has to offer?</P>
    <P>The ultimate solution to the Northern Ireland problem will only be found at the conference table.  Everyone must sit around that table armed with nothing more than their democratic mandate and the courage of their political convictions.  The Provisional movement might be surprised at how far the real world has moved on since it first embarked on its campaign of violence more than 25 years ago.  The incoming British Government, whatever its political colour, might be willing to nudge the Unionists towards a more compromising attitude in the event of peace being re-established in Northern Ireland.  The one thing of which we can be sure is that no British Government will seek any concessions from the Unionists as long as the threat of IRA violence hangs over them.  I ask the Provisional IRA and the republican movement to take account of these realities and to abandon their futile campaign of violence.  Once peace has been established the real war can start &mdash; the war of words between the different political parties in Northern Ireland about its future shape.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believes there are six basic principles which would underpin any lasting political settlement.  I would like to take the opportunity to restate them.  There can be no internal settlement.  There must be a recognition of the relationship between Unionists and Nationalists, North and South, Northern Ireland <Col N="1680" /> and the United Kingdom and the Republic and the United Kingdom.  There can be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland unless a majority of the people wish it.  This is the starting point for any settlement and one which each party to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, with the exception of Sinn Féin, recognises.</P>
    <P>The right of the majority for the time being in Northern Ireland to chose between the United Kingdom and a united Ireland does not imply a right for that majority to override the two Governments legitimate interest in creating a genuine partnership society in Northern Ireland. The tilt nature of Northern Ireland, now recognised in international law, means that the province which is democratically British could one day be democratically Irish.  This carries with it a sound basis for insisting on a real North-South dimension to the settlement.  The three strands in the political process will only receive their strength and shape by reference to each other. The basis of any settlement in Northern will primarily emerge from those who are politically in the centre.</P>
    <P>Any political settlement in Northern Ireland will also have to contain a number of other elements.  These include a new political order with genuine parity of esteem; a written constitution for Northern Ireland, including a bill of rights and democratic institutions; an acceptance of the principle that the external constitutional status of Northern Ireland must be decided by the majority; a maximisation of the degree of self-government in Northern Ireland and new policing structures which will enjoy cross-community support; and a North South dimension in areas of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>Certain people in the Government tried recently to play politics with Northern Ireland by suggesting that there is a difference between ourselves and potential coalition partners on this sensitive issue.  I doubt if any party in this House disagrees with the principles I have outlined or with the basic elements of a settlement because there is no difference in principle between the parties in the Oireachtas on the Northern Ireland issue.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland's future is bleak unless there is a move towards dialogue and consensus.  Confidence building measures are essential if we are to have any hope of reaching that consensus.  Such gestures are required from all parties to the conflict and a great opportunity now presents itself to the British Government as we pass the 25th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry.  Calls have been made for an inquiry into what happened on that fateful day.  The victims of violence and their relatives are entitled to know the truth; therefore there is a necessity for a truth commission.  The British Government has all the facts at its disposal.  The answers to the questions can be found in the files of the British army, the Northern Ireland Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office in London.  It would take little effort by Mr. John Major to compile the necessary information which could <Col N="1681" /> then be made public at an inquiry.  The British Government could then formally apologise for shooting dead the 14 innocent people in Derry on Bloody Sunday.</P>
    <P>A solution to the Northern Ireland problem will involve building bridges of understanding across the rivers of mistrust which have developed over the years.  A formal explanation of what happened on Bloody Sunday would be a first step in building such a bridge between the British Government and the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  If anyone doubted that efforts at reconciliation and mutual understanding were urgently required, they would have only had to watch <i>Spotlight</i> which was broadcast on BBC last Tuesday night.  A large group of young people from both sides of the divide took part in the discussion.  Some of them were willing to explore new avenues and to look forward. However, it was depressing to listen to the large number of speakers who were only willing to look back.  It proved that all the ingredients are there for another generation of sectarianism and mistrust.</P>
    <P>It seems possible that the Northern conflict will continue to simmer for another 25 years.  We must do everything to ensure that does not happen. I also urge the Unionist politicians to discuss the political future of Northern Ireland in a spirit of compromise.  While the absence of an IRA ceasefire is the biggest single obstacle in the way of political progress, there is a duty on Unionist politicians to show an interest in abandoning their &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; and &ldquo;majority takes all&rdquo; stance. They must commit themselves to the creation of a partnership society where both traditions are fully recognised and respected.</P>
    <P>I accept the Unionists are rightly proud of their Britishness, but being British in Northern Ireland appears to be different from being so in Britain. Modern Britain is a cosmopolitan society.  Cities such as London, Birmingham and Bradford are melting pots of nationalities, religions and cultures. The Unionists are loyal to Britain, but does the Britain to which they are loyal exist anymore?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that any peace settlement will of necessity require tough decisions by the Unionists.  However, before any of this can happen, the IRA must call a halt to its campaign of violence.  Unless that happens, no British Government will be asking the Unionists to make any tough decisions.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that the current talks will be abandoned.  When talks were abandoned in 1992, it took many years to get them back on stream.  Although they seem to be going nowhere and people believe that nothing will happen until after the British general election, I would hate to see them called off.  We owe it to the people of Northern Ireland, who have suffered so much over the past 25 years, to keep them going and to keep their hopes up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> The ongoing work of building a lasting peace in our country must continue despite the recent setbacks.  Trying to achieve a permanent settlement where everyone can live in harmony is the great task facing this generation.  The tremendous work which went into building the peace process must not be lost because of the actions of a few, particularly when a majority of the people want peace and prosperity.  The present difficulties in Northern Ireland will not be easily resolved in the short term, particularly during the British general election campaign when the parties are seeking to gain greater support.  However, we must continue the process and urge everyone to remain peaceful until we resume the talks after the election.</P>
    <P>The marching season is a difficult time each year, as we saw last year in Drumcree and across Northern Ireland.  It causes great bitterness and division among local communities.  The British Government must act immediately to set up the parades commission if last year's events are to be avoided.  I urge the Government and the Tánaiste, who is meeting Sir Patrick Mayhew later today, to strive to keep the process alive. We hope that by the end of this year the peace process will have developed further.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for giving me an opportunity to speak as I represent the Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with my colleagues in appealing to both sides in the North to renew their efforts for peace. Those of us who live in the Border counties remember what it was like when the ceasefire was announced.  I was near Goma in August 1994 when the bush telegraph sent a message to us that a ceasefire had been called.  When I arrived home there was a euphoria in the Border counties as people headed North to visit Armagh and Belfast which they had not seen for years.  I spent an afternoon in Armagh during the Christmas season soaking up the atmosphere.  It was incredible <Col N="1683" /> to see people who had not been in the North since 1969 enjoying the freedom.</P>
    <P>There were many economic benefits as well. Throughout that Christmas period and the following summer, it was difficult to get accommodation in Belfast.  There was a complete renewal of the economic system in Northern Ireland.  It is disheartening that this renewal did not take place when it mattered most and the ceasefire broke down.  That was a disaster of enormous proportions for everyone and its effects were felt across the whole island.</P>
    <P>As other Members stated, it is important to try to maintain our optimism but it is difficult to do so when account is taken of the obstacles and incredible prejudice that exists in Northern Ireland.  The Government and Opposition parties are united in trying to remain optimistic and bring about a resumption of talks.  Politicians should continue to appeal to both sides, particularly the republican movement, to renew the ceasefire.  When the last ceasefire broke down, many people concluded that it had been a tactical move rather than a concerted attempt to bring about peace. Repairing that damage will be difficult.  If the republican movement intends to call a new ceasefire, it will have its hands full trying to convince people that it is not another tactic.</P>
    <P>Genuine responses are required from people in Northern Ireland.  It will be incredibly difficult to bring about another ceasefire but the rewards of doing so are enormous.  We must remain optimistic and take every opportunity to try to create the kind of milieu that will bring about such a ceasefire and genuine talks.  I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue.  My first comment is &ldquo;Let there be peace&rdquo;, but it must be peace with justice for all.  I watched a television programme earlier in the week of an interview with Bishop Daly about the events of 25 years ago.  He referred to the hovels in which families were obliged to rear their children and stated that conditions were appalling, there was overcrowding and people had no hope of obtaining employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government should have the decency to acknowledge that injustices have occurred in Northern Ireland.  A number of my brothers worked in the United Kingdom and I do not know why the fair and just system in operation there did not apply to Northern Ireland. Had there been fair play in the past, had people been given decent homes and employment and had they not been discriminated against on the basis of class, creed or political affiliation, the trauma that affects not only Northern Ireland but the Republic would not have occurred.  Bishop Daly highlighted the conditions in which people were forced to live and, while they state many things, British Government Ministers never confirm <Col N="1684" /> that they permitted this to develop and that it is there duty to rectify it.</P>
    <P>The British Government allowed a period of 18 months to pass during which every Member of Government and Opposition parties in both Houses contributed to the development and maintenance of the peace initiative.  I know of no other country where people would have been permitted to waffle and twist words for 18 months and allow a ceasefire to collapse.  Lives are being lost and the current situation will affect future generations in Northern Ireland and the Republic.  Following the ceasefire, people began to invest money in Ireland and tourists from the Republic visited Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the British Government played politics for so long and did not co-operate with this Government and its predecessor to develop and maintain peace.  That would not happen in any other country.  The British allowed the situation in Northern Ireland to continue for many years and they have a duty to apologise for and be honest about Bloody Sunday.  If they cannot admit that a serious mistake was made when innocent people were killed, how can they expect people who were mistreated for generations to respect law and order in Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>I hope that peace will return to Northern Ireland because young people must be given the opportunity to remain there and live in a free and just society.  People living in the Republic, regardless of class, creed or political affiliation, have enjoyed the benefits of such a society since independence. Why is that not the case in Northern Ireland?  I am sickened that some Unionist politicians refuse to acknowledge the grave injustices visited upon the minority community in the past, which created the problems in Northern Ireland. Until those injustices are acknowledged, there will not be peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government success in the future in trying to regain the peace initiative created by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  The present Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have done everything possible to maintain that initiative but the blame for its collapse lies with the British Government because it wasted the time available.  There cannot be peace without justice, particularly in respect of housing, jobs, etc.  The situation has become so crazy that people cannot pray in their local churches.  If the various churches &mdash; Catholic, Protestant, Presbyterian, etc. &mdash; had come together 30 to 40 years ago, engaged in discussions, stated that everyone prays to one God and that the bitterness should stop, it is possible that 25 years of slaughter could have been avoided.  In recent years, the churches have made various efforts towards gaining peace and it is high time that this occurred.  Church leaders have a role to play but they were inactive in the past when they could have neutralised the bitterness that existed.</P>
    <P>I hope that common sense will prevail in the future.  I wish the Government success in trying to revitalise the peace process because it is in the <Col N="1685" /> interest of everyone, particularly young people, to do so.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Irish Takeover Panel Bill, 1996:" RHead="Second Stage">
    <Title>Irish Takeover Panel Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Takeover Panel Bill, 1996, provides for the designation of a takeover panel to monitor and supervise takeovers and certain other related activity with a view to ensuring fair and equal treatment of all shareholders in such situations and to provide support and credibility for the Irish financial markets.  The companies which will fall within the panel's remit will be mainly those currently listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>The need for an Irish takeover panel came about as a result of the separation of the Stock Exchange here from being part of the London stock exchange in December 1995 and the decision of the London takeover panel that it no longer wished to have responsibility for takeovers here consequent on that separation.</P>
      <P>The question of what form the Irish takeover panel should take was the subject of detailed consideration by a working group representative of the Irish financial markets.  The majority view of the working group was that the panel should have statutory backing and the group recommended accordingly to the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  There was concern on the part of the group that if the Irish takeover panel were to operate other than on a statutory basis, there may not be the same respect for the rules and rulings given, as compared with the London panel.  Because of the stature of the London market, parties involved in takeovers there would generally be respectful of any directions or rulings. The ultimate sanction for disobeying of a ruling or direction of the London panel is ostracism from the financial services of the City of London but the panel can rely on the pro-active support of the relevant regulatory authorities in the UK in the achievement of this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the Securities Investment Board (SIB) has imposed the so called &ldquo;cold shoulder&rdquo; rule which in essence obliges an authorised firm to which SIB's rules apply not to act for any person in connection with a takeover, merger or relevant acquisition of shares if the authorised person has reason to believe the persons for whom the firm would so act would not be likely to comply with the takeover code.  Therefore, given the manner in which the support is rendered by the regulatory authorities it could be said to amount to indirect statutory backing in a key area of the UK panel's activity.  However, the industry view here was that limited statutory backing of this nature would not work in Ireland.  The main <Col N="1686" /> reason therefore for putting in place an Irish takeover panel with statutory backing is to provide support and credibility for the Irish financial market, thereby avoiding any uncertainty arising from the separation of the Irish Stock Exchange from London.</P>
    <P>As stated at the outset, the primary task of the panel will be to monitor and supervise takeover activity falling within its remit with a view to ensuring fair and equal treatment of all shareholders. The panel will not be concerned with the financial or commercial advantages or disadvantages of any particular takeover.  These are matters for the company and its shareholders. Equally, the panel will not be concerned with issues such as competition, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended.</P>
    <P>Pending the enactment of the present Bill, the UK takeover panel has continued to accept responsibility for monitoring takeovers and related matters which fall within the takeover code.  Following the confirmation that the Minister proposed to legislate for a takeover panel, the proposed nominating members of the panel have formed an interim panel and the Governor of the Central Bank has appointed a chairperson designate, Mr. Dan O'Keeffe SC.  An interim director general designate, Mr. Leo Conway, formerly of Ulster Bank Finance, has also been appointed.  The preparation of the draft Bill has involved close and protracted discussions and consultations with the interim panel.</P>
    <P>Against this background I would now like to deal with the provisions of the Bill itself.  Essentially, this Bill is concerned with giving statutory backing to a company to be known as the Irish Takeover Panel for the purposes already referred to.  The Minister will designate the company for these purposes subject to certain conditions being met&mdash;the company must be incorporated under the Companies Acts as a public company limited by guarantee and the Minister must be satisfied that the company's memorandum and articles of association are consistent with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>There will be five members of the panel drawn from the various interests in the Irish financial markets.  The Minister can, by regulations, alter the membership if circumstances so require in the future.  The board of the panel will have seven directors.  Each of the members will nominate and appoint one director each.  The Governor of the Central Bank nominates and appoints the chairperson and vice-chairperson and he will take account of the general public interest in making these appointments.  The directors so appointed can co-opt three further directors as required. There is provision for alternate directors to be appointed primarily to cater for conflicts of interest arising.</P>
    <P>The directors will be independent of the members in the discharge of its monitoring and supervisory functions.  The panel will operate for <Col N="1687" /> this purpose through the medium of detailed rules which the panel itself will draw up. However, in a number of key areas the Bill specifies what these rules must contain and provides in relation to some of this number that the Minister be consulted or approve them.</P>
    <P>The rules, which will be modelled where possible on the UK rules, must reflect the general principles set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  The Minister can amend the Schedule by regulations after consultation with the panel.  The panel can give rulings and directions as required in each case arising.  It can apply to the courts to have these rulings enforced, if necessary.  An aggrieved party can seek a judicial review in the courts in relation to specific rulings or directions of the panel.  The panel will be self-financing and will be required to submit an annual report which will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As the Title of the Bill makes clear, the task of the takeover panel will be to monitor and supervise takeovers and other relevant transactions, terms which are defined in section 1 of the Bill. The reference to other transactions would include all matters that are incidental to takeovers, including work on the preparation of a takeover offer.</P>
    <P>It also includes substantial acquisitions of securities.  These involve ways in which parties acquire shares in a company which falls within the remit of the panel but can only do so at a predetermined rate within specified timeframes.</P>
    <P>Other terms defined in section 1 which are also fundamental to the Bill are &ldquo;acting in concert&rdquo; and &ldquo;control&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Acting in concert&rdquo; is a concept that is very important in the context of activities in which the takeover panel will be interested. Essentially, it deals with circumstances where two or more parties act together.  It would be quite easy to avoid the provisions of the Bill if parties were able to so organise their affairs that no one of them fell within the size criteria that are laid down.  That would enable interested parties to drive a coach and four through the requirements of the Bill and the rules made by the takeover panel.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Control&rdquo; will arise where a party holds, in aggregate, not less than 30 per cent of the voting rights of the company.  This is also central to the activities of the takeover panel in that when somebody acquires control, the party or parties acting in concert will have to make a mandatory offer to the remainder of the shareholders.</P>
    <P>In terms of the scope of the Bill, section 2 defines the companies to which the Act will apply; that is public limited companies or other bodies corporate incorporated in the State, whose securities are currently listed on the Stock Exchange or have been authorised to trade there within the previous five years.  It also enables the Minister to provide, by regulations, that the Act should apply to the securities of other public limited companies in future if the need arises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> Specifically excluded from the remit of the panel will be UCITS and investment companies under Part XIII of the Companies Act, 1990.  The former are excluded because of the particular manner and purpose for which the shareholding of such companies are brought together, that is, investors with a common purpose.  The same consideration essentially applies to investment companies within the meaning of Part XIII of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the designation by the Minister of the Irish Takeover Panel as the body to undertake the functions of the panel as set out in the Bill.  Certain conditions must be complied with before the designation can take place.  The specific conditions are that the panel be registered under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, as a public company limited by guarantee, to be known as the Irish Takeover Panel, and that the memorandum and articles of association of the company be approved by the Minister.  Section 3 also specifies the provisions of existing Companies Acts that are disapplied in respect of the panel, and who the members of the panel will be.</P>
    <P>There will be five members of the panel and these are the bodies specified in section 6, namely, the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies &mdash; Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Irish Association of Investment Managers, the Irish Bankers' Federation, and the Irish Stock Exchange.  In the case of any of these bodies not being a body corporate, section 3 provides that an individual or body corporate nominated by the unincorporated body will be the member of the Irish Takeover Panel.  The membership of the panel is representative of the various interests involved in the Irish financial markets.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 deal with other matters relating to the memorandum and articles of association of the panel.  Section 4 is designed to ensure that following the incorporation and designation of the panel, the members will not be able to alter either the memorandum or articles of association without the prior approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>As already indicated, section 3 provides that the memorandum and articles have to be approved by the Minister prior to the designation of the company.  The particular section 4 provision will ensure that no changes are made without the Minister being made aware of and agreeing to them.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the principal objects that must be included in the memorandum of association of the Irish Takeover Panel.  These are the monitoring and supervision of takeovers and other relevant transactions so as to ensure that the provisions of the Act including the scheduled principles, and any rules made by the panel under section 8 of the Bill are complied with as respects each such transaction.  It also provides that the panel can include in its memorandum such other objects and powers as are reasonably necessary or proper for it to enable it to discharge its functions, provided these are consistent with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> Section 6, already referred to, makes provision for the directors of the panel.  Essentially, the directors of the panel will monitor takeovers and issue any directions and rulings pursuant to the rules which they make under section 8.  Accordingly, it is vitally important that the panel and its directors should be able to discharge their functions without hindrance or other improper direction from the members who have nominated the directors.</P>
    <P>The panel will have seven directors.  They will be nominated by the five specified bodies already referred to, representing the various interests in the financial industry.  In addition, the Governor of the Central Bank will appoint the chairperson and deputy chairperson.  The governor will have regard to the general public interest in making these appointments.</P>
    <P>In particular cases, conflicts of interest could arise, and it is accordingly proposed that the directors should be able to have alternates nominated to take their place in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>In addition, particular takeovers may arise where the expertise available to the panel may be wanting in some respects.  In such circumstances, it will be possible to co-opt up to three additional directors to the panel whose term of office may relate to the individual takeovers, but is not so limited.</P>
    <P>Because the provisions of section 182 of the 1963 Act override any provision in the articles of a company and provide that the members of a company may remove a director, it is necessary to disapply that particular provision in respect of the panel, given that we want the panel directors to be totally independent of the members who have nominated them.</P>
    <P>Finally, provision is made for the Minister to either add to or remove any of the nominating bodies in the future if circumstances arise where this proves necessary or desirable.  The consequence of such a removal is, of course, that the director nominated by such a member who is removed should automatically relinquish his position and this is provided for in this section.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the general duty on the panel to monitor and supervise takeovers to ensure that the provisions of the Act, including the scheduled principles, are complied with.  However, to avoid circumstances where parties try to get the panel to undertake activities that are not within their remit, subsection (2) provides that the panel cannot be compelled to act in circumstances where it would not otherwise be required to.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that the Minister may amend the scheduled principles, by regulations, following consultation with the panel.  However, these regulations will require the approval of the Oireachtas by way of a resolution.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a key provision of the Bill and will enable the panel to make rules to set out the various requirements to be complied with by parties engaging in takeover activity.  In general, the approach is that it will be the panel's own responsibility to draw up the rules in accordance, <Col N="1690" /> and in compliance, with the Act.  However, in three specific areas, section 8 lays down requirements that must be included in the rules.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that the Minister must be consulted in regard to the determination of what will amount to a &ldquo;substantial acquisition of securities&rdquo;.  The reason this is proposed is that the rules in this instance will determine percentage limits and time limits within which acquisitions can only take place, but which will not result in actual control of a company arising.</P>
    <P>For instance, under the present UK substantial acquisition rules, no party may acquire 10 per cent in any company in a seven day period if as a result of the acquisition plus what he already holds, a person would end up holding between 15 and 30 per cent.  This follows the same approach as in the case of a takeover in that it is the Minister with the approval of the Oireachtas who will determine the percentage limit as to when control arises.</P>
    <P>Section 8(3) provides that the panel must make rules for the making of a mandatory offer where a person acquires control of a company, whether acting alone or in concert with other parties.</P>
    <P>The takeover panel rules may also apply to companies that find themselves subject to the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended.  This section provides that the rules must make specific provision for what happens if the Minister, for example, makes a reference under the said 1978 Act to the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>The possibilities that would arise include the actual suspension of the takeover offer while the matter is considered by the Competition Authority and the Minister, through to the actual lapsing of an offer where a reference is made. However, the detailed rules will be subject to the approval of the Minister.  The section also provides that the panel may grant derogations or waive rules in the particular circumstances of an individual case.  However, this can only be done by reference to the scheduled principles.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the power of the panel to make rulings and give directions.  As already indicated, there was concern that, if the takeover rules and panel were to operate here other than on a statutory basis, there may not be the same respect, as in the London situation, for the rules and rulings given.  Consequently, section 9 is one of the central pillars of the activities of the panel in that it underpins rulings and directions that will be given by the panel.  In addition, it provides that where the panel issues rulings and directions, it may publish them.  This will ensure that all market participants are aware of the decisions given and taken by the panel.  To enable the panel operate effectively it has also to be able to obtain information and this section will ensure that the panel can seek information and the parties who are asked for the information will be obliged to provide it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is designed to ensure that, following appropriate inquiry or examination in the matter, <Col N="1691" /> the panel may, if it thinks fit, advise, admonish or censure parties in relation to their conduct in a takeover situation.  The section further provides that the panel can publish their advice, admonition or censure.</P>
    <P>As a protection for parties subject of the sanction imposed by the panel, such parties will be empowered to apply to the court which, following a hearing on the matter, can either confirm the decision of the panel or annul the decision and make certain orders.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is essentially a procedural section, and makes provision for a number of practical matters that will enable the panel to exercise its powers.  In the first instance, it provides for the power of the panel to conduct hearings.  Secondly, it provides that these hearings can be held otherwise than in public.  The panel is given the power to ensure the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents by such witnesses.  It also provides for the position of a witness appearing before the panel.  Finally, in addition to creating an offence for a person who fails to obey a summons of the panel, section 11 also provides that the panel can make application to the court to enforce the compliance of witnesses at hearings.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that the panel can apply to the courts to have its rulings or directions enforced.</P>
    <P>One major difference between the existing code dealing with takeovers and the new regime proposed under the present legislation is the involvement of the court.  As mentioned earlier, the respect of parties involved in takeovers for the code and rulings of the London Takeover Panel derived mainly from the international standing of the UK market.  The same could not be said to apply in the case of the Irish market. Accordingly, it is possible that some parties the subject of rulings or directions might, for their own reasons, be prepared to defy the panel. Section 12 is designed to enable the panel to go to court to get the court to enforce a ruling or direction where this is being ignored by the party in question.</P>
    <P>When an application is made to the court, the court can make interim or interlocutory orders as it deems necessary.  However, the panel cannot apply to the court earlier than seven days from the making of the ruling or giving of the direction. This is designed to allow the party against whom the ruling or direction was made to consider their position and, in particular, consider whether or not they want to make an application to the court themselves under section 13.</P>
    <P>In fact, the court is specifically precluded from making an order where such an application has been made.  However, the panel may apply and the court may grant interim or interlocutory relief as is considered appropriate by the court under section 13(8).  This would ensure that in particular cases, where urgency was involved, and this is likely to be the case in some takeovers, the panel <Col N="1692" /> would not be debarred from going into court at an early stage.</P>
    <P>While respect for the rulings and directions is a very important feature of the takeover code, inevitably circumstances will arise where a party will feel aggrieved at the rules, ruling or direction given by the panel.  Section 13 is designed to provide a mechanism which will enable such parties to have their concerns examined by the courts and where necessary obtain relief.  However, it is designed so that applications to the court will not be entertained other than on substantial grounds.</P>
    <P>In addition, the timeframe within which applications to the court must be made are extremely tight.  However, the court can extend the time limit in certain cases but, <i>inter alia,</i> must bear in mind the nature of the relief that can ultimately be granted.  Moreover, where the High Court gives its decision, any appeal to the Supreme Court will only be possible where the High Court certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance.  Of course, the right of appeal on constitutional grounds is preserved.</P>
    <P>As mentioned in relation to the previous paragraph, this section also ensures that in particular cases, while awaiting the outcome of a judicial review, the court may grant interim or interlocutory relief as it considers appropriate.  Overall, section 13 is designed to provide a balanced approach to ensure that parties can protect their interests while at the same time ensuring that takeover activity is not unduly impeded.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with provisions with respect to appeals, applications, etc., to the court.  Time is a huge factor in most takeovers.  Accordingly, it is considered appropriate to try to ensure that the courts will be available to deal with matters that arise in particular takeovers and deal with them as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is desirable that as far as possible one judge should deal with all applications. This would enable the judge to become familiar with the rules, rulings and directions of the panel and should assist the process of ensuring speedy decisions from the court.</P>
    <P>Moreover, having regard to the confidential nature of some of the information in relation to takeovers, this section also provides for the courts in particular cases to hear the case <i>in camera.</i></P>
    <P>Section 15 is designed to ensure that where transactions in relation to a takeover have been completed, the provisions of this Bill cannot be used to have them unwound.  In very many takeover situations, once the takeover is concluded, the offeror will immediately move to introduce new arrangements in the company which has been taken over.  This could involve the sale of property, the rearrangement of existing facilities, the redeployment of management and so on.  It would be invidious to allow for the unscrambling of a takeover once it has been completed, having regard to such circumstances.  Essentially, the only circumstances in which a takeover can be unscrambled will be on the basis of an application <Col N="1693" /> by the takeover panel itself under section 12.  It will be recalled that under that section, where the panel considered that parties were likely to ignore their rulings, they can go into court immediately to have the ruling or direction, etc., confirmed.  This would thus become all the more important having regard to section 15(a) where a party could seek to ignore a ruling or direction of the panel in the knowledge that once the takeover has been carried out, no other party other than the panel could seek to have the takeover unwound.</P>
    <P>Even where a takeover has been carried out in accordance with a rule, ruling or direction, although this is subsequently declared invalid or quashed, it cannot result in the unwinding of the takeover again, save for the action that can be taken by the panel.  For the panel to take such action it would be of the view that the circumstances justified the unscrambling of the takeover and the fair treatment of all the shareholders involved.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the panel is going to be self financing and it is not proposed that central Government funds be used to meet any of the expenses of the panel.  In the circumstances, it is necessary to give the panel the power to defray the expenses incurred in performing its functions, and section 16 is for this purpose.  For example, it is proposed that, subject to the consent of the Minister, the panel will impose a levy on relevant companies and other parties which are involved in a takeover.  Before agreeing to any charges the Minister will consult with any persons or parties considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister's announcement of his intention to legislate for a takeover panel an interim panel has been in operation.  While it is not yet involved in vetting any takeovers as such, much preparatory work has been undertaken. This involved extensive consultations with the Department in the preparation of the draft legislation and subsequently the preparation of draft memo and articles for approval by the Minister as well as the preparation of the draft rules and code together with explanatory notes.</P>
    <P>The interim panel has also close contact with the UK panel and has benefited from training and other information provided by the UK panel.  It is intended that the expenses incurred by the interim panel can be defrayed by the panel when it becomes operational.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is designed to ensure that information obtained by parties directly or indirectly involved in the work of the takeover panel will be regarded as confidential and will not be disclosed other than in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  In this regard, it is provided that disclosure can be made where this is necessary to explain why a particular ruling or direction was given or where disclosure is made to certain parties to facilitate their operation &mdash; for example, to the Garda or the DPP.  This section also provides a penalty for failure to observe confidentiality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> Section 18 will ensure that information of a confidential nature that would not normally be disclosable in legal proceedings will have the same benefit under this legislation.  This could be an important stay on ensuring the privacy of confidential communications between the client and his legal adviser in particular.</P>
    <P>Given that it is now proposed to legislate for the operation of the panel, it is considered appropriate that an annual report should be submitted on the activities of the panel and in turn the Minister should arrange for the publication of the report.  Section 19 provides accordingly, but in addition requires the panel to have the report with the Minister not later than four months after the end of the year to which the report refers and the Minister to have the report laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas not later than six months after the end of that year.</P>
    <P>It also provides that the Minister can prescribe the matters and information that he wants to see addressed in the report, but there is the proviso that information which could materially injure or unfairly prejudice the legitimate interests of any person should not be disclosed in the annual report.</P>
    <P>The panel will be operating in a particularly sensitive area and, in that it will be issuing rulings and giving directions, there is always a possibility that certain parties would feel aggrieved.  Provided the panel and the members, directors, etc., do not act in bad faith, section 20 will give them protection against being held liable for damages. Separately, the section makes provision that will enable the panel to indemnify any member, director, officer or employee of the panel in respect of their activities on behalf of the panel.  Finally, the section provides for the inclusion in the Defamation Act, 1961, of a provision that would ensure than any report of the activities of the panel will benefit from qualified privilege as provided for under that Act.</P>
    <P>As a result of the interest of the panel in matters that are happening in the corporate area, it is considered appropriate that the panel should be specifically identified as a party which has access to reports of investigations which are carried out under Part II of the Companies Act, 1990, or reports of relevant authorities of a recognised stock exchange under Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, concerning insider dealing.  As mentioned, these reports could relate to areas in respect of which the panel would have a particular interest.  The primary legislation already provides for the availability of those reports to other interested parties.  With the establishment of an Irish Takeover Panel, it is considered appropriate that they equally should be specified as a party to whom access to the reports should be made available.  Section 21 provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>In a number of provisions, reference is made to prescribed matters.  Prescribed means prescribed by the Minister by regulation.  Section 22 deals with the manner in which such regulations are made.  In certain instances it will be sufficient for <Col N="1695" /> the Minister to lay the regulations before the House.  However, in three instances &mdash; those in section 1 where the Minister, within the definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo;, proposes to alter the threshold at which mandatory offers must be made; section 2 (1) (c) where the Minister proposes to extend the companies to which the panel's remit applies; and section 7 (3), where the Minister proposes to change the scheduled principles &mdash; it is provided that the Minister's draft regulations must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas by way of a resolution.  The other circumstances where the Minister would exercise his power to make regulations would involve the prescription of a recognised stock exchange.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is a reasonably standard provision included in legislation where reference is made to a particular body and it simply provides that any document sealed with the seal of the panel will be accepted by a court in evidence unless proof to the contrary is shown.  One of the central features of the activities of the Irish Takeover Panel will be the issuing of notices, directions and other rulings to parties involved in a takeover.</P>
    <P>Section 24 makes provision as to the manner in which the information is to be conveyed.  It also provides that in the case of a company registered under the Companies Acts, the registered office will be the residence of the company.  Two sections of the Bill, section 11 (5) and section 17 (3), provide for an offence.  Section 25 provides for penalties in respect of persons found guilty of an offence under those sections.  It also provides that in the case of offences under section 11 (5) and section 17 (3) the proceedings may be prosecuted by the panel.  In addition, the time limit within which proceedings can be brought is two years.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is also a standard provision that ensures that any expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill will be met out of general funds.  As mentioned in relation to section 16, it is not proposed that the Minister or Central Government funds will be involved in providing any funding to the activities of the Irish Takeover Panel.  Section 27 contains the short title as well as the manner in which the Bill can be commenced.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill contains the principles which will be applicable to the conduct of takeovers. Essentially, the principles are a general expression of the matters that will govern the activities and rules of the panel in ensuring that all takeovers are operated in a fair and reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>That concludes my outline of the Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit agus roimh an Bhille.  This Bill replaces legislation that is almost 200 years old.  That legislation stood the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> I wonder why we had to make the Irish Takeover Panel a statutory body.  The Minister of State said that because of the stature of the London market, parties involved in takeovers there would generally respect its directions or rulings. That is an indictment of Irish business people and they are not deserving of it.  There has been too much castigation and ridicule of business people. They are the employers who keep the wheels of industry and our country moving.  After all, if they have acted without a statutory body for almost 200 years there is no reason to create a statutory body now.  However, the Minister of State and his advisers might have good reason to think otherwise and I do not dispute that.  Nevertheless, it is a pity.</P>
    <P>Section 6 refers to the composition of the panel and names the Law Society of Ireland, the Irish Association of Investment Managers, the Irish Bankers Federation and the Irish Stock Exchange as nominating bodies.  The panel will also include the Governor of the Central Bank.  When takeovers occur it is important to protect these groups and the shareholders.  However, another group of people who often are not protected are the workers, and there is nothing in this Bill to protect them.  They emerge badly from many mergers and takeovers, particularly workers who are starting their careers and have been less than five years with a company.  When the company is taken over they are simply thrown out.  That is sad and there is nothing in this Bill to protect them.  There should be such a provision.</P>
    <P>When one speaks of mergers and takeovers one must bear in mind everything that is taken over.  That includes workers and their products. Often mergers occur because there is a duplication of products and, in order to sew up the market, fewer workers are required to do the job. &ldquo;Restructuring&rdquo; is the modern term for that practice. In every restructuring human beings are disposable fodder.  This Bill should provide protection for workers.  Perhaps it is not in the remit of the Bill but if possible I would like to see such protection included.  It is an important issue. Every person who loses a job represents a family out of work, because it is often the breadwinner who is let go and put on the live register.  A survery of the long-term unemployed would probably show that many of them became unemployed as a result of restructuring and takeovers.  Perhaps the Minister of State would look at the human aspect of takeovers.  It is most important.</P>
    <P>We appear to be giving a great deal of power to the Central Bank in this legislation.  Ministers and Governments have had on a number of occasions to put extraordinary pressure on the Central Bank to lower interest rates when that institution was keeping rates higher than they should have been.  In this Bill we are giving the Central Bank even more power.  The Governor of the Central Bank will nominate the chairman and vice-chairman.  The workings of the panel will be controlled by &ldquo;big daddy&rdquo; in the Central Bank.  Is that wise?  We have had experience of <Col N="1697" /> the Central Bank keeping interest rates high and working for its own best interest.  The chairman and vice-chairman should be appointed by a vote of the people who are nominated to the panel. Workers should also be able to nominate a member of that body because, without them, there is nothing.  The chairman of the panel should be democratically elected from the body and not appointed by the Central Bank because we are giving too much power to the Central Bank in its dealings with business.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>As a protection for parties subject to the sanction imposed by the panel, such parties will be empowered to apply to the court, and the court, following a hearing on the matter, can either confirm the decision of the panel or annul the decision and make certain orders.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we are giving too much power to the courts because we are leaving it up to one man to make a decision which must be accepted. There was a time when An Bord Pleanála made decisions regarding planning but people are now challenging those decisions in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  Such challenges cost my county £1.5 million &mdash; the county won in three cases but lost in the fourth.  One wonders whether judges are experts in these matters.  If we set up a panel then its decisions should be sacrosanct.</P>
    <P>I once attended a planning meeting at which three legal advisers were present.  Their advice was that although the proposed planning was within the law so many objections could be raised leading to such a prolonged legal process, that it would make it uneconomic for the developer to continue with the work.  This is what happens when we give too much power to the courts. When the Minister sets up this panel it should be given sufficient power so that its decisions will be beyond legal challenge.  In the words of John Wilson it should not become &ldquo;a barrister-fattening exercise&rdquo; and we are not bad at that in this country. There needs to be some controls because the companies being taken over, and their shareholders, will have to pay the costs.  When a case goes into the legal machine it can take many unexpected turns.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary and I welcome it. However, I regret that we will have yet another inspectorate because we are overrun with inspectors. We had a great country in the 1960s when there were far less regulations, statutory instruments, legal jargon and interference.  I wish the Bill well and I know that the Minister has received the best advice but, from a layman's point of view, I would appeal to him to put the powers of the panel beyond the courts.  If someone is determined enough and has sufficient money, they can make it uneconomic for a takeover to go ahead.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see workers involved as they are inconvenienced the most by takeovers. <Col N="1698" /> When companies close, workers' lives are changed and the same can happen when there is a takeover.</P>
    <P>We also need to introduce legislation to deal with people such as Tony Taylor.  In such cases, innocent people think they are getting a very good deal but they lose their life savings.  We seem to have no control over financial concerns which advertise very attractive interest rates in off-shore accounts, advising people on how to evade if not avoid tax and so on.  At a time when so many people are receiving redundancy lump sums it is important that they do not lose that money to smooth talking whiz kids and their bad investments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for whom I have great respect.  While I am not too familiar with the details of the Bill, on my initial reading of it I wondered how necessary it is.  I was disappointed to think that the financial institutions had neither sufficient ability or confidence to manage their affairs without the need for legislation to give effect to their decisions.  That is a poor reflection on these institutions and I am disappointed that such a supposedly competent group should have to run to the Minister to introduce this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the working group was established to oversee the separation of the Irish and London Stock Exchanges.  He said that it was the majority view that there may not be the same respect for the rules and rulings given as compared with the London panel.  I agree with Senator Farrell that it is disappointing that this mentality is emerging from those in positions of financial power.  These gentlemen &mdash; there are very few women directly involved at senior level in these areas &mdash; had to run to the Minister and, as a result, we have a Bill before us.  I believe that most sections of this Bill should be, and could be, applied by a voluntary group set up to monitor and control takeovers.</P>
      <P>We have a great deal of legislation, much of it gathering dust on the shelves.  We have companies' legislation, amendments to various companies Acts, we have monopolies and takeover legislation and all the existing legislation combined, together with a voluntary body, could keep the situation under control.  I would be interested to hear the Minister elaborate further on what is the real necessity for this Bill.  Reading through it, one has to ask why it is not possible to let them get on with the job, taking responsibility and control for themselves.</P>
      <P>Here we have the mentality of State dependency creeping into the higher financial echelons, which is a poor reflection on them.  I welcome the appointment of the chairperson designate, a Clare man, Mr. Dan O'Keeffe SC.  He might apply a little common sense and normality.  I congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other feature of the Bill which interests me is the Minister's power to interfere, change, amend or prevent anything on this panel.  The <Col N="1699" /> level of ministerial involvement, or possible involvement, is extraordinary and I question the necessity of this.  The bottom line is that if London can do it, so should we.  It is time we matured and took responsibility for ourselves.  The panel will, I gather, be self-financing and I would like the Minister to elaborate on how it will secure that finance.  Will it be securing fees from various takeover activities?  I am delighted an annual report will be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas and I hope it will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for consideration within at least six months of the previous year.</P>
    <P>I am very curious about section 6 of the Bill and the membership of the panel which is drawn from the Consultative Committee of the Accountancy Bodies &mdash; Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Irish Association of Investment Managers, the Irish Bankers' Federation and the Irish Stock Exchange.  We are told that the membership of the panel is representative of the various interests in the Irish financial markets.  This is a gross misstatement.  These are bodies that are, in the main, administrative, bodies which provide services to shareholders and who actually do a job at the behest of shareholders.  In a sense, they have their own cliquish, vested, concentrated interest.  The ordinary shareholder, be they from Longford, Leitrim or Roscommon is not represented. A person such as Senator Quinn who creates movement on the ground as far as employment and financial turnover are concerned, is not really representative.  Where is the ordinary shareholder who knows about basic, normal business activity on a daily or annual basis and who is not involved in these very selective, administrative groups?  There is a real need to have somebody who does not come from specific areas of expertise on this panel.  The ordinary man or woman is not represented.  This is a very exclusive representation.</P>
    <P>Financing this country is not exclusively the domain of these bodies.  The realities are that finance is out there and people are working hard, taking chances and making investments.  These are the people who really know how things happen and are in a position to get involved in takeovers, etc.  Let us give them a voice on this panel. I hope that on Committee Stage, the Minister will give that serious consideration.  He may ask how it is possible to choose an ordinary shareholder but knowing Minister Rabbitte's ability, I am sure he will be able to devise ways and means through which an ordinary businessperson or shareholder can become a representative on this panel.</P>
    <P>As I stated initially, the Minister seems to have extraordinary powers under this Bill.  There is an unacceptable level of ministerial involvement in something which, in my view, should be privately controlled.  The reality is that existing legislation could be applied by the Minister under his portfolio for consumer affairs with particular responsibility for the application of company law and restrictions in relation to competition.  Given <Col N="1700" /> that this Bill is coming from Minister Rabbitte, for whom I have great respect, I can only suppose there is good reason for it and that there must be a clear thought process behind it.  I cannot see that myself and I fail to understand it, but I hope the Minister will be in a position to elaborate in more detail at the conclusion of this debate.</P>
    <P>The Bill is primarily concerned with technicalities and controls, with the admonition and censure of people.  We already have legislation for this which may be difficult to apply because, as we have seen repeatedly, you can legislate as much as you like but there are always ways of getting around the legislation.  While I am sure the Bill is necessary, I have reservations about it. It is a poor reflection on our financial institutions that they had to run to the Minister to get a Bill to control their own affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I will support its passage through the House.  I thank the Minister for his explanation.</P>
      <P>I had an experience 18 months ago which had a great impact on me.  I was in America and I was in the company of senior business executive investors.  One of the gentlemen, on hearing I was from Ireland, spoke very enthusiastically and highly about a holiday he had here and about what a wonderful country it was.  As I glowed in the praise, he then turned to the other investors and said that he was on the board of a number of companies and that he had made it a definite policy never to allow any company of which he was a board member to invest in Irish business again. I was jolted and I reacted immediately.  He told me that he had been involved in a business in Ireland which, after a number of successful years, he and his colleagues felt obliged to close down. He said that the laws, the traditions and the outlook of Ireland to anybody who had to close a factory down after a number of years was so intrusive, and made it so difficult, that he decided he was not going to allow any company with which he was involved to invest here again.  He was not talking merely about the laws but about the nation as a whole, the trade unions, the senior civil servants, State agencies and we as citizens. To a certain extent, whenever I look at a Bill coming through now, I try to keep a watching brief on behalf of those whom we do not ever want to deter from investing in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make three points about the Bill.  First is the issue of whether our takeover panel should be voluntary, something Senator Farrell and Senator Taylor-Quinn have spoken about.  Should it be voluntary, as in Britain, or statutory as in the rest of the European Union and as proposed in the Bill? As a general rule, I favour the voluntary route. In many business activities, the most efficient and cost effective form of regulation is self-regulation. I am not happy about the general trend in the European Union towards regulation by directive rather than by voluntary means.  In many cases, this produces a cumbersome mechanism which is <Col N="1701" /> not nearly as effective, and is much more expensive than a voluntary form of regulation.</P>
    <P>However, I agree with the Minister in this case. Voluntary regulation is not appropriate in all cases.  I believe in a pragmatic approach where each case is examined to find what is most appropriate to it.  That should determine what is put in place rather than any prejudices or ideology.  This Bill is a case in point.  Even as a believer in voluntary regulation, I am persuaded by the Minister's case that the statutory route is the proper one in this case.</P>
    <P>There are two reasons for that.  The first has to do with reasons of clout and Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Farrell spoke about this.  It is not a coincidence that the arrangement in London is voluntary because the city is such a tightly knit fraternity that a voluntary body can grow its own teeth.  The takeover panel in London has real power because it can effectively stop people doing business where, and if, they transgress. However, no voluntary body could have that clout.  Companies or individual operators could flout its recommendations with impunity if there were no teeth to ensure compliance with them.</P>
    <P>The second reason the statutory route is right is more important and concerns the issue of international credibility.  When all is said and done, London is a tiny market in financial terms.  From the outside, it looks small, cosy and eminently capable of being manipulated by cowboys acting inside the fence.  I do not bet but I am told that many British punters will not bet on Irish races because they feel they are on the outside of a market which is tightly controlled by relatively few people.  I am sure that is not true but the perception is there.  I asked why, when race meetings are announced, Irish ones are seldom included except for the big ones and that was the reason given.  We must face that in the context of the Stock Exchange where we are trying to interest people from outside in our local stock market. Credibility is the key issue and, when it comes to takeovers, only a statutory takeover panel can deliver the necessary credibility to outside investors. Even with that, it will still be an uphill battle. I applaud the thinking behind this Bill.  The issue of how we appear to the outside world has been very much in the minds of those who drew up this Bill.  That is good and I wish the same approach was applied in the case of our food industry, a matter I will address later on the Adjournment. It does not apply to all legislation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the cost of the mechanism we are creating.  It will not involve any cost to the Exchequer, but that is not the only consideration. I have noticed that the Department of Finance tends to have a schizophrenic approach to costs.  If the Exchequer is involved, all its scrooge instincts emerge and that is no bad thing because we are talking about our money. However, so long as the State does not pay for it, the Department seems to have no problem loading <Col N="1702" /> enormous costs onto other people, regardless of their ability to pay.  There is a vagueness in this Bill about how exactly the cost of the operation will be levied.  I would welcome clarification on this from the Minister but perhaps that may not be easy to do at this stage.  Maintaining a quotation on the Stock Exchange is an expensive operation, especially for small or medium-sized companies.  We must be careful not to thoughtlessly add to the burden without giving the matter full and careful attention.  I feel strongly about this because we tend in many cases to adopt the attitude that if we are not paying for it ourselves, it does not matter how we load the costs onto someone else.</P>
    <P>The Bill as presented to us imposes a time limit on the presentation and publication of the takeover panel's annual report.  I applaud that as the person who, in the four years I have been a Member of this House, has been pushing for this in regard to all State bodies.  However, I was a little concerned to see that this provision had to be added on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  Could we not send a signal to the parliamentary draughtsman that, from here on, whenever an annual report is mentioned or the word appears there must be, as a matter of routine, a time limit on its presentation?  The principle, I am glad to say, has now been fully accepted but we should not have to repeatedly fight for it.  For the first few years, I tabled an amendment on this to every Bill which came to this House and I am delighted to see that it has been recently included in Bills.  It happened on this occasion in the Dáil so we cannot take credit for it this time.</P>
    <P>I now move to a broader issue.  In the discussion on this Bill before it reached this House, much was made about the small size of the Dublin stock market and the desirability of increasing that size in the interests of improving the credibility of Dublin as a financial marketplace.  From the point of view of our economy, there are two main benefits which a stock market can deliver. The first is that we can provide a mechanism by which some companies can raise capital, either for start up or expansion.  The second is that a stock market can provide an opportunity for investors to put money to work in the Irish economy rather than investing abroad.  This is a major need in view of the enormous size of the pension funds which operate in this country.  The future of everyone who works, with the exception of civil servants, depends crucially on stock exchange investments.  The vast majority of our pension funds depend on stock exchange investments.  If the money cannot be properly invested in this country it goes abroad.  On the one hand, plenty of companies are looking for capital and plenty of investment funds are looking for a place to invest their money and, on the other hand, we have only a tiny stock market.</P>
    <P>There are two reasons this is so.  First, there is an artificial constraint on State-owned companies <Col N="1703" /> raising money in the most appropriate place.  I have no ideological commitment to privatisation and see no essential benefits in it <i>per se.</i>  For me, two things are paramount and neither is necessarily linked with ownership.  One is whether the company is operating in a competitive market rather than in a monopoly.  I have found my membership of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies of huge interest in recent years as the enormous benefit of competition has been discovered.  Even in State companies, competition is beneficial to the customer, the nation and the company itself because it makes it work harder.</P>
    <P>The second reason is whether the company can get the new capital its business requires.  A number of successful State companies have, by the nature of their business, a continuing need to consume large amounts of new capital.  The State is no longer in the position, if it ever was, to provide that sort of money and the reality is that there are many investors who are only too willing to put that new capital into those companies&mdash; Telecom Éireann, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and perhaps even the ESB.  However, what is holding up this process is the dog in the manger attitude of some people who believe we must hang on to total State ownership under any circumstances. They acknowledge that the State is not prepared to invest properly in the business, yet they will not let other people do it.</P>
    <P>The recent alliance announced by Telecom Éireann is a halfway house which undersells the real potential of that company.  Aer Rianta, which is a good example, has major opportunities abroad and it is not the State's business to get involved in funding them.  Why should it?  Aer Lingus, like all airlines, is going to need a constant flow of new capital in the future.  The ESB, similarly, has massive future investment needs which could be funded commercially.  The companies I am talking about are industrial giants and their presence on the Irish Stock Exchange would transform it overnight.</P>
    <P>Holding back those State companies from the Irish Stock Exchange is one reason for its stunted growth.  The other is that private companies often find that going public is a proposition which is not very attractive, and I can talk about that with some knowledge.  There are many reasons that a company might choose to remain private, but let me focus on just two issues.  First, private companies, especially if they are family-owned, tend to take a long-term view.  They want to stay in business for the long haul and, as a result, they often consider doing things which will not pay off for a very long time.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the story I told earlier, I was impressed recently by the visit to my company of representatives of an American company.  We spent a day with them and it was very interesting. Where our people were interested in what the <Col N="1704" /> customer wanted and long-term interests, this company, which does not have any investments here, was clearly more interested in the short term, day-to-day stock market quotation and they were not taking a long-term view.  They even made a number of telephone calls during the day to inquire about their stock market quotation.</P>
    <P>A private company has the freedom to forego profit in the short term because it considers that enhances its long-term future.  Assuming that the company can pay its way, there is no overriding pressure to maximise profits week in, week out. It need not look for this week's gain.  When such a company thinks about going public in Ireland, Britain or, more so, in America, it gets a very rude shock.  The first thing it must do is throw the long-term out the window because its new investors from the stock markets will want to know the short-term results.  In the US they want to know the quarterly results.  All they are interested in there is in the current quarterly results and there is now demand for the monthly results of many companies.  They are only interested in the long-term to the extent that it does not compromise today's earnings and the reality is that investing for the long-term always compromises today's earnings.</P>
    <P>I am trying to explain why some companies which would join the stock market are tempted not to do so because it forces them to take a short term rather than long-term view, and the long-term view must be in the best interest of those people to whom Senator Farrell referred, the workers in the organisation, as well as the investors and customers.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the customer.  The second shock private companies get is that all of a sudden their customers become less important. Private companies survive and thrive by serving their customers' needs.  Suddenly, overnight, they are told when they go public that customers must take second place to the shareholders' interests, who are usually big investors, pension funds and others.  This, of course, is very bad business indeed.  In the long-term, what is in the customers' interest is also in the shareholders' interest; but that is in the long-term and in a market dominated by short term considerations, their interests tend to diverge.  Small wonder that many private companies which do not have a pressing need to raise large amounts of capital prefer to stay away from the stock market, but it does not have to be that way.  Stock markets are not necessarily short term in their focus; it just happens to be the culture of which the stock exchanges in Ireland, Britain and America are a part.  In the Far East, and particularly in Japan, a totally different culture exists.  On a visit to Japan a couple of years ago I was most impressed by the long-term view of Japanese companies in regard to investments, looking after their workers and such things as redundancies, which they avoided at almost any cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> What I am saying is this.  If we want the Irish Stock Exchange to grow &mdash; and it is in the interest of the economy that it does &mdash; then things must change, and the Minister will be delighted to know that I am not asking the Government to change something as I am not saying that this is in the hands of the Government.  First, we, as a nation, need to change our attitude to public investment in State companies.  That is, to a large extent, in the hands of the Government.  This need not necessarily involve total privatisation; but it does involve creating a market in the shares of successful State companies, some of which I have just discussed.</P>
    <P>Second, investing funds need to change their attitude to the long-term.  They need to recognise that what is in the interest of a company's customers is ultimately also in the best interest of the company's shareholders.  That shift in culture would be considerable, but I choose to believe it is not impossible because I have seen it happen elsewhere.  After all, most big investors in business are in for the long-term too.  They are in the business of providing pensions well into the future, 30, 40 or 50 years hence in many cases.  If we can persuade them to take the long-term view, we could greatly stimulate the economy through the medium of stock exchange investment.  I welcome this Bill because I think it is taking steps in that direction and I use this opportunity to try to remind not just the Minister and the Government but the nation that we can take other steps also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn mentioned words like confidence and trust in the course of his contribution. This Bill is designed with that in mind and I welcome it.  When we are dealing with people's shares and money we must be very careful. We know what has happened in the past when some &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; managed to get their hands on these things and left people in difficulty.</P>
      <P>I welcome the way the Minister addressed the House at length, using quite a lot of technical language which many people would not understand, but that is necessary in a situation where one is dealing with such complex matters.  The idea behind the Bill is to protect the shareholders in situations where takeovers or other relevant transactions, such as the substantial acquisition of securities, are contemplated and/or put into effect and to provide support and credibility for the Irish financial markets following the separation of the Irish Stock Exchange from London.  Following the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, which was promoted by the Minister for Finance, the Irish Stock Exchange, Dublin, which at the time formed part of the one in London, stands alone. Since then, and until this Bill is enacted, the take-over code and rules of the Takeover Panel, London, continue to apply.  It is as if the exchange was in Dublin but part of it still in London, so it is important that this Bill be enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> I want to make a few further points about the Bill and one of them relates to section 22.  I am glad to see that regulations will not be rushed through by the Minister and put into effect and that they must be referred back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I welcome that because the matter can be discussed openly.</P>
    <P>I have just one query for the Minister.  Section 8(5) requires the panel to submit its proposals and rules dealing with substantial acquisitions and in concert parties to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for prior approval. Will the Minister of State clarify whether subsequent amendments to the initial rules on these topic would require prior ministerial approval?</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary, although much of its contents is above our heads.  I was glad to hear the comments made by Members, especially Senator Quinn, who is involved in business and the Stock Exchange.  We need the trust and confidence of the people so that they and foreigners will be encouraged to invest in Irish companies and in the Irish market.  Our Stock Exchange and panel must be strictly dealt with by legislation because we are dealing with money, securities and savings. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members who contributed to the debate.  I would like to clear up a misunderstanding in relation to the scope of the legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is not to adjudicate on the merits or demerits or the financial or commercial advantages of the particular takeover.  It does not pass any judgment on that.  Some Members may have felt it has a role in that regard, but it is purely to protect and ensure that principles of equity and fairness are applied to the interests of shareholders. It does not deal with the question of advantages or disadvantages.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell began by querying whether it was necessary to establish the takeover panel on a statutory basis and a number of other Members, including Senator Taylor-Quinn, asked if it was necessary at all.  The short answer is that it is necessary because of the separation of the Dublin Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. Senator Quinn touched on the fact that the status of the City of London as a financial centre is such because its credibility has been established over hundreds of years.  Members may have views on Britain's place in the world in 1997 compared to 1947 or 1927, but that does not necessarily apply to the City of London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Quinn pointed out, rulings or directions of the panel in the City of London carry clout and the cost of disobeying or circumventing them would be such that it would not be one which any reputable financial interest would be prepared to pay.  By comparison, the Irish Stock market is small and does not have anything like the critical mass of the City of London and would <Col N="1707" /> not automatically have its credibility.  If parties sought to circumvent, ignore or abuse rulings or directions of the panel, a different situation would obtain.  I assure Senator Farrell that it was not the intention of the Bill to reflect on the competence of Irish business or businessmen to arrange their affairs.  It is merely a fact of history, size and financial reputation to say that it would not be an analogous situation with that of London.  As Senator Quinn said, we seek credibility &mdash; the reason for putting this on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>These conclusions respond to the demands of the industry.  The industry carefully considered these questions.  I agree with Senators who said there are merits in a voluntary mechanism. However, it is generally felt it is necessary to put this on a statutory basis for the reasons I outlined. We should not create an image of a takeover panel permanently in session.  Having spoken about the importance of a panel, it is not envisaged that it would be preoccupied with constant takeovers because that situation does not obtain in Ireland; but on the occasions it does, I agree it would be important.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Quinn's concerns about costs &mdash; albeit in this case they would not be imposed on the Exchequer but on the companies or transactions concerned &mdash; the way levies and charges will be made is probably unfounded or exaggerated in that the cost of the panel would be minimal.  We are talking about a stipend or honorarium for the directors, which will be of no great consequence, and perhaps a secretary general and a secretary.  Transactions will look after themselves.  It is not intended to levy charges other than in direct proportion to need.  Arguably, there might be a particular year in which there is a fair amount of activity, but in another year, such a situation might not arise.  I do not believe this will be too much of an imposition.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be dragged down the road Senator Farrell wished to bring me in relation to the Tony Taylors of this world.  Other legislation applies to that, although one could reasonably say it did not work in the case he instanced.  There is the Investment Intermediaries Act passed by the House of the Oireachtas in 1995 and subsequently invoked.  If somebody is determined to subvert an Act there is not much one can do about it.  We should not mislead people into believing that it is possible to legislate to the nth degree so that somebody determined to circumvent the law will not find a way to do so.  We can legislate to prudentially supervise the activities of such people and require them to conform to certain standards but beyond that it is difficult.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell was concerned with the power being given to the Central Bank.  I do not believe that is entirely fair in that the only power being given to it is the appointment of the chairman or deputy chairman of the panel.  Omitting the question of whether he is from County Clare and <Col N="1708" /> whether that is a good thing, it is not an extensive power.  It is desirable that one goes outside the family of interests to which Senator Taylor-Quinn referred and which is, admittedly, a fairly exclusive club.  It is probably a good idea to appoint an outside person rather than nominating a chairman themselves.</P>
    <P>I accept Senator Farrell's point about the possible impact of takeovers on workers in the company. However, notwithstanding the complexity of this Bill, I point to its relatively narrow scope. There is legislation to deal with the protection of workers' interests in that situation; Senator Quinn might say there is too much legislation dealing with it.  There are also European instruments, such as the transfer of undertakings and so on, which provide for that area.  One of the effects of a take-over may be downsizing &mdash; to use modern jargon&mdash;or restructuring.  However, there is legislation to deal with that.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn mentioned how American businessmen praise Ireland and what it has to offer, but then he pointed to his own reluctance to invest here because of the plethora of law surrounding a closure or this country's traditions. That view has been represented to me.  Sometimes I wonder if that view has not as much to do with the brouhaha created in this relatively small society when there is a major closure as it has with the perception that we have excessive law. The business of disemploying workers in Japan, for example, is not permitted by its culture &mdash; I do not know about its law.  It is inescapably more difficult in the Netherlands or the Scandinavian countries than it is here, although I know that does not compare with the United States.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Farrell that the protection of workers is also a valuable consideration.  Last night I dealt with the type of case to which Senator Quinn referred when I received a deputation from Deputy Bell and his trade union colleagues relating to Coca Cola.  It is not a closure but a serious downsizing by a major international player.  Perhaps Senator Quinn knows where it ranks in the world, but I think it is near the top. It employs 335 people in Drogheda and they have well paid secure jobs.  However, it now proposes to make 108 people redundant.  This, in addition to other problems which have arisen in Drogheda, is a serious blow to the town.  It may be conceded by people involved that the company sees itself as having been obstructed by a section of the workforce from doing certain things which it believes are necessary.  If these redundancies go ahead, it will be a huge blow to the economy of this small town.  A company which has done well in Ireland and made considerable profits from a good workforce has an obligation to the town.</P>
    <P>It is good that we have, both by tradition and law, an ability to intervene with a major player to sort out the arguments as to why it should, as I hope it will, change its mind.  Without that tradition, <Col N="1709" /> it would be difficult to do that.  That is not to say we should not exert influence on the industrial relations situation there as well, but the loss of 108 jobs is a big price to pay.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Quinn's point about it being voluntary, he drew his own conclusions as to why this is underpinned by statute and why that is desirable.  As regards section 8(5), Senator Calnan asked if subsequent amendments will require prior ministerial approval.  The answer is yes.  One Senator asked if too much power is vested in the Minister and if the Minister's role is too intrusive in this situation.  I do not think that is the case.  The Bill states that it is only if the ground rules are changed that the Minister must be brought in.  That is only consistent with where we started out from.  The Minister will not use the powers of the Bill to intrude into the affairs of the panel and how it does its business.  However, it may find that after a year or two of its operation, it may want to make changes.  It would then be proper to revert to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn gave an interesting dissertation on the role of the stock market in Ireland.  While it is not strictly the purpose of this Bill, he is right to air his views.  He used this opportunity to comment on the role the Irish Stock Exchange might play in other circumstances if it was not constrained by size and our cultural attitude to whether some of the major State companies should be quoted.  The arguments he set out about the Stock Exchange being the mechanism to raise capital for the expansion of companies in this economy are incontrovertible.  I accept that no one would make the argument that the Stock Exchange is contributing as much as it might.  I also accept that it can be a mechanism for investment in the domestic indigenous economy, rather than placing moneys outside the jurisdiction because of a lack of opportunity in many cases.  I was interested to hear his view that our traditional culture has obstructed the growth of the Stock Exchange and that once a company is a significant player on the Stock Exchange, it is only interested in long term planning as long as it does not sacrifice short term dividends.  That is probably true.  There is evidence that there is now a more pragmatic assessment of these questions than in the past.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to Telecom Éireann's strategic alliance which, most people agree, is a step in the right direction.  More than that, however, it is a necessary step if Telecom is to compete in the global market.  In my personal opinion &mdash; I am not speaking on behalf of the Government &mdash; I would draw á distinction between this matter as it relates to a food or insurance company and an energy company such as the ESB.  If one considers the experience in Britain, there is a significant issue of public policy to be considered in terms of privatising strategic utilities, particularly where the public good could arguably suffer.  For example, the process to privatise <Col N="1710" /> water in Britain was not very satisfactory.  If the general experience during the past 15 years in Britain is considered, senior executives and management used the privatisation process for self aggrandisement rather than strategic considerations and it has not been a happy experiment. Ireland has taken a slower approach but there is some merit in doing so.</P>
    <P>I am considering a small number of amendments to the Bill which do not alter the scope of the measure but are seen as necessary to give effect to its provisions.  The first is an expansion to the definition of the terms &ldquo;offerer&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeree&rdquo; to ensure that the provisions of the Bill relating to the regulation of these parties, at certain stages prior to the making of an offer, can have proper effect.  The present layout of the text at section 16(1)(d) leads to a certain confusion that it may relate to rules which it does not.  The section is concerned with the powers of the panel to raise charges to finance itself.  A simple revision to the format of the text is seen as resolving this problem.  I am also considering a revision to section 20 which provides for the indemnification by the panel of its officers, directors, etc., to remove the doubts expressed by panel in respect of the provision of this indemnification in a certain specific situation.</P>
    <P>I merely wanted to bring these revisions to the attention of the House.  In normal circumstances I would be glad to avail of any disposition on the part of the House to allow me to conclude the Bill today because it must be dealt with as quickly as possible.  However, until the precise text of the amendments becomes available, I cannot proceed further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with grave concern:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the latest contamination of 6 workers at the BNFL Nuclear Processing Plant at Sellafield;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the consistent number of reports which continue to question the safety of a new nuclear dump built by Nirex Ltd. at Sellafield; and continues to call on the Government to lobby the British Government to have Sellafield closed down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="1711" /> thank the Seanad for once again focusing attention on the environmental risks to Ireland arising from the activities of the nuclear industry, particularly Sellafield.  As the Seanad will be aware, I am meeting with the UK Ambassador, Ms Veronica Sutherland, in my office tomorrow to discuss all aspects of the UK nuclear industry.  Needless to say, the two topics highlighted in the Seanad's motion will be at the top of the agenda.</P>
      <P>First, let me turn to the recent nuclear incidents at the Sellafield complex.  The Seanad may be aware that on Sunday, 2 February 1997, an incident occurred at the Magnox reprocessing plant at Sellafield in which six workers were contaminated. Initial tests indicate that they were found to have suffered minor personal contamination. The extent of contamination in the vicinity of the work area has yet to be determined and the UK nuclear installations inspectorate are investigating the matter.</P>
      <P>However, within the space of 24 hours there was a further incident at the Sellafield complex. Initial reports suggest that elevated levels of activity were detected in a storm water collection tank on the night of 3 February 1997.  The radioactivity has been traced to a spillage of active liquid resulting in contamination of a roadway, gutters and building environments.  BNFL have taken measures to prevent any further spread of contamination and have segregated the affected area pending cleaning operations.</P>
      <P>Based on the information available to date, the RPII has said that neither incident is of radiological safety significance to Ireland.  I have instructed my Department officials and the RPII to seek full details on both of the incidents.</P>
      <P>BNFL's comment that these incidents are an &ldquo;unfortunate coincidence&rdquo; suggest they are oblivious to the fact that such incidents further undermine public confidence in the safe management and operation of the nuclear facilities at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the matter of Nirex.  In January 1996, at a public planning inquiry in Cumbria, I set out the Irish Government's objections to the underground laboratory at Sellafield currently being proposed by Nirex.  I will set out briefly the major points made during the Irish Government's submission to the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We contended there had been an absence of a fully open and transparent site selection process with independent review.  The refusal by Nirex to release full information on alternative site options and processes militated against an effective assessment of potential environmental impact, which would make it impossible to understand the environmental basis on which the choice of location or project was made.  We considered that the environmental statement submitted by Nirex should have addressed all repository options and alternative disposal processes. We believed the case being made by Nirex <Col N="1712" /> for Sellafield as the site for a dump was advanced, not primarily on safety considerations, but on cost and transport advantages and on the assumption that the local community in Cumbria might be more receptive to such a facility.  These core arguments made at the inquiry still stand.</P>
    <P>The UK nuclear industry has been operating for many decades.  All the benefits of the electricity production and industrial activity which derive from it have accrued to the UK.  At the same time the threat of hazard from UK nuclear reactors and waste inventories affects neighbouring countries who do not share these benefits.  We therefore have the absolute right to insist that the UK bear the cost of keeping this hazardous waste totally contained and isolated from our shared environment.  Insistence on this approach is not an excessive, irrational aspiration but a reasonable and technically feasible requirement that can be achieved with current engineering technology. To realise this, the repository must be an actively managed storage facility with continuous assessment, inspection and retrieveability on an indefinite basis.</P>
    <P>There has been a spate of media publicity relating to information which has emerged concerning the scientific and economic arguments about this project.  I welcome the debate which this has engendered and regard it as playing a positive role in furthering opposition to the proposal. First, there was the leaked memorandum by UK Nirex's director of science, which exposed Nirex's considerable doubts about the project's scientific basis.  The real value and significance of this memo to us is the clear picture it gives of grave doubts and lack of confident professionalism at the heart of Nirex's scientific division.  The memorandum suggests that the scientific division of Nirex have deep uncertainty about being able to make and sustain a scientific case in support of the safety case for a repository on the Sellafield site.</P>
    <P>Second, two reports concerning problems facing a radioactive waste disposal facility at Sellafield&mdash;one edited by R.S. Haszeldine and D.K. Smythe and the other by Gordon MacKerron and Mike Sadmicki of Sussex University&mdash;suggest that there is insufficient convincing evidence that a safety case could be made which would justify development of an RCF at Sellafield.  Over the weekend, there was further media coverage which referred to two in a series of more than 40 reports provided by Nirex to the UK Environment Agency, formerly Her Majesty's Inspector of Pollution.  These reports have heightened further the perception of serious scientific and economic pitfalls associated with pressing ahead with this rock laboratory.</P>
    <P>Taking all of this into account and given the prospect of a decision by Secretary of State John Gummer, I wrote to him this week reiterating Ireland's strenuous objections to the Nirex proposals and highlighting the fact that there has <Col N="1713" /> been an absence of a fully open and transparent site selection process with independent review.  I indicated that this made it impossible to understand the environmental basis on which the choice of location for the project, so near to the Irish Sea, was made.  I called for the plan to be abandoned and maintained that more research should be undertaken into alternative sites and disposal options which would avoid an environmental threat to the Irish Sea.  I urged him to refuse Nirex's appeal or at the very least to reopen the inquiry so that the many scientific and geological factors which have come to light could be properly assessed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to tell the Seanad that I was informed yesterday that the UK Government has now decided to engage in a public consultation process about a whole series of additional information which has come to light in the recent past about the Nirex proposal and is effectively reopening the inquiry.  My Department will be included in this consultation process.  As I understand it, the results of this new consultation will eventually be considered by the UK Secretary of State for the Environment when he adjudicates on the Nirex appeal.  Accordingly, my Department will now examine this new area of consultation and elaborate as necessary on our strenuous opposition to the Nirex proposal because of the environmental risk which it represents.</P>
    <P>I have previously made firm commitments about the Government's determination to prevent this dump being located at the Sellafield site.  I think any objective observer would agree that the Government has done all in its power to vigorously press our case and to influence decision making by the UK authorities.  My own appearance at the public inquiry and the forceful arguments put to the inquiry on Ireland's behalf is a measure of that steadfast approach.  We will not shrink from pursuing the case further if the rock characterisation facility is approved, drawing upon the best scientific and legal advice to advance our case.  In conclusion, I pay tribute to the Seanad for once again displaying cross party solidarity on this important subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House and the other parties for agreeing to my all-party motion on this important issue.</P>
      <P>I have always believed this is a national issue above party politics.  The passing of today's motion will strengthen the hand of the Minister and the Government in their fight against this proposed site at Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that, since this motion was tabled, the Minister has been informed by his opposite number in Britain, Mr. John Gummer, that the British Government has done a U-turn by deciding to reopen the public inquiry on the Nirex proposal.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister sought and obtained a meeting with the <Col N="1714" /> British Ambassador.  Today's motion will demonstrate to her how strongly everyone feels about this issue.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of days there have been two accidents at this monstrosity called Sellafield. There has also been a train accident.  This highlights the worries everybody has about it.  It is significant that on the Cumbrian local authority, all the parties, including the Tories, have opposed the site and have asked for the inquiry to be reopened.  We now have the spectacle of British Government scientists coming forward with information that supports our Government and the Minister's stance at the public inquiry &mdash; that this is not the right place for a nuclear waste dump.</P>
    <P>The weight of information and media coverage is important.  This issue, which successive Irish Governments have highlighted, is now getting a fair hearing in the British media.  The Minister must ensure that on every occasion this issue tops the agenda both at national and international level.</P>
    <P>Following my conversations with them, I am confident that British MPs and MEPs, as well as those from Northern Ireland, share our concerns. I hope we will work hand in hand with them to ensure that the current British Government, and whoever may be in power after the British general election, will take Ireland's concerns into account.</P>
    <P>If any of the waste that is being stockpiled at Sellafield seeped into the Irish Sea it would leave this country in a horrendous situation, both environmentally and commercially.  I am pleased that there is cross-party support for this motion and that the Minister's efforts to ensure that this disastrous proposal by Nirex for a dump at Sellafield will not go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Wright's proposal for a short debate on this issue.  As he said, there is cross-party support on the matter. The Minister is aware that this House has given him and his Government colleagues total support in recent years for the campaign against Sellafield and the Nirex proposal for a rock cavern site.</P>
      <P>As the Minister announced yesterday, the good news is that the public consultation process will recommence in light of additional information that has recently come to hand concerning the Nirex development.  The new consultation process may not have been put in place were it not for the Government's work on this issue.  The Government has been proactive and has always been focused in its campaign.  The Minister's intervention at the first planning process at Cumbria was innovative.  The second process would not have been opened up by the British Government if it had not been for the Minister's work. The Government must be commended for these efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate provides us with yet another opportunity to send a clear message to the British Government that the Irish people want this nuisance to stop.  Following incident after incident at <Col N="1715" /> Sellafield we have seen a total disregard for the health and safety of people living here.  The campaign against Sellafield must continue and its successful conclusion can only come about when the facility is closed down once and for all.</P>
    <P>Opposition to the Sellafield project and the rock cavern project proposed by Nirex, is not only focused in Ireland but has gained huge support throughout Britain, including from many local authorities that are opposed to the advancement of the nuclear industry.  The British Government must understand that opposition to Sellafield is no longer only based here.  An important coalition has now developed on both sides of the Irish Sea whose voice must be heeded.  The Sellafield issue must be raised at the highest level between the British and Irish Governments.  We frequently hear about the importance of the North-South dimension of Anglo-Irish relations, but Sellafield represents the most important issue in the east-west axis.</P>
    <P>The lunatic proposal by the British nuclear industry to place a gigantic nuclear dump under the suface of Cumbria is yet another example of that industry's insensitive and irresponsible attitude. It is time Nirex, BNFL and Mr. John Gummer listened carefully to the advice and expertise of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution.  Vast sums of public money have been put into this development, but it is money that has been poorly spent.  To date, over £200 million has been spent on the development, which is going nowhere.</P>
    <P>The weight of geological and technical information about the proposal is such as to make it completely untenable for either the British or Irish people to accept.  The fact that the dump has been proposed within a stone's throw of the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield underlines the sinister nature of the proposal.</P>
    <P>The cross-party nature of our opposition to Sellafield must continue and the obvious threat of the nuclear industry to Ireland should not be underestimated.  All those involved in the campaign have a responsibility to stop the out of date advances of the British nuclear industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  I understand he cancelled an important meeting to be here, which indicates the level of importance he places on this issue.  For many years the Labour Party has been opposed to nuclear power.  Both in Government and out of power, we lent our voice to opposing the Sellafield process, which must be brought to an end. Recent events have shown just how much at risk we all are from the threat of accidents at Sellafield. There is a public health risk through environmental contamination.  From the most recent incident there, we see how even small accidents can lead to radioactive contamination of workers and the work site itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More important still is the risk of the Nirex proposals to place a dump in the rock strata <Col N="1716" /> under the Irish Sea.  This would have repercussions for generations to come, yet they propose to do it despite our total opposition.  If an accident occurs we will, as a nation, suffer the consequences.</P>
    <P>As the Minister rightly pointed out, we do not benefit in the slightest from the risks that are being taken.  The British public may get cheaper electricity but we do not benefit from that while we run a risk to our children and our children's children.  There are consequences in the continuation of work at Sellafield in that it encourages the stock piling of what could be potentially dangerous side products of the process.  It could lead to more nuclear arms being made available throughout the world.  It would seem that what is driving Nirex, Thorpe and BNFL is money and if that is their only concern then they will sell plutonium to the highest bidder without worrying about the consequences.  There are consequences, therefore, not only for ourselves but for world peace.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister for the hard work he has put into this area.  The fact that the inquiry is to be reopened is attributable to that work. Without his strong efforts we would not be listened to as readily as we have been.  I also pay tribute to the Government, particularly Minister Gilmore, who has been very active on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to Senator Wright, who initiated this debate, that he has shown cross-party support for the work of the Minister.  This is an issue on which the whole of Ireland is united.  The Minister has everybody's backing and I wish him well in his meeting tomorrow with the British Ambassador.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Sellafield represents an ongoing threat to the health and safety of everybody living in these islands.  Since the days when Sellafield was known as Windscale, it has been plagued by accidents, leaks and what are euphemistically termed &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; involving radiation.  Each of those incidents represent a potential catastrophe, and in the last six weeks Sellafield workers were contaminated by radiation.</P>
      <P>The threat posed by Sellafield has been significantly increased by the Thorpe nuclear reprocessing plant, a facility which involves the transport of nuclear waste and nuclear enriched material through the Irish Sea.  The risk posed by Sellafield and Thorpe are compounded by the proposed Nirex underground nuclear waste dump.  Leaked internal memos prepared for Nirex confirm what environmentalists have long suspected, that the geological structures of the Sellafield site are fundamentally unsuited to such a facility and that there is a real danger of radioactive contamination of the water course.  That is an opinion apparently shared by the British Government experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these circumstances any decision by the UK Environment Secretary, John Gummer, to grant planning permission to Nirex would amount to criminal negligence.  Construction of this dump <Col N="1717" /> would pose a serious and continuing health risk not only to those living around Sellafield but to those living on the east coast of Ireland.  In recent years the UK authorities appear prepared to play Russian roulette with the safety of everybody in these islands, and the privatisation of the nuclear industry has placed profit margins firmly above safety margins.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Nirex proposal I would like to find out from the Minister whether an underground dump of this type is covered under EU environmental directives.  In the short and medium term it is clear that maximum diplomatic pressure must be exerted on the UK authorities to ensure that planning permission for this radioactive rubbish bin is refused.</P>
    <P>I welcome the very strong statement by the Minister and his total commitment and that of Minister Gilmore to this issue.  I hope that the public representatives on all sides will continue to voice the concerns of the people in every available forum.</P>
    <P>Last October I welcomed in this House the Supreme Court decision clearing the way for legal action to be taken against BNFL.  I pointed out that the Euratom treaties were outdated and had not kept pace with either scientific or political change.  They should be amended to take account of the concerns of non nuclear jurisdictions such as Ireland which share land or maritime borders with nuclear jurisdictions.  Radioactive fallout does not respect national boundaries.  I am aware that there is considerable opposition within the EU to any such change and I hope the Government will continue to pursue this matter at various levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary body, we have prepared a study on environmental issues affecting the UK and the Republic of Ireland.  The Minister gave evidence to that body.  The draft report of that group has now been completed but since then extraordinary information has come into the public arena over the last two weeks.  I am shocked by it.</P>
      <P>In preparing that report the group visited Sellafield and the Nirex dump.  I was present on both occasions but that was not my first visit to Sellafield. I visited Sellafield in 1985 with a group of colleagues from Dublin Corporation on the 30th anniversary of the great fire.  I expected a large demonstration but was shocked when I got there because, apart from the Dublin group, the Wexford group and the Louth group, there were very few people from Cumbria.  I was disillusioned and felt that the Irish Government in their efforts to close Sellafield and the Nirex dump were only puffing against the breeze until the British people became interested in the problem that affected their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last two weeks the Cumbrian county council and other local authorities have shown interest.  They now realise that this is an issue on their own door step.  If we can encourage that, then it will be a first step forward in abating the <Col N="1718" /> situation that exists at Sellafield and Nirex.  That is the key to the solution &mdash; we must encourage the local authorities in that part of Britain to become involved with us in requesting the British Government to close these facilities.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the stand he has taken on this matter.  I do not want to pre-empt the report, but the Minister's stand is recognised in it.  It is very important that we send out a strong message and provide every opportunity to encourage the people of Britain to object to this facility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his election and to express my sympathy to Members of the Seanad on the loss of Senator Liam Naughten, the former Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>Speaking in the debate in the Dáil on 11 December, on the motion to set up the Buchanan examination, I noted that the common point in the contributions by Deputies from all sides was the view that the political process as a whole and the reputations of those who work in it had been tarnished by allegations regarding payments to politicians and public servants by Dunnes Stores and/or Mr. Ben Dunne.  As I said then, I am determined that everything that can possibly be done will be done to remove that tarnish.  I am also determined that it will be done as efficiently, effectively and economically as possible.</P>
      <P>The basis for the allegations about payments appears to rest, in the main, on a report dated 12 April 1994, prepared by Price Waterhouse for Dunnes Stores and an affidavit sworn by Mr. Ben Dunne in High Court proceedings.  There may, of course, be additional relevant information which is not contained in either document.</P>
      <P>The concern arising from the media allegations of last November did not relate to the mere fact of the payments.  There is nothing improper in political parties and politicians receiving or seeking donations for the funding of political activity, which is essential to the working of democracy; nor is there anything improper in individuals and companies contributing to politicians and political parties.  Without such support, certainly in the past, it would not have been possible to sustain the level of activity required to maintain the political system as we know it.</P>
      <P>The public concerns, which we all share, are twofold.  First, that the payments may have been made either to influence decisions or as a reward for past decisions which may have benefited the donor.  Second, that some of the payments may have been excessive and gone beyond what would be reasonable to support the normal political activity of any individual recipient or even any normal political party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the allegations were made, the Government moved with speed to allay public concern. However, we also sought to ensure that any moves made were the right ones.  What is the desired result?  It is to establish and expose the facts and to ensure that if there is any evidence of impropriety, it will be dealt with in the appropriate way in accordance with the laws of the land.  The process in which Judge Buchanan is involved is, as I made clear on 11 December, &ldquo;the <Col N="1722" /> first and, I believe, the most appropriate initial step to establish the facts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his interim report, addressed to the Cathaoirleach and to the Ceann Comhairle, Judge Buchanan completed the first stage of this initial step.  I speak for all Members when I convey thanks and appreciation to Judge Buchanan and to those who are working with him.  They are performing a public service and are doing so with efficiency, skill and speed.</P>
    <P>The interim report deals with one of the sources of the allegations, the Price Waterhouse report.  It addresses payments covered in that report that were made to Members or ex-Members of the Oireachtas and to the Fine Gael Party.  The interim report also notes the limitations of the Price Waterhouse report.  That report had been commissioned principally for the purpose of investigating certain transactions which had been undertaken by Mr. Ben Dunne without the knowledge or consent of other members of the board of the relevant company. It deals only with the circumstances of specific transactions selected by Dunnes Stores for inclusion in the report and into the accounting treatment of these transactions in the records of the company.</P>
    <P>The Price Waterhouse report was limited from the outset and, in so far as Judge Buchanan's study was limited to the Price Waterhouse report, his report was limited by the limits placed by Dunnes Stores on that report.  Anybody who complains that the Buchanan report does not answer every question should recognise that there are, and were, limitations from the outset on that exercise.  We are now moving to an exercise which will have less limitations.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Judge Buchanan will provide a similar report in respect of public servants as defined in the agreement with Dunnes Holding Company.  The definition is broad and includes employees of any organisation which is publicly funded.</P>
    <P>The Buchanan process is proving to be a highly cost effective means of clearing the ground and isolating matters that deserve the more serious treatment that only a judicial inquiry can provide. This has been done without getting involved in the expensive, adversarial procedures associated with compulsory disclosure.  A tribunal costs about £10,000 or more a day.  The cost of the Buchanan exercise so far, including the Judge's salary, pensions and so forth, will total no more than £30,000.  It has been a cost effective exercise and the information it has disclosed, because it was disclosed voluntarily under a voluntary agreement, has come into the public arena quicker than would have been the case if one had chosen the compulsory route initially.  Now that we are taking the compulsory route, we can do so in a more focused way because we are concentrating on matters that were not voluntarily disclosed. It makes sense in any proceeding in which one <Col N="1723" /> is trying to get facts, to get as many as possible voluntarily, thus saving effort, time and dispute, before proceeding in a focused way to pursue the facts one cannot get voluntarily.  That is the logical and sensible way we have proceeded.</P>
    <P>We are also aware of repeated media allegations involving a very large payment to a political figure.  On 3 December last, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported on its front page that a &ldquo;prominent Fianna Fáil figure is believed to have received more than £1 million from Dunnes Stores in the early 1990s.  The money was paid by several cheques with different bank accounts in London on a number of dates&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 12 December, <i>The Irish Times</i> further reported that details of these payments were understood to be contained in an affidavit drawn up by Mr. Ben Dunne as part of a legal battle. The newspaper story said that this document &ldquo;provides his version of where £1.1 million in payments from the company were routed.&rdquo;  That is Mr. Dunne's version.  The article continued &ldquo;It is understood that he&rdquo;, that is Mr. Dunne, &ldquo;alleges that the ultimate beneficiary of the money was a Fianna Fáil politician&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know that the main Opposition party feels, because of an allegation about an unnamed Fianna Fáil figure, at least in that report, that it has been unfairly put in a position where it is considered suspect.  This is not fair to the party in question or its members and it is important that the matter is brought quickly into the open so that all those to whom no guilt can be attached are allowed to clear their names.  It is a matter of regret that it has not been brought into the open in the last two months.</P>
    <P>There was also an allegation in <i>The Star</i> on 4 December that up to a dozen politicians received more than £5 million.  The newspaper went on to state that members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Labour had all received payments and that, additionally, a current Senator and a top ranking party official were among the beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference proposed by the tribunal are designed to establish the amount of payments made to politicians, political parties and, depending on Judge Buchanan's continuing work and a subsequent resolution of this House, public servants.  They are also intended, most importantly, to enable the tribunal to inquire, in respect of payments, into &ldquo;the considerations, motives and circumstances therefor&rdquo;.  As I have said earlier, it is not the fact of the payments that is important, it is the suggestion that they may have been made improperly or corruptly to influence politicians and public servants in the conduct of their business as public servants.  That is what needs to be established.</P>
    <P>I am availing of this debate to respond to some of the points made in the Dáil about the tribunal earlier this afternoon.  Those points may be made <Col N="1724" /> in this debate and it is better that I anticipate them.</P>
    <P>The main Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, said that it was especially concerned that the tribunal proceed and report very quickly.  It even wanted the Dáil to prescribe when oral hearings would start so that the tribunal would be put under pressure to work exceptionally quickly.  I could not agree to this proposal but I do agree that it is urgent that the air be cleared through an early report.  The tribunal will work much more quickly if information is volunteered to it rather than if people have to be forced to disclose information.</P>
    <P>The Leader of Fianna Fáil made reference to reports in the newspapers of the sum of £1 million being paid to a senior Fianna Fáil person who held high office.  According to <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> the money in US dollars, about $2.2 million in all, was paid into an offshore bank account controlled by a prominent accountant who included this senior Fianna Fáil figure among his clients.  No suggestion was made in any newspaper report that the figure referred to had severed his connections with Fianna Fáil to date.</P>
    <P>In the interests of speeding up the work of the tribunal, and the Leader of Fianna Fáil was most anxious that the work of the tribunal would be speeded up, he should consider going to the figure in his own party who has been named in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and in other media, and seek the truth directly from this person.  This would not be an unreasonable request for the Leader of Fianna Fáil to make of a party member in view of the fact that he, and his party, have expressed such concern in the Dáil today that the proceedings of the tribunal be allowed to proceed quickly and not be delayed.</P>
    <P>After making these inquiries, Deputy Ahern could make the results public, either by public statement or by providing the information directly to the tribunal and saving it a lot of difficulty. Deputy Ahern might also be able to confirm that the person in his party will give his fullest co-operation to the tribunal to deal with all these allegations, including the reports of offshore bank accounts and routes for the cash.</P>
    <P>These allegations are in the public arena and everybody has a responsibility to dispel them if they can be dispelled.  All should ensure that the public and the tribunal get the full facts. However, the leader of a party about one of whose members the allegations in question have been made, is obviously in a better position to ask that member to put all the facts on the table than is anybody else.</P>
    <P>A party president has authority over all his party members, not just those who are members of the Oireachtas.  This is clear under the constitution of most political parties.  It is a pity that the definitive information was not put in the public arena in the past two months.  This would have helped greatly in focusing the work of the tribunal, if indeed a tribunal would have been <Col N="1725" /> needed at all if all the facts were put on the table when the allegations were first made.  That has not happened.</P>
    <P>Now a tribunal has been set up and the main Opposition party is expressing anxiety that it reports speedily and I agree.  I suggest that, through its leader, it takes the steps I have suggested to get the facts into the public arena without delay.  Otherwise, as both of the Opposition leaders indicated in the Dáil earlier today, a cloud of suspicion will continue to hang over politicians.</P>
    <P>Any person who was a collectively responsible member of Government, serving in Cabinet with the Fianna Fáil figure who has been identified, would obviously have a particularly good basis for demanding public answers from a former Cabinet colleague, especially if that colleague is still a member of his party.  If the newspaper reports are accurate, Deputy Ahern served in the Cabinet with the person in question and at a time when the moneys were allegedly paid, so he is in a position to ask that question if the person named is the relevant person.  He thus has a right and a responsibility to ask questions and get answers.  He does not need to leave the job to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil today we had a long debate on the Order of Business where the whole focus was on the Leader of Fianna Fáil's anxiety that the tribunal report quickly.  If that is his concern then he has a special responsibility to go to any identified member of his party who has information to help the tribunal report quickly.  If he does not do that, there is an obligation on him to give us an explanation.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference proposed for the tribunal have been carefully crafted and are, I believe, on the basis of the information currently available, the appropriate ones.  I would particularly like to highlight the request to the persons selected to conduct the inquiry to note the desire of the Houses that it be completed in as economical a manner as possible, and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it.</P>
    <P>No one can guarantee that the inquiry which we are now embarking on will provide the perfect solution or will necessarily provide conclusive answers to every question.  It is an expensive process and it can be time consuming but it is the most effective one available.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with fundamental matters of great public importance.  To meet them we initiated a sensible, independent, sifting process directed by Judge Buchanan.  Now we are moving to the next phase by bringing into play the most powerful and best tested weapon in the investigative armoury of the State, namely the independent, judicial sworn inquiry, to ensure that these matters of importance and public concern are given the fullest and fairest possible consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity on my own behalf, and on behalf of my colleagues here today, to welcome the Taoiseach into the House and to thank him for taking time to propose this motion on what is undoubtedly a matter of great public interest.  However, in keeping with the tradition of this House whereby we try to avoid partisan political speeches, I think we should look in a broad way at whether or not in this particular context the tribunal, as drafted by these terms of reference, will be able to serve the purpose it is intended to serve.  We feel that when we called for this tribunal in December of last year, it would have been a more appropriate time to move immediately into a tribunal.  The reason for that is clear: for every day and hour that these innuendoes are in public currency, the quality of public life in this country is, of necessity, undermined. Nobody wants that.</P>
      <P>We are also faced with the possibility that this tribunal may be in progress during a general election and I am of the opinion that it would not be a good thing for this country if it were to be in session during a general election.  There are other issues which are more important to the public&mdash; crime, unemployment, education, Northern Ireland &mdash; and those are the primary issues that must be the basis of debate and discussion in a general election.  I think the Taoiseach would agree that it would be a mistake if this particular affair was allowed to gain centre stage in a general election context.  Subject of course to the independence of that inquiry, it should be made clear that every effort should be made to determine the outcome of this tribunal well in advance of a general election.</P>
      <P>I have noticed that there is a stipulation in the terms of reference that there should be an interim report within ten days; and if the hepatitis C tribunal is anything to go by, we could expect a relatively speedy tribunal.  We could also be pessimistic and expect that a tribunal, perhaps involving very complex commercial affairs, could go on for a considerable period of time, and that is a fear we should address.  I agree with the analysis of my party leader that Justice Brian Mc Cracken is admirably suited to untangling the issues in that tribunal.</P>
      <P>I would like to return to one particular word the Taoiseach used and that was &ldquo;decision&rdquo;, because the key point in this is whether any decisions by any Members of the Oireachtas or any serving Government Minister were at any stage influenced by donations.  I think that is one of the key concepts that people will be interested in and that will have to be examined by the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the language in the terms of reference for this inquiry adequate to take into account the effect on decisions that may have been made?  In part of the Taoiseach's speech he quoted, I think, from <i>The Star</i> newspaper.  Another Sunday tabloid newspaper had a particular allegation or <Col N="1727" /> innuendo to make about a certain Government Minister, which I am not going to honour by repeating here today.  I agree that if names are bandied about in the public without firm authority or evidence, reputations can be destroyed where they should not be.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach fully satisfied that the wording in these terms of reference can fully deal with the effect that financial contributions, whether to individuals or to political parties, may have made on decisions?  The only words relevant to that are the words: &ldquo;...and the considerations, motives and circumstances therefor...&rdquo;.  Perhaps that is adequate but I would put a general question there.</P>
    <P>I want to read into the record of this House the words spoken by my party leader at lunchtime today.  In one short paragraph they encapsulate what I believe this tribunal should be all about. Deputy Ahern said:</P>
    <P>I want the tribunal established without fear or favour to any Member of this House, past or present, or any former member of this, or previous, Governments.  I wish to repeat, with one addition, what I said here on 3 December because I consider it vitally important.  Politics and participation in public life is a career of public service.  It is not an avenue of enrichment or life style enhancement from private donors even where they only want to help people perform in a particular manner.  My party and my front bench are determined that financial scrupulousness will be strictly observed by all our elected Members without fear or favour.  Anyone who abuses their position or knowingly flouts the rules will face the law of the land.  The political fabric of our democracy is precious.  The public are entitled to have an absolute guarantee of the financial probity and integrity of their elected representatives, their officials and above all, their Ministers.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach will agree that those are words eloquently spoken by Deputy Ahern and I have read them into the record of this House because I believe they encapsulate the spirit of what this tribunal should be all about.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach to consider subparagraph (b) of the terms of reference wherein reference is made to such further matters as Dáil and Seanad Éireann might by further resolution consider appropriate.  I think the Taoiseach will agree that during the term of this tribunal many other matters may arise which are perhaps outside the terms of reference but which would be considered relevant by these Houses.  I would like to hear what the Taoiseach's general attitude will be, how welcoming and approachable he will be, to both sides of both Houses in relation to altering the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry if it <Col N="1728" /> appears necessary to do so during the currency of that tribunal.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the precise number of tribunals that have been held in the State to date. We have had the Whiddy tribunal, the Stardust tribunal, the Kerry Babies tribunal, the Beef tribunal and the hepatitis C tribunal and now, for want of a better name, the Dunne tribunal.  I do not know if there is an official or unofficial name for this tribunal, but I presume most people will refer to it as the Dunne tribunal.  We, on this side of the House, welcome the setting up of this tribunal because it gives everybody &mdash; and this is an important point &mdash;the right to be heard and to put their case.  To date, there have been lots of unanswered questions, innuendo, allegations and so forth.</P>
    <P>I applaud the work of retired Judge Buchanan, but I think he was set a task without having adequate powers to deal with it.  I want to repeat what we said earlier about the fact that this tribunal should have started earlier; but now that we have it, let us welcome it.  People will attend the tribunal and they will be legally represented, able to defend their reputations, to explain their positions and to vindicate their rights.  That is very important.  I hope that during the currency of that tribunal there would perhaps be a lack or an absence of discussion on the subject until the tribunal reaches its conclusions.  In the same way as it is inappropriate to discuss court cases while they are ongoing, I believe it would be better, and in the interests of justice for all concerned, if silence was maintained until this tribunal has completed its work.</P>
    <P>This tribunal may be two months late, but it is better late than never.  We fully support it and I am sure all on this side of the House will co-operate with it.  I will not take this opportunity to answer in any part the tone or content of some sections of the Taoiseach's speech, but I am sure that will be a matter of reply on a different occasion.  I and my colleagues warmly welcome the Taoiseach to the House today and welcome the establishment of this tribunal.  We hope and assume it will be a good one which will finish before the next general election.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House this afternoon.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I warmly welcome the establishment of a tribunal into the Dunnes Stores payments affair.  While my party is not completely happy with the terms of reference of the tribunal, I suppose there is no point opposing it because we have been calling for the past two months for the establishment of such a tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As our party leader said this morning, there is no point in engaging in the politics of &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; because it would not get us very far, but it is difficult for the public not to be cynical.  The Government is now trying to convince us that all along it would move from the political Buchanan tribunal to a judicial tribunal and that this was all part of the process.  I acknowledge that the Taoiseach <Col N="1729" /> made it clear from the first day that he had no fundamental objection to the establishment of a tribunal, but the Government accused the Progressive Democrats of indulging in opportunistic politics.</P>
    <P>When members of my party tabled a Private Members' motion in the Dáil last December seeking the establishment of such a judicial tribunal, we were severely criticised by members of the Government.  In the course of that debate on 10 December, the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Jim Higgins, said the Progressive Democrats were on &ldquo;their high moral penny farthing&rdquo;. He lectured us on how such a tribunal would be very expensive.  I am sure it is of great comfort to the public that such a senior member of the Government is only interested in establishing the truth if it can be done at bargain basement prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, stated that a tribunal would be a potential disaster, a recipe for prolonged hearings with huge legal bills and the real prospect of journalists ending up in jail with no guarantee of satisfactory or complete answers at the end of the process. The Minister also went on to tell us that the result of our proposals would be enormously costly and a cumbersome tribunal.  I am glad to see that both these people have made a U-turn decision and have now realised that what we were looking for was the only way we can ever get to the bottom of this story.</P>
    <P>Much of what has been said about various payments to politicians is pure speculation and that is why my party pressed from the beginning to have this matter brought to a tribunal and cleared up quickly.  A cloud hangs over politicians in this and the other House.  The only proof we have so far of any payments are those to former Minister, Deputy Lowry, because there is documentary evidence to support it and we also have his statement to the Dáil.  I would not speculate further because we are treading on dangerous territory.</P>
    <P>The Government has throughout this affair shown a complete lack of judgment in dealing with the issues raised by it.  It is now 70 days, well over two months, since the <i>Irish Independent</i> published its story detailing payments made to Deputy Lowry by Dunnes Stores for renovations to the former Minister's home in Tipperary.  The public will be very cynical that it has taken so long and will believe that we did not want the whole truth of this matter to emerge.  The Taoiseach, however, accepted from the beginning that there was a possibility that a tribunal would be needed.</P>
    <P>There is no specific reference in the terms of reference establishing the tribunal to the individual at the centre of the initial allegations, Deputy Lowry.  That is unfair because it puts us all in the same boat when we clearly are not, and we must wait until this tribunal reaches a conclusion, <Col N="1730" /> which could take some time, to have our names cleared.  It is like saying we are all in the same boat which we clearly are not.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party, I would like if the tribunal could be finished before the next election takes place because it would be unfortunate if it were to be ongoing during an election campaign. I realise that it is not possible to put a time limit on it as it would probably be unrealistic.  None of us knows until the tribunal begins exactly what matters will need to be investigated and how long that will take.  I hope it does not prove to be lengthy and costly.  We have had a great example in recent weeks of the hepatitis C tribunal which was well handled by its chairman, former Chief Justice, Mr. Finlay.  Other tribunals in this State did not come to a satisfactory conclusion or did not come to any at all.  I hope this tribunal follows the example of the hepatitis C tribunal.  We would then begin to see and know what exactly the situation is in relation to these payments from Dunnes Stores.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the tribunal will investigate illicit payments.  All involved in politics will realise that legitimate payments are made for election campaigns to many members of all political parties.  These are legitimate and are not the payments with which this tribunal will be concerned.  It is the making of illicit payments which needs to be investigated.  It must be stated that every payment politicians or parties receive for election expenses is not tainted.  Many people genuinely make contributions to all political parties because they appreciate that we live in a democracy.  It is in our interest that we have a choice of political parties and politicians to vote for come elections and that political parties are not run on fresh air.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the tribunal and we will all completely co-operate with it.  The sooner it comes to its conclusions, the sooner the cloud of suspicion hanging over us is lifted.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a case for Mallow vocational school and I have no doubt that Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, will convey to the Minister for Education the strong manner in which I will put this case because, as early as 1987, plans were ready to proceed with the building of a new vocational school at Mallow, County Cork.  The plans were finalised, the land was purchased at Summerhill, <Col N="1731" /> Mallow, for the project but because there was a slight decline in the numbers, the Minister for Education at that time decided not to proceed with the project.  There was a campaign going on in Mallow at the time.  Some schools benefited from it and the vocational school lost out.</P>
      <P>There are now 450 students enrolled in the school together with 50 apprentices and the new school would provide for about 500 students.  The growth in enrolment over the past five years is now causing serious accommodation problems. Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, each second level student is entitled to the option of completing a transition year programme but space constraints at Davis College do not allow this option to be given to all the students.  At present, just one class can be accommodated but, ideally, 75 students should be accommodated.  They are deprived of that right.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to give the go ahead for the completion of the plans so that tenders can be invited as soon as possible as it will be some time before the school will be completed. The Cork County chief executive officer publicly announced in 1984 that plans to build a new school were prepared.  This is 1997 and the project has not been taken one step further.  That is not acceptable and I want to make that clear to the Minister.</P>
      <P>On a related topic, I urge her to make provision for a new building for Gaelscoil Tomás Dáibhis in Mallow.  The school currently occupies prefabricated buildings which were second-hand when acquired 13 years ago.  The structures leak, are infested with unsavoury wildlife &mdash; vermin to put it bluntly &mdash; and lack an indoor toilet.  No child should be expected to learn in such conditions and I hope the Minister will make the matter of suitable accommodation for Gaelscoil Tomás Dáibhis a priority also.  Appropriate accommodation is vital to the learning process.</P>
      <P>The reason I raise that as a related topic is that the students of the Gaelscoil progress to secondary school at Choláiste Dáibhis and there is no accommodation for them there.  It is a very urgent matter and I appeal to the Minister to address it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity of responding to this Adjournment debate.  A new vocational school to cater for 450 pupils is currently being planned for Summerhill, Mallow, County Cork.</P>

These documents are currently being examined by the Department's technical staff.

    <P>At this stage, it is not possible to indicate when the project will proceed to construction as this will depend on the availability of funding and the Department's other commitments and priorities. However, every effort is being made to have the planning of the new school completed as soon as possible with a view to being in a position to invite tenders as soon as funding is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Mr. Deenihan, is present because I know he will have no difficulty in accepting the simple point I want to make.</P>
      <P>Let me assure the House that, in raising this question, I have no wish to embarrass the Minister, score political points or make things more difficult for the beef industry.  On the contrary, I am acting in what I believe is the best interests of the beef industry, which is of central importance to the economy and at the heart of Minister of State's deliberations.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the mistake to which I want to draw attention is absolutely disastrous from the point of view of that industry.  I say that in the full knowledge that the mistake was made at the express wish of the beef industry.  Up to the end of last year, new cases of BSE were announced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry each week as they were discovered.  As a result, everybody was kept fully up to date with the situation as it evolved.  However, the beef industry did not like this bad news in the newspapers week after week, so they made a submission to the Department asking that it announce new cases only once a month.  On the face of it that sounds quite reasonable &mdash; get all the bad news out of the way at once and then have peace and quiet for the rest of the month until the next announcement.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, that is not the way things work in the marketplace.  To the buyers of Irish beef outside Ireland who are scrutinising everything that happens in the beef trade with a closer and closer eye, this change means only one thing, it is a clumsy attempt to cover up bad news.  They see this as a crude manoeuvre to stifle information. Not surprisingly, many of them see it as a clear demonstration that the Department acts solely in the perceived interests of the Irish beef industry. The key point is not whether the Department reports once a day, once a week or once a month but that one cannot change the rules to suit oneself and still maintain credibility.  That, in essence, is the message from the marketplace.  My hope is that it is not too late to listen and act on that message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> I know that many of my company's customers have been disgusted by this change but, with all due respect to them, the people I am really concerned about are the international buyers of Irish beef.  They are the people for whom credibility is all important and they are the ones who have no reason to give Ireland the benefit of the doubt.  I know from first hand experience how these people view Irish beef.</P>
    <P>My company is part of a European buying group which keeps us in daily contact with our counterparts in almost every EU country.  It represents 23,000 supermarkets around Europe and I know how closely the buyers in those supermarkets watch what is going on.  These are not people whom we can fool.  I had good news for them before Christmas when I told them about the new Food Safety Board which we are to set up.  I was able to convince them that this new board would be totally independent and would act in the interests of the consumer, not the producer.  They were sceptical but, in the end, they were prepared to believe me.  Now we have been given a slap in the face by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  If anything was ever guaranteed to stoke up the fires of scepticism among potential buyers, last week's action is certainly it.  Changing the rules was the cardinal sin.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister of State's brief will contain a mountain of guff about the imagined benefits of making monthly announcements dreamed up by some poor civil servants locked in an ivory tower far away from the marketplace.  No doubt his brief contains comparisons with other countries in which announcements are made even less frequently.  However, that is totally irrelevant to the key issue which is that one cannot maintain credibility if one changes the rules in one's favour.</P>
    <P>With one stroke we have said we have something to hide.  We were letting it all hang out for everybody to see and we spoke about openness and transparency.  We have told the marketplace that we are not on its side.  We have even said we are not neutral &mdash; we are on the side of the producer against the marketplace.  That is the message this action sends.</P>
    <P>This was a disastrous decision which will wreck untold damage on our beef industry not only this year, but well into the future.  Our only hope is to reverse this decision immediately.  Let us be totally honest and admit that this was something we did not think through and on which we did not consult widely enough.  Let us be brave enough to admit we were wrong and that we are going to put things right.  If we do not, the beef industry and the economy will pay a terrible price in lost credibility and will make the job of the new Food Safety Board incomparably more difficult.</P>
    <P>I do not expect a definite answer from the Minister of State tonight.  However, if his speech contains an attempt to defend this terrible <Col N="1734" /> decision, I suggest he tears it up even at this late stage and goes away to think about this.  It is one thing to make a mistake but it is far worse to dig a deeper hole when one knows one has made a mistake.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed with the tone of the Senator's contribution. I would have expected something different and more balanced.  The reason the Minister decided to publish the results of tests for BSE on a monthly rather than weekly basis is to try to restore some semblance of proportion to the public coverage of this matter.  I do not accept that this will cause any damage to the international credibility of the Irish beef industry: in fact the opposite is the case and that is precisely why the Minister took the decision.</P>
      <P>Let me fill the Senator in on the background to the system in place.  All suspect cases of BSE must, by law, be notified to the Department. Notified cases are immediately investigated by veterinary inspectors of my Department accompanied, where feasible, by research officers from the Department's veterinary research laboratories. If BSE cannot be ruled out by veterinary clinical investigation, the animal is killed by euthanasia and the head is removed to the veterinary research laboratory to be tested by histopathology for BSE.  This process involves keeping the brain in a solution of formalin for a period of some days.  The laboratory practice is to examine the brains which are ready for testing once per week and a procedure developed where the results were made public after the herd owner, the EU Commission, Bord Bia and other parties involved in the trade requiring veterinary certification were notified.</P>

    <P>This weekly notification led to a situation where say a single positive case of BSE in a herd population of seven million commanded weekly headlines in press, radio and television.  That is totally disproportionate to the news value of the incident and was causing the very damage of which the Senator speaks.  BSE is not a major problem in Ireland &mdash; it is a mere pin prick but the continuous publicity was building it into a problem.  For that reason the Minister decided to issue the results monthly and, if I give the sequence of events that occurred in January, the Senator will appreciate the value of that decision. There were five weeks in January on which tests were read.  The first week yielded one positive as did the second and third.  The fourth week yielded three and the fifth week yielded five, giving a total of 11 for the month.  I see no reason the public should be bombarded on a weekly basis with results at this low level, if by doing so we would create unnecessary problems for everybody in the beef industry.  There is no question of suppressing information.  I stand by what the <Col N="1735" /> Minister has done and feel it is the right decision in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have the most transparent reporting system which has been acknowledged by the technical experts who have come here from third markets and European countries.  They have absolute faith in our reporting system.  The Minister took correct action.  One BSE case was reported over and over giving the semblance that there was a major <Col N="1736" /> problem in this country when in fact it is very small, comparatively speaking.  We are announcing cases every month, which could not be more transparent.  People will know the exact number of cases and will not be bombarded weekly.  I defend the action taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 12 February 1997.</P>
