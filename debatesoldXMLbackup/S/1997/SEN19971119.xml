      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In the light of the Louise Woodward case, the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to safeguard the position of young people who are engaged in vulnerable employment, within the EU and internationally, by putting processes in place to ensure that (a) a duty of care is provided for these young workers, and (b) such work is monitored.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Gallagher of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement about new scientific evidence regarding the transmission of new variant CJD through blood transfusions and the measures necessary to ensure the treatment of blood donations to eliminate this risk.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 to 7, inclusive, and items 9 to 14, inclusive, without debate.  Item 8 is not being moved. Second Stage of item 15, the Children Bill, 1997, is to conclude today.  Item 16 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The contribution of principal spokespersons on Second Stage of item 15 should not exceed 20 minutes and 15 minutes for all other Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. However, I do not like the practice of taking all Stages of a Bill in the same week.  There should be at least a week's interval between Second and remaining Stages.  This is fairer to the spokespersons <Col N="778" /> involved and it also gives more time for reflection on points made on Second Stage before Committee Stage.  I do not object to the arrangements this week but I would be happier if, in future, there is some space between various Stages.  Do I understand the Leader correctly that the Second Stage debate this evening is open ended and will not conclude until all speakers have contributed?  If that is the case, I am happy.</P>
      <P>I am very happy with the proposals regarding the motions for committees.  They represent a significant improvement on what operated until now as they are more focused.  There is a greater opportunity for Senators to participate in committees because of these proposals.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate soon on crowd safety and control at major public functions? This arises specifically out of last Saturday's rugby international at Lansdowne Road. Between 2.30 p.m. and 2.45 p.m. that day a crowd disaster was waiting to happen.  Large numbers of people were being funnelled into Lansdowne Road, the DART gates were closed and new barriers were erected at the Shelbourne Road intersection. I experienced at first hand this frightening and dangerous situation.  It only required a sudden shower of rain which would have caused those at the back to push forward, or for exuberant people to push forward, and a major disaster would have happened.  The Irish Rugby Football Union is exhibiting extraordinary complacency and smugness in the face of many complaints about this.  I would like to see a statement from the Garda on this situation as it will be too late when a major disaster happens.  This situation lasted about 45 minutes and it seems extraordinary that the DART gates are closed creating a cul-de-sac in Lansdowne Road.  People are funnelled in and there is no way to stop them at the Shelbourne Road side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the conclusion of Second Stage of the Children Bill, will the Leader reassure the House that this Bill will not be guillotined and that all speakers will be facilitated? If there is not enough time today, there should be time for them tomorrow.  That is the understanding under which I consent to this item, and Members are concerned about it.</P>
      <P>It is important to note the element for substitution in the new committees.  This will allow greater participation to Members.  Government spokespersons have commented in the last week on literacy.  This is a hugely important issue and it should be addressed properly, scientifically and determinedly.  If we are to sell this country as highly educated, we cannot have reports being issued which state that people cannot read.  The Government should take this in hand.  As a representative of teachers, I would like this to be debated fully and properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speakers about the Children Bill.  There should be no guillotine on this important legislation.  If necessary <Col N="779" /> the debate should be rescheduled for tomorrow or another date.</P>
      <P>I am happy with the element for substitution on the new committees, but I am unhappy with the proposals regarding the numbers.  Effectively participation by Labour Senators in any of the 12 standing committees is ruled out.  That seems to be a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
      <P>Will the Leader inform the House of the Government's proposals in response to the Judge Kelly's decision in the High Court on Monday relating to Zoe Developments?  They were described as &ldquo;recidivist criminals&rdquo; because of substantial and serious breaches of health and safety regulations.  That was not the first time those breaches occurred.  Perhaps the Government could look into what was considered in Britain following the Zeebrugge disaster &mdash; the offence of corporate homicide.  The directors of a company which is guilty of serious offences could be charged with manslaughter.  The Leader should respond to this matter as it is known all over Dublin that these builders have been breaching health and safety regulations over the years.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider a debate on banking profits?  Bank of Ireland's interim report shows a 30 per cent increase with a huge profit of £500 million for the year, which I am sure will be about half the amount the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will have to distribute in the not too distant future.  It is an area at which we should look because of the strict regulations in the PCW and Partnership 2000 about what workers may earn and the fact the banks have restructured employees' salaries so they earn less.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader propose to respond to the report of the Court of Auditors which found that, in many cases, the farming community has been paid twice in respect of funds from Europe?  We must ensure one section of the community does not perceive another to be getting funds from Europe which have not been properly earned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to attack the media, but I express disappointment that as far as I could discern there was no report on Seanad Éireann in any of the print media on the day we discussed the Europol Bill, 1997, which was extremely important.  Issues were teased out in this House which had not been in the other House.  I regret the people were deprived of the opportunity to see issues of fundamental human rights being examined by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what my colleagues said about the various committees.  I would like to inform the House about a difficulty last week when the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs decided to hold its meeting to coincide with the Order of Business in this House.  I wrote a strong note to the committee indicating that I regarded this as insulting and that my colleagues would wish this to be forcibly drawn to its attention.  I received an undertaking <Col N="780" /> that it will not meet at a time which coincides with the Order of Business in this House.</P>
    <P>Could we have a debate on foreign affairs as a matter of urgency, concentrating specifically on developments in the Middle East and with particular reference to the massacre at Luxor?  This is an extremely dangerous development which needs to be debated.  It would be appropriate for some Members to issue a call to leaders of the Islamic faith to comment on this issue because that great religion, which has added enormously to the diversity of man's cultural tradition, is being grossly betrayed by the silence in front of these appalling atrocities.  It is almost as if they are being encouraged.</P>
    <P>Closer to home, when may we have a debate on the North of Ireland?  It is important we have a debate at this juncture, particularly in the light of comments made in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Jim Cusack, the well informed security correspondent, who indicated that members of the IRA do not like the cease-fire because they are being asked to produce their licences and car insurance.  It is a pity about them.  They will have to learn to behave as ordinary citizens.  I found it chilling that a Sinn Féin spokesman said that if they do not get what they want, they can go back to what they know best, and we know what that is.  This House should send a clear message to those people that such behaviour is not tolerable.</P>
    <P>Will the House consider debating conditions in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, in particular taking account of the 1995 report on mental hospitals?  It is a reproach to all of us that this matter has not been more substantially ventilated.  It is extraordinary that we gloat and boast about our plans to build 1,000 new prison places and put somebody in jail for a minimum of ten years at a cost of £0.5 million yet they cannot get a lavatory seat or a light bulb in St. Ita's, Portrane.  This House owes it to itself to discuss this matter.</P>

      <P>We cannot have a debate on the matter now.  I ask Members to confine themselves to questions to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago I asked for a debate on unauthorised television and telephone masts and pylons.  Since then, without appointing myself as a concerned person, I have received numerous letters from around the country encouraging me to raise the question again.  I ask the Leader to provide time to debate this national problem.  There is no forum other than the Dáil and the Seanad where the voices of those who represent different aspects of problems in rural Ireland can be heard.  This is driving a horse and cart through the planning regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on the funding and future of local authorities.  I do not want their role diminished <Col N="781" /> to the point where they are totally ineffective organisations and are responsible for almost nothing.  This has happened in Northern Ireland.  It is not the way to exercise and administer democracy and I hope it never happens here. I ask the Leader to provide time to discuss these issues so the House can make a useful contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Dr. Haughey Dr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Leader the appalling tragedy in North Korea.  This is an appropriate time to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to make a statement or to have a debate on the matter.  Given our dreadful history it is also appropriate he make a statement on the 150th anniversary of the Famine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Hayes Mr. J. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I renew my call to the Leader for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to this House for a full debate.  That was never more important or necessary than now, with the announcement last week of a cut of £35 million in the Agriculture Estimates, a nine per cent reduction.  This sent shivers down the spine of many people in the farming community.  Why is the Minister for Agriculture and Food shying away from coming to the House to address this important issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on juries and the legal system in view of the fact that, on <i>Liveline</i> last week, a juror spoke of how worried she was because she contributed to putting someone behind bars for nine years, although she felt at the time, and still feels, he was innocent. The jury was bullied by one person who had her mind made up before the case started.  This is serious.  It is wrong that people lock themselves in a room and we do not know what goes on when they are reaching a decision.  There should be an arbitrator to observe what is going on and to see justice is done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on evictions.  In business there is an early warning system to avert problems.  A similar system should apply to evictions; it should be partially funded by the State and partially by building societies and banks who are making such large amounts of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a scandalous that a widow was thrown out of her home a few weeks before Christmas and that her child had to be accompanied into the house by a garda so that she could remove some of her belongings while the sheriff's men were there.  The sanctity of the home has been invaded.  It is scandalous that a building society, which is making millions of <Col N="782" /> pounds, cannot solve those problems.  We should have an ombudsman, or some other system, to see if such problems could be solved.  That is a scandal in this day and age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday I raised the issue of EU funding post-1999.  Over the past few years EU funding has contributed greatly to our economic growth and development.  Nevertheless, there is still a range of serious social and economic problems in Dublin and other urban areas. It is imperative that the Government prepares a programme for the post-1999 situation.  The timing is critical.  I ask the Leader to allow time to debate this very important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader discuss with the Minister for Health and Children the possibility of State assistance for people who have decided to institute proceedings against the tobacco industry, in line with the cases brought in the United States?  Tobacco consumption causes the death of about 6,000 people in Ireland annually; it is a huge cost to the economy and the Health Vote.  A precedent has been established in that the Government has decided, under protest, to assist the people in County Louth who allege the practices of British Nuclear Fuels are causing a health hazard.  The people who have issued proceedings in the High Court against the tobacco industry are not seeking 100 per cent funding but for the State to recognise what they are doing and to provide some assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on agriculture.  However, I must correct the erroneous statement that the Estimates are reduced from last year's figure.  That is not the case.  The amount of the Estimates has increased. The Minister is introducing in the Dáil today a Supplementary Estimate for £65 million.  The REP scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments under the European environmental protection measures are to be significantly increased.  The one area in which there has been a reduction is headage payments, which is due to the fact those payments were brought forward and front loaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister not say that in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Supplementary Estimates to be introduced today £9 million must be taken out of next year's spending to pay for what was brought forward earlier in the year.  It is important to clarify those matters, which is one of the reasons I would welcome a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the wrong payments to farmers, it must be pointed out that those payments were made due to an agreement reached under the MacSharry CAP reform proposals.  It was not the recipients' fault that the price predictions on <Col N="783" /> which those compensations were based turned out to be erroneous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not, nor would the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Norris said about the atrocity in Luxor.  Perhaps the House could debate the issue.  It may be that what happened is more to do with very severe exclusion under the regime than any manifestation of religious extremism, although it is connected to such extremism.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that when I returned to the House after my brief absence voting rights in Seanad elections would have been extended to graduates of the University of Limerick.  I will continue to raise this issue until the democratic rights of such graduates and graduates of other appropriate third level institutions are adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I join in Senator Farrell's call regarding the ability of financial institutions to evict people when, in some instances, large amounts of money has been paid in interest.  It would seem that the law is weighted heavily in favour of the financial institutions.  I ask for amending legislation, in this area.  The consumer needs to be protected against the vested interests of big financial business.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader of the House for a debate on the future of Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> Europe, particularly with regard to our status for financial support.  Up to now we have enjoyed Objective 1 status.  That has been very helpful to the farming sector and others.  There is income convergence in some sections of the population but that is not the case in the west or in parts of the midlands.  Convergence of income has not taken place and many farmers are leaving the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader for a debate on the position of Ireland in the new structures that will be set down by the EU <i>vis-à-vis</i> status for funding.  It is important that as much of Ireland as possible retains Objective 1 status. Otherwise we will have nothing but forestry and tourist reservations in the west.  Now, two years <Col N="784" /> before these decisions are taken, is the time to debate this matter and this House is a suitable vehicle for that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children, in light of his remarks in the Dáil yesterday, to clarify the legal position regarding the role of a health board when it is acting <i>in loco parentis</i> for a raped, brutalised and pregnant child particularly in the light of the right to travel which is enunciated in an amendment to the Constitution and passed by a large majority of the electorate a number of years ago.  Does the Minister plan to bring in legislation to solve the serious legal and constitutional position for Irish women?  Does he consider it tolerable that a 13 year old child and her parents should be placed in the position in which they now are with regard to this tragic, complex and legal reality?  Does he propose to deal with this in a legislative context?  Does he consider it appropriate that this complex situation must, once again, be referred to the courts for a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my friend and colleague, Senator McGowan, who asked the Leader if he would consider a debate on the ever increasing concerns that are being expressed across the country at the proliferation of mobile telephone masts.  This has become a national issue.  I attended a meeting of very angry mothers, primarily, in Carrick-on-Shannon last Monday. There is a similar group in the Cathaoirleach's county, just across the river, objecting to the location of masts on ESB and Garda property which is, effectively, within the State's ownership. We are dealing with somewhat irrational but very genuinely held fears about the health hazard posed by these masts when they are located beside educational establishments.  In the absence of a debate I ask the Leader if the Government would consider following the lead of New Zealand which has banned such masts from sites adjacent to educational facilities and California, the home of the micro chip, which has banned corporate institutions from locating such masts beside educational facilities, and several local authorities in Scotland which have also followed the lead of California and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>There may be irrational fears and the case may be unproven, but it is difficult to reassure mothers of children attending schools that microwaves from these masts do not have a potential health hazard.  As a parent I would not wish to dissuade people from their genuine fears on this matter.  It is a national issue requiring debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Public Enterprise to attend the House to debate the recent train derailments in Counties Kerry and Roscommon and the condition of the national rail stock?  I requested a debate when Deputy Dukes was Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> The derailment in County Kerry is the third such accident on the stretch of rail track between Killarney and Tralee.  The seriousness of the matter was pointed out to the then Minister.  It is fortunate that there were no fatalities.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister emphasised that most of the designated EU funding for railways would be spent on the Dublin region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of rural Ireland also have a right to proper rail stock.  This important issue warrants an immediate debate with the Minister present.</P>
      <P>There should be a debate on fluctuating petrol and diesel prices.  A well located petrol station can charge exorbitant prices.  There can be a difference of up to 30p per gallon between one station and another, which is morally wrong. There would be uproar if the budget imposed a price increase of 4p on a gallon of petrol or diesel. There should be uniformity in pricing among all stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to publish the interim report of the north County Mayo enterprise initiative which she established following the closure of the Asahi complex in Killala?  The first of the workers are being laid off and between now and Christmas over 300 workers will be laid off.  Asahi was the anchor for local industry in north County Mayo.  The initiative was established by the Minister to find an alternative source of industry.  It is imperative that she make an announcement on the progress made by the task force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The format of the Order of Business for this week is similar to the format which I complained about last week.  What is at issue is not the length of time we give to legislation, such as the Children Bill, but the length of time between the Stages.  Second Stage of this Bill will be taken today with Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken tomorrow.  The Government is telling the House it does not have the time to consider the views of Senators.</P>
      <P>We are not using the House correctly.  The Leader has outlined the legislation to be introduced. It should be possible to introduce two Bills in one week and to ensure that no Bills are passed in any given week.  We should use the House to initiate Bills, as happened in the past.

      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the issue of literacy. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, spoke last week of the problem of literacy in adults and children and the possibility of testing children before they graduate from primary to secondary school.  Senator O'Toole answered that in the newspapers.  It is the sort of topic we could debate here and I support Senator O'Toole's call for such a debate.</P>

      <Col N="786" /> I congratulate and welcome the immediate response last week of the Minister for Education and Science to requests I and a number of others made for funding to be made available for technical education.  When a Minister responds in such a prompt fashion, it is obvious he recognises the problem.</P>
    <P>I have visited Clonmel regularly in the past three years and flooding seems to be a frequent occurrence there.</P>

      <P>A situation has arisen in Dublin because of the lack of co-operation between and foot dragging of the three children's hospitals over who should deliver childcare medical services. I ask that heads be banged together because this is a serious matter.  One of the inner city children's hospitals will close next year leaving only one in the area, Temple Street.  Planning should have begun some years ago to take cognisance of this fact but nothing has happened.  This is not the fault of the Department of Health and Children but is due to the lack of co-operation between the three children's hospitals in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Cathaoirleach will be pleased to hear I do not want heads banged together and neither do I want a debate.  We have had requests for about 12 already today.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food should provide funding to help South Dublin County Council implement the Control of Horses Act.  Two weeks ago a tragic accident nearly occurred, and last weekend the M50 and Clondalkin village were again visited by 20 ownerless horses.  Another tragedy is waiting to happen.  The council staff dealing with this problem are being attacked and need assistance from the Garda.  They need extra funding from the Department to try to solve this problem which has escalated beyond belief and will remain with us until the matter is properly handled.</P>

Will the Leader ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, if there is a change in Forbairt's policy on underpinning the economies of rural areas?  Will <Col N="787" /> he also ask her to explain to the House if there is a new emphasis and direction to the underpinning of the economy of the west and to the focus of its industrial development?</P>

      <P>The Leader was asked to raise the rape case with the Minister for Health and Children. During the past few days I have found it reprehensible that politicians have rushed to the media in what, in many instances, is a subtle attempt to thwart the will of the people by exploiting a terrible personal tragedy for the family. Any request to the Minister should be to mobilise the agencies of the State in order to provide the necessary support and assistance to the child and her family in their present plight.</P>
      <P>We should call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that the full rigours of the law are applied to the person responsible for the crime.</P>

      <P>I apologise, a Chathaoirligh, that was not my intention.  However, I have been disturbed that some of the recent comments have shown disregard for the family.  The debate on Northern Ireland should be balanced.  Some Members have requested that it should not be one-sided and should include institutionalised violence and crimes committed by British forces. It should also include the recent serious bombing attempt in Dundalk.</P>

      <P>We should have a debate on flooding.  Senator Quinn mentioned Clonmel but many other towns also suffer from this problem. There are many State agencies with responsibility in this area and they should come together to implement a single issue programme to overcome the problem.</P>
      <P>We have recently seen headlines concerning the &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of our waterways.  The over fertilisation of farms and the overuse of phosphates, while not the only cause, are leading to difficulties with clean water and the greening of waterways. In the past, State agencies encouraged the continuous use of phosphates and fertilisers which may now be causing the problem.  If we are to overcome this problem we should have a debate on the matter.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Haughey in requesting a debate on the appalling famine in Korea.  Such a debate would bring great credit on this House as it would demonstrate a willingness to overcome what may be perceived as a political <Col N="788" /> or ideological aversion to highlighting such humanitarian problems.</P>
      <P>In recent years I accepted invitations to visit North and South Korea.  I am keenly aware of the need to harmonise relationships between the two parts of this divided country.  I also realise that a huge challenge faces North Korea in endeavouring to adapt to changing world structures and realignments.  It behoves Ireland, which suffered a genocidal famine which was not of our making, to respond in a humanitarian manner.  We were misrepresented at that time and still are in regards to that Famine and I request the Leader to discuss this issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Regarding the points raised by Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello relating to the Children Bill, 1997, the debate on Second Stage will resume after Private Members' business tonight and is open ended.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased with the welcome Opposition parties have given the establishment of the new committees and I wish them well.  Senator Manning expressed concern about what happened last week at Lansdowne Road and the need for a debate on crowd control in general.  It is an important issue, particularly with so many young people congregating in places of entertainment &mdash; although there were also many middle aged and elderly people at the rugby match at Lansdowne Road &mdash; and I will be happy to arrange for a debate next week.  The authorities at Croke Park may be able to help the Rugby Union of Ireland in relation to some of these matters.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Quinn want a debate on literacy and I will arrange that.  Senator Costello raised his serious concern about the construction industry, particularly one company.  This could be raised in contributions to the debate on Second Stage of the Private Members' Bill, thereby getting a response of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello raised the need for a debate on banking; I have no problem arranging that. Senator Norris raised the issue of media coverage of proceedings of the House.  Many Members have discussed this over the years and we might raise it at the next party leaders' meeting to see how it can be progressed.  Senator Norris is correct is speaking about the poor coverage of the Europol Bill debate in the House.  RTÉ has been covering the Houses of the Oireachtas fairly well over the last number of weeks, but we have a problem with the print media which will have to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> Senators Norris, Walsh and Dardis called for a debate on Northern Ireland; we will have such a debate within the next three or four weeks.  I was trying to arrange a debate that would facilitate all the requests which have been made over the last number of weeks.  I expect to come to the House with something definite over the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane.  I understand that the 1995 mental health report was not discussed in either House.  I want to change this and will allow time for discussion of the report within three weeks.  It is a matter of great concern and I know many Members want to contribute.</P>
    <P>Senators McGowan, Mooney and Burke called for an urgent debate on the serious position many families, communities and parishes find themselves in in relation to the controversy over mobile telephone masts.  The leaders of the groups in the House should get together and arrange a discussion on the matter during Private Members' business as a matter of urgency.  If a consensus cannot be reached, it can be discussed during the next Fianna Fáil Private Members' time.  Senator Haughey and Senator Ó Murchú sought a debate on the famine in North Korea. Senator Fitzgerald and I have been in contact with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and he has agreed to come to the House on Thursday afternoon next week for an open ended discussion on foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes and Senator Dardis asked for a debate on agriculture.  I have no problem with that proposal particularly at this time and I will try to arrange it during the current session. Senator Farrell and Senator Finneran suggested a debate on the jury system.  That might be a suitable topic for discussion in Private Members' time.  There will not be sufficient time to hold debates on all the subjects suggested by Senators so there will have to be a meeting between the leaders of the various groups to see how the demands of Members can be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell and Senator Finneran also called for a debate on evictions.  I have no difficulty with the proposal but the problem will be allocating time for it.  Senator Doyle made a worthy suggestion last week and I apologise for not replying to it then.  I would like to facilitate his and Senator Finneran's suggestion of a debate on EU funding after 1999.  Everybody is anxious to find out what Ireland's position will be.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, who secured £8.4 billion in EU funding deserves our congratulations. Many Members of the Opposition were sceptical about his claims on his return from the Summit in Edinburgh but those claims were realised and he deserves our congratulations for his efforts in that regard.  There will be a day long debate on EU funding at the earliest opportunity. Senators will be given advance notice of the date because it is one of most important topics for debate suggested today.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor suggested a debate on the tobacco industry.  Perhaps Senator Manning would <Col N="790" /> facilitate such a debate during Fine Gael Private Members' time because there will not be sufficient time during this session.</P>

      <P>Senator Jackman asked for a debate on the voting rights of third level institutions. I doubt that any Member would object to such a debate and I will allocate time for it. Senator O'Meara and Senator Walsh called for support for the 13 year old girl and her family in view of the tragic circumstances in which they find themselves.  The House will be aware that the Minister yesterday announced his intention to publish a Green Paper which will be referred to the constitutional review group.  We should await the publication of that paper before deciding what we should do in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Dan Kiely made a lengthy contribution about the serious problems with the Tralee-Killarney rail line.  A similar problem arose last week with the rail line in the Cathaoirleach's constituency. The Minister for Public Enterprise has sought an urgent report on the matter and I will delighted to allocate time for a relevant debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey and Senator Chambers asked for a debate on trade and employment and the preliminary interim report on north Mayo.  The Minister will be in the House in the future to deal with legislation but, in the meantime, I will try to get further information on the matter for the Senators.  I will see what information I can acquire for the two Senators.  Senators Quinn and Callanan are seeking a debate on the serious flooding which occurs in certain parts of Ireland every winter and spring.  If we can find time to debate the Office of Public Works report on flooding we will do so in the next session.  Senator Fitzpatrick is seeking a debate on the future of children's hospitals in Dublin and drawing up a co-ordinated plan.  I would be delighted to afford the Senator time for this and will speak to the Minister for Health and Children in relation to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Children Bill, 1997, provides for important changes in the operation of the law in relation to guardianship of children, rights of access to children, the conduct of proceedings in relation to family disputes concerning children and the hearing of evidence in those proceedings. It creates, in the interests of children, a system of guardian <i>ad litem</i> and of legal representation of such guardians.  The Bill is in line with commitments given in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium in relation to support of parents and their children and in relation to a review of the courts system to protect children. The Government supports the principle of the Bill and it took early action to have it restored to the Dáil Order Paper.</P>
      <P>The Bill now before the House is substantially the Bill which was restored to the Dáil Order Paper but it has, following detailed examination and debate, undergone a good deal of technical amendment.  It is a Bill which, I think the House will agree, will help to build on the many reforms of our family laws which have been introduced over the past decade under various Governments and which have received the benefits of debate in both Houses.</P>
      <P>The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which the Bill amends, is the definitive legislative measure for resolution of disputes in relation to children.  It provides that any court in deciding questions relating to guardianship, custody of, or access to, a child shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. Senators will, I am sure, quickly appreciate that the principle of what is best in the interests of a child is one that will continually come to mind in the course of our debate on the Bill and that it is as relevant today as it has been in earlier decades. That is the experience in other jurisdictions.  It is the principle which has guided international conventions in relation to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I set out the main details of the Bill for the information of the House, I should like to point out that the Bill takes into account recommendations contained in a number of reports of the Law Reform Commission.  These are the reports on child sexual abuse, oaths and affirmations, the rule against hearsay in civil cases and family courts.  I take this opportunity to thank the Law Reform Commission for its enlightened work in those areas.  It is expected that the Bill will facilitate, in due course, ratification of the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights which Ireland signed in January 1996.  That European Convention complements the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The aim of the European convention <Col N="801" /> is to promote the rights of children in family proceedings affecting them, to grant them procedural rights and to facilitate the exercise of these rights by ensuring that children are informed of them and allowed to participate in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill contains standard provisions in relation to short title, commencement, collective citation, interpretation and expenses.  The Bill will come into operation one month after the date of its passing with certain exceptions which are to be the subject of commencement provisions. These exceptions relate to six of the proposed 12 new sections which are being inserted into the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, by section 11 of the Bill and to Part III of the Bill in its entirety.  Commencement orders are required in respect of those provisions to ensure that the administrative arrangements necessary for their successful application are in place.</P>
    <P>Some of the excepted provisions of section 11, for example, will have an impact on the work of the Probation and Welfare Service and the health boards and these organisations will have to be consulted about the manner in which these new responsibilities can be accommodated.  Similarly, the provisions of Part III may necessitate the installation in courthouses of additional facilities for evidence to be taken by live television link or by means of a video recording, although such facilities are already available for the purposes of criminal proceedings in the Circuit and District Courts in the Four Courts in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill gives effect to amendments in the law on the guardianship of children.  It does so in the main by amending the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  Guardianship is a long standing concept in the law.  It is the collection of rights and duties which a parent has towards his or her child.  It includes the right to custody of a child and the duty to care for and control the child.  All guardianship rights are subject to limitation by order of a court.  For example, where married parents separate a court may make an order under section 11 of the 1964 Act granting one parental guardian custody of his or her child.  The non-custodial parent retains the status of guardian and he or she must be consulted on all matters affecting the welfare of the child.  No custody order made in guardianship proceedings is ever final but is subject to review at any time if it is established that factors taken into account by the court since the previous order have changed.  A child ceases to be subject to guardianship when he or she attains the age of majority, that is to say 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The 1964 Act provides that the married parents of a child are the guardians of that child jointly. In the case of unmarried parents, the mother is sole guardian of the child.  Until the Status of Children Act, 1987, it was not possible for an unmarried father to establish guardianship rights in respect of his child other than by subsequently marrying the mother of the child.  The 1987 Act amended the 1964 Act by empowering the court, on the application of an unmarried father, to <Col N="802" /> appoint him to be a guardian of his child jointly with the mother.  It also provides for a special informal court procedure to be used where the mother consents to the appointment of the father as guardian and the father's name is registered as such on the births register.</P>
    <P>I think Senators would readily share my view that the law should facilitate, as far as possible, the sharing of responsibilities of unmarried parents in relation to children.  Some 12,500 children are now born to unmarried parents annually.  At present, approximately 700 applications are made to the court each year by unmarried fathers who wish to become guardians of their children jointly with the mother &mdash; representing an increase of 200 per cent since 1990.  Of these 700, 400 are by agreement.  The effect of what is provided for in section 4 of the Bill is to remove the need to go to court where the father and mother are in agreement on the question of guardianship.</P>
    <P>Section 4 repeals and re-enacts section 2 of the 1964 Act.  The main differences between the old section 2 and the new section 2 are that a new paragraph (c) has been included in the definition &ldquo;father&rdquo; and a new subsection (4) has been added.  The effect of these amendments is to extend the definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo; to include the father of a non-marital child whose relationship with the mother of the child satisfies conditions specified in subsection (4).  Where these criteria are satisfied the unmarried father can acquire guardianship rights jointly with the mother without having to go to court.</P>
    <P>The conditions are that the father and mother (a) have not married each other; (b) declare that they are the father and mother of the child concerned; (c) agree to the appointment of the father as guardian of the child; (d) have entered into arrangements regarding the custody of, and as the case may be, access to the child and (e) have made a statutory declaration to the effect that they have complied with all these conditions.  The requirement of a statutory declaration will attach the necessary degree of formality to the process.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 8 of the Bill make certain consequential technical changes only to the 1964 Act. Section 7 of the Bill makes clear that where the unmarried father is appointed guardian by virtue of the new procedure he may be removed from that appointment only by the court.</P>
    <P>In so far as disputed applications by unmarried fathers for guardianship, custody or access are concerned, and for that matter applications by spouses or former spouses for custody or access are concerned, the new section 11D of the 1964 Act, as inserted by section 9 of the Bill, is relevant. It provides that, in considering whether to make an order in relation to guardianship, custody of or access to a child, the court must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.  This new provision in the Bill is inspired by a provision in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> These earlier sections 4 to 8, inclusive, of the Bill have generated the most interest among some commentators but I think, on further analysis, Senators will agree that the remaining sections are also of particular significance. Section 9 inserts four new sections &mdash; sections 11A, 11B, 11C and 11D &mdash; into the Act of 1964. Section 11 as it stands in the 1964 Act is the section under which most applications in relation to custody and access disputes are made in the courts.  That section empowers the court to give any direction it thinks proper in disputes concerning children.  This includes a power to make orders granting custody of a child to the father and mother jointly in suitable cases.</P>
    <P>The perception among some interest groups is that the law does not permit the making of such orders or that the courts too rarely grant such orders.  The new section 11A is intended to highlight the discretion that the court has under section 11 to order joint custody.  Joint custody may involve a variety of arrangements.  These may range from a situation where a child spends a certain number of overnights separately with each parent during the week to a situation where parents, although formally separated, continue to live in the same household and are in a position to operate a less specific joint custody arrangement. The Bill does not draw a line indicating where joint custody ends and sole custody or access begins nor does it specify a list of criteria which should be used by the court in reaching its decision.  Decisions of this nature are premised on an array of considerations in an infinite variety of cases and discretion in the matter is best left for the courts to exercise, having regard to what is in the best interests of a child.</P>
    <P>Again, new section 11A regarding joint custody should also be read in conjunction with new section 11D which requires the court to have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>In the course of preparation of the Bill, representations were made that persons who are closely related to a child in one form or another should have an independent right to apply for access to that child.  The new section 11B caters for such cases.  It provides that any person who is a relative of a child or has acted <i>in loco parentis</i> to a child may apply to the court for an order of access to that child.  The intention is to reflect the fact that continued contact with relatives such as grandparents can often be in the child's best interests.  This circumstance may particularly arise in cases where the ties between the parents of children are broken.  The court would, in making orders, have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that a party must first apply for the leave of the court to bring an application under section 11B and subsection (3) specifies various matters to be taken into account <Col N="804" /> by the court in deciding whether to grant leave. These include the wishes of the child's guardians, the applicant's connection with the child and the risk, if any, of the application disrupting the child's life to the extent that the child would be harmed by it.  The purpose of this filter process is to ensure that unmeritorious or vexatious claims are prevented from proceeding to a full hearing.</P>
    <P>The new section 11C is a technical amendment which gives legislative backing to rules of court which provide that any order made under the 1964 Act shall not be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal against that order unless the court directs otherwise.  The new section applies to any court.  I have already dealt with new section 11D.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill inserts a new Part IV in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, containing 12 new sections &mdash; sections 19 to 30, inclusive &mdash;&mdash; with which I will now deal.  These new sections are, in effect, a charter for the rights of children in cases of dispute.  They offer a comprehensive range of provisions which are designed to safeguard the interests of children in guardianship, custody and access proceedings.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised by those involved in the area of family conflict that counselling and mediation can be of immense benefit in helping couples to sort out their difficulties.  The instinctive tendency towards a court based solution can often undermine the ability that even the most embittered couples have within them to reach a voluntary settlement.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the courts are, and should always be, a last resort for the settlement of differences between parents for the betterment of themselves and their children.  The reality is that a high proportion of custody and access disputes could be settled on a voluntary basis without ever getting to court.  The proposed Part IV of the 1964 Act gives legislative backing to that approach.  It mirrors, to some extent, provisions which apply under the laws in relation to judicial separation and divorce and they will have application for the most part in the District Court.  It is the approach which is urged on states by the 1996 Council of Europe Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights.</P>
    <P>The new provisions provide as follows.  Subsection (2) of the new section 20 requires a solicitor, before instituting proceedings on behalf of an applicant for guardianship, custody of or access to a child, to discuss with the applicant the possibility of engaging in counselling or mediation to resolve the dispute.  Where appropriate, the solicitor must also discuss the possibility of a deed or agreement with the other party on the issues in dispute.  Subsection (3) requires the solicitor to certify to the court that he or she has done so at the time of the institution of proceedings and that he or she has provided the names and addresses of persons qualified to give counselling or mediation to the applicant.  If the documents instituting proceedings are not accompanied by such a certificate the court may adjourn the proceedings for such period as it considers reasonable <Col N="805" /> to enable the solicitor to fulfil these obligations.</P>
    <P>The new section 21 contains provisions in relation to the respondent's solicitor similar to those in new section 20 in relation to the applicant's solicitor.  The new section 22 empowers the court to order an adjournment or further adjournment so as to facilitate attempts by the parties to reach agreement on some or all of the terms of a settlement.  Either party may at any time request that the hearing be resumed and the court shall, subject to any other power it has to adjourn proceedings, resume the hearing.</P>
    <P>The new section 23 provides that any oral or written communication between the parties and a third party for the purposes of seeking agreement and any record of such communication is not admissible as evidence in any court.  These new sections 20 to 23, inclusive, are aimed at facilitating as far as possible a non-adversarial approach to disputes in relation to children and to provide an alternative dispute resolution mechanism of the issues.</P>
    <P>The new section 24 enables agreements relating to rights of custody and access to a child to be made a rule of court and will enable the enforcement powers of the court to be invoked in respect of any breach of the agreement as if the agreement had been an order of the court.  The new sections 25 to 28, inclusive, are concerned with ensuring that, where litigation is underway, the rights of children are not alone protected but actively promoted.  The new section 25 requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable having regard to the age and understanding of a child, to consider the wishes of the child in proceedings to which section 3 of the 1964 Act applies &mdash; in other words, proceedings in which the welfare of the child is the primary consideration. Children will have insights into their lives that are important for the court to take into account in any decision making.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, particularly as a child gets older, failure to make an order which takes account of his or her wishes may, at least in some cases, be very upsetting for the child and, therefore, counterproductive to the enhancement of the child's welfare.  It is important to acknowledge, of course, that in many cases there are real problems in placing weight on the wishes of the child or even in ascertaining them.  These are factors which the judge must decide on, taking into account the unique circumstances of each case. The new section 25 replaces in more modern terms section 17 of the 1964 Act.</P>
    <P>The new section 26 extends to the District Court, in proceedings under the Act of 1964, the power that the High and Circuit Courts have to order social reports from the Probation and Welfare Service, a person nominated by a health board or any other person.  The new section 27 provides that a child to whom custody or access proceedings relate need not be brought before the court to be present for the hearing unless the court so directs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> The new section 28 takes into account recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in its report on family courts.  It empowers a court to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> in proceedings under the 1964 Act where the court is satisfied that it is in a child's best interests to do so.  The role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> will be to interview the child, assess his or her needs and inform the courts of those needs and of the child's views.  Subsection (2) specifies criteria which the court must take into account in deciding whether to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem.</i> These include the age and understanding of the child, the content of any social reports which are available on any question affecting the welfare of the child, the wishes of the child and any submissions made to the court by the parties to the proceedings or any other person to whom they relate.  Subsection (3) provides that the person from whom a social report was obtained may, notwithstanding that fact, also be appointed guardian <i>ad litem.</i></P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of the new section 28 empowers the court to order that the guardian <i>ad litem</i> be legally represented where exceptional and grave circumstances exist.  Subsection (5) provides that the fees and expenses of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> and the costs of legal representation may be paid by such parties to the proceedings and in such proportions as the court may determine.  The new section 29 provides similarly in relation to the cost of any mediation or counselling services.  The new section 30 is a jurisdiction provision only.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is a technical provision which provides for the use of modern terminology in the 1964 Act.  It provides that the term &ldquo;child&rdquo; replaces the term &ldquo;infant&rdquo; where it is used in the Act of 1964 except for references to &ldquo;infant&rdquo; in the Short and Long Titles of that Act.  Section 13 makes amendments to section 28(5) of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, and allows for the granting of a civil legal aid certificate by the Legal Aid Board to a guardian <i>ad litem</i> appointed under the 1964 Act where either of the parties to the proceedings is in receipt of civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>Section 14 amends section 5 of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986, to provide for an increase in the maximum penalties for breaches of custody and access orders in the District Court.  The fine is being increased from £200 to £1,500 and the term of imprisonment from six months to 12 months. The existing penalties are out of line with the jurisdiction generally of the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 15 amends sections 8 and 8(a) of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  Those sections of the 1976 Act allow maintenance agreements to be made a rule of court in the Circuit and High Courts.  The effect of section 15 is to allow maintenance agreements, other than separation agreements, to be made a rule of court in the District Court also.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with Part III of the Bill regarding evidence of children.  Section 20 defines the scope of Part III; it applies to civil proceedings before any court concerning the welfare of a child provided they have commenced after the commencement <Col N="807" /> of that Part.  A particular difficulty is how to treat the evidence of children and the hearsay evidence of expert witnesses such as social workers in proceedings involving children. Over the years the courts have in certain circumstances admitted hearsay evidence of social workers in wardship cases while in others the evidence of social workers has been treated as expert testimony.  Such decisions have resulted in a degree of uncertainty in this area of the law. The provisions in Part III of the Bill are designed to eliminate this uncertainty and have been welcomed by members of the legal and social work professions.</P>
    <P>The changes are intended to provide greater flexibility in receiving the evidence of children in proceedings affecting their future welfare by amending existing provisions in three major respects.  First, it will be possible for children to give evidence in court via a live television link. Second, the Bill provides for the admissibility of out of court statements made by children which up to now were excluded by virtue of the rule of law relating to hearsay.  Third, the Bill enables the court to receive the evidence of children under the age of 14 years otherwise than on oath or affirmation.  I ask Senators to note as I go through Part III that these provisions apply to a person, who is of full age but who has a mental disability to such an extent that it is not possible for him or her to live independently, as they apply to a child.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that children may give evidence in cases concerning their welfare by live television link from within or outside the State with the leave of the court.  This mirrors similar provisions in criminal law where sexual offences or offences involving violence or threats of violence are concerned.  Subsection (2) provides that this evidence shall be video recorded.  The intention is to remove from the child the burden of having to give evidence a second time should circumstances require it.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for the admissibility of such a video recording in evidence, subject to conditions, if, for example, the case is appealed to the Circuit Court.  Subsection (3) makes clear that a child who knowingly gives false evidence from outside the State by television link shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Much can be said about the remaining sections. However, Senators have heard a sufficient amount to enable them assess the legislation.  I look forward to the debate and I will deal with the other sections as required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  Before I deal with the Bill, I wish to refer to the horrendous case involving a pregnant 13 year old child. At present, she is at the centre of the same type of controversy I witnessed when I was in the Seanad between 1989 and 1992 regarding the X case.  The broadcaster Pat Kenny referred to the current case in his interview with the Minister this <Col N="808" /> morning as the X2 case.  We thought at that time such a case would never arise again.</P>
      <P>There are references in <i>The Irish Times</i> today to President McAleese's view of Ireland as a forward looking, progressive country.  The newspaper states that this view is a counterpoint to the stark reality of the position of the 13 year old and the awful predicament in which she, her family, the health board and the State find themselves. We have collective responsibility as citizens of Ireland.  As a teacher I witness 12 and 13 year old children coming into first year in secondary school.  They appear so vulnerable at that age.  It shocks us all to the core to discover that a child who should be going through the normal traumas of teenagehood has taken on the enormity of adulthood while still a child.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, particularly with regard to the upgrading of the law on guardianship, custody of and access to children and the evidence of children in civil proceedings.  We have always prided ourselves on the fact that the nation cherishes its children.  However, the welfare of children is one of the most important issues facing us.  We must accept the changing nature of society, the enormous level of family breakdown and the changes in family life.  These are due to the pressures people face as the country teeters towards the new millennium.  In many cases it is not an ideal society for young people.  It is consumer driven and family life is constantly under attack.  The Bill is a symptom of that society and I am glad it is being addressed.  However, I have a number of queries about points raised by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The nuclear family which was relatively new ten or 20 years ago is fading away.  The extended family now exists only in Third World countries or Eastern society where grandparents are very much part of family life.  That is not the case in urban Ireland or, because of demographic decline, in rural Ireland.  The Minister was very eloquent when being interviewed by Pat Kenny today.  He referred to crime, the marginalised and drugs, all of which are relevant to this Bill.  The Minister should show the same enthusiasm toward the disadvantaged, particularly children, that he displayed in Opposition for introducing zero tolerance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Celtic Tiger is a cruel type of image.  Tigers are not known for their compatibility with humans, and the Celtic Tiger is extremely voracious, feeding from certain elements of society.  It is alive in the prospering economic life of Ireland, but in Limerick, for example, there is still a wide gap between the haves and the have nots.  Our enthusiastic acceptance of the Celtic Tiger image tends to camouflage the hidden Ireland of poverty, disadvantage, child abuse and violence against women, and those matters are being kept from the media.  If we want to enter the new millennium progressively and ideally, we must take steps to ensure that our children and grandchildren, who will be the adults after the <Col N="809" /> year 2000, will bring our moral codes and values with them.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to guardianship <i>ad litem.  I am particularly happy the Bill provides that a court can appoint a qualified person to act solely in the interests of the child being the minor infant, rep</i>resenting his or her interests <i>in loco parentis,</i> with no other reference to the parents or the State. The court must have discretion to grant legal representation to the guardian <i>ad litem,</i> and this provision is very welcome.  However, it is regrettable that in cases of severe marital breakdown, where there may be a lack of parenting skills, the child can be sidelined by parents in their wrangling and emotional trauma.  This can happen in their fight for emotional or even financial supremacy.  I welcome the provision that guarantees the child's interests solely will be represented by a professional person where the court sees fit.</P>
    <P>It is becoming more and more frequent in cases of marital breakdown that grandparents or near relatives apply for access to children.  That is visionary and is to be welcomed.  It is a realistic appraisal of the situation by the Minister.  The child will feel welcome with a grandparent, aunt, uncle or any other relative.  Does the Minister envisage the involvement of an interested neighbour who would have the interests of the child at heart?  This would not necessarily be in an adoptive or fostering situation.  Does the Bill include situations where a person unrelated to the child could be granted access if deemed fit by the court?  The bonding between a child and a grandparent or other relative happens over a period, and this bond should be kept intact.  This Bill takes that into account; this was not the case with previous legislation which did not take changing society into account.</P>
    <P>The issue of counselling, mediation or legal representation of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> is extraordinarily important.  Court procedures can be traumatic for adults, let alone children and should be the last resort.  Mediation and counselling are very important.  Will those facilities be readily available to people who do not have the financial resources to avail of expert advice?  The Minister may say they will have free legal aid, but the people involved in that scheme are not in a position to deal immediately with these family problems in my area.</P>
    <P>People will want this Bill implemented immediately, and if the financial and personnel resources are not there to do so, it will be a sad day for all sections of society.  Backup services and funding must be addressed.  That is crucial because this remedial action will prevent a great deal of distress and marital disorder.  Bringing an ordinary person into a court puts the fear of God into them, whether it is for a minor or major offence, and the emotional life of children would be thrown into turmoil.  Therefore, every effort should be made to address the problem before the case comes to court.</P>
    <P>Could another word be found for &ldquo;custody&rdquo; in this Bill?  This point was raised in the Dáil.  &ldquo;Custody&rdquo;<Col N="810" /> has very negative connotations and &ldquo;care&rdquo; may not be appropriate either; references to children being taken into care has changed the perception of that word.  Legal expertise could give us another word, perhaps &ldquo;ongoing parenting&rdquo;, as &ldquo;custody&rdquo; is too legislative and is very emotive. The Minister should examine this matter on Committee Stage, otherwise we are sending the wrong signals.  Finding exactly the right word might be impossible, but it should be examined.</P>
    <P>Regarding evidence given by children through live television link in certain civil proceedings, district court judges in my area have refused to sit in 18th century courtrooms.  In that century the rooms may have been attractive but they have deteriorated since then.  Without appearing negative, before we discuss technology that is obviously needed we should look at the physical arrangement of these rooms.  They are grim and formidable outside, but there should be basic accommodation inside.  Limerick County Council has had to supply chairs to courts around the county.  Is it practical to believe video link-ups and television cameras will be available immediately in courts?  I hope they will, otherwise this legislation will be idealistic rather than practical.</P>
    <P>I hope video evidence will not be taken in courthouses because they are not particularly suitable venues for children who would prefer evidence to be taken elsewhere, for example, in judges chambers, although I know that would not be possible in areas other than the capital city. Perhaps we should consider the type of family courts we see regularly on American television. Such a facility, rather than stark and Dickensian courthouses, should be available to children, particularly during their vulnerable teenage years.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to what might be a contradiction in the Bill.  Section 28 (1) states that in civil proceedings &ldquo;the evidence of a child who has not attained the age of 14 years may be received otherwise than on oath or affirmation if the court is satisfied that the child is capable of giving an intelligible account of events which are relevant to the proceedings.&rdquo;.  Section 28(2), however, states: &ldquo;Any child whose evidence is received in accordance with subsection (1) and who makes a statement material in the proceedings concerned which the child knows to be false or does not believe to be true, shall be guilty of an offence and on conviction shall be liable to be dealt with as if guilty of perjury.&rdquo;.  I consider that extremely harsh and a contradiction given that the child has not taken an oath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not know if a child giving evidence has been grilled or drilled by a parent. Will we be able to ascertain whether a child is speaking from his or her viewpoint or if a child is under stress and is saying something, as teenagers do, which will get him or her out of court as quickly as possible?  A parent may drill a child to <Col N="811" /> say what they want.  In such instances, it would be extremely harsh to find a child guilty of perjury. A child may be frightened and in an environment with which he or she is unfamiliar.  This is an extremely harsh measure and may be contradictory.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the UN convention which will be reflected in our legislation.  It is stated that in considering whether to make an order under section 6A, 11, 14 or 16 the court shall respect the right of the child who is separated from one or both parents to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis except if it is contrary to the child's best interest.  That is probably an improvement but is it in accordance with the thrust of the UN convention?  I hoped for a more positive provision to establish joint custody as the preferred option.  Given all the equality legislation on the Statute Book, a stronger case should have been made for joint custody.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Family produced an interim report.  While I would not like the Bill to be delayed, how much of the interim report has been taken on board in this legislation?  I presume there has been close contact between the Minister and members of the commission, which I hope will be ongoing.  Perhaps the recommendations of the Commission on the Family will be taken on board on Committee Stage.  Although we await the final report, the interim one is important.</P>
      <P>It is also important that the main elements of the Bill are implemented.  I hope the Minister has taken on board what I said.  We are all concerned about the rights of children.  We must ensure the effective implementation of the Bill and, therefore, provide the necessary financial resources and personnel to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I laud the Minister who has brought six Bills before the Oireachtas, even though he is six months only in office.  If he continues in that vein, we will be extremely busy.  In Opposition the Minister gave clear commitments which were included in the Programme for Government on which he is acting.  I would like to place that on the record because often Ministers are criticised unfairly.</P>
      <P>The most important feature of the Bill is the rights of children in cases of guardianship.  We are dealing with the rights of children, not parents. The Bill makes an important provision which allows a father, who is not married to the mother of his child, to be appointed guardian of the child with the agreement of the mother and without the need to go to court.  That was a contentious area and this is a step in the right direction.  Apart from its concern for children, this Bill makes some important changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been changes in society over the past 20 to 25 years.  If this Bill had been brought before the House 20 to 25 years ago, I am not sure it would have been passed.  At that time there was considerable moral opprobrium and <Col N="812" /> stigma attaching to children born outside wedlock. That stigma also attached to the mother and the family.  In most instances children born outside wedlock were not recognised and were given up for adoption.  Over the past two decades mothers, in most cases, have opted to keep children born outside wedlock and to rear and acknowledge them openly.  That is a welcome development as far as I am concerned.  This Bill recognises that the father has rights to his child.</P>
    <P>Statistics show the broadening of society's views.  Seven hundred applications are made to courts by unmarried fathers each year, which is an increase of 200 per cent since 1990.  While 700 applications out of the 12,500 children born to unmarried parents is only a small proportion, the number will increase in the millennium.  I welcome that more applications will be made by unmarried fathers for guardianship of their natural children.  Four hundred of those applications were made by agreement.  This Bill provides for consensus, counselling, mediation and that every effort be made, by agreement, outside the court. No-one wants to force a child to go to court in this situation.  The previous speaker mentioned the trauma suffered by a child in court, in front of judges, solicitors and lawyers.</P>
    <P>The development in this Bill to allow for unsworn evidence is welcome.  The child can give his or her evidence to the judge in a simple manner or can do so by video link.  There was a fear for many years that children would be intimidated. In this day and age, we often lose sight of the ability of children aged five, six or seven years, in first, second or third class in national school to make decisions.  They are more intelligent and clever than we give them credit for.  We will never have a Utopia but these new developments ensure that children can give evidence without fear of a systematic court system involving wigs and gowns.</P>
    <P>Where a father can apply by consent for sole or joint custody, certain criteria must be laid before the court.  This is important and will speed up the process as it can be done in the District Court.  If there is agreement by the parties, through statutory declaration, the father can gain joint custody by consent.  Hitherto, under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the father was not entitled to such custody.  If he had the courage to pursue such rights he had to go through the courts which, apart from the stigma and moral opprobrium, involved major costs.  In many cases, fathers forgot about the issue.</P>
    <P>The conditions with which parents must comply are set out clearly.  They must not be married to each other, they must both declare they are the parents of the child, they must both agree to the appointment of the father as guardian of the child and declare that they have entered into an arrangement regarding the custody of, or access to, the child.  This is done by statutory declaration which simplifies proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 20(2) specifies that a solicitor for the applicant conducting a case must certify that certain <Col N="813" /> advice was given and that counselling and mediation were made available.  From my legal experience, I know of the amazing lack of knowledge regarding the provision of counselling and mediation.  In circumstances where this may fall through the court will eventually resolve it.  The solicitor for the respondent, normally in a dispute between the father and mother, has similar obligations. If the judge believes the certification required by the court from the solicitor is not adequate the case can be adjourned to ensure that avenues of counselling and mediation are fully explored.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the increase of minimum penalties by the District Court for breaches of custody and access orders.  The monetary penalty will increase from £200 to £1,500 and the term of imprisonment will increase from six to twelve months.  This provision is welcome as the previous penalties were not a sufficient deterrent to breaches of custody and access orders.</P>
    <P>Section 15 amends sections 8 and 8A of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  Those sections of that Act allow maintenance agreements to be made a rule of court in the Circuit and High Courts.  This Bill provides that these agreements, other than separation agreements, can be made a rule of the District Court.  This will also speed up the process.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides greater flexibility for the receiving of evidence from children.  They can give evidence in court via live television link or provide out of court statements, which was hitherto prohibited under the hearsay rule.  This is important because outside the confines of the court, a child may make an honest and open statement to a guardian, friend or grandparent. Such a statement can now be admitted as evidence. The requirement of giving evidence under oath or affirmation no longer exists.  There is also an important provision that, where one parent moves with the child to another state evidence can be given by television link from outside the State.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very welcome.  As Senator Jackman said, there is not enough time for a more detailed and intense debate on this Stage.  Because of the number of Members who wish to contribute to the debate, I wish to share my remaining time with Senator Chambers.</P>

I wish him well in his good work.  One can see from the <Col N="814" /> changes which have taken place and the legislation which is being introduced that he is using his able mind in the interests of the State and its citizens.</P>
      <P>Health board social workers, most of whom are involved in the protection of children, have one of the most difficult and trying jobs.  As society changes, the workload of health boards substantially increases.  The breakdown of traditional marriage structures places a huge burden of responsibility on the State and those employed to protect the interests of children.  I welcome the Bill which I hope will provide those employed to safeguard the interests of children with a more effective and efficient way of so doing, particularly where relationships have broken down.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill the interests of the child are paramount, which is necessary and reflects the wish of the people.  There is a human aspect to this legislation in that it obliges solicitors to discuss with applicants for custody or guardianship the possibility of seeking advice and counselling on such applications.  If legislation does not have a human element it is merely an instrument rather than something which helps people.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes on the taking of evidence which will help the difficult work of social workers who deal with children and protect their interests.  I hope these changes will help to protect children in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has spent a good deal of time here and I hope he enjoys his visits as much as we do. I wish the print media would follow the example of RTÉ in covering these debates.  The Europol Bill, which was very important, was covered by RTÉ only.</P>
      <P>This is a very important Bill.  It is essentially the same Bill which was proposed by the former Minister, Deputy Taylor, on 25 April 1997, updating the law on guardianship, custody, right of access to children, giving greater say to children in custody disputes, encouraging the resolution of such disputes out of court, giving a right to the child's natural father to become a guardian by agreement with the mother without having to go court and providing access rights for grandparents. I received numerous items of correspondence on this matter so I am glad this Bill has been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome, in particular, the emphasis on alternative dispute resolution procedures and the <Col N="815" /> introduction of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> concept under section 11.  That battle was fought in this House.  I proposed the introduction for the first time of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> in the Child Care Bill. We had a huge argument on it.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, took that debate and, with great courage, went back to Cabinet and the Bill was recommissioned. Therefore, the guardian <i>ad litem</i> concept came from this House and I greatly welcome its automatic inclusion in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the context of this Bill, for example, article 7.1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states:</P>
    <P>The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, in as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.</P>
    <P>The House should note the use of the plural &ldquo;parents&rdquo;. Article 9.3 states:</P>
    <P>State parties shall respect the right of the child who is separated from one or both parents to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child's best interests.</P>
    <P>Article 9.1 states:</P>
    <P>State parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when such separation is necessary in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>That seems to be the moral and intellectual context in which this Bill should be placed, together with article 42.1 of the Constitution in which the State &ldquo;guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill seems to have an exclusive emphasis on article 42.1. The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, stated on Report Stage in the Dáil on 5 November 1997:</P>
    <P>What we know at present, as the Constitution group has indicated, is that the rights as such of a child are not expressly referred to in article 41.  Rather, the focus is on the right of the family, not the individual members.  For this reason, the new section 11D of the 1964 Act, as inserted by section 9 of the Bill, is drafted in a way that coheres with article 41 of the Constitution as it stands.</P>
    <P>Must this be so?  Although the Bill redirects some of the emphasis, it does not seem, due to this hesitation, to place the interests of the child at the centre of our focus.  Does this suggest, for example, that the Guardianship of Infants Act is unconstitutional because it refers to the right of the child?  It seems a rather extreme interpretation of the Constitution.  I would like, also, to <Col N="816" /> refer to the fact that, in some of the wording, it appears to assume that it is unnatural and exceptional for a father to wish to have access to a child or to assume custody.  I would like to think that things have changed greatly in this country over the last few years.  It is a lovely sight to see young men with their children in tow, pushing them in prams or slung across their shoulders.  It is very moving to see the way in which men are no longer ashamed to be seen in the role of parents.  This transformation has taken place over the last 20or 30 years.  We must make the assumption that most fathers will naturally wish to have an involvement in the family as is proper.  In the words of John Waters in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 May, &ldquo;By presupposing irresponsibility as the natural response of an unmarried father the culture builds a wall against him ensuring that he could only apply for, or obtain, guardianship in a manner subservient to the wishes of the mother&rdquo;. This, regrettably, remains the case under the provisions of this Bill and for this reason I will put down amendments.</P>
    <P>We must look at a whole series of assumptions. I refer to a subsequent article in <i>The Irish Times.</i>&ldquo;Statistics give the lie to the myth of a good mother,&rdquo; by John Waters on November 11.  John Waters looks at a situation where video cameras had been placed in hospital wards and cases of child abuse had been recorded.  It was not said in the earlier sections of the news that in all 39 cases the abusing parents were mothers.  There were attempted suffocations, the actual breaking of limbs, one broken arm, recorded on camera.  I would not wish this to be seen as any kind of misogynistic impact of my own but Mr. Waters makes the very effective point that if these abusers had been fathers that aspect would have been splashed across the media.  We must bear in mind the equality of parenthood as stated very clearly in those sections of the United Nations convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill has the effect that an unmarried father need not apply to the court in order to become a guardian of his children if the mother agrees &mdash; we require the agreement of the mother straight off &mdash; if the parents have made a statutory declaration and they have made arrangements regarding custody.  In so far as the Bill removes the requirement to go to court it is welcome but it falls a long way short of what is required in order to redress the position of unmarried fathers.  Unmarried fathers should be entitled to have relations with their children on an independent basis.  It should not be merely at the whim of the mother particularly as, very often, children are used as weapons of revenge, and access to custody is a very significant weapon in this matter.  The Bill should provide that mothers cannot unreasonably withold their consent to the father obtaining guardianship so that we have a level playing field.</P>
    <P>With regard to maintenance section 8 appears to be good.  However, I would like the Minister to address the point of whether this provision discriminates <Col N="817" /> against unmarried parents.  It is a pity there is no mechanism to ensure that where those payments are made they are spent exclusively on the child.  We make sure they are paid to the parent or the guardian but we do not know where they go.  They could be spent on bingo, on booze or on cigarettes.  The Bill does not monitor the spending of that money and I think that is a pity.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for three new sections to be inserted: section 11A makes a declaration that the court may, if it thinks it appropriate, make an order granting custody of a child to the child's father and mother jointly.  I think that is a pity because it places the burden of proof on the father; &ldquo;where it is appropriate&rdquo; implies that this is exceptional.  The burden of proof immediately is put on the parent who is trying to uphold and protect the custodial rights and obligations of both parents and consequently the best interests of the children.  The burden of proof should, of course, be on the other parent, the one who is trying to prevent a biological parent having access to the child.  Again, for that reason, I have put down another amendment about which I will be arguing.  I am merely signalling at this stage.</P>
    <P>Section 11B allows members of a child's extended family to apply an order giving access to the child.  I should like to raise a couple of questions about this.  I think it is a very good idea because I know there are grandparents, aunts and uncles who, maliciously, have been denied access and they should be given a legal status.  However, having first to apply for and be granted leave to apply for the right to access seems an unnecessary complication.  It would simply add to the delay and the expense.  I wish we could get some legal definition of who is covered by this.  Does it have to be a blood relative?  Can long familiarity be taken into account?  Could a beloved teacher be considered?  We have to look at this particular test.  I should like clarification of &ldquo;the court shall have particular regard to. . .the wishes of the; child's guardians&rdquo; in section11B (3)(c).  Does this regard for the wishes of the guardians constitute a veto?</P>
    <P>The question of mediation is extremely important.  One welcomes this.  Section 11 introduces new sections 19 to 30 to the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  These sections 19 to 22 are intended to promote and facilitate alternative methods of dispute, resolution, etc.  I would like to see the Minister giving consideration to the introduction of mandatory mediation in all cases before court proceedings can be initiated.  If we believe in mediation surely we should try it before we get into court at all.  Research should also be carried out into the success rate of mediation, the reasons for failure and finally why mediation is not availed of in many cases.</P>
    <P>I have been briefed by an excellent group called Parental Equality.  They have done their own research.  Their view is that the well known bias against fathers in custody cases undermines the effectiveness and usage of mediation services. Mediation in custody cases can only be effective <Col N="818" /> where both parties are committed to achieving a reasonable solution which respects and upholds the status and dignity of both parents and facilitates ongoing shared parenting.  This cannot happen if the sex of the parent is known to be the key determining factor in the outcome of the case.  The devotion of the members of Parental Equality to their children is exemplary.  One man said to me that if you are a man you go into court five goals down before the first half commences.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which puts the rights and the interest of the child almost centre stage.  I have had a long involvement with Cherish, the association for single parents; I am now its president.  We have always sought the involvement of the non-marital father with the child. About 12,000 children are born outside marriage in this country every year but a substantial number of these children have little or no involvement with their fathers.</P>
      <P>We have encouraged mothers to try to get the non-marital father involved in the upbringing of his child because a child has a natural curiosity about their father and there is nothing better than getting first hand information from that person. We have run courses for mothers teaching them the best way to maintain a relationship with the fathers of their children but, regrettably, a very large number of fathers do not want to become involved in the upbringing of their children.  This is extraordinarily hard on those who want to become involved in their children's lives.  Of course, joint custody should be the norm but I do not think it can be considered possible in all cases.  There are a substantial number of men who do not want to be co-operative.</P>
      <P>I was very interested to get an article dealing with the need for women who are pregnant, or who hope to become pregnant, to take folic acid to reduce neural tube defects.  The article is entitled &ldquo;An Important Step in Planning a Baby&rdquo;, and the photograph on the front of the magazine is of a man holding a child.  I think that is interesting.  It is important for men to think more about the planning of pregnancies and the consequences in terms of lack of access to their children.</P>
      <P>There are cases involving incest, rape, child prostitution and so on, where it is impossible for the father to become involved.  While blanket recognition cannot be given, fathers should be encouraged to become involved in the upbringing of their children.  In this regard I welcome the fact that they do not have to go to court.</P>
      <P>Fathers could give financial assistance towards a child in cases where the mother is reluctant to allow access.  Even in marriages where couples have separated there is extreme difficulty in obtaining support for children.  It would be a start if the man demonstrated a financial commitment to his child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concerns expressed by Senator Norris regarding the way in which money is spent can be addressed later.  If there is abuse of expenditure <Col N="819" /> the man can take action.  However, if the woman sees that money is being provided by a man on a regular weekly or monthly basis towards the support of his child it would make it much more difficult for her to disallow access and to be unamenable to the father assuming his rights and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the interest taken by the Minister in cases involving children where a marriage or partnership has broken up.  He has put mediation rather than the courts to the forefront.  Nothing is more distressing for children than court cases.  I hope that service will be given the resources it needs because lack of resources prevents many who would wish to do so from becoming involved in mediation.</P>
    <P>The provisions regarding access by relatives is to be welcomed.  Perhaps the Minister could broaden them as blood relatives are not necessarily closest to the child.  Child minders or supportive neighbours may have been closer to the child when a marriage was in trouble.  It is regrettable that such people have been excluded.  Perhaps it would be better to include them and provide that they may be excluded if they are being vexatious or troublesome.</P>
    <P>Excellent changes have been made regarding the receiving of evidence by children.  The Law Reform Commission is to be applauded for the work it has done in this area.  The ability to understand and answer questions is given greater importance than the chronological age of the child.  Sometimes young children have a strong sense of what happened.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent publication of legislation on court services.  Delays of trials, often of a few years, are bad enough for parents but they are intolerable for children because it is difficult for them to place in context events of several years previously as well as having to recall the trauma they may have endured.  The admission of hearsay evidence and the use of video links from abroad is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed about the comments made by Senator Norris on the article by John Waters in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11 November.  I was a young doctor when battered baby's syndrome was first recognised in the early 1960s.  It was recognised that the mother could be the abuser and was as likely to be involved in the physical abuse of the child, although not so much in sexual abuse.  A letter from a sociologist was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> a few days later in response to the article which pointed out that an enormous amount of research had been undertaken on the subject and that in a large number of cases women who abused were being abused within the family.  A report by the Casualty Department of Saint James's Hospital found that women presenting with physical abuse were often afraid to stay for treatment because of the abuse that may have been perpetrated on their children at home.  This is a well known condition and nobody is attempting to say that there are not women <Col N="820" /> who do not become involved in the abuse of their children.</P>
    <P>However, we must look at family situations. Family dynamics can be dramatic, as we have seen with the publicity surrounding a pregnant 13 year old child.  Without all of the facts of the case it is hard for us to fully know these dynamics.  The Bill encourages dealing with children in a more straightforward manner, which I welcome and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it so rapidly to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Minister is as prolific in Government as he was in Opposition with regard to producing legislation.  I heard his interview this morning on &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; and I welcome his commitment to the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill.  There was great disappointment among all those involved in drafting these Bills when they were struck down by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is similar to but improves the Bill introduced last April.  We are all on the same side with regard to family law. All Senators wish to improve the legislation and because of the issues that have been raised, it appears that the same lobbyists have approached Members on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators referred to the tragic case involving a 13 year old child.  When I was last a Member of this House the tragic X case arose.  At the time many people thought it was a single incident which could not arise again.  It is awful that similar circumstances should occur. While family law has come a long way since then, we still have vulnerable children in society who can be subjected to trauma and who need protection.</P>
      <P>A 13 year old is a child.  Senator Jackman referred to seeing 13 year olds in school.  As a teacher I remember students attending first year at the age of 12 or 13 years.  They are children, even those who look mature.  It is awful to think of children having children, especially under such traumatic circumstances.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which updates the law on guardianship, custody of and access to children and of evidence of children in civil proceedings. I acknowledge the work of the Law Reform Commission.  The commission has been the backbone of many improvements in legislation, especially in the area of family law, and that is something we should acknowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is gratifying to know that, as a result of this Bill, there is a possibility we will be able to ratify the Council of Europe convention on the exercise of children's rights which we signed in January 1996.  It complements the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ratified in 1992.  Any of us involved in <Col N="821" /> dealing with legislation and who have spoken to people outside this country at conferences will be aware of the intense embarrassment felt at our inability to ratify those conventions.  We at least have less cause for embarrassment now.  This is a good Bill which is child-centered and child-friendly. It seeks to ensure the best interests of the child are vindicated at all times and, by and large, it succeeds in doing so.</P>
    <P>Many references were made to the section which allows a father to be appointed guardian of the child by agreement with the mother.  There are differing views on this.  I have had many dealings with Parental Equality and I am very impressed by the case they put forward.  It comprises mainly men who feel disenfranchised, although they want to assume responsibility for their children.  They believe this Bill does not go far enough in that regard.  I have often said that children do not only have mothers, although in this society that is often the case as many fathers do not assume any parental responsibilities. When a group is anxious to assume the rights and responsibilities of parenthood we should encourage and enhance its work.  Some 12,000 children are born each year to unmarried parents out of which 700 applications for guardianship are made by fathers.</P>
    <P>Unmarried fathers assume varying degrees of responsibility for their children, which leads organisations such as Cherish to be understandably diffident in advising about guardianship rights for unmarried fathers.  It argues parental rights should be contingent upon full acceptance of parental responsibilities and that is a good point.  Unmarried fathers have a choice as to whether or not to develop a relationship with their child and, as we know from statistics, many unfortunately reject that option.  Nonetheless, there are many fathers who want to play a fully responsible role in the rearing of their children, and we should try as much as possible to make that easier for them.  I hope it is indicative of a change of attitude within society that men would take on the role and responsibility of parent to their children.  Senator Norris is right when he says there is a more visible involvement of fathers with their children today.  That is something which is very welcome and of which we shall see more.</P>
    <P>However, we are still very conventional.  I know my husband will kill me for saying this but I still largely take on the responsibility for organising my daughters and the household, although we have what many would consider an equal relationship, something on which my husband is often congratulated.  That is indicative of the type of household which exists in Ireland.  Where both parents work outside the home, women still unfortunately have to take a greater role in organising the family home and bear greater responsibility for rearing children.  That is changing and more men are willing to work share so as to participate more in this regard.  That development is indicative of the changes in our society <Col N="822" /> and is something we should examine further within the confines of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that custody of the child may be granted to relatives, such as grandparents, and that they will be allowed access to the child.  This was a bone of contention when we were discussing the divorce legislation.  Many grandparents felt they would never see their grandchildren again.  It is widely agreed that there is a tender link between the old and young and this can develop into a loving relationship which is very beneficial for the children, the grandparents and society.  We should try to nurture that.  I accept the point about other people who have a loving relationship with the child also being considered for access and perhaps the Minister might examine that.</P>
    <P>There will be an emphasis on counselling and mediation in alternative dispute resolution procedures. Following on the provisions of the divorce legislation, it was agreed that there should be separate counselling available for children. The issue here is about the resources made available. I remember having many disputes with the Minister's predecessor in the area of equality and law reform about the availability of mediators, for example.  This is a significant issue because there is an insufficient number of trained mediators.  It is easy to provide for it in print but it is very difficult to resource it properly.  It is essential that we do so if this is to remain a child-friendly Bill which ensures the child's interests are vindicated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the court being obliged to take account in its proceedings of the child's wishes because we make assumptions when deciding for children.  They should be listened to.  Adults often think they listen to children but they do not hear what they say and that is a concern.  Being able to listen is a great and essential skill.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill for evidence to be given through a live television link.  We all know the appalling condition which the so-called family courts are in and I hope they will be improved substantially.  Improvements have been slight and we have a long way to go.  It is extremely bad for children to be in any kind of adversarial circumstances, especially when they are living through a traumatic time.  The provisions on live television links are welcome.  Some questioned the validity of children's evidence.  I read the Dáil debate on this Bill and was not entirely satisfied with the Minister's response.  Perhaps the Minister might address this issue further when he replies.</P>
    <P>This is excellent legislation which I welcome and commend to the House because it is a step forward in the area of family law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted, but not surprised, that this Minister is introducing the Bill. As a Member of the other House, I was Chairman when Committee Stage of the Children Act, 1989 &mdash; the first child care Bill to be passed by the Oireachtas since 1908 &mdash; was discussed.  The Bill had lain on Second Stage for eight years, not because the Dáil was not aware of its duties but <Col N="823" /> because no one could agree on even the bones of the Bill.  This applied to all parties.  With the agreement of the Whips, the then Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, advanced the Bill to Committee Stage.  Deputy O'Donoghue played a leading role in ironing out the difficulties.  There was a mixture of skills and professions discussing the Bill and the Deputy brought uncanny legal brilliance to the deliberations.  However, he not only brought the hard diamond of legal brilliance, he also brought humanity.  The Deputy would not take all the credit for getting the Bill through but he played a leading role.  I am not surprised to see him introducing another Children Bill.</P>
      <P>How we have moved on since passing the Children Act, 1989.  We were innocent men and women trying to do our best.  We then had a flood of scandals, both in institutions and families which showed how children were abused and, in one or two cases, killed, by people whom they originally trusted, who were in positions of authority and were supposed to be looking after their welfare.  These people failed in their duties.</P>
      <P>Attitudes to, and relationships with, children have changed greatly since then.  The post-1960s generation, who let it all hang out, are now the parents and, in some cases, the grandparents of today's children.  Their attitudes are moving away from total freedom.  I do not want to sound ponderous or to look down on children but, in this day of nuclear families, we are coming to regard children as people to be treasured and protected. They are to be brought up like a valuable tree which is staked but given freedom to grow and blossom in the sun.</P>
      <P>That is the ideal at which we should aim for our children.  However, being human, we sometimes fail.  Politicians are not exemplars of parenthood. They are often away from home.  Senator Keogh praised her husband.  I am not surprised, he was a neighbour of mine growing up and she was only stating the facts.  However, sometimes we find it difficult to be present at the most important times in our children's lives.  That is the nature of the job and our wives and husbands have to take up the slack.</P>
      <P>This is a child focused Bill.  It is strong on supports for the child in a court.  The Minister is responsible for the family courts.  I receive many complaints, mainly from fathers, who have been before these courts.  They tell me that they are not listened to and that the weight of judgment normally comes down on the mother's side.  In many cases this is just.  However, our judges may have to go for training, if not counselling, in modern family thought, sociology, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people agree that a court is a poor and a crude place in which to try to sort out family difficulties.  In the end, the judge may be forced to seek refuge in the Statute Book rather than dispensing justice and what he feels may be right. Sometimes this is not the correct decision.  No matter how young, children have a strong sense of justice.  This is one of their stronger senses.  As <Col N="824" /> we get older that sense of justice is blunted.  When talking and listening to young children and teenagers, one knows that they have a strongly developed sense of justice.  I welcome this Bill. However, the Minister or his successor will be back with further children Bills.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the House appreciates the Minister's interest in the various matters he has brought before us and I compliment him on his performance on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; this morning.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, this Bill is a lost opportunity.  Is the Government scared to deal with the rights of fathers?  This Bill should provoke serious debate as to the natural rights which fathers should have but which the law still does not permit.  It is for the Government to legislate and not for the courts to make the law.  The likelihood is that the issue of fathers' rights will be lost for another ten years.  Worse still, it will be lost until the next blatant anomalous case where a father will lose out because of the lack of legal recognition for his rights.  The father should be an automatic guardian except in specified circumstances provided for in legislation.  The essence of the problem is that there is an absence of legislation to deal with the rights of the natural father.</P>
      <P>I concur with Part III of the Bill and commend it to the House.  We already have provision whereby children can give unsworn evidence in criminal matters and it only seems sensible that the civil system should have parity with the criminal system where the sanctions are far more severe. The UK Children Act, 1989, enables children to give unsworn evidence in civil proceedings provided they satisfy a watered down test of competency. The British experience has not provoked serious complaints about these provisions.  In the case of Johnson <i>v.</i> Ireland the European Court emphasised the State's obligation as follows:</P>
      <P>To respect the individual's private and family life and to act in a manner calculated to allow family ties develop normally as between non-marital parents and their children.</P>
      <P>Deputy Alan Shatter's <i>Family Law</i> states:</P>
      <P>The changes effected by the 1987 Act do not equate the position of the natural father to that of the natural mother.  The mother is automatically by statute the guardian of her child.  The father is merely entitled to apply for guardianship. The mother's right to her child is given constitutional recognition (under Article 40.3), the father's is not.</P>
      <P>Presently, therefore, fathers of children born outside marriage are treated as constitutional outcasts; are in an inferior legal position to that of mothers; have no automatic guardianship rights and can only obtain them by means of a court order under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutional position is set out by the Supreme Court in the State (Nicholao <i>v.</i> An Bord <Col N="825" /> Uchtála) 1966 Irish Reports, which held that a father has 'no personal rights in relation to his child under Article 40.3º of the Constitution.  The natural father has the right to apply to the court to be appointed a guardian but this does not give him the right to be appointed as such.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes nowhere near amending this anomaly surrounding the lack of rights of a natural father.  It allows a father who has not married the mother of his child to be appointed guardian of the child by agreement with the mother without the need to go to court as at present.  However, in a judgment in December 1989 in the case of K <i>v.</i> W, the late Mr. Justice McCarthy in the Supreme Court cited the decision of Nicholao <i>v.</i> An Bord Uchtála, holding that the unmarried father had no constitutional right to the custody or society of the child.  He raised the question of whether the fact of there being a prospective adoption in train was to be taken into account in a guardianship application.  If so, then a spiteful mother could wilfully defeat a father's claim by setting the adoption process in motion.  Mr. Justice McCarthy felt that the purpose of the Status of Children Act, 1987, was to promote the father to the position of having rights.  He found it difficult to accept that a loving father who with the mother, wished to have a child had no natural right to the society of the child.  Shatter's <i>Family Law</i> states:</P>
    <P>The father ultimately failed in his application, the High Court ruling that the child's welfare required that she remain with the adopters.  He had seen his child on only one occasion, being two days after the child's birth. At the date of the final court decision, the child had been with the prospective adopters with whom it had bonded for 15 months.</P>
    <P>The 1982 report of the Law Reform Commission on illegitimacy recommends that both parents of a child born outside marriage should be joint guardians of their child with legislation providing for the courts to exclude a father from joint guardianship or from a right to custody where such order is in the best interests of the child. Such legislation could be enacted subject to the proviso that no right to joint guardianship or custody vest in a father where the child was conceived as a result of rape or by use of donor sperm through artificial means of procreation.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy John Kelly, in the second edition of his book <i>The Irish Constitution,</i> when dealing with the natural personal rights as contained in Article 40.3º of the Constitution suggests &ldquo;that it seems wrong to close the door on principle against the father&rdquo; having a natural personal right in relation to his child.  He argued for recognition of such a natural personal right &ldquo;even if a highly contingent and easily defeasible one&rdquo;. Recognition of the natural father's right under Article 40.3º could still allow for flexibility and should not be absolute.</P>
    <P>Clearly, this Children Bill goes nowhere near implementing the Law Reform Commission's <Col N="826" /> proposal.  It seems unfortunate that we have lost an ideal opportunity to properly tackle the legal rights of natural fathers.  The reform contained in the Bill is slight and grants no rights.  It gets rid of the ridiculous situation where a father had to get a court order to be a guardian where the mother had consented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a civilised advance in dealing with children.  The interests of the child should be paramount and I particularly welcome the extremely important power to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem.</i> I also welcome the provisions which make it easier for a child to give evidence and ease the stress on a child in court.  I have seen examples from other places, and one difficulty is that these provisions could be negated because of lack of resources.  The provisions imply substantial modification of courthouses and courtrooms and involve considerable expense.  I hope resources are made available if the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator Coghlan regarding the rights of the natural father.  At present we are dealing with very difficult social situations with the state of wedlock becoming less defined.  What were seen as the concepts of marriage and the single nuclear family no longer apply.  The law has to attempt to keep pace with these changes in society.  Where a child is the product of a loving and natural relationship the father should have some established rights in law to access and be concerned with the child subject to the paramount interests of the child.  Despite this slight reservation, I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to speak on this matter.  As one who spent the greater part of his political career on the side of equality between the sexes, there is a need to defend men.  There is an implied subtext about the behaviour of all men in much of our legislation pertaining to family violence, guardianship, etc.  We have all been lobbied by the same interest group to which a number of speakers referred.  The fundamental point made by that interest group, and which this Bill inadequately attempts to address, is that there are many cases where both parents, in the case of unmarried couples, ought to have rights of guardianship. While it is a step in the right direction and facilitates agreement where such agreement is possible, it does not yet recognise that where both parents are meeting their parental responsibilities there ought to be a presumption that both have a right to guardianship.</P>
      <P>When the Status of Children Bill was introduced in 1987 there was considerable controversy because the presumption that it would guarantee guardianship rights to both parents was not included.  Time has passed and we can now understand the problems involved.  However, the fact that we can understand the problems involved in automatic guardianship is not a reason to create unnecessary legal hurdles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> I take grave exception to much of what is portrayed as the liberal left view on this issue, particularly in the United Kingdom.  Children are better off having two parents.  However, a newspaper of which I am fond, <i>The Guardian,</i> and, to a lesser extent, <i>The Irish Times</i> take the view that it does not really matter.  When a parent loses a partner as a result of an illness or accident it is recognised that not just the spouse but the children suffer.  It is therefore illogical to suggest it makes no difference to a child whether he or she grows up in a single parent family or in a two parent family. This is not an attack on single parenthood or on single parent families.  It is simply an assertion of a reality.  Whenever there is a tragedy which deprives a child of one of its parents we acknowledge it as a tragedy for the child and not just for the partner.  It is therefore equally reasonable to suggest that it is preferable for children to grow up in circumstances where they have two role models and two parents to share the responsibility of parenting.  That has benefits not just for the child but also for the parents.</P>
    <P>I am a product of the 1960s to which Senator Fitzpatrick referred.  I do not know how much I learned to let hang out over the years but I probably have a different attitude from my parents about many of these matters.  However, I accept that one of the unfortunate consequences of that period is that many people have been allowed to talk themselves into believing that responsibility for their actions is everybody's but their own.  I am a great believer in the role of society in supporting people who are in difficulty and in the negative effects of poverty and appalling living conditions.  However, I do not believe people should have the right to behave as they wish, wherever they wish, and let somebody else take exclusive responsibility for the consequences of their actions.  Regardless of whether it is the mother or the father of the child, we must tell people: &ldquo;If you have a child, you have a responsibility; we have a responsibility to support you but you have a responsibility too&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the other subtext of the dilution of the right to guardianship is a dilution of our commitment to pursue with vigour fathers who are reluctant to accept their responsibilities. One of the more revealing facets of life is listening to men talk about women in exclusively male company.  Their attitudes to many things, including sexual responsibility, are often not as noble in the company of hard men as they might be in front of a different audience.  There is a degree to which macho male society regards men who father children as symbols of male potency.  We therefore must redefine our culture.  Men have rights and obligations.  Parents have rights and obligations.  Children have rights and, in so far as it is possible, they have a right to access to and support from two parents, preferably of different sexes although others might have a different view on the latter.  We must create a framework in <Col N="828" /> which we will support people but in which it is also recognised that people have responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In our attempts to protect women from unpleasant and dangerous men and men they regret meeting, I worry that we might put obstacles in the way of men who wish to play an equivalent role in the rearing of their children.  One of the consequences of the distorted view we had of parental roles was that it deprived men of many of the joys of rearing children.  Men were seen as the breadwinners who went to work each morning, brought the money home, behaved properly, were singularly faithful to their spouses, at least sexually, but who did not have much involvement in the experience of intimacy that is involved in the rearing of children.  The absence of these expressions of intimacy and affection brutalised men to a greater or lesser extent but we cannot now move in the opposite direction and pretend men are no longer needed.  A balance must be struck.</P>
    <P>Having spent time with the lobby group I mentioned, there is a case for rewriting the law to recognise the rights of the considerable numbers of men who are fathers of children, who wish to take on their responsibilities and about whom it would be correct to presume they are fit and proper people to have guardianship of their children for the sake of their children.  The law should not be allowed to exclude from children the right to have two parents simply because we cannot find a way of writing the law which would protect women and children from unpleasant men and fathers.  The law should permit children to have two parents where that is obviously the preferable option.</P>
    <P>Even though it is late in the day and we are rushing this legislation to a degree, I hope the Minister will reconsider the language used in the Bill, which many men would consider negative in its presumptions about men, and rewrite it in the type of language which recognises that many men want to be full and equal partners in the rearing of their children.  The only way to do that is to recognise their right, qualified by the necessary conditions, to guardianship.</P>

      <P>It is also the first time liberalism has changed to my way of thinking.  In the early years of our membership of the House, the Senator and I opposed each other's views, but our views are now converging at last.  Conservatism is becoming fashionable again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be careful in how we proceed because men are not getting a fair crack of the whip in the present climate.  I am aware of cases where men are the real abused partners but nobody listens to them.  They are thrown out of their homes because barring orders are always applied against <Col N="829" /> husbands, never the wives.  There is no rational method whereby a mediator can go into a home and check which spouse is wrong or right.  This is not an easy problem to solve.  Only a coward and a bully strikes a woman.  A person who strikes a woman is not worthy of being called a man.  He is no different from the bully who attacks an innocent child.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we must put in place a system which carefully examines both sides before the case comes before the court.  Justice may be done in the courts as far as the legal system is concerned but it is not always done for the children. Children should always be put first but on &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; at present we see a typical example of children being used as pawns in a game between husband and wife.  This brings home that we must take a more balanced view. The system should involve much more mediation and a method of assessment before families are broken up.  It is becoming too easy to do this now &mdash; there have been cases in England, including some involving alleged child sex abuse, where children were wrongfully taken into care.  There is a thin line between right and wrong in those cases but we must ensure that children are not traumatised in any way.  As Senator Ryan said, it is traumatic for children when one parent dies but it is also traumatic when their parents split up.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister is doing an excellent job in achieving justice and not only in this legislation.  He is a brilliant Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is working sincerely and with dedication.  I have no doubt the Bill will make life easier for families and children.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>It was first introduced by my Labour Party colleague, the former Minister, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, last April and it is a significant step forward in the promotion and protection of children's rights. It is a wide ranging Bill which introduces many new, important and necessary provisions.  It is forward-looking legislation which is not afraid to consider what may be needed in the future as regards, for instance, representation for children in court or the taking of evidence.  It recognises that the context in which it arises is one of massive social change, not least in the pressures under which families operate.  The Bill also considers the rights of fathers, mentioned by many speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that we debate this Bill in a week in which the terrible plight of a child has come to public attention.  We find ourselves unable to resolve or even discuss this matter in a rational fashion.  I welcome the Minister for Health and Children's comments in the Dáil yesterday, which were thoughtful and forward-looking, but it will be necessary for us as legislators to grasp the nettle we have avoided until now.  We must legislate for difficult cases involving children, where circumstances are not ideal and which parents are unable to handle.  That is our role as legislators and I hope that, in the context <Col N="830" /> of modernising our democracy and community, we will be able to put aside the old battles and deal with these complex, tragic and difficult issues in a rational way which does not demean the role of women and does not make any more difficult the decisions they sometimes have to take.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a number of wide-ranging powers. Many of us have been lobbied by or have spoken to groups representing unmarried fathers.  It is notable how their position has changed &mdash; not only are young unmarried or single fathers taking their responsibilities as parents much more seriously, they are enjoying it.  This is to be welcomed. There was a time when society thought it was acceptable for a man to father a child and then walk away.</P>
    <P>One reason that view has changed is single women have lobbied for a change in their status as unmarried parents.  When I hear unmarried fathers express fears about their rights, I cannot help thinking back to a time not long ago when unmarried mothers bore the entire responsibility for children, were often stigmatised by society, cast out by their families and, in many cases, forced to go abroad.  To a large extent we should welcome the change in attitude which means that fathers now want a look in, but it is not long ago since we would have asked fathers to take their responsibilities seriously.</P>
    <P>Our amendments, which we will discuss tomorrow, attempt to push the boat out further in that regard, attempting to balance the rights and responsibilities of natural fathers.  If we give them more responsibility we will send out a strong signal and encourage them not only to do their duty but to experience the great joy of parenthood.  As parents, we know this is to the benefit of offspring, even if the father does not remain with the mother of the children.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises, for the first time, that grandparents and other relatives can have access to children but is this change introduced in a balanced fashion?  This change should be generally welcomed.  Although circumstances have changed, the extended family is still an important source of support for single parents and they have a definite role in the upbringing of children. However, what I mean by a balanced provision is that the rights of parents must come first.  I appreciate the efforts made to strike such a balance in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a fine Bill and I look forward to discussing the amendments with the Minister tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to have the opportunity to contribute on this Bill.  Although the legislation, from first to last is the work of the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Taylor, I warmly commend this Minister on introducing it to both Houses in its original form.  It is another welcome reform of and improvement to the law governing the care and welfare of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> In the past ten years an entirely new corpus of law has been introduced in the Houses of the Oireachtas dealing with the care and welfare of children.  We now recognise that the abuse of children is a major phenomenon in society.  While it is difficult to legislate directly against abuse, we can at least put the legal framework in place to ensure, in so far as any statute can, adequate levels of care and welfare of children who are vulnerable or endangered as a result of abuse.  The Parliament and the country have measured up well to that problem.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the abuse of children is one of the major issues of our time.  This will remain the case well into the new millennium.  Not a day goes by but we read reports of what happened to children in the care of people who were trusted to educate them and provide them with health care. These people often behaved like monsters, destroying the normal development and lives of thousands of children.  This was taking place up to 40 years ago but it was not discussed or addressed.  However, the victims of these awful deeds of abuse are now coming forward and speaking out about what happened to them.  The result is that judicial punishment is being applied to the perpetrators.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the courts on the firm approach they are taking to such offenders, lay or otherwise, who usually receive punishments which fit their crimes.  I am glad the length of time which has elapsed since the committal of the crimes against children or the age of the offender is not used as extenuating circumstances to lighten the sanction applied or allow the offenders go free. A good sign of our times is that the wall and conspiracy of silence which often surrounded cases of child abuse in the past is breaking down. People are coming forward and reporting child abuse.  Those who were given special privilege because of their position and who so often abused it, can no longer feel safe and immune from the law whether they wear a business suit or a clerical cassock.</P>
    <P>If one wants to place a value on the worth of a society, a major test is how it looks after its children. The world is full of societies which fail that test.  Children suffer terribly in developing countries distressed by debt, food shortages, poor health services and few resources for education. The number of children who die in the first year of life in poor and developing countries because they did not have access to the most elementary health care, such as a measles prevention injection or simple treatment for diarrhoea, is appalling. The number of children in developing countries who die in the first five years because they do not have access to clean safe water is equally appalling.  The number of children, particularly girls, in the developing world who have little or no access to even the most elementary primary education is a scandal.</P>
    <P>The United Nations' annual publication, <i>The State of the World's Children,</i> is an excellent commentary <Col N="832" /> on a yearly and country by country basis of the position of the world's children.  It is also backed up by excellent statistics, showing how key indicators in countries are improving or disimproving. In comparison Ireland is among the best in the world in the report in terms of the key indicators of child mortality, access to proper health care and education.  However, the state of Ireland's children in 1997, while bearing no relation to what happens to so many children in the developing world and countries which call themselves developed, such as China, is not everything we would wish.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of children in Ireland enjoy the protection of a stable parental and home situation. Most children have access to excellent education and health care services.  However, that is not the case for a minority.  While I have no statistics to prove my point, I am satisfied that excluded minority is growing.  The shocking case of a 13 year old girl who is pregnant as a result of rape is dominating the news today.  The child at the centre of this dreadful tragedy is, according to media reports, the victim of unacceptable economic and social conditions.  Ireland in 1997 has produced the atrocious conditions in which that young girl and her family of ten other children and parents live at the side of the road. Despite the country's prosperity and the roaring Celtic tiger, this problem has not been adequately addressed.  The girl is a product of the environment in which she was reared.</P>
    <P>She is in the care of the Eastern Health Board on foot of an order made in the courts.  I understand she may be removed from its care today so that her parents can make a heartrending decision for her.  If she is returned to her parents, the State agency will be let off the hook but that is not good enough.  Under the Child Care Act, health boards are given unclear instructions regarding cases involving children in care.  The board must always act in the best interest of the child.  They are fine words but they are much too vague in tragic, complex and controversial cases such as this one.  The health board has no option but to resort to the courts for a decision. However, the courts, which often have an intimidatory and combative atmosphere, are the last place in which such cases should be aired for a decision.  The law must be clarified so that when State agencies face extremely difficult dilemmas, such as the current case, they can rely on more than a well meaning but vague line in relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>This year in Ireland there is also the unacceptable phenomenon of child prostitution. The Eastern Health Board recently produced a report on this in its area, principally in Dublin city.  It is extraordinary that young children, boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 18 years, are involved in prostitution on the streets of Dublin.  Something must be done about this matter.</P>
    <P>From the explanatory memorandum, one of the main features of the Bill is that it allows a <Col N="833" /> father who is not married to the mother of his child to be appointed guardian of the child by agreement with the mother without the need to go to court, which is the current position.  I was in the Seanad in 1986 when the then Minister of State, Nuala Fennell, introduced a Child Care Bill which became the Child Care Act, 1987.  Until then a father had no right of guardianship.</P>

    <Title>Private Business. - Local Government (Planning and Development) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. After the debate he may see the wisdom of our proposal.  I thank the Leader of the House and Senators for giving me and my Labour colleagues the opportunity to bring forward this planning legislation which, hopefully, will have the support of all Senators.</P>
      <P>This Bill amends the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, by providing that an application for planning permission may be denied &mdash;&ldquo;may&rdquo; is the important word &mdash; if the applicant or connected person has failed to complete works that were a condition of the granting of planning permission for a previous development by them.</P>
      <P>It will also allow the Minister to make regulations forcing an applicant to provide information in relation to previous permissions and whether they were completed in accordance with the conditions attached to them.  The Bill provides a simple mechanism to enable planning authorities to tackle rogue builders or developers who have previously failed to properly complete works in new housing estates, whether by failing to complete them in a reasonable time or by failing to complete them at all.  This obviously includes the standard of work of the houses, the taking in charge of the estate, the dedication of the open spaces and the health and safety standards for workers during construction.</P>
      <P>Irish people have a tradition of aspiring to home ownership.  We are unique in this regard among EU member states.  Over 80 per cent of the dwellings in the State are owner occupied. Families and single people are willing to mortgage themselves up to the hilt to achieve this objective.  This has also been a great boost to the State and the demand for local authority housing has been reduced accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average price of a new house for which loans were approved in Dublin has increased from £62,375 in 1992 to £94,375 in 1997.  The repayments on such loans are in the region of £650 to £700 per month.  With such repayments there is no alternative in most cases to both partners having to work outside the home.  What do buyers expect in return for this, the biggest <Col N="834" /> investment of their lives?  They expect their houses to be constructed up to a certain standard, roads to be usable, public lighting to operate, grass verges to be planted and maintained, and open spaces to be developed and maintained so that their children can play, and they expect these facilities within a reasonable period.  Given this scenario is it any wonder that residents are rightly angry when any of these items, normally conditioned in a planning permission, have been delayed or, in many cases, deliberately ignored?</P>
    <P>Since becoming a public representative in 1983 the two main planning issues that have consistently been brought to my attention by residents are indiscriminate rezoning and unfinished estates.  Regarding unfinished estates, I committed myself to pressurise Government about this scandal, which is being caused by a minority of builders.  Apart from causing grief to buyers, they are also giving the building industry in general a bad name.  I believe that the Construction Industry Federation itself, which is well aware of this problem, should have dealt with this.  Given that it has not, it is imperative that legislation be put in place.</P>
    <P>I intend to use examples from my own constituency, although I know that all of my colleagues will have similar examples.  An estate in Balbriggan was built 19 years ago and in that time a generation of young people has grown up without an open space to play on.  An estate in Donabate is nearly 15 years old and still has not been taken in charge; Bord Gáis has refused to install natural gas to the houses because the roads have not been taken in charge.  There are two other estates in Balbriggan and Swords where the houses were so badly built that in one fungus was growing through the floors, which had to be replaced.  In the other estate the roofs had to be replaced.  In one of these cases, the residents were covered by the home bond scheme which was some consolation to them, notwithstanding the delay, inconvenience and trauma caused.  In the other case the residents were left with no alternative but to take legal action against the developer.  This went on for years, at their expense.  It should be noted that not all builders are part of the home bond scheme.</P>
    <P>The planning department of Fingal County Council has sequestered security from seven developers who have not brought estates to the taking in charge standard.  Furthermore, legal action is current regarding the dedication of the open space in nine other developments.  It has taken from five to 13 years to get to this stage. Imagine, there have been no footpaths, no public lighting in some cases, defects in houses and no open spaces in other cases during that time and people paid between £50,000 and £80,000 for those house.</P>
    <P>The most galling aspect of this whole sorry saga is that while the council is endeavouring to achieve agreement with the developers, and the house purchasers have had to bear the brunt of the unfinished nature of their estate, the same <Col N="835" /> developers have the right under current planning legislation to apply for and be granted further planning permissions.  Developers are entitled to seek and be granted further planning permissions while they have left other estates in a shambles. This is unacceptable.  Disgruntled angry residents pose the same question to me and to other representatives: how can they get away with it?  The Minister of State will have to convince me and thousands of people who are in this situation why he is doing nothing.</P>
    <P>As regards possible enforcement action against these cowboys, present planning legislation is totally inadequate.  The 1992 planning Act imposed limits of up to five years from the date of the planning permission to the period in which the planning authority may take action.  This was a retrograde step.  Developers are driving a coach and four through the system.  The planning authority may take action in a District Court in the first instance and the maximum fine which may be imposed is £1,000.  Some developers are prepared to go down this road as it is a paltry sum to pay given the huge profits most make.</P>
    <P>Another ploy used allows the developer to wait until shortly before the court hearing to agree to a programme to carry out outstanding works.  If this is not fully adhered to, another court date is sought thus causing a further delay.  The planning authorities, even working under the constraints of current legislation, should be more aggressive and be prepared to go straight to the High Court if necessary.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing Members' contributions and I hope they and, in particular, the Minister will acknowledge this problem.  I hope the Government and the Minister will not push this issue aside.  It is not an issue with which to play politics, so let us agree to this legislation, which may not be perfect.  I am prepared to allow the Minister to take this Bill in the spirit in which it was put forward and to return with better legislation. We must all do something about this scandal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I hope the Minister will agree to accept this Bill and see it through to a conclusion because the matters contained therein are extremely important as Members will note from Senator Ryan's impassioned contribution.  For all the years I have known him, Senator Ryan has complained about incomplete and poor quality work on a large number of housing estates in suburban areas.  I congratulate the Senator on his initiative in bringing forward this Bill.  It is the first legislation to be brought forward in the House by a non-Government party and I hope it will be the first of many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple Bill which provides for the refusal of future planning permissions to a builder who has not completed works which were the conditions of previous planning applications granted.  It also allows the Minister to make regulations <Col N="836" /> seeking information on the track record of a builder.  The legislation provides a mechanism to control builders acting like cowboys, not carrying out work according to the conditions of the applications and leaving housing estates and apartment blocks incomplete either in relation to work on blocks or surrounding estates.  This is extremely valuable legislation which I hope will be passed into law.</P>
    <P>This Bill is timely considering the high profile attention paid to the largest apartment block developer, Zoe Developments, in the High Court on Monday.  Judge Kelly described the firm as a recidivist criminal because of the number of times it had been before the courts for breaches of health and safety regulations.  He castigated the manner in which the firm operated in fulfilling conditions of employment for its workers.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, 15 breaches of health and safety regulations were discovered.  That was compounded by the tragic death a few days previously of a worker on the site.  He was not the first worker to die on a site in the capital.  We require high standards from the building industry. However, with such low standards for workers, one can imagine that, in certain circumstances there are low standards in terms of the materials being used to construct houses.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider introducing an offence of corporate homicide so the directors of building firms may be charged with manslaughter because they get off virtually scotfree. They may get a tongue-lashing in the courts and a fine &mdash; the maximum fine which may be imposed is £1,000 &mdash; for breaches of health and safety regulations but they are safe from criminal prosecution.  Profits in the construction industry are considerable so we should expect the highest standards.</P>
    <P>While I do not know about the experience elsewhere, we all know about housing estates in Dublin that are unfinished or which are poorly maintained and constructed.  As a public representative, I attend meetings of residents associations at which complaints are made about unfinished pavements and landscaping, lack of amenities and the inability of the Corporation to take an estate into charge because work is still outstanding by the builder who is working on another estate.  It is virtually impossible for local residents to get hold of the builder to complete unfinished work.  I know of estates which have not been taken into charge by the local authority for up to 25 to 30 years and where work will probably not be completed.  Dublin Corporation has had to forfeit the bond in respect of estates on the Navan Road and in Inchicore because the builder would not come back to carry out work.</P>
    <P>We must put pressure on builders who are getting huge contracts and who are making enormous profits.  We still have low standards in terms of construction and the completion of work.  This proposal would allow us to monitor a rogue builder so that his previous record could be made available under regulations made by the Minister. <Col N="837" /> If a builder does not fulfill the conditions of contracts for which he has applied, we should be in a position not to allow substandard work to continue. People are paying large sums of money for homes for their families and will be in debt for the rest of their lives, yet they are left in the lurch in terms of repairs and so on by builders who are making a fortune.</P>
    <P>This is the most simple and straightforward legislation which has come before the House for a long time.  It is a simple mechanism to deal with a serious problem.  Every resident association would applaud us if we put in place a mechanism which would prevent builders of apartment blocks and housing estates from riding off into the night like cowboys leaving people in the lurch as if nothing had happened.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  I ask the Minister to accept it and ensure it is brought to a conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím le morán atá ráite leis na Seanadóiri as Páirti an Lucht Oibre ach ní féidir liom glacadh leis an mBille.  Most Senators agree with the sentiments expressed in and the motivation behind the Bill.  We are all aware of estates in our localities which are unfinished.  This has caused tremendous hardship to the people purchasing those houses.</P>
      <P>However, to be fair to the construction industry, a small minority of builders and developers give rise to this problem.  In most cases they develop a reputation and their track record identifies them easily.  They cause much misery and financial distress especially for young first time buyers who are working to a tight budget.  There is a need to ensure that the practice in a number of isolated cases is rectified and dealt with efficiently and effectively.  It does not matter what price houses are, it is essential that people get value for money.  Because of the high prices paid for houses today, it is even more necessary that it is not left to the individuals involved to deal with these problems.</P>
      <P>The Bill raises many legal and constitutional issues.  It is a blunt instrument to resolve a minority problem in one sector of development which comes before local authorities for adjudication. Nobody supports rogue builders but an examination of the Bill uncovers many anomalies which will create greater problems in the planning process. The specification of connected persons in section 3(a) of the Bill could mean that people applying for an extension for a disabled person could encounter difficulties because they are obliged to provide information on their planning record.  If it is not as impeccable as it should be, this could result in difficulty with their planning application.  This is unfair and may result in constitutional problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practicality of the Bill needs to be looked at.  Developers and builders, particularly those who are highly active, submit many applications to a local authority annually.  Many small builders who build 12, 13, or 14 houses in a year may go <Col N="838" /> through the planning process having to provide, on an ongoing basis, all the information on how they complied with each condition of individual planning applications.  This surely adds to existing bureaucracy, which needs to be addressed in the Minister's current review.</P>
    <P>Section 3(b) requires local authorities to make a judgment on a planning matter based on past experience of the applicant.  Does this change the thrust of planning?  Each case must stand on its merits and the criterion for proper planning and development is eroded as a result.  Most developments comply with the conditions.  We should deal with the problem rather than imposing conditions on 99 per cent of the applicants to catch the 1 per cent who do not comply.</P>
    <P>Bonding should be looked at in the review on planning.  Tighter arrangements need to be put in place.  The adequacy of the bond needs to be examined to ensure that where one is put in place it is sufficient to meet any incompletion of the estate.  The local authorities also have a role to play.  There has been a significant improvement in the enforcement of planning regulations although there is a lack of resources in local authorities to properly police all of them.  However, in the case of housing developments, large or small, there is a need for ongoing inspections in the course of development to ensure there is compliance.  Planning authorities should consider phasing developments so that the bond can be applied to each phase, and therefore will not prove a prohibitive factor to a developer because of the quantum that would be required if one looked at shortcomings in a large estate.  However, I would be loath to interfere with the cost efficiency of developments. The courts are a last resort to local authorities in ensuring compliance.</P>
    <P>I commend the Labour Party Senators on introducing this Bill.  However, a parochial note has been injected into the debate.  The Labour Party was in Government for the past five years. I would like to think they acknowledge the expeditiousness with which the current incumbent of the office of Minister for the Environment and Local Government has moved to implement an overall, root and branch review and revamp of the development process.  There have been many submissions and a national planning conference is arranged for 27 November to give everyone a chance to have an input prior to decisions being taken on the new Planning and Development Bill. This is an opportunity for the Minister to embrace the sentiments expressed here.</P>
    <P>While justifiably criticising builders and developers who have failed to meet their obligations, one must acknowledge the tremendous contribution of the construction industry to the provision of homes.  We can be proud of our home ownership levels.  I hope the House rejects the Bill but I ask the Minister to consider the motivation inspiring it in his overall review of the planning process.</P>

      <P>I understand the anxieties that forced my colleagues to introduce this Bill and I thank the Government for publishing it and allowing it to be discussed in Private Members' time.</P>
      <P>This matter is not a problem in the part of the city I represent although there may be a problem in Senator Ridge's area.  We lack land for building in the city so the problem does not arise although it did in the past.  The way of getting around the problem was to have sufficient bonding to cover the cost of the local authority moving in to finish an estate.  I understand why this should not happen and I was disappointed to hear Senator Costello refer to a case where the bond was not sufficient and had to be returned to the builder.</P>
      <P>The real weakness in our planning system is the lack of enforcement of regulations.  Enforcement is a slow and tortuous procedure which provides no real satisfaction for councillors or the public. I support Senator Ryan's suggestion that local authorities should be allowed go to higher courts. Judge Kelly made that point in the High Court recently when he said the only penalties in the lower courts for breaches of the health and safety regulations were small fines.  The higher courts can deal in a more specific way with such breaches.  At present, actions for breaches of the regulations must be taken in the District and Circuit Courts and then, if possible, in the High Court.  The Minister should allow local authorities to go to the higher courts to seek enforcement of the regulations and provide them with the necessary funding to so do.</P>
      <P>This Bill should make provision for the safety of building site workers.  On a chilly afternoon this month, a young man called James Masterson stood on a half finished roof of an apartment block in the inner city.  He moved nimbly on the top of a half constructed building on Charlotte Quay in Ringsend, which is down the road from this House, laying down the cladding around which the roof was to be built.  There was no fencing between that 24 year old and the vast docklands skyline, except for polythene sheeting. When he stumbled there was nothing for him to hold onto to prevent his fall.  He plunged straight through the polythene onto the concrete 25 feet below.  He lay there for an hour before he was discovered by a 16 year old apprentice.  He was taken to hospital and died shortly afterwards.</P>
      <P>He was the third builder in seven years to die on a site owned by Zoe Developments in the city. The company has 12 criminal convictions for breaches of the Health and Safety Act.  The senior health and safety officer said that Zoe Developments has an appalling safety record. This displays a shocking disregard for the safety of its workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> Zoe Developments has had more influence than anyone else in the past decade on how Dubliners live by building apartment blocks faster than any other developer.  A price has been paid by members of its workforce in the carrying out of these projects due to the lack of safety on these sites.  The health and safety officer said the proprietor of Zoe Developments comes from a school of thought, which is not unique among builders, that if workers are injured on sites it is because they do not look where they are going. Such sentiments are rubbish &mdash; a safety fence around the hole though which that young man fell would have saved his life.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a provision in the Bill to deal with the safety of workers.  We must address that paramount aspect of the issue of planning and development.  The sentiments expressed in this Bill should be part of the revision of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act.</P>

      <P>I support the thrust of Senator Ryan's remarks.  We all share the same bitter experience.  The four topics at every residents' meeting in Dublin, and probably other urban areas, are litter, travellers, traffic and the taking in charge of housing estates.  What I find most insulting about the process is our apparent lack of ability to deal with these matters.</P>
      <P>The same builder has built in excess of 2,000 houses in my area over 15 years.  It is not putting it too strongly to say he has caused heartbreak to people.  People have had continuing construction outside their houses for ten years.  He has built in small plots with no cohesive pattern and there is continuous mud and dirt.  I live in a housing estate which took 21 years to be taken in charge.  It is timely to review these matters which affect people gravely.  The most important purchase made by young couples in urban areas is their home.</P>
      <P>The most disgusting aspect is that when building companies build in better off areas of Dublin they finish the estate to the extent of shaving the grass.  However, the same builders have a different attitude when they build in less socially desirable areas.  I heard a foreman tell a group of residents they were not used to anything better because they were originally from corporation houses.  Those residents had originally been shown a map of a beautiful estate with an open space, the road reservation for which the developers had forgotten to include in the planning application.  About five years later, after the residents had got used to having a nice open space, there was uproar when the builders arrived to build the road which the developer had omitted to show on the plans when the residents were buying their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Construction Industry Federation is great at sending us glossy brochures on how well builders are doing.  They are doing very well for themselves. It is time they gave some of that back to <Col N="841" /> the people who are making them wealthy and keeping them in jobs.</P>
    <P>I appreciate this Bill will probably not work because I can see difficulties with it.  However, I will support it because we should do whatever we can to remedy the appalling situation whereby these rogue builders benefit from the court system. I have seen them settle outside the court after being pursued by the council for two and a half years.</P>
    <P>There have been many incidences in my area of small builders' sites not being taken up leaving, in some cases, a crescent of houses with gaps between them resembling a set of bad teeth.  That situation has pertained for the past 15 years.  Such estates can never be taken in charge.</P>
    <P>In some cases the developer has absconded and cannot be found, or his company has gone into liquidation.  I do not know what legal redress exists in such cases.  We always have to tell the residents that apparently there is nothing we can do.  That is not good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the spirit of this Bill, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why there are unfinished estates when house buyers are forced to pay such high prices.  It is getting to the stage where young people cannot afford to buy houses.  The Minister should inquire into the escalating price of houses, particularly as inflation has never been so low. Last month inflation increased by 1.2 per cent, mainly as a result of increases in the price of liquor.  Many builders are creaming profits off the top by charging exorbitant prices.  There is no excuse for unfinished estates.</P>
      <P>There is a bonding system and perhaps it should be re-vamped and improved.  In Kerry, for example, in new housing estates the builder does much of the preparatory work such as roads, footpaths and lighting in advance.  We have had problems with unfinished estates in Kerry for a number of years but the local authority acted to ensure that a proper bonding arrangement was implemented.  In many cases, as well as a bond, the local authority take a number of sites from the builder on a guarantee basis and if the estate is not properly finished planning permission is not given for these sites.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his swift action in bringing in legislation.  A national planning conference will be held next week where Senator Ryan and members of all local authorities will have the opportunity to express their views.  I understand that the Minister has received more than 100 submissions for that conference and I believe this will be a very good conference on planning.  I am concerned about safety on building sites and I implore the Minister to include safety matters in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> Over the past five years, local authorities have greatly improved the situation with regard to fly-by-night builders who left unfinished estates and I compliment them on that.  I am glad we have the opportunity to discuss this matter in the House but I wonder why Senator Ryan introduced this Bill at this time?  Would it have anything to do with a by-election in Dublin North?  It is unfortunate that the Labour Senators did not introduce such a Bill when their party was in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill has opened up a discussion which is very welcome.  I am glad that we are having this debate in light of the national planning conference which will be held next week.</P>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of the Bill.  Every Senator and Deputy has experience of housing schemes where the taking in charge by the local authority was well overdue.  We only need one fly-by-night builder to tarnish the whole industry and for that person to be used to penalise the 95 per cent of good, respected developers who honour their commitments and the conditions laid down by the planning authority.  It would be a pity if I spoke for this motion because I have experience of many builders and developers and 99 per cent of them are well respected.</P>
      <P>There are two issues involved the first of which is the granting of planning permission.  The second is the monitoring of the conditions laid down in the planning permission and how the planning regulations are implemented.  This may be where the weakness lies.  We must look at the certificate of compliance and see if we can hold back the sale of houses until phase one of an estate is completed.  This is a measure that could be looked at.  The question of bonding could be tidied up.  I do not know how bonding can be enforced.  We all know of the fly-by-night developer who moves on from one company to form a new legal entity.  Legislation is lacking in this area because, where there are defects the local authority can only get an injunction to stop building and not to force a builder to remove part of a building.</P>
      <P>This debate is a golden opportunity to highlight the weaknesses in our planning legislation but we must not penalise the very good developers. Every professional organisation has one fly-by-night who tarnishes the entire profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of this motion but I cannot support it.  We should apply the conditions attached to planning more stringently and involve bodies such as the Construction Industry Federation and the Home Buyers' association who have a role to play in bringing about a better finished product.  Residents' Associations are often dissatisfied when an estate is being constructed but when it is finished they are usually satisfied. There are often hiccups in the building of estates and at local authority committee meetings we often find that two or three years elapse before an estate can be taken in hand.  It might be possible <Col N="843" /> to insist in a time limit for the finishing of an estate.  I agree that it should never take longer than four or five years before an estate is taken in hand unless something extraordinary happens. We may have to analyse why things go wrong in a particular area or we may find that a particular builder fails because of something outside his control.  Although I agree with the thrust of the motion, I cannot accept its implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Ryan and his colleagues on bringing forward this short but very timely legislation.  Many Members have dealt with planning issues and with the problems associated with unfinished estates.  Only a certain percentage of builders cause problems.  Many Members who are aware of the difficulties will support this Bill.  I hope that the Minister will take the contents of this Bill on board and not reject it entirely if amendments can be made to it.  I am sure that the proposers of the Bill would accept such amendments.  I am sure that, because of their limited back up in preparing the Bill they will accept it could be improved.</P>
      <P>The problem of builders leaving unfinished estates was greater some years ago when the bonding system was inadequate.  Builders sometimes sold the houses quickly, left things in a horrific state and rode off into the sunset.  Some of these, as Senator Kiely said, could not be pursued because they dissolved one company and then registered another.  The situation has improved and will further improve under a bonding system. If people are dissatisfied with fly-by-nights, the planners will be able to liaise with their colleagues in different authorities.  Previous convictions and operating malpractice can be taken on board.  For example, previous problems can cause difficulties for renewals of pub licences, even where there have been changes in pub ownership.</P>
      <P>Many conditions are often imposed on planning applications.  For example, it can be stipulated that planning permission will only be granted when difficulties elsewhere are resolved. In this regard, problems often arise with extensions or buildings constructed without planning permission on the basis that retention orders will be granted.  Penalties are rarely imposed.  People without a track record should not be allowed build in areas and previous malpractice should be taken into account when considering planning applications.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh referred to an extension for a disabled person.  Perhaps he was looking for the sympathy of the House; it does not appear that we are being asked to consider the case of a poor invalid.  Senator Joe Doyle referred to the question of safety.  Those on building sites and on streets must be protected.  The Minister must be more vigilant in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the concept of the Bill and I hope the Minister will respond positively to it.  If there are defects I hope they will be addressed by way of amendments on Committee Stage rather than <Col N="844" /> rejecting the Bill on Second Stage.  Many of us, especially those of us on local authorities, agree with the Bill's provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members concur with the thrust of the Bill.  Nobody, especially members of local authorities, could condone the actions of developers in leaving estates unfinished.</P>
      <P>The high cost of housing today means that young couples must undertake big mortgages. They are to be commended for starting off in the right way by providing their own home and legislators must provide them and others with the best safeguards.  For the prices charged by some building contractors for houses buyers could expect marble driveways.  This Bill seeks to address a minority of builders.  There are always one or two bad apples in an orchard and the construction industry is no different to others in this respect.</P>
      <P>As legislators and local authority representatives, we can take credit that Ireland has the highest rate of home ownership in the EU.  People in Ireland are proud of their homes.  They agree with the words: &ldquo;Your home is your castle.&rdquo; In contesting elections we canvass people in their homes probably once every 18 months.  People are to be congratulated for the amount they spend on their homes.</P>
      <P>Living standards today are unbelievable, especially when compared with the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  In those years the first thing one did each morning was to get a bucket of water from the well.</P>

      <P>Most Senators, especially those from rural areas, will recall the daily hardships incurred.  By contrast, living standards today are fantastic and everybody associated with local government, including the Minister and his predecessors, should be congratulated.  Local authority members get little credit for the work they undertake on a voluntary basis at county council meetings.  As a representative of that great body that elects most of the Members to this House I congratulate them.</P>
      <P>I am heartened that Deputy Dempsey was appointed Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  He is committed to the local authorities and to his stewardship as secretary of LAMA.  As a member of Meath local authority for a number of years he has served his apprenticeship and knows the requirements of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the review being undertaken by the Minster on behalf of the Government, which is not even five months in office, will introduce the right solutions to the problems this Bills seeks to address and, doubtless, the Minister will cover many aspects which are not included in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for this Bill and I congratulate the Minister and his officials on seeing that need at such an early stage in the lifetime of the <Col N="845" /> Government and for promising legislation through the review which is taking place.  I suggest that the House reject this Bill but request the Minister to consider its objectives on unfinished housing estates in the review of the planning process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>No speaker has objected in principle to what this Bill seeks to achieve.  Notwithstanding the contributions made by Senators on the Government side, I ask the Minister to consider agreeing to Second Stage, given that it is a debate on the general principles of the Bill. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum, the Bill provides a simple mechanism to enable planning authorities tackle rogue developers. Senators from both sides of the House who are members of local authorities have spoken of the difficulties experienced by their councils in trying to ensure rogue developers are tackled and prevented from causing further problems.</P>
      <P>This problem is not as great in my area as it is in Dublin and other cities.  There are four planning authorities in my constituency and I have only heard complaints about one of them.  The first question which comes to mind is why that authority does not use its power in the same way as the others to ensure rogue developers do not continue their work in the area.  I have had to attend public meetings in that area and defend the reputation of the planning authority and officials.  Those of us who are familiar with what happens at such meetings will not be surprised by the type of accusations levelled against councillors and officials.</P>
      <P>Residents who object or complain about the non-completion of their estates are told they can take proceedings under section 27 to oblige the local authority to enforce its own conditions.  That is unsatisfactory because these people are operating in a voluntary capacity for the benefit of their communities.  They should not be forced to spend time and money taking legal proceedings against their council.  I fail to see why this Bill cannot be accepted on Second Stage as a means of tackling this problem when everyone has said this must be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister is undertaking a fundamental review of the planning process.  I would have liked to have attended the conference, but the invitation to my local authority unfortunately specified the attendance of two members and one official.  I contributed my views to the submission which my local authority compiled on the matter. I hope the conference leads to action and I expect it will.  We do not need another conference or report to tell us about this problem.  What we need is action and the Bill provides that in principle. I have not heard many Senators disputing its detail, but I am prepared to accept that it can be improved on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of all residents' associations, I appeal to the Minister to take urgent action to alleviate the concern, hardship and occasional financial losses suffered because of rogue developers.  I <Col N="846" /> would like to bring the Minister to one specific area and show him six estates built by the same developer, none of which was ever finished and where unauthorised developments were undertaken. In all cases retention was sought and granted, but even those conditions were not complied with.  It is indefensible to stand up in front of people and accuse certain developers and companies of not having finished estates, while at the same time the council has given them permission to build other estates which they probably will not complete either.  That is intolerable and we must tackle it.</P>
    <P>Enforcement is lax in most local authority regions because the councils do not have the staffing resources to implement it.  I asked at a meeting of my county council on Monday why 18 conditions were being attached to a planning permission when we knew no one would ever check to see if they had been complied with. Enforcement is one area I would like the Minister to examine in his wider review.</P>
    <P>We do not need to wait for the completion of that review to tackle this problem.  This Bill is enabling legislation.  The concerns expressed by Senator Walsh would not arise.  Any of us who deal on a day to day basis with local authorities and planning know that it is handled in a common sense fashion.  The type of extreme examples given would not arise because this Bill would allow for the real rogues, to whom Senator Ormonde referred, to be tackled without impeding genuine developers who comply with the law and whose reputation is known by the planning authority to be good.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this Bill at this late stage.  We will co-operate with him in amending it accordingly to ensure its aims and objectives are achieved and that the people, from whose concerns it has arisen, can be satisfied the Oireachtas is taking prompt action to deal with their problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to accept the Bill, it would not solve the problem of unfinished estates to which Senators referred.  It is accepted by all that it is a major problem, but as Members will know, especially those who were Members of the other House, this legislation cannot be retrospective and will not, unfortunately, solve the problem of unfinished estates.  Many of them have remained unfinished for up to 25 years and they are spread throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much as one would like to pursue the builders who built those estates 25 years ago to make them compensate people for the pain and suffering they caused, there is nothing in this Bill which would allow us to do that.  However, in the spirit of what Members have said, it is perhaps time, under a new and reformed local government system, that we examined the issue of local authorities doing something to resolve the problem of unfinished estates.  This is a topic to which I might return when we discuss the funding and structures <Col N="847" /> of local government.  No matter how much we exercise our mind in amending the Bill to make it legal and constitutional, it will not solve the problems of the people for whom Senators on both sides of the House expressed concern.</P>
    <P>I condemn, in the strongest possible terms, unfinished estates and builders who fail in their duty to ensure that housing estates are properly completed.  House purchasers invariably pay high prices for their homes and they are entitled to expect the highest standards in terms of the basic infrastructure being installed, open spaces being properly landscaped and footpaths and lighting being provided.  As Senators have said, the planning system has a critical role to play in ensuring that happens and that developers meet their obligations in that respect.  It is true to say that, because of weaknesses in the legislation and in local authorities in the past, it did not always happen and we live with the consequences of that. While we talk about it, people must live with it on a daily basis.  They lack a proper quality of life because a rogue builder decided he had made enough money out of an estate and left it unfinished. As far as I am concerned there is no excuse for taking shortcuts in the completion of housing estates.  The recent significant rise in house prices has meant that there is a very high profit margin on housing development.  Such profits cannot be further inflated by allowing builders to leave estates unfinished and avoid their obligations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity offered by the Second Stage reading of this Bill to air these issues at a time when we are engaged in a wide ranging, fundamental review of the Planning Acts.  I assure Senators that the specific problems of unfinished estates will be considered in the review.  I invite any Member of this House to make formal written submissions to the review process.  The national conference will take place on 27 November and we will accept written submissions from interested parties up to that date. I formally issue an invitation to Senator Gallagher if he wishes to attend the conference.  He would be more than welcome.</P>

      <P>We will work out some system in which the House will be proportionately represented. In the words of the explanatory memorandum the objectives of the Bill are to provide &ldquo;a simple mechanism to enable planning authorities to tackle &lsquo;rogue&rsquo; developers who have previously failed to properly complete work in new housing estates.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan outlined the reasons for introducting this Bill and I sympathise with him.  I am sure that all Senators, TDs and councillors have come across the problem of unfinished housing estates.  There is no doubt that the minority of builders who leave estates unfinished do a grave disservice to their trade and to the people who buy their houses.  The construction industry is a <Col N="848" /> very important part the economy and its output accounts for around 17.5 per cent of GNP.  It is unfortunate that such a major industry is being tarnished in the public mind by builders who operate on a fly-by-night basis and leave estates with unfinished roads, lighting and public areas. Such estates are a hazard to the safety of adults and children and seriously detract from the quality of life of residents, many of whom pay huge prices for their houses.</P>
    <P>Builders carry the primary responsibility for these matters.  Bodies such as the CIF and the Irish Home Builders Association have a role to play in regulating the conduct of builders.  There have been some efforts in this direction but more can be done.  I will raise this matter with the Irish Home Builders Association in the near future.  It is in the interests of the building industry that the public at large have confidence that builders will complete developments to the satisfaction of their clients.  In this regard, I would particularly ask Home Bond whether it should continue to register builders who fail in their duty to properly finish estates.  Representative industry associations should organise themselves in such a way that membership is only available to companies and individuals who comply with best practice in the industry.</P>
    <P>The report on the strategic review of the construction industry, commissioned by my predecessor and published in June, recommended that there should be a registration scheme for contractors in the building industry to ensure consumer protection, quality, health and safety and efficiency in the industry.  This report, entitled &ldquo;Building Our Future Together&rdquo;, also recommended the introduction of a national physical development bond scheme with the fundamental aim of guaranteeing the proper finishing of developments. Such a scheme was drafted by the Construction Industry Federation some time ago but without consultation with local authorities. Therefore, the scheme did not have widespread acceptance.  However, the report recommends that this CIF bond scheme should be reviewed and amended by the CIF in agreement with local authorities.  The report further recommends that the agreed scheme should then be applied universally.</P>
    <P>This is one report which will not gather dust. Three weeks ago I launched the Forum for the Construction Industry which is charged with overseeing the detailed implementation of the report.  The forum has been formed on a partnership basis between the Government and the construction industry and this will ensure successful implementation of the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The report contains almost 90 recommendations and a timetable for their implementation. I am certain that the forum will make good progress in implementing each of the recommendations. These initiatives will have a very positive impact on the type of problems which have prompted this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> There has been considerable adverse publicity in the past few days regarding safety on construction sites.  This is another aspect of the need to ensure the highest standards in the building industry with developers living up to their responsibilities to their workers as well as their clients.  As the Cabinet Minister with responsibility for the construction industry, I have a strong interest in supporting any measures which will improve conditions for building workers and I have referred to this issue publicly on a number of occasions.  Each year up to a dozen building workers die at their work; 1,600 are injured.  This toll of death and injury on building sites is unacceptable and action must be taken to reduce it.  It is more unacceptable when it is felt, anecdotally, that a considerable number of injuries are not reported.</P>
    <P>The Strategic Review Committee on the Construction Industry also gave priority to improving the health and safety of building workers.  A number of recommendations were made in relation to the health and safety code.  However, the committee concluded, and I agree, that the core requirement is not laws, regulations, rules and so on, but the fundamental cultural change in attitudes to site safety by all the partners to the construction industry &mdash; clients, design professionals, contractors and workers.  The HSA is doing its best to bring forward such a change and they have the full support of Government and myself.</P>
    <P>Unfinished estates have been the subject of concern over many years.  Since the early 1980s, my Department has taken a number of opportunities, both through the issuing of advice and through legislative change, to strengthen the hands of local authorities in dealing with unfinished estates.  These measures have gradually contributed to the considerably improved situation.</P>
    <P>Many of the unfinished estate problems arose from older permissions granted without laying down proper stringent conditions.  Under section 26(2)(e) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, conditions may be imposed in granting planning permission requiring the giving of security for satisfactory completion of the proposed development.  The development control advice and guidelines, published by the Department in October 1982, dealt comprehensively with this issue.  Even at that stage it was becoming obvious that clarification was necessary.  The guidelines emphasised the need for adequate security to enable local authorities to complete the necessary works to a satisfactory standard in the event of default by the developer.  The advice has in general been followed and the use of bonds by local authorities has been generally effective, although we would all admit that, at the beginning of the scheme, local authorities failed to take sufficiently large bonds to finish estates, particularly in the case of estates which took up to ten years to complete. The stipulations, if properly enforced, are of benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> The Department's advice to local authorities has also emphasised the scope for attaching conditions regarding the phasing of housing estates as a means of avoiding the problem of unfinished estates.  That advice was backed up by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1990, which provided for the inclusion in planning permissions of conditions, without attracting compensation, relating to the giving of security, the phasing and completion of works and the occupation of structures.  It may also be noted that we have moved some way from the type of large scale housing developments of the past which were more prone to problems associated with unsatisfactory completion.</P>
    <P>In general, the planning Acts contain a considerable range of enforcement powers for planning authorities to take action in respect of any development, including housing, which has been carried out without the benefit of planning permission or where the conditions of permission have not been complied with.  Anyone, including residents' associations, is entitled to seek enforcement action through the courts.  I hope the review will deal with unauthorised developments and people commencing or completing work without proper, or any, planning permission.  This is an offence, as it should be, but most people get around it by immediately applying for planning permission on being found out.  Planning for retention should be a separate matter.  At present, people are abusing a system which was meant to address situations where genuine errors were made.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains two basic provisions.  Section 3A amends section 25 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to enable the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make regulations requiring applicants for planning permission to submit information to the planning authority regarding previous developments carried out by that applicant or by a connected person.  This provision aims to provide the planning authority with the record of the applicant and connected persons when the authority considers subsequent applications.</P>
    <P>The second provision basically provides that the planning authority may have regard to any information furnished to it in relation to the past history of the applicant when dealing with a new application.  The planning authority can consider that information as part of the assessment of the application and refuse permission where it considers there is a real and substantial risk that the development would not be carried out in a reasonable time and in accordance with conditions which might have been laid down.  This provision introduces a significant new concept into planning legislation, namely, that a local authority should refuse to grant permission when it is satisfied that the conditions would not be fully complied with.  This could have wide implications which need to be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>The solutions put forward in this Bill pose very complex legal and possibly constitutional questions. <Col N="851" /> The Bill raises significant issues in relation to planning and company law.  It would not be possible to accept this Bill without carefully examining these complex legal issues in detail. For example, while the definition of &ldquo;connected person&rdquo; from the Ethics in Public Office Act may be suitable in the context of disclosure of interests, it is hardly a suitable basis for making decisions relating to planning applications.  For instance, could the brother or sister of a rogue developer be held accountable for their brother's or sister's past failure where their two companies are unconnected?  A number of people would have major difficulties with this, not least somebody like myself who has 11 brothers.  It would be difficult to keep track of everything they were doing.</P>

      <P>They are definitely not, but it is a difficulty.  I acknowledge, of course, the general perception that problems arise from the practice of setting up separate companies for each development.  Although the principals of the companies are the same people, the companies are separate legal entities.  In looking at these issues we need to consider whether the extensive provisions of the Companies Acts in relation to reckless trading and the disqualification of directors are of relevance.</P>
      <P>It is also worth noting that the main problems relate to older estates and it does not appear that any new legislation can do much for them as there is a limit on what can be achieved by way of retrospective legislation.  Senator Ryan does not attempt in the Bill to deal with the problem of older estates.  The Bill would only apply to planning applications received by planning authorities after it was enacted.</P>
      <P>We are in the process of carrying out the most comprehensive review of planning legislation since the introduction of the Planning and Development Act, 1963.  It is appropriate, therefore, that this issue be examined in the context of this major review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public consultation phase of this review is nearing completion and the conference will take place on 27 November.  Political parties, local authorities, people in the public and private sectors and other interested bodies have been invited to participate.  If Senators who expressed a wish to attend have not received invitations, perhaps they might consult their party Whips and we will try to facilitate them.  When the national convention is over, it is my intention to complete the review as quickly as possible and to bring forward legislation.  That review of planning legislation is in line with the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium which states that &ldquo;it is now time to start the process of updating and consolidating our planning laws to prepare for the challenge of the new millennium&rdquo;.  It is all the more important that we do this particularly <Col N="852" /> as the basic principles of the planning system were laid down 34 years ago.  Many things have changed since then.</P>
    <P>The review is general in nature.  However, because of the wide scope of planning legislation I asked that the review focus on a number of key topics some of which are relevant to the issues raised in the House today, including the increased participation of the public in the planning process, an evaluation of how local authority development plans are adopted and the levying and application of development contributions.</P>
    <P>By encouraging increased public participation in the planning process I hope to make it even more transparent than at present.  This will encourage planning authorities to prepare better plans and to ensure the decision making process is of as high a standard as possible.  That can only help to ensure that planning authorities are not remiss in using the full range of powers available to them.</P>
    <P>I intend to look at how development contributions are levied and applied by local authorities. These levies play an important part in ensuring the adequate provision of services to housing estates, including roads, sewerage and water services.  I also intend to consider whether the enforcement powers under the planning Acts should be examined to see if they can be rationalised.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the issues raised today should be considered in the context of the planning review.  The solutions put forward in the Bill raise complex legal issues which should properly be addressed in the context of the wider review. In that sense the introduction of this Bill at this time is opportune as it gives us a chance to debate the matter generally.</P>
    <P>I ask the Senator to consider withdrawing the Bill for the reasons I have outlined.  Complex legal and constitutional issues are not addressed in the Bill.  The content of the Bill will form part of the review of planning legislation.  In addition, the principles in the Bill would not apply to estates which have existed for the past 20 years and which have not been finished.  The resolution to that problem rests with the local authorities.  In co-operation with the Senators who have raised this matter, I am willing, in the context of local government reform and funding of local government, to examine how that problem can be resolved.  I hope the Senator will withdraw the Bill and allow us to resolve the problem through the review and through discussions with local authorities.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister referred to the &ldquo;Strategic Review of the Construction Industry&rdquo; because I have read the review and, being a doctor, I paid particular attention to the section <Col N="853" /> on health and safety.  There are 90 recommendations in the report but I hope they are not all as anodyne as the recommendations in the health and safety area, particularly in this dreadful week following the death of a young construction worker, James Masterson.  He died on a site owned by Zoe Developments which was described by Judge Peter Kelly, not known for hyperbole, as a &ldquo;recidivist criminal&rdquo; according to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 November.</P>
      <P>The Minister is correct to point out that not all construction companies should be tarred with the same brush.  I note that the P.J. Hegarty construction company, for example, has an ISO award.  It, therefore, must be possible to achieve safety in the construction industry.  The section of the &ldquo;Strategic Review of the Construction Industry&rdquo; dealing with quality building, health and safety and the image of the industry is inadequate.</P>
      <P>I listened to Dr. Sylvia Wood talk at length about this area.  The death rate in the construction industry is second only to that of the agriculture industry.  The Seanad recently held a debate on disability and how to help people with disabilities and, in the course of that debate, I suggested that we try to prevent people becoming disabled.  Many people are perfectly well when they get up in the morning but by the evening they have serious disabilities.</P>
      <P>The construction industry is one of the industries in which the worst accidents happen.  At present, there is one death a month and over 1,000 accidents, although we do not know how many accidents are unreported.  However, I have seen such cases in casualty departments and they are extraordinarily serious.  People are permanently excluded from the workforce after accidents on construction sites.  The same accidents, such as falls from heights and scaffolds collapsing, continue to occur.  I live near Waterloo Road where another man was killed earlier this month when scaffolding collapsed outside St. Martin's House.  It was a miracle other people passing on the road were not also killed.  Collapsing cranes, electrocution and drownings also occur on sites. The HSA says, correctly, that it does not have a policing function.  Its function is to advise people on how to achieve better safety practices in the workplace.</P>
      <P>Look at the recommendations in the strategic review.  It states: &ldquo;The industry should strive for the highest quality in both design and construction consistent with its client's requirements.  ..&rdquo;. If that requirement is financial gain, that recommendation is not very useful.  It continues:</P>
      <P>.. and for a fundamental cultural change in attitudes to worker health and safety by all parties in the construction process.  The SRC endorse the core recommendations of the HSA Advisory Committee on Construction Safety (May 1995); and recommend that the HSA should publish an annual progress report on the implementation of the advisory committee's recommendations, as part of the annual report of the HSA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> That simply means putting one report into another report.  The recommendations continue:</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Inspectorate should effectively enforce health and safety on site and then rapidly move from a policing role to one of supporting the industry to achieve a significant improvement in the on-site working environment.</P>
    <P>That is a rather soft recommendation for an industry in which there are over 1,000 accidents per month.  If one looked on this industry as a huge factory in which accidents occurred at that rate, in addition to many more which are unreported &mdash; only serious accidents end up in casualty departments so there are reports on them &mdash; we would not consider this attitude satisfactory. The fact that the industry is spread out across the country means less attention is paid to the dreadful practices that take place.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>The HSA should assist clients in assessing the competence of the leading 2-3 bidding contractors, in contention for the award of contracts, as Project Supervisors.</P>
    <P>That is a sensible recommendation.  At least efforts have been made in the past to ensure Government contracts are awarded to people who comply with regulations in other areas.  This is an area on which the Minister could make progress at once because Government contracts are important.  Recommendation 3.10 states:</P>
    <P>Improvements in quality and in health, safety and welfare should be highlighted by the industry in the communications media.</P>
    <P>I have material from the communications industry outlining the appalling situation on building sites but the construction industry is not taking a great deal of notice.</P>

      <P>If any political party has received a contribution from a firm which has been described as recidivist criminals, I hope it will return the money immediately.  It would not accept money from drug pushers so it should not accept it from other types of criminal.  That would be the least good example a political party could give.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill.  I do not understand why Governments always say that because something is complex it should be taken from the Oireachtas and referred to experts.  If the Bill is complex, why not deal with it in the manner outlined by the Constitution, that is, on Committee Stage?  It could be done either through a committee of the House or through a special committee.  The argument of complexity is regularly used by Government to avoid dealing with an issue, but it is not an argument against accepting the principle of legislation.  The Minister accepts the principle and good intention of this Bill but he claims it is too complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> The reason we have two Houses of the Oireachtas is that life is complex.  If complexity were to be the reason for not dealing with things, we could not live because life is complex.  If there is no argument in principle with the content of the Bill, the Minister should agree to Second Stage and attempt to organise a Committee Stage either through a full committee of the House or a special committee of the House, to deal with these mysterious complexities.  Otherwise one is entitled to suspect that the first response of the Department of the Environment and Local Government was to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; without appearing to do so.  That is a great pity.</P>

      <P>I join in the condemnation of the situation in which young house buyers find themselves when they buy their first dream house. Three or four years later they may find that the roads are not finished and the landscaping and play areas are not completed and may actually be dangerous for children.  If the Minister is conducting a wide review, why are we trying to patch up the problem by introducing a Bill which, as Senator Gallagher pointed out, needs to be improved at this stage?</P>
      <P>The Minister has instigated a review and 150 submissions have been made to date.  Senators have not examined these submissions which may contain excellent suggestions but I am sure they are being examined by the Department.</P>
      <P>I believe the Bill will add to the bureaucracy which already exists in the planning process.  The move today, which I support, is towards a reduction in local authority red tape.  Emphasis is being placed on making the planning process more accessible to people.  Many of the people involved in the planning process are afraid of the unknown.  They fear that if they do not do things properly they will be refused planning permission without any reasons being given.  To add to the bureaucracy which already exists will make life even more difficult.  We must make the planning process more easily understood by the man in the street.  It is all very well to speak about developers and people with large staffs applying for planning permission and being able to ensure that all of the documents are correct.  However, any change we make to the planning process will impinge on the man and woman in the street who are seeking planning permission for a three bedroomed bungalow which they are building on a small site in a rural area for which they paid £10,000 or £15,000.  Some people may pay £50,000 for a site in a city.</P>
      <P>If those of us who are local authority members were to look at the problems we spend most time dealing with we would see that the planning process is one of those.  Dealing with planning officials, meeting them and liaising between the applicant and the planners takes up most of our time.  That proves my point that it is not desirable to make the process more bureaucratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> We debated the Ombudsman's report in the House recently.  One of the areas highlighted as having the highest number of complaints was that of planning.  We would do well to bear in mind that while our intentions may be good and while the problem we are attempting to solve is a difficult one, we cannot approach it in a piecemeal manner.  The Bill would increase the workload for every applicant and local authority.</P>
    <P>The workload of the planning department of Galway Corporation has increased significantly in the past two years.  Increasing a workload for the sake of something which will not be of major benefit must be avoided.  This measure would seem to equate with cutting off one's arm to ease a sore thumb.  I realise that is probably not the intention of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister and some of the other speakers who stated that the problem lies with a minority of builders and developers.  We must give credit where it is due.  Not every builder or developer leaves estates unfinished.  We cannot bring forward a proposal which will effectively create more problems than it solves.  House buyers are entitled to get what they pay for.  In my local authority area, some estates have not been taken in charge since 1987.  That is a sad state of affairs.  I know some of the people who live in these estates are frustrated by the problems they encounter and by the situation which does not allow the local authority to take them in charge. This Bill will not solve that problem; if it does not solve problems which have occurred in the past, it cannot be of assistance to residents particularly those who are trying to solve problems retrospectively.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for his quick move, since becoming Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to review the entire planning process.  Some of the basic planning principles are older than I am so it is high time they were reviewed.</P>
    <P>We must move towards greater transparency in the planning process.  Unfortunately, with the best will in the world, the Bill does not seem to address the real problem.  It is all too easy for disappointed applicants to hurl allegations at planning officials and local authorities.  We all know that if sufficient mud is thrown some of it will stick.  We will solve many of our difficulties by making the process more transparent and less bureaucratic.</P>
    <P>I welcome increased public participation in the planning process, especially in the evaluation of local authority development plans, which will allow us to develop our cities, towns and rural areas in a manner of which we will be proud and not on a piecemeal basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on the attitude he and his Department are adopting in regard to the development of a partnership between the Department and local authorities to address the problem of unfinished housing estates.  This displays the Minister's understanding of the role of local authorities and the problems <Col N="857" /> they encounter on a daily basis when it comes to enforcement; it displays his commitment and that of his Department to resolving the problem.</P>
    <P>For every difficult and complex problem, there is a straightforward and simple answer and one which is not.  This Bill is an excellent example of good intention.  We would all like to see the problem resolved but the proposed Bill does not address the entire issue.  We must wait for the results of the review and while I do not like waiting for anything to happen, we will be delighted with the results at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the direction in which he is moving on this matter.  As a member of a local authority for a number of years, this debate affords me the opportunity to condemn the minority of builders who leave estates unfinished in local authority areas.  Pressure is brought to bear on the relevant local authority to take these estates in charge.  It is ultimately the tax and ratepayers who pick up the tab.  Money is channelled into areas where it should not be and the ordinary person is paying for the misdemeanours of a small minority of builders, as colleagues on all sides of the House have stated.  Reference was made to the bonding system, which has worked to a certain extent, but a number of builders have a track record of not completing their developments.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's remarks about health and safety.  The Minister should consider the introduction of a special health and safety officer under the jurisdiction of the local authority who would visit housing estates during construction to ensure the proper safety standards were observed by developers.  Too often one facility in a housing estate is undeveloped after most, if not all, the houses are sold &mdash; that is, the play area.  Most people who move into new housing estates are newly married couples, many of whom have put their life savings into their home.  Basic facilities like streets, footpaths, lighting, surface water removal and, most important, play areas must be brought to an acceptable standard before the builder is allowed to leave the site.  Legislation should be introduced to provide that builders who have a track record of not completing estates should not be given permission to develop any other site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for contributing and listening to the debate.  I also thank the Senators who researched the issue and spoke this evening.  By and large, everyone was in favour of the thrust of the Bill.  Senator Glynn said that legislation should be introduced to deal with rogue builders who do not complete estates &mdash; that is what this Bill does.  This is the first legislation I have drafted.  It is designed to meet the needs of thousands of people in my constituency and across the country.  It is the best I could do with the limited resources available to me.  The Oireachtas should provide backbenchers from <Col N="858" /> Government and Opposition with the resources necessary to draw up Private Members' legislation.</P>
      <P>No provision in the Bill will penalise people by making it more difficult to obtain planning permission. It provides for the monitoring of the previous record of developers and will enable local authorities to take that record into account when considering further planning applications.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, is the principal legislation in this area and is considered by planners on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Where changes are suggested we should consider them to see if they are necessary.  It is obvious from the contributions made tonight that such a need exists.  We then must ask how to deal with the problem.  It is suggested that this Bill should be withdrawn and that the matter be referred to a seminar, from which something may arise.  Having heard the Minister's objectives, I doubt that the seminar will draft legislation to deal with this problem.  The Department's contributions over the last 20 years suggest that it is not in favour of changing the legislation &mdash; it argues that there is enough legislation on bonding and other matters to allow the various planning sections to tackle the problem.</P>

      <P>The main thrust of this legislation allows a father who is not married to the mother of his child to appointed as the child's guardian. That is welcome, and presumably proceeds from the Keegan adoption case.  That case established in the European Court that a father had a say in what happened to his child.  The Child Care Act, 1987, established the right of a father to apply to the court for guardianship, and this Bill makes it easier because guardianship can be established by agreement.</P>
      <P>Many Members have referred to the lobbying done on this issue.  Why should the establishment of guardianship rights by a father be the subject of court proceedings?  If a mother contests the father's application he must go to court, and he has no guarantee that that right will be granted to him.  This must be examined.  Some legislation mentions the mother being the child's primary parent &mdash; although that is not the terminology used &mdash; and gives greater guardianship and custody rights to the mother, which some would feel to be proper.  There is no reason a father should not have an automatic right to guardianship, although there are many fathers who do not want to establish guardianship.  There are also mothers who will not disclose the father's name for their own reasons, which makes it more difficult to establish guardianship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law should start from the initial principle that the father has a natural right to the guardianship <Col N="861" /> of the child which is equal to that of the mother.  That principle is not enshrined in this legislation, although we are moving towards it. Also, although the co-operation of the mother is necessary, I do not understand why the father's name is not always on the birth certificate in so far as that is practical.  Every child needs an identity, and its primary identity comes from its parents. According to sociologists, parents are the major agents of socialisation for any child, according to sociologists.  When a new born child is registered, the State should establish the identity of both parents.  There is no difficulty with the mother, but there can be problems with the father.</P>
    <P>Article 9.3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that State parties shall respect the right of the child who is separated from one or both of its parents to maintain personal relations and direct contact on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child's best wishes.  Article 9.1 states that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will except where such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child.  Article 7.1 states that the child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.  Those are clear instructions from a convention we have signed.  I will have more to say on Committee Stage regarding the details of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions, and I appreciate the welcome they have given it.  This Government is committed to a caring society and a system of laws and administrative measures which deal comprehensively with marriage breakdown and the failures of relationships, particularly the effects on children of such unhappy occurrences. I emphasis again the principle underpinning the Bill which is that in all matters relating to the guardianship and custody of and access to children, their welfare is of paramount consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a comprehensive debate on the Bill, I would like to address a number of the major issues raised by Senators, in particular, the questions of the right to guardianship of unmarried fathers and joint custody which have been a recurring theme throughout the debate.  Senators Norris, Henry, Keogh, Fitzpatrick, Coghlan, O'Donovan, Ryan, Farrell and O'Meara referred to the position of guardianship and the rights of unmarried fathers.  I took the opportunity to meet Parental Equality in relation to this and other matters and I also met members of Cherish.  It has been suggested that given the changes in the family, it was time to give greater recognition to the role of unmarried fathers.  I am sure the House will share my view that children are best brought up by both parents and that the law should facilitate, as far as possible, the sharing of <Col N="862" /> responsibilities of parents in relation to their children.</P>
    <P>The position on guardianship under the law is that the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, provides that the married parents of a child are the guardians of that child jointly.  In the case of unmarried parents, the mother is the guardian of the child.  If the child's father subsequently marries the mother, he automatically becomes a joint guardian.  Where the father is not married to the mother, he can apply to the court under section 6A of the Act to become a joint guardian.  Section 4 provides that where a child is born outside marriage, the father can become joint guardian with the agreement of the mother without going to court.  The provision in section 4, which is a relaxation of the procedures, while welcomed in many quarters has also been criticised for not going far enough.  Some critics argue in favour of the granting of automatic guardianship rights to unmarried fathers while others seek to amend the law so as to tilt the balance more in favour of the unmarried father than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>Before examining the complex issues involved in these propositions, it is important to outline the background which informed existing law.  In 1982 the Law Reform Commission Report on Illegitimacy recommended a number of changes in the law of illegitimacy on foot of which the Government passed the Status of Children Act, 1987.  The commission was of the view that the principle of equality required that no distinction should be made in the legal rights of guardianship on the basis of marital status.  It recommended that both parents of a child should be joint guardians of the child whether born within or outside marriage.</P>
    <P>In considering the commission's recommendations in the context of preparing the legislation on the status of children, the then Government had regard to the fact that the extent and character of the relationship of the father of a child born outside marriage with both the mother and child varies greatly.  The situations vary from where a child is conceived as a result of a casual relationship to one where a child is planned and conceived within a stable relationship which has all the characteristics of a family.  The Government, at the time, was of the view that to accord the father of a child born outside marriage a defeasible right would enable a natural father with no interest in the child to interfere with, for selfish or vindictive reasons, arrangements which the mother might wish to make in the best interests of the child and would result in greater recourse to the courts because the number of cases in which mothers would have no option but to seek the withdrawal of the father's guardian status would far exceed the relatively low incidence of cases of fathers seeking appointment as a guardian. The Government considered it invidious to place the onus on the mother to have the father's guardianship rights terminated.  Having considered all the issues the Government decided that rather than give fathers of children born outside <Col N="863" /> marriage an automatic right of guardianship, they should be given a right to apply to the court to become a guardian of their children jointly with the mother.</P>
    <P>The report of the 1996 constitutional review group, in considering the question of unmarried fathers, points to the fact that a natural father has no personal right in relation to his child which the State is bound to protect under Article 40.3. It points out that any criticism of this can be readily understood in relation to natural fathers who live in a stable relationship with the natural mother. However, it states that &ldquo;there does not appear to be justification for giving constitutional rights to every natural father simply by reason of biological links&rdquo;.  It also states that were consideration to be given to any modification of Article 42.1 to expressly include unmarried parents &ldquo;care would have to be taken with the drafting to avoid giving rights to natural fathers who have no relationship with the natural mother or no relationship, other than a biological one, with the child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism of the position of unmarried fathers stems from the common belief that unmarried fathers who apply to the courts to be made joint guardians of their children are discriminated against and that if the mother opposes the application the father has little chance. However, when one examines court statistics, one discovers this is not the case.  In 1996 there were approximately 12,500 children born to unmarried parents.  In that year, 750 applications were made to the courts by unmarried fathers for guardianship. In approximately 90 per cent of these cases, the court made the unmarried father a guardian of the child jointly with the mother.  Of these 750 cases, 400 were with the agreement of the mother. I understand from the courts that they will refuse guardianship to a father only in cases where the father is clearly unsuitable to be a guardian.  The court in coming to all decisions in relation to children must, under section 3 of the 1964 Act, regard the welfare of the child as paramount.</P>
    <P>The change proposed in the Bill is a reasonable step forward in the law as it applies to unmarried fathers.  It would take approximately 400 non-contested cases a year out of the court system and facilitate better the position of unmarried fathers where guardianship is not in dispute.  On that basis, our law is broadly similar to that in the UK and many other countries.  To give automatic rights of guardianship to unmarried fathers would seem to fly in the face of the reality that the mother is normally the homemaker for, and carer of, her child.  On that basis, I strongly believe the law should continue to be generally protective of her position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the child.</P>
    <P>Where the parents cannot agree on guardianship, each case is decided on its merits by reference to what is best in the interests of the child. It is open to question as to whether, as has been suggested, a presumption should be exercised by the court in favour of the father's application for guardianship.  It could operate to make unmarried <Col N="864" /> mothers concede guardianship rather than face court action by the father &mdash; an action, the outcome of which, might in future be regarded as inevitably in favour of the father and not necessarily in the best interest of the child.  Any court action that is invoked could result in undue strain and hardship for the mother.</P>
    <P>Senators Norris, Keogh and O'Donovan raised the question of the powers of the court to make orders for joint custody.  Section 11A, which is being inserted in the 1964 Act by section 9, makes clear that the court may make an order granting custody of a child to both parents jointly if it believes it appropriate.  The Bill has been criticised on the basis that it does not provide that joint custody be made the norm and that the wording of section 11A implies that joint custody should only apply where it is proven to a court that the circumstances merit it, otherwise sole custody should apply.  There is no such implication in the wording of section 11A.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with what is provided in the Bill, I refer to the joint custody concept.  There is no statutory definition of joint custody and the question of what it means varies.  In practice, the term &ldquo;joint custody&rdquo; is used in the courts to describe a variety of arrangements.  These range from a situation where a child would spend a certain number of overnights separately with each parent during the week &mdash; not necessarily half and half &mdash; to a situation where parents, although formally separated, continue to live in the same household and may be in a position to operate a joint custody arrangement.</P>
    <P>Because of the variety of interpretations of what is involved in a joint custody arrangement, there seems to have been some doubt in people's minds as to whether a court had the power under the 1964 Act to make a joint custody order. Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a court may give directions as it thinks proper regarding the custody of and access to a child.  This section has been interpreted by the court as including a power to grant custody of a child to the father and mother jointly.  However, for practical and other reasons, joint custody orders are the exception rather than the rule.  To clarify matters, section 9 amends the 1964 Act by the insertion of a new section 11A which provides that for the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the court, in making an order under section 11, may, if it thinks it appropriate, grant custody of a child to the child's mother and father jointly.  The provision is being inserted to make it clear the court may make such orders.</P>
    <P>To construe the words &ldquo;if it thinks it appropriate&rdquo; as meaning that sole custody will be the norm is to misunderstand the context of the 1964 Act.  Under section 3 of that Act, the court is obliged to regard the welfare of the child as paramount in deciding questions of guardianship, custody, access, etc.  A court, in deciding on whether to make a custody order, must regard the child's welfare as the paramount consideration.  It is that consideration and no other which must inform <Col N="865" /> the court's decision on the nature of the custody and/or access order which is most appropriate in the circumstances.  However, as I indicated in my opening speech, I intend to look closely at this matter between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>What guides the court in making custody orders under the 1964 Act are the circumstances of each case and what is best in the interests of a child.  In the absence of agreement between the parents, the court will inevitably have to make hard and difficult decisions based on the evidence before it.  If, on the basis of evidence, sole custody is the best solution in terms of the welfare of the child, the court will make an order giving custody to one parent and access to another.  If the evidence is that joint custody is considered best in the interest of the child, the court will make an order for the parents to share custody.  At present, courts do not normally make joint custody orders as the mother is awarded custody. This feature of the practice of the courts has little to do with the law and a lot to do with the circumstances of each case.  It should be recognised that this is the reality of these cases.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Bill in the Dáil I introduced a new section 11D which provides that in considering whether to make an order relating to guardianship, custody or access, under sections 6A,11,14 or 16, the court shall have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.  This provision is inspired by a provision in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is intended to direct the courts' attention, in exercising its discretion in making guardianship, custody and access orders, to the desirability of ensuring that children have ongoing and close contacts with both their parents.  This is the most appropriate way to bring about change in the Act of 1964.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor referred to the report recently published by the Eastern Health Board on child prostitution in Dublin.  Pornography, prostitution and paedophilia are the most heinous of crimes. As a society we have a duty to protect our children from the perpetrators of such crimes and the full sanctions of the law should be brought to bear on people who exploit our children in this way.  Such criminal behaviour should not and, I guarantee, will not be tolerated.  Already our laws provide many sanctions against people who engage in such activities and I am determined to further strengthen our laws in this area.  When in Opposition, I strongly advocated a new child pornography Bill to deal with this problem.  I am happy that the Government has approved my proposals for the drafting of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the new proposals is to enhance the measures already in place to protect children under 17 years from sexual exploitation and abuse.  More specifically, there is provision in the proposals for a definition of child pornography as well as for a number of new offences dealing with <Col N="866" /> the production, distribution and possession of child pornography.  It is proposed that all forms of child pornography, including photos, videos and films, will be dealt with as will the use of computers and the Internet to produce and communicate such pornography.  There will also be new offences dealing with the abduction and trafficking of children.  The penalties proposed range from five years to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I expect the Bill will be ready for publication later in this Dáil session and I am anxious to put this legislation in place as quickly as possible so that the criminal purveyors of the appalling and sickening trade of child pornography are dealt with swiftly and severely by the law enforcement agencies.  I also intend to publish a discussion paper on the law relating to sexual offences before the end of the year.  This paper will also deal with the question of child pornography.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Eastern Health Board working party report on child prostitution are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  He informs me that the health board is preparing proposals for submission to him to deal with the issues raised by the working party.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt comprehensively with the points raised in a constructive debate.  I thank Senators for their contributions to a valuable and informed debate.  I look forward to discussing the Bill further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to deal with this issue which I waited to raise until after the Louise Woodward debate.  I do not wish to sensationalise the issue of people working on the Continent, which has been raised many times.  I am concerned that interest should be taken by Europe in the many Irish young people working as au pairs there.  I am worried about the difficulties au pairs encounter in countries far from home where there is a different language, if their reception and pay are not what they expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to speak to his European colleagues about rights for au pairs working with families.  There is youth employment legislation <Col N="867" /> in Ireland to which there is parallel legislation in Europe.  There are also new EU directives dealing with young persons at work, which are used as models for legislation in European countries. There is also part-time workers' legislation.  All this legislation is crucial.  Au pairs are often under 18 years old although the legislation deals with people older than this.  They are also part-time workers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to investigate three matters with his European colleagues.  First, he should establish that there is a register of au pairs in every European country so a family employing an au pair can register with the appropriate Government employment agency.  Second, he should examine whether European youth employment legislation applies to au pairs.  Third, do the rights and conditions of part-time workers apply to au pairs?  The register I have proposed should also include information on the salary, hours and conditions of work of the person employed.  Finally, are au pairs covered by minimum wage legislation passed in this country, the UK or other parts of Europe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and I appreciate the points he made.</P>
      <P>I am very anxious to pursue any of the issues raised by the Senator in the context of the appropriate fora within which I have a role.  In the context of the Louise Woodward case, it is important to distinguish between au pairs and nannies or child minders.  An au pair is essentially a student who is treated as a family member in exchange for certain services, such as a limited amount of light housework or babysitting.  The objective of the arrangement is to enable the au pair to improve his or her linguistic and, possibly, professional knowledge, as well as their general culture by acquiring a better knowledge of the country where he or she is received.  Therefore, au pairs are essentially students, not employees, and, accordingly, my Department has no statutory function in relation to the conditions under which they are recruited, the specialist agencies which arrange their placement or the families which act as their hosts.</P>
      <P>Young people who wish to enter into au pair arrangements abroad would be well advised to take some care in making those arrangements. For example, it would be prudent to draw up a written agreement between the au pair and the host family, setting out the rights and obligations of both parties which should specify the manner in which the au pair is to share the life of the family while ensuring the au pair has a certain degree of independence.  It would also be a good idea to use the services of a reputable au pair agency which would not tolerate the exploitation of au pairs by families attempting to treat them as domestic servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> Unlike au pairs, professional nannies or childminders are regarded as employees and, as such, are protected in this country by all the employment rights legislation dealing with terms of employment, wages, holiday entitlements etc. Nonetheless, such persons in seeking employment through an employment agency should ensure they deal only with licensed agencies.  I am sure the Senator will appreciate it is not possible for my Department to regulate or monitor the activities of young people working outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the general question of safeguarding the position of young people who are engaged in vulnerable employment within the EU and internationally, the Senator may be aware that, over the years, Governments have taken action at international level to prevent the exploitation of young people in employment and to establish basic principles.  Various international bodies, such as the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation and the Council of Europe, have adopted standards in this area and the International Labour Organisation will discuss the issue of child labour again at its conference in 1998.  I look forward to participating in that event.</P>
    <P>In 1994 the EU adopted a directive on the protection of young people at work.  The directive had its origins in the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights for Workers or, as it is more commonly known, the Social Charter.  The charter states that the minimum employment age must not be lower than the minimum school leaving age, and appropriate measures must be taken to &ldquo;adjust labour regulations applicable to young workers so that their specific development and vocational training and access to employment needs are met&rdquo;.  The charter declares that the duration of work, in particular, must be limited and night work prohibited in the case of workers under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, which came into effect in Ireland in January of this year, gives effect to the provisions of the EU directive in this country. The Act repealed and replaced the 1977 legislation on the protection of young persons as well as the relevant provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act, and put in place a single composite piece of legislation regulating the protection of young persons in employment generally, including industrial work.</P>
    <P>The Act sets minimum age limits for employment, rest intervals and maximum working hours and generally prohibits the employment of those under 18 years after 10 p.m. It goes beyond the terms of the directive by generally prohibiting the employment of persons who are under 16 years of age.  The intention is to encourage young persons to remain in education or training beyond the age of 15 years.  Employers may employ 14 and 15 year olds on light work during the school holidays or as part of an approved work experience or educational programme.  Those over 15 <Col N="869" /> years may be employed part-time during school holidays for up to eight hours a week.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides that young people should have an avenue of redress against employers who penalise them for not working longer hours than the legislation allows.  Their right of appeal is to the Rights Commissioner Service in the first instance, following which there may be an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Employers also have specific duties in employing young people.  These include seeing a copy of the birth certificate and, in the case of those under 16 years, getting the written permission of the parent or guardian; keeping a register of particulars of each person under 18 years employed at the place of work; displaying the prescribed summary of the Act and giving new employees under 18 years a copy of the summary of the Act within one month.  My Department's inspectors have powers to enter places of work, question employers and employees and examine records.  A person found guilty of an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £1,500.  Continuing contraventions can attract a fine of up to £250 per day.</P>
    <P>Through the means I have just mentioned, I am satisfied the aim of the legislation governing the employment of young persons, that is, the prevention of abuses of the way in which the labour of young persons is utilised, is being achieved.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised a number of important points about what we might be able to do internationally and at EU level.  I have outlined the legislative framework in which I must operate. However, I value the comments made by the Senator and I share his concerns.  I will try to deal with this issue as best I can within the appropriate fora, some of which I have mentioned, and to respond to the spirit of his comments.</P>

      <P>The tone of the Minister of State's reply was overly defensive.  I very carefully framed the matter in a way which did not specify this country.  I am glad he said he would raise the matter at the appropriate fora.  It is important, as he said, that places of employment would display the appropriate information.  However, if we found the conditions of au pairs were worse than those acceptable to employees, we would have a function in asking Europe to examine the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week British television and newspapers reported evidence of a new strain of CJD.  As a result of this discovery, grave concern has been expressed in Britain about the possible transmission of this variant of CJD through blood transfusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert committee advising the British Government on CJD warned it was possible that a new variant of CJD could be transmitted through blood transfusions.  This advisory group called on the British Department of Health to screen and treat stocks of donated blood.  The group is headed by the distinguished expert, Professor John Pattison, who said &ldquo;It is a significant <Col N="870" /> risk for public health, one that we need to be concerned about and to take whatever measure we can to protect the public health&rdquo;.  He said that while no evidence has been found to date to show anybody has contracted CJD through blood transfusions, the new variant of CJD could have a very long incubation period and it is unknown what percentage of the population could be carrying it.</P>
    <P>The call for action by the British expert group has been underlined by another leading scientist on CJD, Professor Aguzzi of Zurich.  He said &ldquo;If we wait until we see transmission of new variant CJD through blood, then we may have waited 20 years too long because of its incubation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The medical director of the Scottish blood transfusion service, Professor Franklin, said:</P>
    <P>There is no firm evidence of any CJD spread through blood transfusion but that does not mean that what Professor Pattison is saying is necessarily wrong.  Professionally, I would have to say that if the experts on the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee believe there may be a risk, then we should do whatever we can to act on their advice.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the British authorities are paying considerable attention to the advice of their expert group.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a form of treatment involving the destruction of lymphocytes, or circulating white blood cells.  It is very expensive but it may be necessary.  The British Government is considering the recommendation in this regard, including the possibility of introducing screening and treatment.  I ask the Minister to examine the necessity for the Blood Transfusion Service Board and his Department to consider the screening and treatment of blood donations in this country to eliminate the risk of the transmission of CJD and I ask him to outline what action he is taking to ensure that this is done.  We have seen confidence in the blood supply take a beating in recent years but our blood donation and transfusion system is vital to people in every part of the country every day of the week.  We must do everything to ensure that full confidence in the system is restored and maintained.  Screening and the treating of blood donations to eliminate the risk, no matter how small, of CJD transmission is expected by the public and should be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this important issue.  CJD is an exceptionally rare disorder of the brain which causes rapidly progressive dementia and eventually death.  Research has shown that CJD is caused by a unique prion protein which exists in a non-infectious form in all humans.  The mechanism whereby this non-infectious prion protein becomes infectious and causes CJD has been under intense study for many years.  Four types of CJD have been identified to date, including sporadic or classic CJD, the cause of which is uncertain, and new variant CJD.  New variant CJD has only been identified in the last three years and is associated with a variety of symptoms <Col N="871" /> and signs different to those found in sporadic CJD.  There has been no case of new variant CJD identified in the country to date.</P>
      <P>Scientific evidence from the UK has been reported which indicates that the prion protein in the new variant CJD cases shares similarities with the prion protein that causes BSE in bovines, thereby providing convincing evidence that these new variant cases of CJD, which occurred in the UK, were linked to BSE and almost certainly occurred because of the ingestion of BSE contaminated tissue.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the World Health Organization held an international meeting which considered the risk of transmission of CJD by blood and blood products.  The meeting concluded that &ldquo;there is no proven or even probable instance of transmission of CJD by blood, blood components and blood products.&rdquo; It was, however, acknowledged that clinical and neuropathological observations suggest that new variant CJD may behave differently to classic CJD and that further studies were warranted in this area.</P>
      <P>In that regard, new evidence has suggested that the agent which causes new variant CJD may be present in the lymph glands of patients with the disease.  In particular, the agent has been demonstrated in lymphoid tissue in the tonsils of patients with new variant CJD indicating the possibility that it may circulate in the white blood cells.</P>
      <P>No data are available in relation to the transmissibility of new variant CJD by blood transfusion and early clarification of the potential for such transmission appears unlikely.  Notwithstanding the lack of concrete evidence in this regard precautions are currently in place at the Blood Transfusion Service Board against any possible spread of any infectious agent by blood transfusion.  The precautions, which are in line with international practice, include the exclusion from donation of the following groups: persons with a family history of CJD.  This is because on very rare occasions the occurrence of CJD may be more common in persons with relatives who have been affected by the disease; donors who have had treatment with material known to have spread classic CJD in the past &mdash; dura mater grafts and extracts of human pituitary, e.g. human growth hormones.</P>

    <P>There is no test available internationally for screening blood donations for CJD at present although it is anticipated that such a test will become available within the next few years.  My Department, through its CJD advisory committee, is maintaining close links with researchers in this area and a consultant haematologist at the Blood Transfusion Service Board is a member of this committee.  I am committed to introducing effective measures as they are developed to maintain the safety of the blood supply and minimise the risk of any infectious agent.  In this regard one <Col N="872" /> measure which is currently being considered is leucocyte depletion, that is, the filtering of blood donations to remove the white blood cells.  As I have already said, the agent which causes new variant CJD has been detected in lymphoid tissue indicating the possibility that it may circulate in white blood cells.</P>
    <P>White cells can be removed from blood donations using special filters, a process called leucocyte depletion.  However, I am advised that there is currently no direct evidence that leucocyte depletion will improve the safety of individual blood components as it is not known whether, if new variant CJD does enter the blood system, it will be confined to white cells.  Hence the caution being expressed about the benefit of this exercise as far as CJD is concerned.</P>
    <P>Arising from recent recommendations from a UK Government advisory committee, the National Blood Authority is to start work towards a possible extension of leucocyte depletion of blood in order that they are prepared in the event that the risk assessment indicates that this would be a sensible precautionary measure. The practicability and feasibility of this process are currently being assessed by the BTSB to allow for immediate implementation should it emerge that this would be a useful precautionary step. The BTSB is also examining the practical requirements of extending leucocyte depletion to all donations.  It should be noted that certain categories of patients already receive leucocyte depleted blood products to prevent immune reactions; these include transplant patients and leukaemia sufferers.  A large proportion of platelets used in Irish hospitals are also filtered.</P>
    <P>When considering the transmissibility of blood borne infections, special consideration must be given to frequent users of blood products, particularly pooled products.  It is important to note that there has never been a reported case of CJD in haemophiliacs, despite many years of treatment with plasma derived products.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Health and Children has decided that plasma derived Factor VIII, which is currently used to treat haemophiliac patients, should be replaced as soon as practical with a synthetic product called recombinant Factor VIII.  The BTSB is currently making arrangements for supply of this product and expect that it will be available next January.  A similar synthetic product to replace Factor IX is not currently available but my Department will be instructing the BTSB to replace plasma derived Factor IX as soon as this is feasible.  The full year cost of these measures will be in the region of £3 million.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that risks from CJD or new variant CJD are purely theoretical at this stage and any potential risk is far outweighed by the benefits of receiving therapeutic blood transfusions if they are medically indicated.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 November 1997.</P>
