      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to review allowances paid to elected councillors introduced in 1995.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to approve the necessary finance to Laois Vocational Education Committee to purchase lands at the rear of Rathdowney vocational education committee, County Laois, for use as a sports field by the students and to allow for further expansion of this school in the future.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give urgent consideration to have the plans for a new vocational education committee school at Summerhill, Mallow, expedited.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the extension to replace the prefabricated classrooms at Pallaskenry national school, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for a new fire station in Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to immediately reinstate his staff at Henshaws Meat Factory, Dock Road, Limerick, so as to enable them to reopen the <Col N="1542" /> slaughterhouse and to allow the plant function properly.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to consider the idea of changing the day for national voting from Thursday to Sunday.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Honan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to immediately address the unconfirmed reports that the Laois/ Offaly area could lose the Europeat plant whose development has the potential to bring 500 permanent jobs to the area.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to have the Suck Valley catchment area included in the new EU category of extremely disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to approve tenders for the interim development at University College Hospital, Galway, and approve the major hospital control plan for the construction of a proper acute hospital for the West.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Mooney's and Senator Enright's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Committee Stage of item 1 will be taken until 6 p.m.  Item 2 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and, as agreed last week, there will be 30 minutes per speaker but Members may share time.  The Leader of the House will conclude the debate not later than 7.45 p.m.  Item 3 will be taken at 8 p.m. I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the other Opposition groups for their agreement to the change to today's Order of Business.  It had been intended to have a debate on Northern Ireland today but the Tánaiste is meeting with Sir Patrick Mayhew and he wants to be present to lead off the debate, which will now be taken tomorrow.</P>

      <Col N="1543" /> Last week, the House came together on the reopening of the inquiry into the events surrounding Bloody Sunday which is an issue of national interest.  I believe Sellafield is a cross-party national issue.  I ask the Leader to arrange for this House to send a message, in the strongest possible terms, to the British Government.  Cumbria County Council, including members representing the Conservative Party, has called for the reopening of the inquiry into Sellafield and various Government scientists have questioned the technical measures before the British Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer.  I believe that, by means of a letter or an all-party motion of the House, we should send the strongest possible message to the British Government indicating our total opposition to the planned Nirex dump at Sellafield.  I live in a constituency that is situated in close proximity to Sellafield and I believe that this issue is of national and cross-party interest.  As a body, the Seanad should send a message to the British Government couched in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised with the Leader the need to recognise that the convergence criteria for Maastricht will be judged, measured or assessed this year.  In that context, a debate on Partnership 2000 is required in so far as it will impact in many ways on the growth of the economy and the restraint of excesses.  The Leader should make time available for such a debate in the near future.  It is important that the partnership element should extend into political life.  Members on all sides have views to offer and those views should be heard.  At present, it appears that Partnership 2000 is being portrayed in the media as a trade union/employer agreement. The implications are much broader than that and politicians must have an impact on this issue.</P>
      <P>Prior to the recess, the House debated the beef industry.  Many Members raised the need to promote consumer confidence in the industry and for politicians to use every opportunity to identify improvements in that industry.  There was agreement on all sides that this should be done.  It is important that the House receive an updated report on the current position regarding outbreaks of BSE rather than receiving a drip feed from the newspapers when outbreaks in various counties are highlighted for political reasons.  It would be better if the House obtained an overview of the current situation, particularly in respect of the price of beef and the markets on which Ireland is dependent.  For example, is Ireland recouping money from the Russian market for the beef it sells there?  This issue holds many implications for people outside the agricultural sector and we should discuss it and be informed about it on a regular basis.  I ask that this be done in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1544" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a full scale debate on the BSE crisis and the agriculture sector in general.  I did so last week and the Leader indicated he hopes to make time available for such a debate in the near future.  The ban imposed by Egypt on live exports of cattle from Ireland, the extension of its ban by Russia to a number of counties, the loss of export refunds and other related topics are grounds for debate.  There is an urgent need to discuss this issue.</P>
      <P>The other matter I wish to raise involves criminal justice and the courts system.  We have not debated that issue in the recent past and it is something we should debate.  Last November the Taoiseach indicated that a courts service and an independent prison service would be established. However, we are still waiting.  In light of the announcement that prison officers are paid on average £7,000 per annum in overtime and that we have an expensive prison service, there is a need to go into these matters in detail.</P>
      <P>Perhaps someone will tell us the contents of the Buchanan report.  Will that matter be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges? I ask the Leader, as I have in recent weeks, when will we have a tribunal?  Am I correct in assuming that the Government will announce the establishment of a tribunal this afternoon?  Since the beginning, my party has been calling for this tribunal to get to the bottom of this affair.</P>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach should promulgate the first law of adjournment which should state that the number of matters on the Adjournment are in direct proportion to the proximity of a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's comments on Sellafield.  I know that Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, who is dealing with this issue, has taken a strong stand on behalf of the Irish Government.  I support that and it is appropriate that this House should throw its weight behind this issue which is of serious concern to all Irish people, not just those on the east coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have a debate on training.  We have a booming economy and figures announced today indicate a 30 per cent increase in the amount of tax taken in January this year compared to January last year and a 20 per cent increase in car sales.  These and a number of other figures indicate a buoyant economy.  At the same time, we have a high level of unemployment.  This is an appropriate time to take a look at the connection between those who are unemployed and may be inappropriately trained or educated and potential for jobs in the marketplace.  I am not too sure that has been assessed properly.  I have raised this issue at local level where there should be interaction between FÁS, Forbairt and the various agencies and educational establishments.  This is also a subject for national debate.  This is a crucial time when we can either maximise the benefits of the economy for all or not take those opportunities. <Col N="1545" /> Training is a crucial issue and I would welcome a debate on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Sullivan. There is a total lack of co-ordination between the various agencies; everyone seems to be working in isolation.  A national debate is long overdue on how we can facilitate the transition of students who are capable of being trained and completing apprenticeships but who do not seem to be able to grasp what they are being taught.  They will eventually find themselves in the jobs market and unable to sort themselves out.  This issue is linked with Partnership 2000 and youth unemployment. FÁS particularly has a big role to play; it should complement the educational establishment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Leader intend resuming the debate on item 18 &mdash; Statements on proposed legislation on food safety?  There is considerable concern among the general public about genetically engineered foods and an order will soon be signed on the matter.  These foods are causing considerable problems and concern. Ireland has a very good food industry of which we have to be careful.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable discussion about the mid-term review of the economic infrastructure of the operational programme.  That report needs to be discussed in this House.  The EU Commission has suspended the payment of a EU grant of £21 million for the building of a peatpowered fire electricity generating station in North Offaly and South Kildare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader provide time to discuss this matter?  There is considerable concern that the Commission has decided to suspend that grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it straight?  The Senator was against the project from the very beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was able to play with the wind at his back but he is not prepared to have it any other way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has changed sides again, another somersault.  I want to put on record that the Government is in the process of advertising for tenders for this project.  I hope we will have an opportunity of discussing the matter at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make provision for a debate on Luas?  We have had several well informed debates on this subject and the House has played a useful role in examining it.  I ask this <Col N="1546" /> because we now have a new Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, who has indicated that he will look at the question of an underground system.  This House specifically inserted in the legislation the question of reviewing the underground option, so it should not be excluded.  However, there is still very little news about the public inquiry, in the absence of which some senior civil servants and members of the Luas group are continuing to make statements about when they will start to build the onstreet phase in O'Connell Street.  They are preempting the authority of this House and of the public inquiry.  It is important that we should have another opportunity to discuss this.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make provision at some stage for a debate on architecture and the building trade?  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has produced a useful policy report on architecture.  It would be timely to have such a debate in view of the continuing attrition of our 18th century housing stock.  We have had a series of problems in North Great George's Street, for example.  Many of us visit Buswell's Hotel, just across the road from Leinster House.  The devastation that is being wreaked inside that building on good early 18th century plasterwork is a reproach to anyone concerned with architecture.  One of the problems is that such interiors are not listed.  We should have an opportunity to discuss the report on architecture as well as the building trade because of the continuing problem of scaffolding collapsing which has caused serious injury to a number of people.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when the Universities Bill will come before the House?  Last week he said he would welcome a debate on the licensing trade.  Since I raised that matter last week it seems to have become a matter of the moment with the Competition Authority looking into it. Will the Leader indicate when such a debate can take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the report of the Commission on People with Disabilities?  I raised this question previously and wish to pursue it again now.  It is a wide-ranging report containing positive steps which could be taken to facilitate those with physical and sensory disabilities.  It might be appropriate to have a debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to come to the House as a matter of urgency to clarify the position in relation to the future of the peat-powered electricity generating station for the midlands?  As Senator Enright has said, it was reported this lunchtime that more than £20 million in grant aid for the project is on hold.  Will the Government confirm whether this plant will be built?  I would remind Senator Enright that when the Progressive Democrats were in Government, the then Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, <Col N="1547" /> commissioned a feasibility study for this project. I have no doubt that if Deputy Molloy were still in Government the plant would have been built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowen is no longer Minister, and now the Senator is looking for it.  The records are there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Leader aware of the timetable for the Education Bill which was published some weeks ago?  Many groups, such as the vocational education committees and the voluntary national and secondary schools, are concerned about some of the contents of the Bill. This House should have an early debate so that some of the issues being raised outside could be discussed before the Bill comes before us.</P>
      <P>Negotiation of the new tranche of EU Structural Funds will be getting under way over the next six months.  It is widely thought that Ireland will not be included in category one because of the growth in GDP over the last number of years. It is necessary for us to have discussions with the Minister for Finance because the regions are in a different situation to that of the greater Dublin area.  The level of income in the regions is generally much lower.  I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants for alternative farming is a big problem.  Many farmers were convinced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to diversify into alternative farming but at 4 o'clock last Friday evening every Teagasc office got a fax saying that all applications had to be with the Department not later than 5 o'clock that evening.  Many applications were with Teagasc and there was no way they could be delivered to the Department by 5 o'clock.  Some of them were delivered on Monday morning but the Department rejected them.  This is grossly unfair to the farming community and to Teagasc.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to re-examine all the applications which were validly and honestly lodged with Teagasc offices, especially in Sligo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear much about the problem of unemployment. I have previously called, and am calling again, for a survey of the unemployed in every area so that we would know if it there were builders, plumbers, electricians, labourers, shop assistants, etc., on the unemployment register.  A list categorising the unemployed in each area would be a great addition to employers and people thinking of setting up a business because they <Col N="1548" /> would know exactly where the best pool of workers were available.  Until we carry out such a survey we will never come to grips with the problem of unemployment.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Social Welfare about this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome tomorrow's debate on Northern Ireland.  In the aftermath of the anniversary of the Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry an apology is needed to the families of those who were killed.  A new inquiry should also be initiated.  I was in Derry last Sunday and watched up to 50,000 people marching in memory of those people.  Not a stone was thrown.  The people were looking for justice for their own.  I would like to impress upon the Leader of the House the need for all parties to keep up the pressure.  One welcomes the words of people like Ken Maginnis, David Irvine and Gary McMichael who have said that if there is new evidence it should be heard. It is up to us keep the pressure on to ensure that justice is seen to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The deliberations of the hepatitis C tribunal are over.  I attended for part of almost every sitting day and it was extraordinarily well organised and informative.  The Minister for Health said he will set up another tribunal to examine the contamination of blood products for haemophiliacs by HIV and hepatitis C.  I have written asking if he would include the contamination of Factor 8 by hepatitis A which took place in the early 1990s; that was the reason I brought my worries about the imported anti-D before the House in 1994.  Would the Leader ask the Minister if he will consider including this episode of contamination in the inquiry?  During the hepatitis C tribunal I heard from witnesses that, to my amazement, this episode was never resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House allow the debate on the Fisheries (Commissions) Bill to cover the Foyle Fisheries Commission or will it be necessary for me to put down an amendment to the Bill?  There is a serious crisis in the commission.  It was fined £40,000 after being found guilty of job discrimination on religious grounds.  That is a serious matter which we cannot tolerate.  The House should have a voice on this issue and, if our voice is not heard, we are condoning a practice which has contributed to the serious problems in Northern Ireland.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on this matter either by putting down an amendment to the Fisheries (Commissions) Bill or by providing time for a debate on the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter about four times and I plead with the Leader to facilitate a debate in the context of the Fisheries (Commissions) Bill.  If I am denied an opportunity <Col N="1549" /> to debate an urgent matter such as this, I question the value of my membership of this House.</P>
      <P>I cannot count the number of times I have sought a debate on the National Roads Authority. The authority has allocated its funding for this year and local authorities in rural Ireland have fared badly.  About 73 per cent of the funding has been allocated to two cities and the rest is being distributed to rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Leader sat on this side of the House he raised similar questions and spoke of the urgent need for a debate on the allocation of funds by and the performance of the National Roads Authority.  Once more I appeal to the Leader to provide for an early debate on this important matter.  Huge sums of money are being distributed by the authority but it is neglecting rural areas, particularly County Donegal.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Sullivan's remarks on unemployment surveys and identification of skills shortages were added to by Senator Ormonde and Senator Farrell.  The shortage of skills is now approaching epidemic proportions in some industries in parts of the country.  It might be useful to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, to come to the House to discuss this issue. She is the Government representative on the National Economic and Social Forum, a body in which a number of Senators from all sides of the House participate.</P>
      <P>The most recent report of the forum deals with early school leaving and related issues.  A discussion on the report might also afford us an opportunity to address the reasons, despite two years of perceived activity, the excellent concept of local employment services has not yet been set up nationally.</P>

      <P>If there was an expansion of that service many of the issues mentioned in the House this afternoon would be constructively debated by employers, educationalists, potential employers and the various State agencies.  That is not happening.  It would also be useful for the House to learn, as I discovered last week at the forum, that the CSO&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In putting the request to the Minister of State, we might ask the Central Statistics Office to operate a new system of statistics gathering.  Senator Farrell's point is valid in that there is one statistic for Dublin and another for the rest of the country, it is not localised or regionalised.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment or someone else to address these issues to give us some indication of how the Government proposes to provide the opportunities which young people need? In some cases they are over-qualified and cannot find employment in their own areas.  This is particularly relevant to the mid-west and western regions.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine recently introduced a by-law to eliminate salmon drift and draft net fishing from some of our estuaries.  Would the Leader arrange for a debate on this by-law which will deprive many people of their livelihood and which introduces controls which are detrimental to people who have been involved in this activity for generations?  There is as much widespread concern about this law in the areas dependent on this type of fishing as there are about salmon stocks.</P>
      <P>The Leader has expressed concern in the House about Sellafield.  The public are alarmed about this matter and any joint approach which can be taken to confront this issue will receive our support.</P>

It is only 30 miles across the sea and if anything were to go wrong it would be as if it had occurred in Dublin.  We <Col N="1551" /> need a united front on this issue as happened last week on the call for an inquiry into Bloody Sunday. That would be of immense value.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the Naval Service and its role in fishery protection and drugs enforcement.  There is a need for investment in the Naval Service to purchase new ships and recruit more people.  If this is not done soon there will be no navy left as a result of the depletion in numbers which is taking place.</P>

I will put aside a half hour for an all-party motion the contents of which we can discuss before then.  It might be a useful addition to our work to have half an hour set aside every week for issues like that.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked for a debate on Partnership 2000 and I will do that in the near future if I can.  He, Senator Dardis and Senator Enright spoke about consumer confidence.  I have said I will make time available for that issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised the issue of criminal justice. There are at least two criminal justice Bills coming before the House in the next two to three weeks so there will be ample opportunity to discuss the matters he raised.  I have no information about a tribunal.  That is a matter for the Government of which I am not a member but I am sure whatever is needed to get to the truth will be provided.</P>

I <Col N="1552" /> saw the collapse in Waterloo Road and it is a miracle that many people were not killed.  There is a clear cause for concern about safety standards and some of the building practices which have crept in. I intend to raise the matter myself and make time available in the House for discussion on this very serious matter.  It is a miracle there have not been more fatalities before now.</P>

There will be a debate on the National Roads Authority but I am not sure when.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly raised the question of draft net fishing.  I do not know if I can make time available for that in the near future.  To answer Senator Fitzgerald, I would love to have a debate on the Naval Service.  I dealt with Senator Mooney's issue when I answered Senator O'Sullivan.</P>

      <P>The central point of this amendment relates to discussion which took place last week, and it is that it should not be possible for officials who are asked for information to find reasons for not granting the information.  As far as possible the Bill should be amended to ensure that impediments could not be put in the way of the requester and that the stated objective of section 6(1), that &ldquo;... every person has a right to and shall, on request therefor, be offered access to any record held by a public body...&rdquo;, is the central ethos of the Bill and the provisions of the Bill should be in accord with that ethos.  Therefore, it is unreasonable to ask the requester to state that the request is made under the Act.  It is an unnecessary imposition.  If somebody gets in touch with a local authority or a Department seeking information on a planning file or some other matter, it should be taken for granted that the provision of the information is covered in the Bill and it should be unnecessary to state that the request is made under this Bill.  Once the request is made it is, by definition, in accordance with the Bill.  I do not see the necessity for this provision. Many ordinary people will make requests as a result of the publicity about the availability of information and they will receive letters to the effect that, since they did not make the request stating that it was made under this regulation, they will be obliged to resubmit it.  That is why I believe that this subsection should be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the House last week, the authorities in New Zealand applied their access to official information legislation without people having to specify that the requests were being made under the Act but they then found that the appeal mechanisms did not kick in unless it was a request under the Act.  The practice which has now emerged there is that people are being asked to specify on a voluntary basis that it is a freedom of information request so that the appeal system will come into play.  That is really the important thing because if it is a plain, ordinary, non-statutory request across the counter, one does not get access to the appeals system.  Presumably, if one makes a straightforward application for information one would get it in the normal course of events, but if one is refused information for a particular reason only freedom of information requests invoke this particular Act in which one has a right of appeal to the Information Commissioner. I know it sounds a little technical but we expect the detail will contain application forms which will state that people may make a freedom of information request.  We will look at that type of detail in the implementation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1554" /> A number of amendments were taken with amendment No. 17 which also deal with the issue of due particularity.  I propose to accept amendment No. 34 tabled by Senator Lee which means that the due particularity provision only applies where somebody has been advised and helped to narrow down the request.  I have been advised by the draftsperson that I do not have to accept amendment No. 35 as a consequential one if I accept amendment No. 34.  That deals with the due particularity point made by a number of Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for accepting amendment No. 34.  If I understood what Senator Dardis said correctly, acceptance of my amendment meets a large part of Senator Dardis's concern to try to make this legislation citizen friendly.  There is an important educational dimension to this Bill.  As I understand it &mdash;the Minister of State can confirm if this is a correct interpretation&mdash;under section 7(1) (a) a person who did not say this was under the Act would be advised that it was there.  In other words, the assistance dimension would mean that those who were not aware of the Act or who did not make the request under it would be alerted to its existence and if they wished to make the request under it they could do so and this would, in due course, allow them access to the appeals system if it came to that.  Is that a correct interpretation of what is involved?</P>
      <P>The assistance dimension is imaginative and it is important that this is not seen, as far as possible, as hostile or adversarial between citizen and official.  It is important that we try to get across to both sides the fact that we are on the same side, which will take time.  The assistance provision is imaginative and constructive and I understand the Minister of State is extending it to section 7 (1) (a).  If my interpretation is correct, I would be glad to have it confirmed because it would answer Senator Dardis's and my concern about people.  If this is not extended to section 7(1) (a), I would like the Minister of State to advise on how it can be to make the provisions as effective as possible.</P>

I still do not understand the reason <Col N="1555" /> people's rights are eroded in terms of the New Zealand example and why their rights are enhanced by the removal of the statement which requires them to say the request was made under the Act.

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We want the Bill to be as pro-requester and user friendly as possible.  We looked carefully at the experience in other countries and found that not specifying it turned out to be anti-requester.  It is pro-requester to say that it is under the Bill because then there are very specific time limits within which you must get answers.  There is a record in the system that it is a freedom of information request and there is an appeal system in place to deal with it.  That tends to &ldquo;soften the cough&rdquo; of people who are responding because if it is an ordinary, straightforward request for information, that does not kick in the rights of the citizen under this Bill. The citizen may be disadvantaged by that request. That had been the practical experience and is the reason I wanted this to be made as simple as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee asked whether accepting his amendment technically meant that the advice had to include advising people that they should specify that the request was made under the Bill.  It does not do so explicitly but the Minister for Finance has to draw up guidelines in terms of implementing the nuts and bolts of it and my staff are involved in the groups that are dealing with this operation.  That is something we would advise and put in place on an administrative basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>We touched on this issue on a previous occasion.  I was smiling when the Minister spoke about being user-friendly.  My own humble efforts at a Freedom of Information Bill which were supported by most sides of the House, including the Minister, ran to three pages of text whereas this one runs to 63 pages.  User-friendly is not a term that I would readily apply to this Bill.  I fully understand there are very complex issues dealt with here.  It seems to me, however, that we are dealing with complex issues in an inordinately complex way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if we are giving people the right to information, the law has to provide that every civil servant will read into every request that the law provides people with the right to information. The Minister stated that it is necessary to contain section 7(1)(a) because it is a good thing to specify in your request that this is a serious request and that it is covered under that section.  The reality is that the majority of Irish citizens will never have heard of section 7(1)(a) of the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996 and they will never be aware of that.  Unless we create a culture where there is a proactive, pro-information, pro-client attitude among all civil servants, the problem is that 7(1)(a) might provide a bolt-hole for <Col N="1556" /> civil servants who want to be less than pro-client and less than pro-active as regards the freedom of information.</P>
    <P>The problem we are attacking in this Bill arises because of the attitude of a very small percentage of public servants.  My experience is that most public servants make a big effect to be helpful and informative.  I have had the experience of public servants taking risks in going out of their way to draw obscurities to the attention of citizens whom they wish to help.  There is, however, a minority of civil and public servants in State and local authorities who will do everything in their power to maintain a veil of secrecy over the activities which they perform in our name and under laws that we set down.</P>
    <P>While I understand at an intellectual level the point the Minister is making, I believe that section 7(1)(a) will be a bolt-hole for public servants. The fact that there are 63 pages in the Bill and that there will be journals produced outlining procedures to be adopted, is testament to the extent of the problem of secrecy.  Secrecy is deeply ingrained in our administrative culture. Senator Howard and I were speaking earlier today about public servants whom we know, who are good people but who have an extraordinary attitude to secrecy.  They have an extraordinary unwillingness to share with the common people, those who pay their wages, the secrets that they possess.  They exist in a kind of confraternity and certainly do not wish to share their secrets with someone as humble as an elected representative. I fear that if a person does not cite the Act because they are unaware of its existence, they will be denied the information they require.  We must consider some formulation other than section 7(1)(a).  I put down an amendment in this regard but I will not press it to a vote because we are attempting to achieve progress through consensus.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister of State work on the concept of inference before Report Stage?  In other words, where it is clear that a person requesting information has a right to do so under the Act, a civil servant cannot depend on section 7(1)(a) to deny that right.  I am not expressing my argument very well but I believe the Minister of State understands what I am trying to achieve.  I know she shares my view that this legislation should deliver the final hammer blow to the citadel of secrecy.  Let us banish the attitude of mind which created that citadel.</P>
    <P>Our deliberations remind me of the debate on the Ombudsman Act when, from some people's reactions, one would have believed that the sky was about to fall and that civil servants would be dragged into the centre of Merrion Square and burned at the stake.  Nothing of that sort happened and there is no reason for anyone who carries out their work in a satisfactory fashion to fear the enactment of the Bill.  However, Members have reason to fear that public servants who do not wish to be forthcoming with information will abuse section 7(1)(a).  I apologise for harping on <Col N="1557" /> this issue but I believe it is central and must be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe Members are on the same wavelength in respect of this issue.  It is merely a question of finding the best means to achieve what is desired.  I do not disagree with earlier contributions on this matter.  Perhaps my comments will be redundant when the Minister of State replies.  However, on amendment No. 17, in which Senator Dardis suggests the removal of section 7(1)(a), she stated that, in light of the experience in New Zealand, it is necessary to retain paragraph (a).  I would not dismiss her statement lightly because she made a valid argument.</P>
      <P>I am not in complete agreement with Senator Roche but I am anxious to hear the Minister of State's response.  The Senator stated that section 7(1)(a) places a severe burden on ordinary citizens seeking information.  He indicated that they must make very clear, in their request, that they are seeking information under section 7(1)(a) of what will be the Freedom of Information Act.  I do not believe it is necessary to be that detailed but I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments.  It should be sufficient that people indicate they are seeking information under the Act.  The Minister of State stressed that it is necessary to retain paragraph (a) because, in light of the experience in New Zealand, the right of appeal by a citizen to a refusal by a public official to provide information will not be jeopardised.  In that context, I would prefer if the right of appeal by the citizen were not put at risk by the removal of paragraph (a), particularly if the Minister of State remains of the view that, on the basis of the examples to which she referred, it is necessary to ensure that right is protected.</P>

      <P>Would it amount to a revolution in administrative law and if so, is it a revolution one should strive to pursue?  If we approached the matter from the opposite end and included a stipulation that it would be assumed that any request made is met under this Act, unless the applicant specifies to the contrary, I am sure assistance would quickly come from an official who wanted to be covered under other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee has made the precise point I wished to make&mdash;that we should turn this on its head.  I accept the logic of what she says as regards appeals and that unless there is a specific reference to the Bill, the appeals system may not operate.  The onus should be on the body which has the information to reply to the written request saying the information will not be provided under whatever section of the Bill, and that the person has time to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 (6) states a form of request may be determined for the purposes of subsection (1) and, if such a form stands determined, a request under that subsection shall be in that form or a <Col N="1558" /> form to the like effect.  That is reasonable and will put the onus back on the officials.  The other possible way of dealing with it is that it should be specified that the form which is produced shall contain a reference to the Bill.  Section 7(2) gives too much strength to the provider of the information to resist the request.  In practice people will not be aware of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the culture of secrecy, I do not want to reopen the debate we had last week but the Minister knows what it is like serving on a local authority.  On Monday last, Kildare County Council considered the draft development plan for County Kildare.  In advance of consideration of that plan, we were asked to submit in writing questions and amendments to it.  There was a reference in the plan to 2,000 tonnes of toxic waste being produced in the county.  I asked the council officials in writing, in advance, where and by whom this toxic waste was generated and how it would be disposed of.  At the council meeting, I received a verbal answer that this matter was contained in the toxic waste management plan for the county and the information I required was there. During the meeting, that plan was distributed but there was not one reference to a specific company. It said &ldquo;a company&rdquo; produces cadmium or &ldquo;a company&rdquo; produces lead, but the people were not specified.</P>
    <P>If it was possible a few weeks in advance of that for Kildare County Council to specify the companies which had applied for air pollution emission licences, and to have those listed, it was also possible for them to produce that list.  That is part of the culture we are trying to destroy and is a matter which should, of necessity, be on public record.  If it was Britain and Sellafield, we would not tolerate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>We have highlighted this central issue.  In this Bill, we either create a right to information or a right to ask for information.  There is a significant difference because one has to know what questions to ask if it is the second kind of Bill and most citizens do not.  In section (1) (a) of the Freedom of Information Bill, 1995, I tried to create a right of information for citizens which would put an onerous responsibility on every public servant, without equivocation, to provide information.  This would have torn asunder the citadel of secrecy.</P>
      <P>This Bill enacts a right to ask for information. There is a subtle but important difference.  As Senator Dardis's case highlighted, one has to be punctilious in specifying that one is using this Bill in every request for information.  I understand that in debates and exchanges in county councils, people will not be so appraised and, as we have found in the past, half-truths and untruths will be passed off as public information.  This is very serious.  We have to ensure there are no bolt holes in this Bill for scoundrels who wish to withhold information from the people who elect us and pay them.  That is the reality and it is a core issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> I do not want to press my amendment because, as Senator Lee and Senator Dardis said, if there is a reasonable inference that people want to have information under this Bill, it should be supplied without them having to specify it.  It would be possible for the Minister to add to this clause on Report Stage.  That would more than meet my requirements.  I want to be supportive of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate.  We all want to ensure this Bill works for requesters.  Senator Lee made two suggestions and Senator Dardis and Senator Roche repeated one of those about the inference that any request was a freedom of information request unless otherwise proved.  We will look at those suggestions and come back with something on Report Stage, which I hope will meet their concerns.  I want to ensure it is practical and works in administration so people can access their time limits, etc.  Section 6 (1), which we have already agreed, confers a right to information, not just a right to ask for it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (2), lines 5 and 6, to delete, &ldquo;or in such other form as may be determined&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;as may be reasonably sought by the requester&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These are drafting changes meant to highlight the issue of access by the applicant and the user friendly nature of the legislation.  As regards the term &ldquo;as may be determined&rdquo;, who would do the determining?  When I read the earlier section I saw it is determined by the Minister for Finance. This amendment is an attempt to add&mdash;if I was doing it again I would not use the term &ldquo;substitute&rdquo;&mdash;something more in the line of a reasonable request for the manner in which it should be submitted.  It is intended to try to get the Minister to be alert to what is of greatest convenience and use to the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister feel there is a reason for modifying or revising the phraseology &ldquo;in such other form as may be determined&rdquo; to some extent as it is an extremely dirigiste formulation? <Col N="1560" /> I do not want to say &ldquo;to substitute for&rdquo; because I will not press the amendments in terms of substitutions now I am fully aware of what the formulation means.  Does the Minister think it is worthwhile using additional phraseology which would indicate that the determination is intended to be in the best interests of facilitating applications?</P>

      <P>These particular sections deal with a situation where somebody has made a request.  It is basically the form of acknowledgement they receive telling them what is happening to their request.  We inserted &ldquo;or in such other form as may be determined&rdquo; to allow returns by E-mail or other electronic communications as they develop, such as the Internet.</P>
      <P>It may be a trivial example, but if someone requested that an annulment of their request be written on the side of a cow it would be totally unreasonable.  This is about administrative procedure. We will have another look at it on Report Stage but it is intended that this would be very simple.  We are leaving in &ldquo;or in such other form as may be determined&rdquo;.  At the moment, people would normally be informed in writing but it will be open to them to send a reply by E-mail and this will make it easier to do so.</P>

      <P>I accept that, and if this is not seen to be a major substantive issue I am certainly not pressing it.  We had a discussion the last day concerning the fact that not everybody who ought to be in a position to take advantage of the Bill will be literate, some people might be among those who derive least from our administrative system, whether they be travellers or the disabied. It seems to me that &ldquo;or in such other form as may be determined&rdquo; should take cognisance of that as well as technicalities of the type the Minister mentioned.  Such people are even less likely to be familiar with E-mail than they are with writing if they are not literate in the first place.  Perhaps the Minister could keep that dimension in mind.</P>

It is all governed by section 36 where the Information Commissioner has an overseeing role to ensure that, in practice, this is implemented in a reasonable way.  It is a safeguard that the citizens' rights are there.  We did not want, however, to tie ourselves down to one form of communication by saying &ldquo;writing&rdquo; because new forms of communication may become the norm in future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (3), line 15, after &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, or in the opinion of,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are slightly pernickety but they try to ensure that the greatest elasticity possible is built into facilitating access to information. This operates if the head definitely notes that this information is held by another specific public body they can pass it on but if they do not know, what happens then?  They may assume and say &ldquo;it is highly likely that&rdquo;, but here it is phrased &ldquo;to the knowledge of the head is or are held&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggests inserting &ldquo;or in the opinion of&rdquo;.  That is likely to be held as the outer limit of where you begin looking around if you do not know.  It is a simple matter for a head to say that they do not know where these things are. They may be right, they may not know, but from their experience they are likely to have a shrewd opinion of the first place to which you might turn. However, as the Bill stands, it is a definite formulation. That is the intention behind the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Lee's amendments which are very reasonable.  The head might not have definite knowledge as to the location of the file but he might have a good idea where it is.  That is why it is desirable to insert &ldquo;or in the opinion of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled my related amendment to include the words &ldquo;or more&rdquo; after &ldquo;one of the other bodies&rdquo; specified under subsection (3) because, from my reading of it &mdash; and I am prepared to stand corrected by the Minister &mdash; it appears it would be possible to limit it to one.  I do not think that is the intention of the Bill.  If more than one body is involved, they should all be treated in the same way and not restricted to one.  It is a small procedural point.  If the Minister believes otherwise then I am prepared to accept that it may not be required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to the points being raised and with what Senators are trying to do.  The wording &ldquo;the knowledge of&rdquo; in section 7(3) is based on Australian legislation and we are not aware of any particular difficulties arising from it.  We want to ensure this works in the best interests of the applicant and we will not have people saying the request is for somebody else.  In that way they could fob it off and send the request around the administrative system.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is there so it is the duty of the first person to know where it should go. The requester is realistically entitled to expect that the second body to whom any request is passed on should actually deal with it, in other words, it will not do a tour of the system based on opinions but will immediately find a proper home based on knowledge.  That was the thinking behind it and it seems to be working well in another jurisdiction from where the language was lifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> The same point applies to &ldquo;likely to be&rdquo;.  If we tie this down the way in the Bill as drafted, it imposes tighter obligations on the first body to find a good home for it.  If we leave it loose, the request may be sent around the system without finding a good home because one person may think it is somebody else's job and will not have the duty to find out.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to Senator Lee's amendment No. 25 which requires the Minister to prepare guidelines.  I propose to adopt that on Report Stage.  We will come to that later.  This will guarantee fairness, in other words, there will be guidelines on how to transfer requests.  In addition, the commissioner will be involved in overseeing guidelines for requests.  That will ensure that what we are looking for will actually happen.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Dardis's amendment No. 22, we are concerned that it should not be too wide, but that it will be tied down to somebody who has responsibility for replying to the request. The provision is based on practical considerations. Very often a document or memo that is created in one Department is copied to the other 14 Departments for information or comment.  The main information source is obviously those who created the document and who have responsibility for collating it.</P>
    <P>From their experience of the public service, Senator Lee and Senator Roche will be familiar with the memorandum for Government procedure and round robins.  I understand the reasons for the amendment, placing an unreasonable burden on public bodies to express and consider all other bodies who may hold copies of the record, without conferring a particular benefit on the requester.  The interests of the requester, however, are more directly served by placing responsibility on the primary holding body of the information and to let them do any other picking up that is required.</P>
    <P>There is some discretion in the section whereby the head may alternatively direct the requester to a body that is otherwise more appropriate.  Sometimes two Departments may have parts of the information so the responsibility would lie with somebody to pull it all together.</P>
    <P>We may be able to return to this on Report Stage.  We will have another think about what the Senator is trying to do.  In our view, it is drafted in the most pro-requester way.  This matter is quite technical but Senator Lee's amendment No. 25 brings in the commissioner to oversee that these procedures work well.  I do not want to insert something that ends up with requests getting lost in the system.  I am sure Senators share my view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">

      <P>I am very appreciative of the acceptance of amendment No. 25.  However, had I read subsection (3) as the Minister is doing &mdash; that &ldquo;the knowledge of&rdquo; implies that it is the duty of the head to find out and then proceed &mdash; I would not have tabled the amendment.  That covers exactly what I am trying to achieve, but <Col N="1563" /> that is not how I read it.  &ldquo;To the knowledge of&rdquo; means to me that the person knows where the request ought to be going.  If the Minister is satisfied that the phraseology can only be interpreted in the way in which she has indicated, I gladly withdraw my amendment.  However, if there is any possible doubt I hope that, on Report Stage, there will be a phraseology which would make it crystal clear that it is the duty of the head to have that knowledge or to find out that knowledge if they do not have it themselves and to ensure that it proceeds to the proper terminus.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to make a major issue of the &ldquo;or more&rdquo; phraseology.  However, the subsection makes an earlier reference to records which, to the knowledge of the head are being &ldquo;held by one or more other public bodies&rdquo;.  The reason for the second &ldquo;or more&rdquo; is not to create a paper chase but for consistency where the person who is responding to the requester has knowledge of information being in the possession of more than one body.</P>

      <P>We keep crossing backwards and forwards in this debate over the foundations of the Freedom of Information Bill and administrative procedures legislation.  The type of arrangement Senator Lee mentioned was one of the most intriguing and welcome innovations in French administrative structures introduced by former President Mitterand.  He introduced the extraordinary diktat that a civil servant or a public servant who received a request from the public could not simply say &ldquo;this is not for me&rdquo; and discard it. They now had a statutory responsibility to direct that information to an appropriate person within the administration, to inform the requester in writing where the request had gone and to ensure that the second recipient civil or public servant responded.  The full name, address and telephone number of the second recipient had also to be given to the citizen.  It was an extraordinary innovation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The head&rdquo; could be a Minister and the Minister cannot readily delegate responsibilities under the current legislation without first getting the agreement of the Oireachtas.  Does this confer a general right on Ministers to delegate responsibility in a wide sense?  If that is the case something is happening under the Ministers and Secretaries legislation that has never happened since 1924, namely, that the Oireachtas is giving a general right to political heads of Departments to delegate activities.  There could be an extraordinary abuse of that power.  A Minister, <Col N="1565" /> faced with the possibility of some politically difficult situation, could delegate responsibility for the difficult areas of administration without the Oireachtas discussing it.  I know that sounds farfetched, but for the first time we are giving a general right to a Minister to delegate functions in a general way within their own Department.  If that interpretation is correct, then it is an extraordinarily wide development and I wonder what its impact would be?</P>

      <P>Section 8 (2) (d) provides that if a request is refused the reason for the refusal must be given. However, the refusal should specify the reasons under the Bill.  If it is consistent to state that the requester must make the request under a provision of the Bill, it is reasonable that where the request is refused the relevant section of the Bill under which it is refused should be quoted. Section 8 (1) (a) refers to the decision on whether to grant or refuse a request and section 8 (1) (b) further states that if the request is granted a head shall &ldquo;determine the form and manner in which the right of access will be exercised&rdquo;.

      <P>The provision in the Bill is based on a system that has worked well in other jurisdications for over a decade.  One can appeal to the commissioner if one is refused a voluminous request and he or she will decide if the public interest is served by a person receiving 18 or so truck loads of documents.  However, it is important to provide protection against excessive voluminous requests.  A number of safeguards are already provided for the public interest and a refusal can be appealed to the Information Commissioner. Public bodies are obliged under section 10 (2) to assist or offer to assist a request before claiming it is voluminous and the level of assistance which is offered in terms of narrowing the request can be investigated by the commissioner when considering an appeal.  The provision is working well in other jurisdictions so I advise caution.</P>

      <P>In page 17, subsection (2), line 28, to delete &ldquo;4 weeks&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;8 weeks&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The intention of this amendment is to give more time to the requester of the information.  In other words, information is being made available and, under the Bill as drafted, the record is to be kept available for a period of four weeks.  The public bodies have been given a long time in which to respond and they have far more resources than the private individual.  It would be liberal to give the private individual a good degree of flexibility. I understand that if the period is too long it could create working difficulties and there could be a backlog of documents to be looked at.  However, two weeks is too restrictive for the ordinary citizen and four weeks would be more appropriate. I am prepared to say it should be eight rather than four weeks but I will accept a different figure.</P>

      <P>Section 11 permits deferral of access to a narrow range of records in specified circumstances.  The time limits are aligned with the availability of records and the standard provisions in section 8(3).  This section states that <Col N="1569" /> public bodies should hold records for four weeks if an individual wishes to inspect them on the premises of that body and in this narrow range there could be a deferral.  We are using the same time limits as in section 8(3) because it would not make sense to have different time limits in the two circumstances.  The papers we are talking about tend to be current working records and it would be unreasonable for the Minister to expect a public body to set them aside for eight weeks and not have them available for ongoing work. Four weeks is more reasonable.</P>

    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill whereby a reference book will be prepared and that information will be made available.  However, it is important that this would be circulated to members of local authorities and health boards. By virtue of the fact that they are in the same position as the ordinary citizen and would not be overly familiar with the terms of the Bill, it would be useful for them to have the reference book. My local authority has agreed to this in respect of planning guidelines so they would be available to planners, developers and members of the council.  Information should be given to elected local authority members on how to access information and how to advise members of the public to do the same.</P>

Line 49 on page 22 states that the Minister &ldquo;shall cause notice of those places to be published in such manner as he or she considers adequate for the purposes of this section.&rdquo; Potentially, there are several Ministers or heads involved.  Is it envisaged that there would be some degree of consistency or will it be left to the discretion of individuals?  I presume the intention is to have it as generous as possible but is there any way of ensuring that such will be the case if a Minister or head decides otherwise?</P>

      <P>There is a problem in that there is no guarantee of consistency in the attitudes of different Departments and agencies because of the degree of discretion allowed.  This is understandable. I was planning to table an amendment but I could not see a way to amend it to achieve the point made by Senator Lee that there must be consistency in the interpretation.  If a query went to appeal before the commissioner, that is where the ultimate decision would be made. However, it strikes me that it would be good at the same time to try and ensure a consistency. Would it be possible to signal an amendment on this section on Report Stage?  I have examined it and cannot think of an amendment which would address the point Senator Lee made but I am prepared to return to chiselling at the quarry face. The Minister is sympathetic and her attitude has been the same as ours throughout this, but there is a little problem here.</P>

      <P>Under section 15(6), the Minister is the Minister for Finance and the intention is that there would be general uniform guidelines.  The places we would expect these manuals and copies of guidelines to be available would obviously be the offices of the public body concerned.  The intention also is that the Department of Finance would ensure that they would be available, for example, in local public libraries and that there would be a pattern to the places where this information would be available.  The Department of Finance would also prepare a summary of the guides which would be available in all public libraries and public offices throughout the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have problems with the early parts of section 19.  I understand the constitutional imperative and that Cabinet secrecy is concerned here, the relaxation of which we look forward to.  I have difficulty specifically with section 19(1)(c), which deals with the grounds for granting a request.  It says &ldquo;contains information (including advice) for a member of the Government, the Attorney General, Minister of State, the Secretary to the Government or the Assistant Secretary to the Government for use by him or her solely for the purpose of the transaction of any business of the Government at a meeting of the Government.&rdquo;.  I understand we are dealing with the constitutional aspect but I have some questions about the inclusion of the Minister of State.  Could the Minister explain why it is required that a Minister of State be included with the other categories of people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It bothers me that if there were something extremely sensitive which the Government did not want released, the easy way out would be to raise it at Cabinet thereby circumventing the intention of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be understood that this section greatly relaxes access to Government papers.  At the press conference where I announced the Bill, there was a stunned silence when I explained exactly what this section meant. It provides limited and time bound protection for matters prepared for Government, related briefing material and Government records.  This <Col N="1573" /> material can become available and the protection will be no longer applicable when five or more years elapse from the relevant decision being made or, in respect of factual information, where the associated decision has been published, unless another exemption protects the information. Basically, after a Government decision has been made and published, the factual material relating to that decision is released.  Secondly, within five years, the whole memorandum is released, unless there is some degree of protection because it concerns security or the personal affairs of an individual. In other words, the material is intrinsically covered by another exemption.</P>
      <P>The exemption under section 19 only applies to material specifically prepared for Government.  It would not be open to someone to run something past the Government thereby acquiring protection. It is simply not available.  It only applies to material specifically prepared for Government. Such material would ordinarily consist of a Government memorandum, for example. Government decisions are protected up to the point where the decision is communicated.</P>
      <P>As regards the point made about the Minister of State, in all Administrations the Government Chief Whip is a Minister of State, attends Government meetings and would in the normal course receive such Government papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, why not specify the Chief Whip rather than a Minister of State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a valid point because, as I understand it, the Minister of State who is Chief Whip is not a member of the Government.  He or she is there in a purely advisory role and has no constitutional status.  The Constitution does not recognise political parties nor does it recognise Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this draft has had to be introduced because of the peculiarity of the high chair at the Cabinet table.  This is a serious point because Ministers of State are not Ministers of the Government.  The Chief Whip is not a member of the Government and has no constitutional standing as such.  There is no reason whatsoever that papers produced in the office of the Minister of State should be accorded this exalted status way and above the status of such an office, with all due respect to the Minister of State present.</P>

      <P>First, let me congratulate the Minister on this important section.  It makes a major contribution to opening up possibilities.  In fact, when I read this I actually asked myself &ldquo;Has she really got this through?&rdquo;  and I decided <Col N="1574" /> that I would not ask her in case she must say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>For a contemporary historian, section 19(4)(a) is a very powerful argument in favour of single party Government so that there cannot be vetoes by leaders of small parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that Senator Dardis and Senator Roche have a strong point: that instead of saying a Minister of State, one should be as specific as possible.  Even allowing for the Deputy Rabbitte situation, or if something like that happens with future Governments or if something cognate happens with future Governments, let a specific amendment to this Act be introduced for the duration of that particular Government rather than have an encompassing clause as general as this.  One would not object to specific amendments in specific situations for specific cases rather than trying to anticipate the totality of possibilities in advance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of a meeting of the Government includes a meeting of a Government subcommittee, which would involve one or more Ministers of State.  From time to time, for various purposes and under all Administrations, those kinds of subcommittees &mdash; such as the Cabinet subcommittee on drugs, for example &mdash; are set up.  It is for that reason that we have the generic term &ldquo;Ministers of State&rdquo; there and it is not a back door way for people to receive Government papers because they happen to have been seen by a particular Minister of State.  They do not come out into the public domain; they are kept in the normal way and come out in the normal, regular way as provided for in this section &mdash; in other words, factual information as soon as a decision is published and a full memorandum within five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 28, lines 12 to 17, to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>This amendment has to do, again, with reasons for refusal to grant a request.  Section 20(1)(a) states:</P>
      <P>if the record concerned contains matters relating to the deliberative processes of the public body concerned (including opinions, advice, recommendations, and the results of consultations, considered by the body, the head of the body, or a member of the body or of the staff of the body for the purpose of those processes), and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> The reason I moved the deletion of the paragraph was that I found it extremely difficult to devise a form of words which would try and get across what I wanted to achieve.  To return to the example of a county council, whereby advice is given to the members of the council, I do not see why such advice should not be in the public domain.  I can understand the circumstances where there is legal advice in respect of a court case or some such matter and there might be some grounds in such a case for not releasing the advice until the court case was resolved.</P>
    <P>This paragraph imposes undue restrictions.  It is the loophole to which I referred last week, the &ldquo;yes, but syndrome&rdquo;.  Yes, we are in favour of freedom of information, but there are all these circumstances in which the information cannot be given and this paragraph imposes undue restriction on the freedom of information.  I am prepared to accept that the paragraph should be amended but I moved to have it deleted because it is difficult to come up with a wording which will meet the objective I have in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of Senator Dardis's amendment partly because I see words like &ldquo;relating to the deliberative processes of the public body&rdquo;.  Processes can encompass almost anything and that raises questions in my mind about what could be hidden behind &ldquo;processes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Second, section 20(1)(b) states:</P>
      <P>the granting of the request would, in the opinion of the head, be contrary to the public interest.</P>
      <P>Presumably, &ldquo;in the opinion&rdquo; means at the head's absolute discretion subject to an appeal to the commissioner.  Does section 20(1)(b) not cover section 20(1)(a) in a sense?  If the head wants to say that revealing what is included under section 20(1)(a) would be contrary to the public interest, let he or she make that case.  If it cannot be shown to be contrary to the public interest, it does not need to be there in the first place so it seems to me to be undesirable and, if not, redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  It is both undesirable and redundant and it should be removed.  To illustrate the &ldquo;deliberative processes&rdquo;, the deliberative process of Wicklow County Council recently led county officials to giving certain advice to councillors and the Glendine Wood, an area which would be well known to Senator Dardis, was rezoned.  The hill of that national heritage site will now be completely obliterated.  The moat and the last outpost of the Hiberno-Viking Kings of Dublin will be destroyed in its entirety.  The county council was told at one stage that the Office of Public Works had produced work which stated there was nothing of archaeological value there. It turned out it had produced work which stated that there was nothing of archaeological value in one of the 147 acres which have been destroyed at the 175 acre forest.  The &ldquo;deliberative process&rdquo;<Col N="1576" /> there involved the interpretation which some of the county council officials put on the document they received from the Office of Public Works which now has been greeted with derision.</P>
      <P>It strikes me that sometimes the very essence of the questions which one would seek to ask about public bodies is the information and advice which informed the deliberative process; and if that particular section remains as it is, it could be used as a means to prevent people from informing themselves after the event of occasions where public representatives were misled, particularly in local authorities.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the protection which the Minister of State wants to achieve in section 20(1)(b) and section 20(1)(a) is better achieved by section 20(1)(b) simply by reference to the public interest, because the commissioner could determine at the end of the day.  To extend that protection to matters relating to the deliberative process would be absolutely disastrous.  The Minister would be aware of this from experience in local authorities.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister re-examine this section.  I am putting down a marker that, having looked at it and thought about it, I will propose that it be removed or dramatically changed on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">

      <P>It is a very complicated section. Subsection (2) states that subsection (1) does not apply in certain situations relating to section 16 and there are a list of such situations.  Subsection (3) states that section 20(1)(b) does not apply to certain other aspects of the matter, so it is quite complicated and I would appreciate some clarification from the Minister.</P>
      <P>If one reads section 20(1) in isolation, it appears to be something with which we would all disagree; but when one reads the subsequent subsections, it does not appear to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan's point is a good one because subsection (2) almost makes subsection (1) redundant.  It would seem to make far better sense to consolidate section 20(1), but that is a drafting matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee's point, about where the head believes the request would be contrary to the public interest, is correct also.  This would reinforce the argument that section 20(1)(a) is not necessary.  Why should it be included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to protect certain narrow elements of the policy making process until a decision has been taken. The request can only be refused under the section <Col N="1577" /> where it would be contrary to the public interest to reveal the information in advance.  As Senator O'Sullivan pointed out, section 20(2) lists the protection offered to a range of information, including matter used, factual, including statistical information, reasons for making a decision, reports of investigations into efficiency and so on and scientific and expert reports.  The protection offered by that subsection to information is extremely narrow. It is the only section where one can invoke the protection where it would damage the public interest if one gave out the information.</P>
      <P>A severe hurdle must be overcome by a head of a public body who decides to withhold information under this section.  If we move along the lines suggested by Senator Dardis, it would give no guidance to a head in terms of discretion, which section 20(1) does.  It seeks to narrow this down.  If we delete section 20(1) it would leave discretion to a head to refuse a request where a grant would be contrary to the public interest without reference to the type of material involved.  We felt it would create undue ambiguity about what might qualify for protection.</P>
      <P>This provision was carefully constructed and is modelled on similar provisions in Australia, Canada and the US.  I am worried that if we adopt Senator Dardis's amendment, it would disable the provision and both the public bodies concerned and the information commissioner would have no guidance as to what this was about.  The exceptions to the exemption in section 20(2) are sufficiently broad.  Material may be protection in only a narrow range of circumstances.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to ensure public bodies can get on with making decisions.  It also deals with instances where premature disclosure half way through the policy making process would damage the public interest.  There is a severe test in that a head of a public body would have to satisfy and give reasons to the information commissioner that the premature release of the information would damage the public interest.  We are not looking at a major loophole; this is a narrow and tightly drafted section.  Other jurisdictions which have freedom of information have found that they need limited protection for the policy making process.  This section is modelled on that and it exempts as little as is practically possible.</P>

      <P>I am still not convinced by the Minister of State's argument.  She spoke about the advice one might give to a head.  I think it was Wellington who said publish and be damned&mdash; Senator Lee can correct me if I am wrong as I bow to his knowledge on the matter.  That is the type of perspective I have on this.  What is wrong with all these restrictions?  It is extremely difficult to read this section and then to say precisely what is in mind.  Even granting a request that is contrary to the public interest is circumscribed by section 20(3) and is extremely complicated.  My intention&mdash;I suspect it is that of the Minister of State as well&mdash;is to ensure that as much of this <Col N="1578" /> material comes into the public domain as possible. If, as Senator Roche said, it is part of the deliberative process of the public body, I do not understand why any of this information should be withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I labour under the disadvantage of not being a member of the bodies likely to be involved in this decision making.  Like Senator Dardis, I am a little uneasy about this.  Section 21(2) states: &ldquo;Subsection (1) shall not apply in relation to a case in which the opinion of the head concerned, the public interest would, on balance, be better served...&rdquo;.  That brings us back to the point about consistency in that the judgment of the heads concerned could vary from one to another and this might be appealed to the Information Commissioner.</P>
      <P>A huge problem with the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner is the resources they have to conduct their affairs effectively.  The more appeals that can be made to them, the more clogged up their offices will become trying to decide on matters unless they are given more resources.  The role of the Information Commissioner is crucial but the more appeals that are made, the less effectively the Bill will work in normal circumstances because it will mean that one side or the other is dissatisfied with what is happening.  I hope a torrent of appeals will not be made to the Information Commissioner from both sides.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the Minister of State mentioned the danger of premature disclosure in terms of the deliberative process.  I agree that if something is confidential while a decision is being made, it would not be open to anybody trying to discover something at that time.  There should be some type of designation about when information could become available in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spoke about certain narrow circumstances.  Looking at the phraseology of section 20(1)(a), &ldquo;processes&rdquo; is a very elastic concept. The paragraph states &ldquo;(including opinions, advice, recommendations, and the results of consultations, considered by the body, the head of the body, or a member of the body or of the staff of the body...)&rdquo;.  That blocks fairly comprehensively whatever it is setting out to block.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that point.  If section 20 (1)(b) is included, why is section 20(1)(a) required?  If it is contrary to the public interest and that the head will make the decision, it can be appealed.  If it is not contrary to the public interest, he or she should not be making that decision.  I do not see the need for section 20(1)(a) if section 20(1)(b) is included.</P>

      <P>If we delete section 20(1)(a) &mdash; I believe Senator Dardis said he was not <Col N="1579" /> particularly in favour of deleting it but he could not think how it could be amended&mdash;the section would read that a head may refuse to grant a request where the granting of the request would, in the opinion of the head, be contrary to the public interest.  It does not say what the protection is about.  The purpose of the section is to allow a limited degree of protection to the policy making process where it would be contrary to the public interest to have premature disclosure until decisions were made.  Unless we specify that in section 20(1)(a) it would become a free flowing public interest matter about which we and the Information Commissioner would know nothing. This ties down what this is about.  It is a limited and time bound protection for the policy making process.</P>
      <P>In the normal course, once a decision has been taken and promulgated, it would not be contrary to the public interest for the material and negotiations which proceeded to come out.  There may be occasions&mdash;and this is dealt with in another section&mdash;in terms of bargaining stances where information coming out after the event may be inappropriate.  This is about instances where premature disclosure would be contrary to the public interest and it is literally limited to that. We do not see the protection in this section applying to factual information or expert reports. That information comes into the public domain whether a decision has been taken or the policy process has been completed.  There is a great deal of openness here.  We are tying down and specifying in a narrow way to what the exemption refers.</P>

      <P>We are talking about preliminary drafts and documents that inform a debate which has not been completed or which is part of a negotiation process.  I tried to achieve that, not very successfully, in section 5 (a) of my own Bill because in the Norwegian legislation, as one of the Minister's officials pointed out, they took the view, and it is a logical one, that a preliminary draft which is prepared to inform a debate and which is part of a negotiation process clearly could not be in the public domain until such time as the decision is made.  At that stage, it would be part of an historic record and it would be good for that information to come into the public domain.</P>
      <P>That is what the Minister is trying to get at and I do not think anyone would deny that, in practical terms, it must be achieved.  However, it could be achieved in a more simple and understandable way than what is proposed.  Will the Minister look at something along the lines of section 5 (a) of my Bill?  I intend tabling a Report Stage amendment on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read section 28 several times and I feel a great sense of unease about it.  My unease arises because this entire section seems to be unnecessarily complex.  I would like the Minister to assure me about the level of power and authority that seems to be granted to the head.  I see the point that the Minister is making in this section of the Bill.  It is that personal information which is in the possession of the public body must be retained and guarded in order to protect the rights of an individual.  However, this section overdoes it.  I would have felt, particularly with the passage of time as it includes information relating to someone who is dead, that it would be in the general interest that information would be made more freely available.  I know this is difficult. I recognise that the aim is to protect a living person against any personal information which has come into the possession of a public body <Col N="1582" /> being made freely available to people who have a prurient interest in their lives.  I can see that, with the passage of time, it would sometimes be in the greater public interest for such information to be made available.</P>
      <P>I am not sure how I could word an amendment on this.  I had intended to contact the Minister's Department on this matter, but if the Minister could assure me that this would not mean that historical records would be locked up in the Department forever, I would be quite happy.  If not, I will try to word an amendment for Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is to protect the personal privacy of individuals and that unstated constitutional right to personal privacy.  It is important to ensure that personal details which individuals supply or which are available for legitimate purposes in a public Department are not available to all sorts of people.  It is proposed that the Minister for Finance will make regulations covering access to information for next of kin or parents in respect of their children because such issues are sufficiently sensitive that it would not be appropriate to put it into primary legislation.</P>
      <P>However, one of the cases made very strongly to us when we were drafting this legislation is that in the normal course of events, if my husband was dead, I would get his medical records but there can be situations where, for example, in the case of somebody who is suffering from AIDS who is dying, a person wants an absolute assurance that the cause of death will not be conveyed to their parents. They would die happy and in comfort knowing that the information will remain private.  It is in order to allow for that kind of detail and sensitivity that this matter will be dealt with by means of regulation.  Equally, with regard to the example of a minor child being entitled to their records while their parents cannot see them versus that of a parent being allowed to see a child's school records, at what point is a parent entitled to see the medical records if their child is using contraception, etc?  These are difficult issues which we propose to address by way of regulations rather than by specifying in the primary legislation.</P>
      <P>I reconsidered the wording and I am not completely satisfied about circumstances where the public interest can override the right to personal privacy.  In that context, I propose to substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because it is important that we respect people's right to privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Roche's point, the Archives Act allows access to information following a period of 30 years.  This would permit access, for historical purposes, to the records of deceased persons.  I received correspondence from distressed relatives regarding articles written about deceased persons.  The Law Reform Commission made a recommendation in its report on defamation that a defamation of the dead should apply in cases of recent death because of the distress that could be caused to families.  Members <Col N="1583" /> are aware of the Hilliard case and the distress caused by an article published in <i>The Phoenix</i>, which the owners of the magazine later admitted was utterly untrue.  The Law Reform Commission's recommendation emerged as a result of that case and is being carefully examined by the Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>In terms of historical access, the Archives Act should prove adequate.  However, people are entitled to know, within reason, that their secrets will not be revealed immediately after their death.  For this reason, we propose to deal with the sensitivities surrounding access to information in respect of deceased persons by means of regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a useful discussion because, ardent advocate though I am of freedom of information, I believe in the right to privacy. Legislation must ensure that, as far as possible, the right to privacy is protected where the balance is in favour of that right, contrary to any other considerations.  I agree with the Minister of State about the way records can be misused, including those under archive, despite the fact that, as a historian, I am anxious to have access to as much information as possible.  I am aware of cases where unsubstantiated charges and accusations made against persons were reproduced by people using the archives, as if they were valid, without any attempt to state the opposing argument or note that archive material had been refuted or was not substantiated.  That can happen not only in relation to the dead but also in respect of those who may still be alive and who may not wish to become involved in reopening matters in respect of which they were totally innocent.  There is scope for abuse of information by irresponsible people and those who might be so abused are entitled to have their rights protected by the State.</P>
      <P>With regard to the examples the Minister of State quoted regarding the area of health, she is justified in reconsidering the relevant provision to ensure it is drafted in a satisfactory manner.  It may seem slightly pedantic to ask but the term &ldquo;to avoid a serious and imminent danger to the life or health of an individual&rdquo; is used in section 28(2)(e).  It is left to the opinion of the head to decide what is meant by &ldquo;serious and imminent danger&rdquo;, presumably medical advice, etc., is taken in that regard.  By definition, &ldquo;imminent danger to life&rdquo; is serious.  What scope exists in respect of the opinions of individual heads &mdash; this can vary from case to case &mdash; regarding the interpretation of what constitutes &ldquo;serious and imminent danger&rdquo;?  Imminent is a somewhat elastic concept.  I do not want to press the issue but I would be reassured if clarification were offered.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's response was very enlightening.  I believe regulations are the appropriate way to deal with this complex issue.  It was interesting that the Minister of State <Col N="1584" /> referred to the Hilliard case.  I am familiar with that case because I knew the man who died and his wife was a work colleague of mine.  That case is a good example of how the reputation of deceased persons can be seriously maligned by people who are careless about the way they use information received after the event.  The Minister of State reassured me and I will be interested to see what she will do on Report Stage.  On balance, however, she answered the questions put to her.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the option of spending a further three years trawling through the secrecy provisions of all other enactments and receiving reports as to whether they should remain, be amended or otherwise.  It is proposed instead to charge a committee of the Dáil with carrying out that function, consider the various Acts, receive reports from Government bodies and lay its own report before the House, which will also be placed in the public domain.  The section provides that the Information Commissioner may give a report on the secrecy provisions of any enactment.  For example, there are secrecy provisions in the IDA Acts which were put in place for very good reasons.  Companies such as Intel or Motorola engaged in business with the IDA supply confidential commercial information and it would not be fair that that information would be available to their rivals <i>via</i> the freedom of information mechanism.  Those secrecy provisions will stand the test of any review process.</P>
      <P>However, if a Department puts forward an unduly conservative reason &mdash; which would not stand up to scrutiny in today's modern world &mdash; for retaining a particular secrecy provision, the committee will have available to it a report from the Information Commissioner if it so requests and can make recommendations in respect of what will happen with the secrecy provisions in question.  By taking this line, we have ensured that the Freedom of Information Bill was introduced a number of years earlier than had we trawled through each individual case.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, Senator McGennis raised the issue of adoption information which involves particular sensitivities.  We are not engaging in a blanket repeal and that matter is <i>sub judice</i> at present because of the Supreme Court case to be heard at the end of March.  This allows a mechanism where on a case by case basis, confidentiality or secrecy provisions in particular Acts, some of which may be there for good reasons or others which, in the light of modern thinking or the passage of time no longer apply, may be repealed.  In the Third Schedule to the Bill, a series of blanket, catch-all secrecy provisions as regards the Official Secrets Act, 1963, the Gas Act, 1976, the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, etc., are repealed <i>in toto</i> with the Freedom of Information Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply which did not quite answer the question I asked.  Why can there not be an Oireachtas joint committee of both Houses?  It is my entirely biased view, which I am sure is not shared by anyone in either House, that the deliberations on freedom of information legislation conducted entirely by Members of the other <Col N="1586" /> House did not necessarily improve matters because many issues which should have been dealt with at that time were not.</P>
      <P>Historically, there has been more interest in this House on the issue of freedom of information. With respect, there has been a passion for freedom of information in this House which has not been shared by the Dáil.  Why is the Seanad continuously ignored in this matter?  I am sure there is a perfectly adequate reason why we cannot have an Oireachtas joint committee.  I would like to hear it as I cannot imagine what it is.</P>
      <P>In getting the widest possible spectrum of views it would be a good idea if this committee carried out a continuous review.  A committee established to support the freedom commissioner and the concept of freedom of information should be a joint committee of both Houses.  I am not sure if my colleagues in my parliamentary party in the other House support me and I do not particularly care if they do or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to that committee, I do not think I would be doing them an injustice in saying they have an extraordinary range of responsibilities as a Dáil legislative committee. The Minister is probably aware it is my view that many of the committees we have in both Houses are not clearly focused anyway.  We should have functional committees in specific areas of Government looking at the spectrum of those functions rather than individual specific committees dealing, for example, with legislation.  I do not think that committee can possibly deal with that whole remit.  That is a wider issue of Dáil reform and the committee system.</P>
      <P>Historically, there has been a positive interest in freedom of information in this House, going back over at least three Seanads.  Members such as the former Senator Brendan Ryan debated the matter.  The creation of an Ombudsman was discussed in the early 1980s.  There has been far more active interest in those issues in this House than there has been in the Dáil, because of its nature.</P>
      <P>The Dáil committee should not be an existing committee which is already overburdened and not clearly focused.  It should be an Oireachtas joint committee that looks at the issue of information. There would be benefits in this.  We need a standing committee in both Houses to look at the issue of public service reform, which is where this issue belongs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 43, subsection (3), line 11, to delete &ldquo;the person&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;such person as has been selected by the serving members of the Civil Service Commission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am returning to an old hobby horse of mine. There was a debate in this House in the early 1980s about the creation of an Ombudsman.  One Member who went on to the Dáil, the late John Kelly, did me the great honour of quoting extensively from an article I had written in a magazine called IBAR, attacking the Ombudsman proposals as extremely timid.  The issue of the appointment of a commissioner or of independent authorities is that they should be independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate in the other House on the creation of the Ombudsman, the then Taoiseach accepted as a point of principle that the Ombudsman should not be seen to be coming exclusively from the Government and gave an undertaking that the Ombudsman should not be seen as the favoured nominee of Government.  He indicated there would be a process of consultation in which the leaders of other parties would be informed in advance of the name of the Ombudsman.  Prior to the press release going out with the name of Michael Mills and later Kevin Murphy, the names were circulated to the Leader of the Opposition, which was not what was intended by consultation. <Col N="1588" /> Under this section, the Ombudsman will be the commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. E. Fitzgerald Ms. E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The first commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, accepting that the Ombudsman will be the first commissioner, it would be good practice if we could have an independent production of the listing of people we would consider for this position.  I believe, and this in no way reflects on the qualities of either Mr. Murphy, the current Ombudsman or Mr. Mills, his predecessor &mdash; one of them, as the Minister knows, worked closely with me for years and I have been a friend of the other for years &mdash; that in the Ombudsman Act a tremendous opportunity to produce a name through political consensus was lost.  Michael Mills was particularly inspired as the first Ombudsman, but it should be up to the Houses to suggest a shortlist of names which would be looked at.  There should be some nominating process.</P>
      <P>Looking at the legislation relating to the creation of the Ombudsman office, the difficulty in establishing the nomination process has been a difficult issue which has been a grain of sand in the shoes of those who have written about it.  In most legislation the Executive makes the proposition and the Opposition react to it.  There is the nucleus of an idea here that is worth exploring. The absolute autonomy and independence of these offices could be established if there was an autonomous or apolitical process of selection and nomination.</P>
      <P>I realise there are difficulties in doing that, but there is a precedent and there is much discussion about it in literature.  It is important that these offices, which are among the highest in the State, are seen to be what they are &mdash; offices which are associated with the people and not with the parties. It is important that these offices, particularly those of the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner, are seen to be more closely aligned with the Houses of the Oireachtas than with the Executive.</P>
      <P>I realise that this is simply a symbolic thing, but sometimes symbolic gestures can be important.  I made the proposition that we should discuss this in the context of the existing people who form the commission drawing up the short list and submitting it to a committee of both Houses.  I have outlined the process as a point of discussion.  The selection and nomination process is a way of copperfastening and registering in high measure the independence of this office.</P>
      <P>There is another benefit.  People who are politically associated may well be appropriate for some of these offices; but because there is such a reluctance in political circles nowadays to admit that there might be anything meritorious in their own following, people are sometimes are excluded from office simply because of past career choices. I can think of ex-Taoisigh and ex-Ministers, for example, who would fulfil some of these roles with great zest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I can think of one or two who might not.  This is an opportunity of creating some sort of system that takes the nomination and selection process away from what looks like partisan politics but, in fact, is not.  I do not know any partisan operations of either Ombudsman.  I have no problems with either person because they were inspired choices in both cases.  It would help, however, to confirm the independence and autonomy of such offices if we could evolve some nomination/selection process.  It is an important point that is worth discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Roche has raised an important and substantive point.  The fact that we have had two outstanding appointments as Ombudsman should not divert attention from the significance of the selection process.  What nomination process does Senator Roche have in mind? Would it be up to the Civil Service Commissioners to draw up their own short list, or could people apply for the post?  Anything that enhances the profile, dignity and public standing of the post, which is now a dual one for all practical purposes, is in line with the thinking expressed here on the importance attached to the function. It is appropriate to raise the selection process as a matter of principle which is detached from an appointment that has already been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very pertinent point.  I see no reason why political leaders should not suggest people.  This country lacks a list of the great and the good and, as a result, every time somebody is appointed to a State-sponsored body somebody starts digging into their background to see what way they voted at some stage.</P>
      <P>I already mentioned John Kelly, and I remember an extraordinary contribution he made in the Lower House.  Just because people voted in a certain way in one election does not necessarily mean that they are unfit for any other form of public office.  If you were to do that you would, as he said, exclude from public life everybody who ever had any interest in the State.  You must assume that people have political leanings and so on.</P>
      <P>If you had commissioners, you would have an opportunity for the widest range of personages to offer their names, including individual citizens.  I see no problem with that; nor do I see a problem with members of the Government putting forward names of people who would be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the United States they have the extraordinary procedure whereby committees of the Houses of Congress actually vet names &mdash; in a quite obnoxious way, in my view &mdash; that have been put forward by the Executive.  Because of our system we have never given enough thought to this process of selection and nomination.  Let us face it, we have had this problem in the Judiciary.  There is a view abroad that the <Col N="1590" /> Judiciary is politically appointed, but that is not always necessarily true or fair.  The most important thing is that people are able to fulfil these functions without reflecting a political bias. I am trying to provoke a debate on the autonomous individual who is not seen as the puppet of any political master.  It would be a person in whom the citizenry can have absolute confidence and need have no query about.</P>
    <P>We need to stimulate public debate on this, but it is difficult because cynicism is rife.  The healthiest pastime in Ireland is to be cynical about everything.  Appointments such as the Ombudsman, and others we are attempting to create, should be protected against cynicism by a process of nomination and selection which, albeit in a human world, would be detached from possibility of their being seen as patronage.  I do not believe that appointments which have been made are bad or that there is anything wrong with them; but if they had gone through a process such as this one, their independence would have been even more evident.  It is probably not a working proposition but I have put it down to provoke a debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The impartiality of those who have occupied the office of Ombudsman is self-evident, and nothing in the history of either incumbent would suggest otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I have clearly made that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that and I am not saying the Senator did not.  I accept the desirability of having a system which is not political.  Unfortunately, the reality is that if the nomination is made by the Houses of the Oireachtas it will reflect the complexion of the Government of the day.  Perhaps the Government should make the nomination in the first place.  That would short-circuit much of the debate, although that in itself may be useful.</P>
      <P>I do not share Senator Roche's distaste for the American system, although there certainly are aspects of it which are raw.  A committee which does not reflect a Government majority and which has equality within it would be a reasonably good way of making some of these appointments. It would show that there is impartiality in the appointment.  The alternative to that would lead to a system of canvassing which would not be desirable.  Even though we have some models we regard as preferable to the existing one, it is difficult to devise a superior system which would give us people of superior merit.  A good job has been done by the people we have and had.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas had a bearing on the reappointment of one such pereson when he was in office.  There was a suggestion at the time that somebody might not be re-appointed, but the Oireachtas made its views firmly known on that occasion.  I do not know whether that was instrumental in ensuring that the person remained in office, but the Oireachtas had a view on it.</P>

      <P>I can see Senator Roche's point but it is a much broader issue than the specifics of this legislation.  I agree with Senator Dardis that there is no easy way to what Senator Roche is trying to achieve.  One could ask who appoints the members of the Civil Service Commission.  I presume they are appointed by somebody.  It comes down to who appoints anybody.  We have a system of democracy which gets us here in the first place.  In local government we often speak of people being self-appointed.  There is no easy way to what the Senator is trying to achieve but I sympathise with his aim.  I do not have a particular answer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very interesting debate.  We would like to see the total independence of these offices and that is why in appointing an Information Commissioner we followed the procedures of appointment for the Ombudsman, which require a positive vote of both Houses and appointment by the President. This will lend status to the appointment in a way which appointment through the Civil Service Commission cannot.  In a situation where a named individual, whether Ombudsman, information commissioner or somebody who carried out both tasks, was strongly opposed by the Opposition, their position would be untenable.  A <i>de facto</i> consensus exists by this method of appointment. It will not be possible for the Government to steamroll through an appointment, even in the present happy situation where the Opposition has a majority in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I have difficulty with the proposal put forward by Senator Roche regarding the present Ombudsman, who has displayed extraordinary flair, commitment and interest in relation to freedom of information.  He has been approached in relation to this post.  If we were to go back to the Civil Service Commission he would be out of the loop. That would be a pity as he is a person who in his office and his work commands wide respect as somebody who is a genuine guardian of the public interest.</P>

    <P>I made reference to the word &ldquo;selected&rdquo; because I accept it would be quite inappropriate if we appointed a commissioner for information or the Ombudsman through the Civil Service Commission.  What I was referring to was the short listing.  If you advertise for this position there will be an abundance of applications.

      <P>The reality is that the Senator agrees that it would be desirable to have a nomination process which would involve all sides in political life rather than it being seen as a spoil system appointment by those who happen to have the majority in Government at a particular time. While I accept what has been said about the current and previous Ombudsman, I could foresee a situation where a Government could make an imprudent appointment and thereby destroy the offices we value.  There is a need for debate regarding how we can ensure that something other than partisan considerations apply in the selection and the nomination process.</P>

      <P>The technicalities require us to take amendment No. 54.  We will not have an opportunity to discuss it when the relevant section is debated.  Perhaps Senator Lee has made a mistake as the amendment suggests that the remuneration of the information commissioner be determined &ldquo;in conformity with the purposes, principles and spirit of this Act&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I put that in quite deliberately, knowing that it was wholly irrelevant and inappropriate, as a vote of spiritual confidence in the direction we are trying to go.  I lifted the phrase from section 3, subsection (1), paragraphs (c) and (d), where there is a general rubric that in so far as we do anything under this Bill, we do it in the spirit of the Bill.  This is a financial proposal which is therefore out of order, but that should not prevent us from discussing it.  The intention behind the amendment was that we should be as supportive as possible of the office of commissioner.</P>
      <P>Did I detect the Minister in error in a reply to Senator Roche?  Did she say that the Opposition have a majority in this House?  It would be more correct to say the Government did not have a majority, but the Independent Members are very jealous of their independence.</P>

      <P>The Minister might think about this for Report Stage.  I have not an amendment down on it.  It is quite important as to how the legislation shall be evaluated in due course.  It is permissive as it stands, allowing the commissioner to investigate whatever he or she wants to investigate in terms of implementation.  However, would it strengthen the commissioner's hand if a review were made mandatory after a certain period, that the commissioner shall, after three or five years from the implementation of the legislation, review the working of the legislation and report accordingly to the Oireachtas?  That would strengthen the commissioner's position <i>vis-a-vis</i> all the authorities he or she would be dealing with.  If they know that this sort of report has to be made, the commissioner's authority would be reinforced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that the commissioner will make an annual report and could develop in it any issues in relation to the operation of the legislation.  Placing a time limit on the commissioner might inhibit reviews after two and a half years if they were appropriate.  The facility for an annual report, therefore, may be the best approach, but we will look at the point raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a substantively serious point.  The commissioner will almost certainly be overwhelmed with work.  Resources always lag behind what is necessary in these matters, and when one is overwhelmed with work one becomes immersed in the detail of the immediate.  Annual reports are part of the immediate in this context.  I do not intend to establish a fixed period and the provision could state &ldquo;within a period of&rdquo; a certain number of years.  I will defer to the Minister of State's judgment on Report Stage.  However, in terms of reviewing the implementation of legislation, the knowledge that there must be an overall review, in which one stands back from immediate detail, <Col N="1594" /> helps to focus people's minds on the overall function of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Under this section the provisions of the Bill do not apply to certain records.  Section 46 (1) (f) refers to &ldquo;an official document of either or both of such Houses that is required by the rules or standing orders of either or both of such Houses to be treated as confidential,&rdquo;.  That would permit the Buchanan report, which was given to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this afternoon, to be deemed confidential.  A subcommittee of the Dáil's Committee on Procedure and Privileges is currently considering the Buchanan report.  Under this provision it would be possible for that committee to arrive at a conclusion and say that the conclusion must not be published.  I doubt that the Minister of State or the committee would like that to happen, but it is possible under this provision.  What is the Minister of State's advice on this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <P>These provisions are governed by Article 15.10 of the Constitution, which provides that the Houses of the Oireachtas make their own rules.  The Executive cannot override the provisions of that Article.  Other aspects of the work of the Oireachtas to which this exemption might apply include legal advice given to a committee.  Such advice would be covered by professional privilege and by Article 15.10 of the Constitution.  It is up to the Houses of the Oireachtas to make decisions in this regard as the Executive cannot overrule the Houses.  That is the reason for this exemption.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche expressed concern on Second Stage as to whether section 1 (a) was sufficiently broad to facilitate access to records on the administration and management of various aspects of a court.  Our initial advice is that the section is probably adequate but if we receive further advice we might put down an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister anticipated my contribution on this section.  Last week I referred to the case of two of my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Doran of Greystones, who do not mind their names being mentioned in the House.  They are suffering in an extraordinary way because of the manner in which our courts and various bodies in this land operate.  Their case is due to come before the Supreme Court so I will not discuss it.</P>
      <P>However, information on records concerning matters other than the general administration of the courts should be made available.  I can envisage a situation in which a judge, because of indolence or careless disregard for the rights of individuals, would delay a court case to the point where people would simply be ground down.  It would be in the public interest to know if a judge behaved in that manner.  I can envisage a case where a court action could drag on for years or where a judge could become involved in so many other things that he could not reach a determination in a case and justice would be delayed beyond what is acceptable or could be expected. In such circumstances we should have a right to have information on how that judge performed his or her duties.  I am not referring to a specific case because I am prohibited by the rules of the House from speaking about specific cases.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister of State accepted that the Law Society and the Bar Council will be brought within the scope of this legislation.  With the limited resources available to a Member of this House I have been unable to draft the type of amendment I have in mind to deal with that. I also have not had conspicuous assistance from members of the Bar, because the cases I have in mind are too well documented.  I can envisage situations where incredible injustice is done either willingly or unknowingly by incompetence on the part of the Judiciary and we have one or two prime bozos in the Judiciary.  It would be in the public interest if information were available as to how this rather obscure part of the State operates. Judges and courts are most important and it is critically important that we have confidence in the operation of the courts.</P>

      <P>Most of them will never be back in this House.  However, grave injustices can be done through our courts because of the snail-like, glacial pace adopted in certain cases.  There might be valid reasons for that pace.  The judges might be so encumbered by other matters that they cannot organise business otherwise and they might also be reluctant to voice these problems.</P>
      <P>However, it would be good if we could create a situation which would enable people to access information relating to how judges have proceeded with existing cases in order to know that those judges have not done damage unconsciously or consciously to citizens of the State.  It is wrong that we should create an institution that is above question.  Tragically, over the years we have created a number of institutions which we have elevated to the point where their actions can never be questioned.  Most citizens do not have the resources or stamina to go through the courts system.  I accept that the interpretation of law has nothing to do with us but is solely a matter for the judges and I would be the last to suggest that the Houses of the Oireachtas should secondguess the courts.  However, there is an abundance of evidence available to anyone who does constituency work that, from time to time, people's interests are injured by judges and by the way the courts are administered and I would like to see a review of the administration of the courts.  I am not questioning the right of judges to interpret the law but if there is a delay someone must ask why.</P>
      <P>I apologise if my language was intemperate.  I am close to a number of cases.  During the debate on the Solicitors Bill in the other House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had a detailed discussion on section 2 about information relating to the criminal <Col N="1597" /> history of an individual.  The Minister has made the point about whether information on parking offences, for instance, should be made available.  I do not see why the criminal history of an individual should not be available &mdash; if they commit a crime it should be part of the penalty.</P>
      <P>The Minister confirmed that, under the Constitution, it is open to the Houses to decide that something will not be published.  This comes back to the point I made about the Buchanan Report, that it would be possible for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to say that it was not going to publish the report.  Freedom of information must begin with ourselves.  We cannot demand things of local authorities and public bodies which we are not prepared to demand of ourselves.  It makes me wonder why we have a difficult and complex compellability of witnesses Bill going through the other House which is criticised for not being strong enough.  We can compel witnesses to attend but, at the end of the day, it comes back to the point that was made about the Ombudsman, that because the Houses have the complexion of the Government of the day if the Government wants to suppress something it is in a position to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Buchanan report was published as quickly as it was received and the committee is to be commended on that.  We are bound by constitutional constraints in what we can write into law.  In keeping with the principles and spirit of this Bill I want to see everything on the table, including matters relating to the Houses.  However, it is not open to me to write that in here because I am constrained by Article 15.10 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The general administration of the courts will be fully subject to freedom of information.  The legal advice suggests that administration will include matters relating to management of the courts, proposed policy or organisational changes as well as matters of general administration and use of resources.  The provision we have is based on section 6 of the Australian Act.</P>
      <P>However, we must recognise the constitutional independence of the Judiciary under Article 35.2. If the reason for a delay is judicial that would not be open to scrutiny under this Bill and it would not be open to us to legislate in relation to judicial behaviour other than in those provisions in the Constitution which allow for the impeachment of the Judiciary on grounds of stated misbehaviour.  The Judiciary is not answerable to this House and we cannot ask it to be so.  We are stuck with the constitutional constraints and we must respect that.</P>

      <P>The administration of the courts is ultimately governed by the judges and we should not be talking about secondguessing judicial interpretation of the law.  However, between those two parameters there are occasions when untoward things happen in the courts which are never explained.  Undue delay in the handling of <Col N="1598" /> cases is one example, particularly when the cases are with one judge or group of judges.  I do not know the answer.  It is a frightening dilemma and we have no way of asking for information about why these things happen, how logjams can be broken and how justice can be done?</P>
      <P>We know the adage that justice delayed is justice denied and we could all find cases which have gone on for years for no good reason.  I said it previously that the wigs do not pay too much attention to the Legislature but perhaps on this occasion they will become aware of the discontent that is beginning to flow in relation to a number of cases, some of which have already received widespread public comment.  I will try to find a suitable wording for discussion of this matter on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 54, subsection (1), lines 21 and 22, to delete&rdquo; a fee of such amount as may be appropriate&rdquo; and substitute&rdquo; a reasonable fee, calculated in as consistent a manner as practicable for all public bodies, and notified, as far as practicable in advance, having regard to the financial and other relevant circumstances of the requester, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue.  I do not know whether the phraseology in my amendment is the most appropriate but it would be contrary to the spirit of everything we have said, and the Minister's intentions, if access to information was inhibited by cost.  I know that there are provisions for waiving charges but we are not giving sufficient guidance to the heads or the commissioner as to what would constitute the type of charge the Oireachtas has in mind.  How is the commissioner to decide if there is an appeal about charges?  If people are inhibited because of the charges it would be difficult to appeal.</P>
      <P>Section 47(1) states &ldquo;a fee of such amount as may be appropriate...&rdquo; but this is far too loose. I used a circuitous phraseology in the amendment but it incorporates the principle that we should instruct those responsible for implementing this legislation that it is our intent should be applied. There is scope to block it and, even without any intention to do, there is scope for delay and discouragement.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Lee.  We are back to the &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; aspect of the Bill &mdash; yes we want freedom of information but there are many reasons it cannot be given.  We now have an additional reason: it would be open to someone who did not want to release information to set <Col N="1599" /> the fee.  The Bill states that &ldquo;a fee of such amount as may be appropriate having regard to the provisions of this section shall be charged by the public body concerned...&rdquo;.  That is far too open.  A fee should reflect the actuality of assembling the information and that is contained in subsection (2).  Every effort should be made that no one is denied access to information by virtue of the fact that they cannot afford it.</P>

    <Title>Constitutional Review of the Seanad: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, with the permission of the Chair, to share my time with Senator Lydon.  Last week I said that I was sceptical about any major changes to the Seanad in view of the slow progress made on amendments to the Constitution in the 25 years I have been in the Oireachtas.  In that time, minimal changes have been made to the functions and operations of both the Dáil and Seanad.  We should target a few key areas which would make important improvements in the way the Seanad operates and we should also make some modest adjustments to mirror the changes taking place in Dáil procedures.</P>
      <P>The most important change in such procedures in the past 25 years has been the setting up of committees.  Members of this House are excluded from participating in many of those mainly because procedure here does not entitle Members to introduce money Bills or to have an important input into financial matters.  I would like to see a change in that restrictive provision which does not entitle us to introduce money Bills.  I managed to get around that a while ago when I introduced a Private Members' Bill. Although significant capital expenditure was involved in that measure, we managed to debate and discuss it here because it covered many other issues dealing with flooding.  The bones of that Bill were the basis of another Bill introduced at a later stage which helped to relieve the flooding and damage caused in the west Galway and Clare area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a significant amount of discussion last week on the procedures adopted in other jurisdictions and countries.  Some people spoke at length about the systems in place and the report <Col N="1601" /> mentioned some countries which did not have a system similar to ours.  We should discuss a system and a mechanism which would suit our political needs rather than what is in place in other areas.  We need a system which will work with the other House and will give more effective government than we have had heretofore.</P>
    <P>Most people would agree that there is a general lack of awareness among the public about the volume of work transacted by the Dáil and Seanad. Were it not for the television transmissions which have taken place since cameras were installed in the Chambers, that level of awareness would be less.  I am constantly asked what ministry I hold or what I am now doing in the Dáil although I have not been a Member of that Chamber for nearly four years.  There is a general lack of awareness, especially among young people, about the institutions of Parliament and how they operate. Most young people come here when they are very young on their day out from national or secondary school.  They get so bored with some of the discussion that they switch off and do not show any interest after that.  There is a necessity to make the public aware of the important work transacted here and the opportunity which exists to discuss issues in this Chamber which cannot be adequately discussed in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Some modest changes could be easily implemented without involving major dramatic constitutional changes which would bring the Seanad and committees closer together to discuss topical issues.  On 2 March 1995, almost two years ago, I spoke about Seanad reform but apart from this debate which brought Deputy Jim O'Keeffe to the House, very little substance was discussed.  At that time we were speaking of the reform which might take place as a result of the peace process &mdash; the peace forum was in session at Dublin Castle and discussions on Northern Ireland were anticipated &mdash; and there was a general air of optimism that we would see major reorganisation in cross-Border institutions in the short term which would necessitate fairly major constitutional changes here.  In anticipation of the establishment of a long-term peaceful solution to the problems of Northern Ireland, most people would agree there was an opportunity which would be availed of and that there would be some general acceptance of constitutional change to take into account of the new situation which was evolving in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have got into a bit of a dilemma since that time and we have gone backwards.  I look forward to the prospect of a realigned or reframed peace process.  There must be peace in Ireland in the long term which will encompass North and South and that must be recognised in our institutions. When we get back to the dialogue and discussion and away from the present uncertain situation, there will be an opportunity to bring forward the kind of constitutional reform which would be necessary to give speedy effect to the changes, North and South.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> I am not certain that the option to abolish Seanad Éireann is worthy of consideration.  I do not believe that even the public at large, limited as is their knowledge and experience of the Seanad, would favour its abolition.  When that proposition was put forward by a political party it received a very negative response.  That party can speak for itself, but in general the reaction in the community at large was negative.</P>
    <P>I believe the people would be happy to see a reformed Seanad Éireann dealing effectively with the issues of the day.  The House can play a far more important role than it has in the past, especially by reforming its procedures.  For instance, I was looking at a statutory instrument recently which was introduced to give effect to EU regulations on milk quotas and the management of the Irish milk quota.  Effect was given to EU Directives by way of a statutory instruments which were laid before the Houses but never debated.  This comprehensive legislation has had a great impact on some of the most vulnerable in the community, that is, the small farmers whose livelihood depend on milk.  In my constituency I have seen 1,000 such farmers go out of business over the past nine or ten years because of the EU regulations on milk quotas.  We could have had an opportunity to raise this matter within the period the statutory instrument was laid before the House but, by and large, these instruments go undebated and unnoticed.  It is vitally important that Seanad Éireann has an opportunity to discuss in detail some of the major statutory instruments which are given effect merely by laying an order before Houses and putting it on the Order Paper without the opportunity of a full discussion.</P>
    <P>This applies equally to some of the by-laws which are introduced under various Acts.  Only last week we saw a comprehensive by-law, which dealt with the regulation of salmon drift and draft netting being put in place by the Minister for the Marine.  This matter affected the traditional livelihood of many people living in estuarial and coastal communities and, through the introduction of one by-law made under the inactive consolidated Fisheries Acts, the livelihood of many of these people would be put at risk.</P>
    <P>These matters should be debated before they come into effect.  I would like to see Seanad Éireann discuss all statutory instruments and by-laws which are laid before the House.  The regulations should also be discussed here because it has been my experience that when they are completed they are greater in length than the basic legislation and they transform what was intended when the Bill was being enacted.  This applies to the operation of the subvention system under the Health Acts which is causing misery and hardship for many elderly people who must go through a detailed, complicated, cumbersome, bureaucratic system to get their subventions.  It takes weeks to have one such application processed.  I never anticipated that when the legislation was being enacted.  A reformed Seanad Éireann should be <Col N="1603" /> in a position to go through these regulations in what would be a very useful exercise when there are likely to be greater demands on Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The same applies to regulations from Brussels. The Committee of the Regions has been in existence for some time.  Ireland has representatives on that committee but they have never had the opportunity to put forward their views either here or in Dáil Éireann.  The regions will be more important under the new Cohesion Fund and Structural Fund arrangements as the structures will be reorganised here and it is vitally important that we invite people, such as the Commissioner for Regional Affairs, to address us.  The House invited Mr. Kinnock, the Transport Commissioner, to address us and we had a very good debate.  There is a need for more of that type of involvement with Ireland's Members of the European Parliament, the Commissioners, members of committees &mdash; such as the Committee of the Regions &mdash; and people who are dealing with the day to day activities which affect so many citizens in the Community.</P>
    <P>If we are to give recognition to the views of vocations, which was part of the remit of Seanad Éireann, the House should be reformed in a way which would give an opportunity to people, such as the leaders of the farming organisations, the teachers or the nursing profession, to come here and make their submissions.  I had experience in the European Parliament of regular joint meetings between the Commissioners, MEPs, the farming organisations and Ministers.  Such arrangements, which were very effective, are not in place here.</P>
    <P>We spoke two years ago about this matter and we have not moved very far since.  I am not certain that in the present climate, especially with the uncertainty about what is likely to happen in Northern Ireland, we will see any major dramatic changes in either Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann or the Constitution for a while.  In the light of the developments in Northern Ireland, in the inevitable re-establishment of the peace process and the longer term bringing together of institutions, North and South, in a new framework for Ireland, we will have a unique opportunity to make major changes.  They will not be made in a piecemeal, haphazard way; they will only be done in the context of an overall revision of the Constitution and the putting in place of a permanent structure which will give effect to some of the views of the people, North and South.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are we having this debate? Some have said it is timely, but is that the reason? Have there been street protests or have letters been written to the editors of newspapers?  We are having this debate because we are responding to the report of the Constitutional Review Group, which states: &ldquo;It must be acknowledged, however, that the Seanad in its current form has come in for criticism from different quarters, often accompanied by demands for its abolition&rdquo;.  I do <Col N="1604" /> not know from where this view has come. Nobody has written to me in this regard.  They go on to say that they will not recommend anything, but they recommend a separate comprehensive independent examination.  These people have a bloody cheek, and I will tell you why.</P>
      <P>I have nothing against looking at the Seanad; it is a useful exercise and is good for democracy. However, I have great difficulty responding to a request from this group because some of the other recommendations it made are out of this world as far as I am concerned.  It wants to remove the Preamble to the Constitution, something the Progressive Democrats tried some time ago, but they got their answer.  It also says that every member of the Council of State should no longer take an oath in the presence of Almighty God and that they should simply make a declaration. This is the group which wants us to review the Seanad.  It also wants to do away with blasphemy and sedition in this pluralist State and wants public order based on morality.</P>
      <P>It also recommends same sex marriages, which I believe is an attack on marriage.  The daddy of all the recommendations is that we should bring in legislation to put a time limit on abortion.  In other words, you can have an abortion, but not after this time limit.  This outfit, which is all I can call it, that wants us to review the workings of Seanad Éireann, has attempted in one fell swoop what the British could not do in 800 years, that is, destroy our language &mdash; that is another thing they attacked &mdash; our religion and our sense of morality.</P>
      <P>The Seanad has an important role.  I would like to quote from <i>The Theory and Practice of the Irish Senate</i> by John McGowan Smyth.</P>
      <P>There was a Report on Bicameral Parliaments prepared by the Association of Secretaries General of Parliaments and published in <i>Constitutional and Parliamentary Information</i> in the October, 1966 issue (Rapporteur M. Humblet, Secretary General of the Senate, Belgium):...</P>
      <P>... The protagonists of bicameral systems submit that it is possible to have two kinds of election without considering that one of them is less democratic than the other, and that while direct universal suffrage may embody the national will at a relatively superficial level, indirect universal suffrage reflects movements of opinion that are more profound and of a longer duration.</P>
      <P>On this reasoning a second chamber would be less of a brake and more of a balancing force.  The protagonists of this system involve an argument which seems to them decisive: the work of legislation has more chance of being done well if it is carried through in two processes, each complete in itself.</P>
      <P>A third argument is advanced in favour of the bicameral system.  A single House may be tempted to exploit its omnipotence, above all if it is confronting a weak Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> The Seanad has a role in legislation.  I think this role is devolving.  The chairman of the all-party committee in his address to the Seanad quoted Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, above all people, who said: &ldquo;I was impressed by the utility of Seanad debates in relation to complex questions.  Such debates in the Dáil are almost always narrowly adversarial and often too pettily confrontational. I found however that in the Senate there was a higher proportion of serious discussion of issues and on the whole a less polemical approach&rdquo;.  I would go along with that.  Many useful contributions are made in the Seanad.  We spent over two or three months on the Environmental Protection Act, which required a lot of work.  We also spent a long time on legislation reforming taxation. Recently we spent time on the Family Law (Divorce) Bill and the National Cultural Institutions Bill.  I am not saying the Dáil does not have time to do this, but we seem to be able to deal with legislation without attacking Ministers too much.  Perhaps we are closer in proximity to Ministers who are less inclined to slap us down. We seem to get amendments passed here and have time to think about them.  The Seanad makes a useful contribution in this regard, but it could do more.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Senators made a contribution to the all-party committee chaired by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  One or two lines of that deserve to read into the record.  It reads as follows: &ldquo;We believe Seanad Éireann is entitled to parity of esteem with the President and with Dáil Éireann as a constituent component of the Oireachtas. The fact that in the public perception this is not the case is attributable in our opinion to a number of factors, not least of which is the lack of attention which the Seanad receives from both the electronic and print media&rdquo;.  It is true to say that we do not get much publicity.  I do not believe this debate will be published in the newspapers tomorrow or on radio or television tonight; but if I were to attack the chairman, perhaps it might be.  However, I have no wish to attack the chairman, who is welcome here.</P>
    <P>This House has a new Standing Order which has allowed us to invite people such as yourself, Professor James Dooge and Commissioner Neil Kinnock.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it was too late for me to invite Mother Teresa; so at least you have done better than she has, chairman.  People were afraid of Mother Teresa at the time.  As I have often said, this is a useful forum to which to invite such people to talk about particular subjects.  Leaders from Northern Ireland could be invited to the House.  I think of people like Hume, Adams, Paisley and Taylor, who have different points of view which contribute to the national debate and the problems in the Six Counties.  They would be more than welcome if they came to address us.  It is different to see a man in the flesh and hear his point of view, although one might not agree with them.  This would be a useful exercise for us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> The lack of media attention is not due to the lack of dedication on the part of Members.  It is because we are less adversarial and consequently the House is not as exciting as the Dáil, although we could make it more exciting.  I have had a few headlines but always when I said something controversial rather than practical.</P>
    <P>The election process is fine.  If we change that process and take it away from local councillors, we would be contributing further to the diminution of their powers.  The local committees of agriculture and health committees have disappeared and the vocational education committees are under threat.  Shortly after the formation of this Government there was an attempt to remove a couple of councillors from boards.  We talk in European terms of subsidarity and devolution. Local authorities usually make wise decisions. Any further reduction in their role will render them totally inadequate and powerless; and people will not go forward for election to what is a fairly thankless position, as most Members who are members of a local authority will know.  Local authority members certainly do not do the job for money and must devote a lot of time and effort to it.</P>
    <P>The election of university Senators is elitist, but I would not like it to disappear.  It is no more elitist electing a university Senator than county councillors electing one like myself.  All the university Senators during the three terms I have been honoured to be here have made significant contributions, including the present Acting Chairman, Senator Henry.  I do not always agree with what they say, but that is the whole point of this House.  You do not have to agree with people, but you do give them a forum in which to contribute. I do not see how anybody could be a fulltime Senator.  That is a drawback, the salaries are pitiful, as they are in the Dáil, but I do not think that will change.  I do not think there is going to be any radical change, for the simple reason that no Dáil is going to give us more power than them.</P>
    <P>We could do things that could be overseen, perhaps.  It was recommended in this document produced by Mr. John Coakely and Mr. Michael Laver, of UCD and TCD respectively, that we could deal with tribunals of inquiry and so forth. The TDs are already massively overworked, they say, and there are clear possibilities for them to give jobs to the Seanad or to Seanad committees. That is a good idea.  We could perhaps look at setting up a Seanad committee on public appointments or tribunals of inquiry and so on.  This may or may not happen.</P>
    <P>One thing is very true.  At the end of this big submission made by these people is the statement that: &ldquo;The present system in Ireland does not involve any conflict because the current Seanad has no teeth in what is a system of checks and balances in name only.  Giving the Seanad teeth raises the possibility that we will sometimes bite&rdquo;. I think, therefore, that there will be no radical change and I do not think there should be.

      <Col N="1607" /> There is no great call for change.  It has not come from the public, nobody is shouting and roaring for any significant change.  I think there could be some minor changes made which would perhaps enhance our role as Senators, but I do not think there is any need for a radical overhaul of something that is working quite well at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the chairman of the all-party committee to review the Constitution. I am sorry he was not present to hear the opening remarks from Senator Lydon because they were not as tame as his concluding ones.</P>
      <P>I am going to approach this issue in a different way.  The question has been asked; what should the Seanad do?  Much has been written about the appropriate functions of a second chamber in a modern unitary state.  My preference is for the description of the four functions of revision of legislation, initiation of legislation, interposition of delay and debates on important issues written down by Lord Bryce in connection with the 1918 conference on the reform of the House of Lords.</P>
      <P>Lord Bryce describes the revisionary functions as follows: &ldquo;the examination and revision of bills brought from the House of Commons, a function which has become more needed, since on many occasions during the last 30 years the House of Commons has been obliged to act under special rules limiting debate&rdquo;&mdash; I suppose what we might call the guillotine system.  He felt that the House of Lords could fill in for that.</P>
      <P>On the function of the initiation of Bills, Lord Bryce said Bills dealing with subjects of a comparatively non-controversial character might have an easier passage through the House of Commons if they had been fully discussed and put into shape before being submitted to the House of Commons.  I think we do that here with Bills that come before us for the first time and Bills that have been initiated in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Lord Bryce also stated that the function of delay in passing a Bill may enable the opinion of the nation to be adequately expressed upon it. This would be especially needed as regards Bills which affect the fundamentals of the constitution or introduce new principles of legislation.</P>
      <P>On the final function of general discussion, Lord Bryce stated that the second chamber could provide full and free discussion of large and important questions, such as those of foreign policy, at moments when the House of Commons was so occupied that they could not find sufficient time for them.  These are the four functions which Lord Bryce laid down as the principles for the functioning of a second chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that these statements, made almost 80 years ago, represent a suitable basis for discussion of the role of Seanad Éireann.  It seems appropriate to me to measure the performance of Seanad Éireann against these four functions described by Lord Bryce.  The first function of a second chamber the examination and revision of <Col N="1608" /> Bills passed by the properly elected chamber.  A number of Bills have been amended as they passed through this House.  Sometimes Ministers are unwilling to amend Bills in the Seanad, particularly late in the legislative season, because this would require returning again to the Dáil for confirmation of the amendment.  Senators often argue here for an amendment to a Bill and sometimes, I am sure, they find it frustrating that the Minister of the day will not accept the amendment. But Senators should be mindful that on many occasions the amendment which a Minister has resisted during the passing of a particular Bill would become part of the legislative provision of the next Bill on this particular topic.  The fact that the full debates of the Seanad are read by senior civil servants concerned with the formation of policy is a point that should not be neglected in this connection.  This is something which I have discovered myself in contributions I have made to the House on particular Bills.  I found it recurring at a later stage in Ministers' statements on some other Bill.</P>
    <P>The second function listed by Lord Bryce as appropriate for a second chamber was the initiation of Bills dealing with subjects of a comparatively non-controversial character.  Through the years the Seanad has been used from time to time for the initiation of such Bills and I would like to see an increase in this activity.  I think we have a capacity to shape Bills here before they go to the Dáil.  I think we should be given that chance to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>The third function mentioned by Lord Bryce was the power in delaying the passing of a Bill. In practice the limited power of the Seanad to delay Bills has not been used.  It has been brought to my attention that the Government Bill to abolish proportional representation in 1959 was delayed by the Seanad due to the illness of two Government Senators.  This caused a considerable delay during which public opinion became more strongly engaged in regard to the question; and when the referendum was finally put to the people some months later, the proposal was defeated by the electorate.  That was the very point that Lord Bryce was making as well; that on these issues time should be given so that the general public can express their view before the matter is finally put through he House.</P>
    <P>The fourth function of the second Chamber listed by Lord Bryce is the full and free discussion of large important questions, such as those of foreign policy.  Seanad Éireann has a good record in this area; and if time cannot be found in the normal times of the House, then these issues can be raised during Private Member' motions on Wednesdays between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.  I have spoken myself on South Africa and East Timor and I think we have a good record in this House of speaking on human rights issues.  We find time to debate these issue here.  Tomorrow we have the debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If it is decided that there is a need for a second Chamber to provide for constitutional balance or <Col N="1609" /> legislative efficiency, there remains the vexed question of what its composition will be.  How can you elect a second Chamber?  It would appear that in the first Seanad in 1923, 30 Members were nominated by the President of the Executive Council and the remaining 30 members were elected by the Dáil.  There were certain variations in the election of the Seanad between 1923 and 1936.  It is interesting to note that Mr. Donal O'Sullivan, who was the Clerk of the first Seanad, summarised the key role of the House in the formation of the new State in the following words:</P>
    <P>In the early years, the Seanad proved to be of great value to the State.  It is true that its powers were limited and the attitude to it by both the Government and the Dáil left much to be desired.  But, in personnel, it was probably the equal to any second chamber that existed and it exercised considerable and wholly beneficial influence on legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly made reference to the North-South issue.  I read a comment made by the same Donal O'Sullivan that a large number of Members were appointed or elected from Northern Ireland to the first Seanad.  They worked very well with their Nationalist colleagues and there was never a word spoken in anger here.  I would like the Seanad to play that type of role in trying to unite the people of this island.</P>
    <P>The second Seanad, established under the Constitution of 1937, is notable for the element of vocationalism in the nomination procedure and the extension of the electorate from the Dáil and Seanad to an electorate nominated by members of the city and county councils.  The Constitution provides for 60 Members of the Seanad, 49 of whom are elected by proportional representation while the remaining 11 are nominated by the Taoiseach.  Six of the 49 are elected by university graduates.  I accept and welcome university representation in the House but I would like the franchise to be extended to the Dublin City University and the University of Limerick.  The remaining 43 Members are elected from the five vocational panels &mdash; Cultural and Education, Agriculture, Labour, Industry and Commerce and Administration.  The electoral panels are not specified in the Constitution, they are determined by statute law.  The statute law in respect of Seanad elections has been amended on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>Some Members referred to the vocational aspect of the Seanad.  One of the main criticisms of the Seanad is that it was designed, under the Constitution, to represent vocational interests. However, it has notably failed to do so.  A number of people argued that the intention of the Constitution for a vocational Seanad is thwarted by the statutory provisions relating to the method of election.  I believe this argument deserves serious consideration.  Should the Seanad be reformed by adopting recommendations of the majority report of the Seanad Electorate Commission in 1959 and providing by statute for direct <Col N="1610" /> elections to the Seanad by representatives of vocational organisations?</P>
    <P>I believe consideration should be given to having the members elected to the nominating subpanels directly elected by the vocational groups that nominate them and to electing members on the Oireachtas sub-panel by the existing Seanad electorate.  Such a system would give balance to the membership of the Seanad and invoke the principle of vocationalism that was intended when the Seanad was established.</P>
    <P>The key to the proper functioning of a second Chamber is that it can only efficiently supplement the work of the first Chamber if it views legislation and debates topics in a different fashion.  It has been stated that the Dáil and Seanad operate on different wavelengths and that it is necessary for Members to tune themselves to the appropriate wavelength of the House in which they serve if they are to have any chance to gain the ear of the House.  I discovered this to be true when, having served for a period in the Dáil, I became a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is a political Chamber but that political dimension does not exist in the Seanad.  A former Member who served in both Houses once graphically described the difference between the Dáil and Seanad when he stated that the nature of the two Houses was reflected in the very design of the seats occupied by Members.  He said that the seats in the Seanad are comfortable armchairs designed for sitting in and listening to the points of view of other people while, in contrast, the tipup seats in the Dáil seem to be especially designed for jumping up and interrupting.  This is a fair description of the difference between the two Houses.</P>
    <P>I support Members who requested the introduction of a Question Time procedure in the Seanad.  As the Cathaoirleach is aware, the present Order of Business is used to pose questions. This is very unsatisfactory.  If we do not have the same procedure as the Lower House, at least there should be a means to put down written questions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I will quote the opening paragraph of a comparative study of parliaments published in 1966 for the Inter-Parliamentary Union which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>How many Chambers should parliament comprise?  This question has proved to be one of the most controversial in constitutional law and the answers given to it reflect the diversity of parliamentary institutions.  This is no mere matter for academic political scientists.  The solution adopted in each country is the result of a political choice which goes to the heart of the regime.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate, at this stage in the history of our State, that we should re-examine the political choices we have made and, for that reason, I welcome the present constitutional review.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy O'Keeffe.  My contribution is a personal one and does not reflect the views of my party; it is a poor thing but it is my own.  I consider it a great honour to be a Member of the Seanad, few of my peers would have believed I would become a Senator. The Seanad has done great work and made important amendments to many Bills.</P>
      <P>There is a definite need for a second House. Most democracies in western Europe have a second Chamber.  Sweden is one of the few outstanding democracies which does not have a second House.  One cannot state that the Swedish system of administration is any better or worse for the absence of a second House.  However, a second Chamber provides an additional element of democracy for Bills, delays them and allows members of the public the opportunity to become acquainted with them and put across their point of view.</P>
      <P>The Seanad suffers greatly from a lack of appreciation and knowledge on the part of the general public.  Due to the fact that the formation of the Seanad is somewhat difficult, the public and certain journalists do not have a comprehensive knowledge of the method of election to this House.  This provides a false view of the worst side of the House.  Perhaps there is a need to consider the PR angle, blow our own trumpet and ensure that there is a greater knowledge in schools, universities, etc., of the work of the Seanad.  When one debates the abolition of the House with those who advocate it, one discovers that the basis of their argument is a profound ignorance of the workings of this House.</P>
      <P>I would like a number of changes to be introduced. I believe the Seanad should be decoupled from the Dáil and its life should not be the same as that of the Lower House.  In other words, as in other countries, the Seanad should have a fixed term of office which should not run concurrently with that of the Dáil.  There have been calls for the Dáil to also have a fixed term of office.  If that were to come about, I would continue to argue that the Seanad should run on a different track to the Lower House.  If the Dáil term was to last four years, the Seanad's should last five to six years.  This would be one way to move away from the notion that the Seanad is either a nursery for budding politicians or a retirement home for faded or jaded politicians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The independence of the Seanad is compromised by virtue of the fact that the two Houses are so closely aligned.  For example, Seanad elections must be held within 90 days following the dissolution of the Dáil.  That is the first matter which should be changed.</P>
      <P>I value the work of university Senators and their contributions to many debates in the House but there is something undemocratic about the present system of their election.  There are many graduates of DCU and UL who are bitterly resentful that, although their qualifications are recognised throughout Europe and in the United States, they are not regarded by the Oireachtas as being as good as, or having the same say as, the graduates of the NUI or Trinity College.  Trinity College's allocation of three representatives is totally out of proportion to the numbers of graduates from that college.  This mechanism was used by Éamon de Valera to ensure there would be a small Protestant voice in the Seanad because, at the time, few Catholics were allowed attend Trinity College by the Catholic Church.  It was an artificial mechanism, is now an anachronism and it should be changed.</P>
      <P>We need to look at the method of election to the Seanad.  Anyone who has gone on the Seanad campaign trail will verify it is extremely expensive and cumbersome.  One has to canvass the length and breadth of Ireland.  It is interesting that the Seanad election does not seem to be covered by the Electoral Bill.  Where caps are proposed on spending for the Dáil elections, none has been put on spending for the Seanad election.  This needs to be looked at.  There are tales of the generosity of competitors on different panels when they are campaigning.  The salary would not allow anyone like me to try to compete with some of these people.  I am glad to say that our county councillors are wise enough not to be bribed by the magnificence of the gifts which are often lavished on them in the course of the Seanad campaign and vote for good quality candidates despite that.</P>
      <P>We should look at the system of election and perhaps the establishment of direct elections on a regional basis on a list system.  We should encourage people from outside the political arena &mdash;for example, from trade unions, the clergy, the unemployed and vested interest groups &mdash; to enter the fray as Independents.  This will ensure this House will have the spread of interests which has made it such a different Chamber to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the many Senators who have said they do not see a need for emigrants to have a voice in this House.  Emigrants have something to say about why they are not at home and that voice needs to be articulated.  However, I do not think that would happen if they elected a native to a Dáil seat.  If seats in this House were allocated to them their point of view would be aired. Ireland looks different when one is a hundred or thousand miles away.  Emigrants can see things that are wrong with this country that those of us who are living in it probably do not realise.  They <Col N="1613" /> have a voice and an opinion.  Because people have emigrated does not mean that we as a nation should stop caring for them.</P>
    <P>This is a good House.  Legislation benefits from coming to it and we benefit from being Senators. Some of the better Ministers have benefited from a stint in this House and, they, in turn, have reciprocated by initiating many Bills in this House, particularly such Bills as the Cultural Institutions Bill, which deserve more time for discussion.  I see a great future for the Seanad and hope this view will pertain when the report is produced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Henry.  I welcome the Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, chairman of the all-party Oireachtas committee to review the Constitution, to the House.  The constitutional review group chaired by T.K. Whitaker is worthy of appreciation and attention.  I am delighted the all-party committee has done such work on it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Kelly that we are privileged and honoured to be in this House.  If there is any lack of appreciation, the answer is in our hands.  We have to find some way to earn respect. Senator Lydon asked why we needed this debate and said there was no need for it.  It is healthy and wise to have this debate on a regular basis and continually question whether we have the best legislative system.</P>
      <P>I was in the United States two weeks ago at the inauguration of President Clinton.  It was interesting to hear the discussions about the checks and balances that exist in the United States system, which has lasted since the 1780s. They have had constitutional amendments but there are checks and balances, which is something we should look at to ensure we are keeping in line with what I call, in management terms, best practices.</P>
      <P>In the case of best practice in management, one can usually see what others are doing.  We can do that here and formulate, as we did in 1937, what was regarded as a Constitution and two Houses which were most suitable for our particular needs. Those needs have served us well, and will continue to do so but only if we continue to question them.  I am attracted to the strategic management initiative, which was initiated by the present Government, because it is questioning the way we run our country and is percolating through the organisation of Government, the State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to ask whether the changes we can make are in our own hands.  Many of the changes we can make to make the Seanad useful and capable of earning respect and appreciation are in our hands, and that is why we should question what we do.  If we are talking about radical reform of the Seanad, involving changes to the Constitution, the question we have to face is, how do we create a new Seanad that will appear to the public to be attractive, useful and good value for money?  This is not easy to do and it is made harder by the fact that, at the moment, there is a <Col N="1614" /> widespread lack of credibility in this House as an institution.</P>
    <P>Many consider the Seanad to be fundamentally undemocratic; many see it as a useless rubber stamp and some would like to see it abolished.  Very few would shed any tears if it vanished from national life overnight.  I mention this not to agree with any of it but to remind us what we are up against.  These are the realities of perception with which we have to deal.  We on the inside can see the contribution the Seanad makes week in and week out.  We see even more clearly the extent of the contribution it could make.  That is why I talk about questioning what we do.  However, the reality is that the world outside Leinster House is not so convinced. That reality, I suggest, must be our starting point. If we start from there I think we can best make progress by asking what the Seanad is for, or what could a reformed Seanad be for?</P>
    <P>No discussion like this can fail to range over history.  We all know that this House was conceived essentially as a vocational Chamber, and that over the years it has changed almost into a completely party political one.  This is another fact we have to face up to because the rationale behind the original Seanad conceived in 1937 can no longer be used to justify the institution we have today.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have not developed an adequate rationale for today's institution.  This may be one of the reasons it lacks enthusiastic public support.  I do not for a moment suggest that we should try to turn the clock back to 1937. It seems a little naive to seek to exclude politics and politicians from what is essentially the nation's most important business.  Most of our debates would be infinitely poorer if they did not have contributions from those Senators who are professional party politicians.  Equally, however, today's Seanad does not exploit enough of what could be its greatest strength, and what could be the basis of making it far more popular.</P>
    <P>The Seanad potentially offers an opportunity for a much wider range of voices to be heard on new legislation and on important current issues. By the nature of things, people who become professional party politicians are drawn from a fairly narrow range of occupations and backgrounds. Certain professions tend to be over-represented, such as lawyers and teachers, for instance.  I had better look around carefully to see how many there are here today.</P>
    <P>Their contribution is, of course, very valuable but no one could argue that the ranks of party politicians form a microcosm of Irish life as it is today.  Last week, Senator O'Kennedy pointed out how few of us have competence in new areas of technology, and he is quite right.  I made the same point when we discussed the White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation here a few months ago.  This applies to the membership of both Houses, incidentally.</P>
    <P>Full-time politics is too demanding to interest many people and others simply cannot get <Col N="1615" /> involved because of career commitments.  This is one of the big changes that has taken place since 1937 and, as a result, participation in politics is tending to narrow all the time.  In designing a second House, we have the opportunity to broaden participation in politics at a national level.</P>
    <P>We have the opportunity to create a Chamber in which a much more diverse range of voices could be heard.  That is the part of the original vision for the Seanad that would be worth revisiting if we are to have any revision of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>To pursue this further, let me say a little bit about my ideas on representation as it applies to the Seanad.  I do not think we should seek to have every facet of national life represented in the Seanad, but we should seek to have those facets reflected in its membership.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly spoke about emigrants and the need for emigrant votes.  This is a good example of where we need emigrants' voices reflected in the House; they are actually reflected already in the six university Senators.  I tried to check with Senator Henry as to what proportion of the Trinity College electorate are emigrants and, while we do not know for certain, it is something like 35 per cent.  I do not know the corresponding figure for the National University.  Those votes, voices and aspects of life are reflected in the University Panel representatives.</P>
    <P>We should try to create a situation where most of the people elected to the Seanad are there because of their special background and experience, but they should not come here as representatives of pressure groups or narrow interests.  To create a Chamber like that would be a step backwards.</P>
    <P>I am in business, a fairly large employer, and, if I may say so, I am a specialist in the area of retailing.  That background affects what I say because I speak from experience, but I do not represent business, large employers or retailers. They all have their own lobby and pressure groups outside the House.</P>
    <P>We could create a much better Seanad by seeking to enrich our mix.  My ideal would be a House divided half and half between party politicians and others.  The politicians would ensure that we stayed in the world of practical reality, and provide that necessary connection with the business of running a Government and a country; the non-politicians would provide the broader range of voices, background and experience that no purely party political House could ever do.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the nuts and bolts of how such a Seanad would be elected.  Obviously, it would have to have a large measure of democratic legitimacy if it were to gain any sort of public support.  I want to focus on a Seanad designed to reflect the voices of the full range of our community which could be extremely attractive to that wide range of the general public who at present are disenchanted with the entire political <Col N="1616" /> process, and not just with the Seanad.  There is a disenchantment out there.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from a school the other day where a teacher had given primary school children the challenge of writing out what they thought of politicians and where they saw themselves going in the future.  The view these ten year olds had of politicians in general was very poor indeed.  The sort of body I am talking about would be a catalyst to lead people back to our political institutions.  It could stop the rot that is so alarming and, ultimately, so threatening to our very democracy.</P>
    <P>If we had a Seanad that commanded popular appeal, what powers should it have?  Here I might surprise you because I would not be in favour of giving a reformed Seanad any greater powers than it has at the moment.  This comes back to what we think the Seanad is for.  I see a second House as fundamentally a consultative body rather than a decision making one.  The more power it seeks, the more it becomes a duplicate of the Dáil, and that is the road to abolition.  Senator Doyle touched on that point earlier.</P>
    <P>However, if consultation is to have credibility it has to be genuine.  At the moment, in very many cases, it is not genuine at all.  The Seanad process is very often something to be rushed through as a necessary evil at the end of the day, although this is not always the case.  The Leader has certainly done a marvellous job in recent years to avoid what I experienced on some occasions in the past.  By the time most Bills reach us they are cast, not exactly in stone, but in exceptionally fast-setting cement.</P>
    <P>We could transform that very simply by building on the suggestion aired by Senator Ross.  If the Seanad is a consultative body, then you can make that consultation genuine by putting it up front.  In a reformed Seanad that would catch the popular imagination by virtue of its composition and day-to-day credibility could be sustained by introducing most Bills in this House rather than in the Dáil.  The legislative process would then be seen as two-fold with an internal logic that our present system lacks.</P>
    <P>First you would have a non-confrontational debate about a new Bill, followed by an examination of the details in which the full range of voices would be heard and could provide their own input.  This first stage could be regarded as a kind of national sounding-board.  That having been completed, the Bill could be taken into the purely political arena of the Dáil for what would then become the final stage of its process.  I venture to suggest that if this was the norm, we would get better legislation at the end of the day.  An arrangement like that would make possible a far more relaxed approach to legislation in contrast to the present system in which every Bill is treated in a confrontational manner from day one.</P>
    <P>None of what I am suggesting would involve any real transfer of political power.  I am too much of a realist to believe that any transfer of <Col N="1617" /> that kind is likely, but neither do I think it is necessary.  If we are to have a revision of the Constitution, we should set our sights high.  Nobody is going to get very excited about reforming the Seanad.  The way things are at the moment, there would be far more energy about the notion of abolishing it.  What is potentially exciting, however, is using the Seanad &mdash; reformed both in its membership and its place in the legislative process &mdash; to help transform the people's view of the entire political process.  A restructured Seanad could be the means by which people's faith in the political process is rekindled.  That is an opportunity I hope we will grasp in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the methods of election, the diversity of Members in the Seanad is amazing. Whether it is through election from the panels, the universities or by appointment, there is a tremendously diverse range of people in the House.  This is very useful.  One of the most important things I noticed when I looked at the <i>curriculum vitae</i> of the newly elected Senator Naughten was his expertise in food technology.  I was anxious to have somebody in the House to support me in my weekly call for the environmental health officers' dispute to be settled to ensure that we do not get food poisoning.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the House is not being included in the electoral legislation.  Senator Norris spoke of the huge limitation on the number of people who can stand as Independents, or even within the parties, because of finance.  It is extraordinarily expensive to get elected to Seanad Éireann, even in the university seats, where it is necessary to canvass about 30,000 constituents in my case and about 100,000 in the case of Senator Quinn. The expense excludes an enormous number of people from going forward for election.</P>
      <P>The electorate of the panels is narrow and I see merit in allowing those institutions which nominate candidates forming part of the electorate. We could move to a position where a certain number of Members were elected by the political parties and another group have their election from within the vocational bodies.</P>
      <P>One of the best things about this House &mdash; and I compliment the Leader of the House, Senator Wright, and the other party leaders &mdash; is the way party political differences are minimised where possible.  There are no polemics &mdash; Ministers are welcomed to the House and there is a positive rapport between Members on both sides.  This is important and should not be changed.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a Question Time introduced. The replies to Adjournment debates are utterly hopeless at times and I have on occasion been confused as to whether the matter I raised was understood.  A Question Time would be a great advantage and could perhaps be brought in quite simply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important issue, and one which this Government has been very generous about, is the <Col N="1618" /> introduction of Private Members' Bills.  Sometimes there are quite controversial issues on a party political basis which can be brought in by Private Members.  In the early 1970s President Robinson, then a Senator, with Senator West and Senator Horgan introduced the first contraception legislation.  Further legislation had to be introduced before this issue was considered by the Seanad.  Senator Neville introduced legislation on suicide, Senator Roche introduced freedom of information legislation which led to the information legislation currently before the House, and Senator Norris introduced legislation on the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  I was personally very glad that the Government accepted my child sex tours legislation.  Legislation like this can be introduced here in a very non-controversial manner and the general feeling of the public can be ascertained.  This is a very important aspect of the Seanad which would be far more difficult to replicate in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The fact that more legislation has been initiated in the Seanad in this session is very positive. It is a pity that when there is a significant amount of legislation ready to come into both Houses, the Seanad cannot make a start on some of it.  Some of the Bills debated here have had a very easy passage when they are debated in the Dáil due to the fact that they were discussed so thoroughly here.  The fact that we cannot discuss money matters is unfortunate, but perhaps we could look at how financial regulations are being implemented.</P>
    <P>Nobody has said that the university seats should be abolished because those elected do very little.  There has been no question about that, because the university Senators have been very active.  It is unfortunate that the Trinity College seats are seen as the seats of a Protestant domain. I was sorry that Senator Gallagher raised this matter as I had always looked upon her as the constituent who was pivotal in my election.  I can assure her and Senator Kelly that I do not see myself as a small Protestant or as representing a small Protestant electorate.  Since the Dublin Institute of Technology has had its degrees awarded by Dublin University, the electorate of the Trinity Senators must be up to 95 per cent Catholic.  There is no question that any of those contesting the Trinity seats could go forward on the grounds that they represented the 3 or 4 per cent of Protestants in Ireland.  I have never appealed for anything, either inside or outside the House, on a sectarian basis.  I would remind Senator Kelly that it was not the college that refused to allow Catholics to come to Trinity: it was others who told them they should not go. Since the foundation of the State there has been no ban on anybody attending.</P>
    <P>The university seats should be expanded to the other universities and to all third level institutions. While this could be seen as elitist, election to the Seanad is elitist because of the financial implications I have already mentioned.  If it is elitist we will have to think of other ways of <Col N="1619" /> facilitating those who are not in a position to get elected.  If we did have the other third level institutions as part of the electorate we would have a broader vocational base.  That is important as I would like to see the air of consultation expanded.</P>
    <P>Senator Paschal Mooney said the Seanad is seen as a House of &ldquo;has beens&rdquo; and &ldquo;wannabes&rdquo;. I am certainly not a &ldquo;has been&rdquo; but I would like to be a &ldquo;wannabe&rdquo; and be here after the next election.  I will put all religions in my constituency on notice of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither Senator Kiely nor myself is a &ldquo;wannabe&rdquo;.  We are dedicated Members of the House.  One of the problems in the Seanad is that there have been many &ldquo;wannabes&rdquo; in the House.  It has been used as an umbrella by people who are trying or have tried and failed to become Members of the other House.  I have no objection to a Senator using this House to become a Member of the Lower House.  I also have no objection to somebody who wishes to acquire experience in this House before becoming a Member of the Lower House.  That issue should not be discussed in this context.</P>
      <P>This debate is about the role of the Seanad within the constitutional review.  This is the first time there has been a review of the Constitution in which the role of the Seanad has been just part of the review.  This is not a case of somebody calling for the abolition of the Seanad to make life better constitutionally and in parliamentary terms.  Our bicameral system was not ideal at the beginning.  It offered Unionists an opportunity to participate in the operations of the new State. Many of the Unionist politicians who became Members of the first Seanad did a fantastic job to ensure the State evolved into its current shape.</P>
      <P>It is not an ideal State, but it is ruled by two Houses of Parliament which reflect what the people want.  If I asked people in the streets of Dublin whether the Dáil and the Seanad reflect what the people want, it would be hard to find a consensus that they do in terms of democracy. However, if I asked them what the alternative was I would not find many people who would say that the Seanad should be abolished to ensure a better democracy.  One of the political parties currently represented in this House suggested that the Seanad should be abolished.  However, when it discovered it would be electorally beneficial to withdraw from that stance it did so, That party has discovered that its involvement in the Seanad has been beneficial not only to the party but to its electorate.  The Seanad is doing a job but no institution is above criticism or analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe said that only one-third of national parliaments have second Chambers.  If one takes that to mean one-third of democratically elected parliaments, the statistic is <Col N="1620" /> inaccurate.  I do not know where the statistic comes from, but it is nonsense.  Two-thirds of national parliaments in certain areas of the world are unicameral, but those countries are run by dictators who install a parliament which is a pretence. I have been involved in the Arab world for a number of years and I am familiar with a body known as the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union. Within that union an election is occasionally held for a country's parliament, but that parliament can be arbitrarily abolished.  Bicameral systems in the Arab world have been abolished by diktat, not by vote.  The statistic of one-third of national parliaments would not even stand up in the IPU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said the source for the statistic was the Coakley-Laver study.  They are two eminent academics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Academics never make good politicians; but people who come from academia, such as Senator Manning, have become excellent politicians.  Statisticians do not produce the right statistics.  Deputy O'Keeffe said only one-third of national parliaments have bicameral systems and that the trend is towards having unicameral legislatures. That is not true.  Only two countries which had bicameral legislatures have changed to a unicameral system.  One of them was Sweden or Norway.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also said: &ldquo;In unitary states an Upper House, having a democratic mandate as strong as that of the Lower House, could institute the likelihood of deadlock in the legislative process because both Houses would have an equal right to veto legislation.  If one sought to obviate such deadlock by dividing the legislative areas in two and giving control over an area to each of the Houses, one would immediately be presented with the question: why have two Houses?&rdquo;  My reply is that this country has been well served by the existence of two Houses.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that Members of this House have more time, are not as political, are more academic and can deal with problems better than Members in the other House.  I do not agree with people who say we are not representative of the people.  With the exception of Members elected by the universities and the 11 Members appointed by the Taoiseach, every Senator is elected by somebody who has been elected.  This is extremely important.  The elected Members of this House, regardless of the panels they represent, are elected by representatives of the people, the county councillors who are elected in each electoral area of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a great advantage over Members of the Lower House.  Somebody from north Kerry might vote for me.  If that person has a problem with, for example, fishing rights in north Kerry, I must know what they are talking about.  I have been to the Border area in past years to see the commercial deprivation on both sides as a result of the Troubles.  I am from Kilkenny and am not associated with a Border area, but I listened to <Col N="1621" /> their problems.  However, if I were a Member of the Dáil I would be trying to secure votes in my own constituency and I would not be terribly worried about whether the price of diesel was cheaper north or south of the Border.  Depending on the exchange rate or whether there was an incident on the Border, I would not worry about whether to dance in Letterkenny or Derry.  These are the things which people forget when the question of the Seanad's existence is mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that the system of election to the Seanad made it remote from the people.  That is nonsense.  The Members of the Seanad elected by county councillors are closer to the majority of the people than TDs.  I might regret saying that in the future because I may have to ask some of those TDs for their votes.</P>
    <P>I was privileged to be one of the Taoiseach's nominees.  I would not say that I contributed much to the House, but I have seen Members on both sides contribute greatly to Government.  In some cases they have been very narrow in their focus and they could not understand how Members could broaden their horizons to talk on a variety of issues.  I have seen the value of nonpolitical Members of this House, but I have also seen politicians being more effective than those selected.</P>
    <P>There was a time when university graduates represented a very narrow group of people, and they still do.  A huge number of people went to university but did not graduate.  If one university can elect Members to this House then that right should be extended to all universities.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry was wrong when she referred to Trinity College as a Protestant university for a Protestant people.  The first Provost of Trinity was a Catholic.  There were two universities in Great Britain &mdash; Cambridge and Oxford &mdash; founded in the 12th century.  The university of Kilkenny was founded in the 18th century but it did not last because of religious differences.  King James had about 20,000 soldiers of whom only 2,000 were Irish.  King William also only had about 2,000 Irish soldiers.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there is a debate taking place within the context of a constitutional review and that we are not talking about the Seanad in isolation. There is a need for such a review.  If one mentioned a constitutional review to the public 99 per cent of them would not even mention the Seanad.  They would talk about the division between the State and the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>We need to analyse what we are doing.  The public feels that the Seanad does an excellent job and those who are trying to get rid of this House have no idea of what democracy is about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's opening address to the Seanad on this issue concerned itself solely with this House.  The system of election to the Dáil also needs to be addressed, especially when so many outgoing TDs are not seeking re-election.  They may be frustrated with the system, especially the multi-seat constituencies <Col N="1622" /> in which five TDs may be working for the same constituent.  This does not help them to legislate for the country, which is what they were elected to do.  The Deputy's committee should look at the possibility of introducing one seat, transferable vote constituencies.</P>
      <P>In the Deputy's address he stated:</P>
      <P>It must be acknowledged that the Seanad in its current form has come in for criticisms from different quarters, sometimes accompanied by demands for its abolition.  Particular criticism has been directed at the Seanad's arcane nomination and electoral procedures and its almost total domination by the Dáil and Government. In 1967 the first All Party Committee on the Constitution was able to say that in having a second chamber Ireland resembled &lsquo;most modern democracies&rsquo;.  The current position is that only one third of national parliaments, that is 58 out of 178, have second chambers.</P>
      <P>The second Chamber in this country is very important and the Seanad has improved legislation which has come here from the Dáil.  This House made amendments to the Consumer Credit Bill, which proves that it is justifying its existence. The Harbours Bill, in which I was very interested, was also greatly improved by this House.  There was unease with some sections of the Road Traffic Bill, but the Seanad amended it in response to these concerns, as we did with the Control of Horses Bill, the Family Law Bill and the Constitutional Bill.</P>
      <P>This House also initiated some very important legislation, such as the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, the Civil Legal Aid Bill, the National Monuments Bill and the National Cultural Institutions Bill.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also said that:</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the bridge between Ireland and Europe established by the treaties of the European Union is carrying a huge volume of EU legislation and that this traffic, with increasing European integration, will become even heavier.  The Dáil, even with its extended committee system, is not capable of carrying out the necessary analysis of draft directives and the overview of regulations implemented by statutory instruments.</P>
      <P>The statement goes on to say: &ldquo;It seems to me that the Seanad should be given the task of monitoring this immensely important legislative traffic,&rdquo;.  That seems to suggest that the existence of the Seanad is justified and I agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement then proceeds to the representative basis and states: &ldquo;The way the membership of the Seanad is selected at present makes it remote from the people&rdquo;.  I do not think it is that remote and, as Senator Lanigan said, we are elected by people who are elected by the public and are answerable to them.  Eleven Members are nominated by the Taoiseach and six by university graduates.  It is natural that the Taoiseach would <Col N="1623" /> like to have a working majority in this House to ensure that he will&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a nice thing to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Taoiseach who was elected and not the one appointed in mid-term.  Senator Manning would agree with me that it is only natural for that to be the case. However, former Taoisigh and the current one have gone beyond that and nominated Independent Senators and ones from across the Border who have done valuable work and made valuable contributions.  That is a good thing.  Perhaps this is a good omen for a united Ireland.</P>
      <P>The electoral system has been discussed.  I have been a Member of this House for nearly 20 years, as has Senator Lanigan.  We hope to stay, but our biggest fear is of defeated TDs being added to our panel.  A Senator who was unsuccessful in being elected to the Dáil on the last occasion said:</P>
      <P>We want to encourage effective representation at local democracy level.  It may well be, however, that, because local authority members do not have that and that one of the few perks they have is to elect members to the Seanad, this has given rise to a distortion of the relationship between electors and elected.  The best guarantee of being elected to this House if one is on a panel is to keep in contact with individual local authority members and supply them with tickets to All-Ireland, soccer or rugby matches.</P>
      <P>I completely disagree with this philosophy.  He states further: &ldquo;I know that was not contemplated by anyone who suggested a review of the Chamber of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;.  It is a reflection on the intelligence of county councillors that they would be influenced by the receipt of gifts of tickets or something similar.  I do not mind doing favours in regard to agriculture or other constituency problems.</P>
      <P>That same Senator, when he was Minister for Agriculture and Food, introduced the Agricultural (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, and section 20 of that Act abolished the Council, An Chomhairle, the Board and committees of agriculture.  He took away the power of county councillors, yet he was elected to the Seanad after failing to get his Dáil seat in the last election.  He was elected on the same panel as an illustrious Member of this House who held the office of Cathaoirleach.  She sent out diaries every year and even rang people up to ensure they received their diaries.  The man who took away the power from councils was elected and the person giving what he saw as silly favours was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fallacy to suggest that doing silly things such as giving All-Ireland or rugby tickets gets people elected.  We amend and enact legislation and we should let people know we do that.  We also give a service to the people who elected us <Col N="1624" /> and the general public.  I appreciate the concern for this House to continue.  If the Seanad is to be removed, the other House should also be examined. The burden has become so great on politicians, especially with the multi-seat constituency system, that we should think about introducing single seat constituencies to allow for a better democratic system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the House, I thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, for his attendance at the six hours of this debate.  He is clearly taking seriously his job as chairman of the all-party committee. He has approached the subject of the future of the Seanad in a professional, thoughtful and consultative way supported by the first class research of Mr. Coakley and Mr. Laver, which has been useful for us in this debate.  I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for his courtesy and attendance and hope the debate will be of some use.</P>
      <P>There was no effort on my part to put any parameters on it or to try and structure it in any way. It was a good opportunity for Members of the House with divergent views on their role and that of the Seanad to have their say and in an unexpurgated way.  It is the raw material for reflection by the members of the committee.  Over the next few days, I, as Leader of the House, will make a written submission to the committee on the basis of the debate.  It would be better to do so having considered what was said during the debate.</P>
      <P>In 1937 the debate was taking place on the Constitution and on whether or not we should have a Seanad.  President de Valera, as he was then and soon to be Taoiseach, who three years earlier had moved for the abolition of the old Free State Senate, observed that a bad Seanad was better than none at all.  It was not an enthusiastic endorsement of the House which was his brainchild.  I beg to differ with President de Valera in that debate.  The only valid argument for a second House is that it be a good second House.  Within the term &ldquo;good&rdquo; can be found all the reasons to justify its existence.  It should add value to the political process and enhance the working of our political system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many ways in which it can do this. There is no blueprint, model or example which we can slavishly follow.  There are many ways often born of our experience and tradition and the legacy of those who have gone before us in the past 70 years in this Chamber.  There are many ways in which we can add value to what is a democratic process which is in a constant state of transition.  In the experience of all Members present this evening, and certainly in the experience of Deputy O'Keeffe, our political system has changed more in the last ten years than it did in the previous 60 or 70, and whatever change we talk about now could become part of the ongoing change.  It would be far better, whether Deputy O'Keeffe's committee exists or not, that the question of the reform of this House should be first a matter for the House itself and that the many <Col N="1625" /> reforms mentioned over the past hours would be initiated by us.</P>
    <P>There are reasons why this is so and one of them, if I may declare my interest as Leader of House, is that there should be a stronger statutory basis for the Leader of the Seanad.  At present, the Leader has no statutory basis and no power base.  The position is not recognised and is one which has grown.  If a real leadership role is to be given for reform and direction of this House, the person who has the privilege of holding the office of Leader of the House should have that position supported by some form of statutory recognition.  That is not something I ask for myself but is something which, from my experience, is necessary.  The Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach have constitutional recognition. The Taoiseach, as Leader of Dáil Éireann, obviously has that constitutional recognition.  In a more modest way there should be the same recognition for the Leader of the House, whoever that person may be.</P>
    <P>The first Senate, the Free State Senate which existed from 1922 to 1936, fulfilled some of the criteria I would expect of a second House.  It had a very distinctive contribution to make to the political life of the new Free State.  At a very crucial moment in our history, it provided a vital transformative mechanism which enabled the representatives of the old Unionist tradition to come to terms with, and play an important part in, the development of a new Free State, a State which they had opposed strongly for centuries.  Nonetheless, there were great days when Countess of Dysart, McGillicuddy of the Reeks and Lord Glenavy sat alongside former revolutionaries in the same House.  Tophatted gentlemen arriving for the morning sitting of the Senate met former gunmen not quite in slouched hats coming into the other House.  It was an arena where people could get together, that transformation could be made, and these people were able to come to terms.  These people had a very distinctive contribution to make.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the first Senate was open to people of great distinction to play a part in public life, and I am thinking of people like W.B. Yeats, Oliver St. John Gogarty and others who made very vital contributions.  The role of the Free State Senate in the early years of the State cannot be over-estimated.  It certainly was not a docile body. People, such as Kevin O'Higgins, quickly felt that the Senate had almost too much power &mdash; it could hold up legislation for 18 months.  Ultimately, of course, it paid the price because it conflicted one principle with another and, when it came down to it, there could be no contest between the popular Lower House and the indirectly elected Upper House.</P>
    <P>The Free State Senate did have a number of defects, one of which is central to our debate today, that is, how it should be elected.  Half the members of the first Senate were nominated and it never really came to terms with the particular problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> However, I do not have much time and I want to talk about the future rather than the past. Seanad Éireann, unlike that first Senate, does not have any such clear cut role.  Our vocationalism lacks any real substance.  The university Seanad system is elitist and democratically indefensible. Overall, this House does not provide a sufficient contrast or fill the gaps offered by the other House.</P>
    <P>After what I have just said, let me enter my reservations.  On the question of the university seats, I stand by what I said, that in theory it is very difficult to defend the existence of university seats in a House of Parliament in 1997.  However, using my first criterion, that is, do the university seats add value and enhance our democratic system, the answer is emphatically yes.  We have had some superb university Senators over the years, not least of whom was President Robinson.  The contribution, points of view and degree of expertise of university Senators have been magnificent and that alone justifies the existence of university seats.  Having stated my principle, in practice I would be a strong defender of university seats. Like everybody else, I believe they must be reformed and the electorate must be extended.  I would tell Senator Ross that he can leave his paranoia at home.  There is no conspiracy here to abolish the university seats and dress that up as the sum total of Seanad reform.  That is nonsense and he can print that in <i>The Sunday Independent</i> if he wishes.</P>
    <P>Vocationalism is really at the centre of what this Seanad was intended to be and, frankly, it has not worked but that does not mean it is not necessarily a good idea.  If we could recast the thinking on vocationalism of the 1930s, which was behind at least part of membership of this Seanad, into the conditions prevailing in Ireland at the end of this century, there is the germ of a very good idea which would add a note of distinctiveness, a different point of view and a degree of expertise and value to what we are doing.  How do we do that?  There is no simple answer.  One obvious way is to begin by tightening up the qualifications for standing on the vocational panels.</P>
    <P>To echo a point made by Senator Quinn and others, the panels might be recast.  Maybe there should be a panel for science and technology, the social sciences, sport, youth affairs and whatever. There are areas which are not specifically catered for in the earlier definition of vocationalism.  In that sense, there is a case for looking at recasting the panels and defining the levels of expertise of those to be nominated on the vocational panel. That might well meet with the requirement to add a degree of expertise to this House.</P>
    <P>We must examine the electoral system.  I am a strong defender of the electoral college of county councillors.  First, they have been elected and, second, they have a degree of expertise as they are close to the ground.  There is also a need to widen the electoral system and perhaps provide that some of the 43 Members of the Seanad must <Col N="1627" /> pass rigorous criteria to be nominated and be elected from European parliamentary constituencies at the same time Dáil Éireann is being elected.  That would ensure that people who are elected are not necessarily those who failed to be elected to Dáil Éireann but people with vocational credentials who have a popular mandate. If the election was held on the same day as a general election, it would not involve an extra cost.  I will try to be more specific about this when I make my submission to the commission.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn and others that this House must mix strong, practical, professional, party politicians with the expertise which comes from elsewhere.  I remember being at the Literary and Historical Society in UCD in the 1960s when Seán Lemass said that a Dáil full of graduates was an appalling prospect.  A Seanad full of professionals and experts would be an even more appalling prospect.  There is a need for a very practical mix.  If we can find that mix, a great deal could be added.</P>
    <P>As this debate began about seven or eight minutes late, I ask the House's indulgence to speak for a few more minutes?</P>

      <P>The principle of having Taoiseach's nominees is one which I would defend strongly.  In the past, we have seen some splendid nominees &mdash; Dr. Ken Whitaker, Dr. John Rob, Mr. Séamus Mallon, Mr. Gordon Wilson, Professor George Eogan, the archaeologist, Mr. Brian Friel and Mr. John Magner and Senator Edward Haughey is one of the most successful business people on either side of the Border. Such people bring with them a particular point of view and they are a justification for Taoiseach's nominees.  Past Taoisigh may not have used this power with sufficient imagination but then they had their own particular pressures.</P>
      <P>To come at a point made by Senator Gallagher from a different perspective, three of the nominated positions might well be left to Uachtarán na hÉireann.  Just as the President nominates people to the Council of State, she might nominate three people to the Seanad to represent particular interests which she feels need representation. Again, that is an idea on which I will try to elaborate in my submission.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to look at the other major aspect of the second House, that is, what is the purpose of a second House?  I would strongly argue that, over the years, this House, at comparatively little cost, has justified its existence in the day to day dreary detailed work of examining legislation, having debates and providing points of view not being heard elsewhere.  We need to go further, to reinvent ourselves and to find new roles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make some suggestions.  Statutory instruments were once inelegantly described <Col N="1628" /> as crafty little buggers which creep in and suddenly one finds a body of law which nobody examined and which can have far-reaching consequences. James Dillon, one of the great legislators, always argued that any law should be scrutinised, go through Parliament and not come into existence surreptitiously because it suits civil servants or Ministers.  There is a clear democratic deficit in our system at present in the examination of statutory instruments.  If arrangements were properly structured, this House could have an important part to play in ensuring that law does not come into existence by stealth, as often happens, and that it is properly scrutinised.  This happens all the time and there is a list of statutory instruments which will become law unless a motion is put down.  I believe it should be the other way around and that they should have to justify their existence before they become law.  I am sorry if that causes problems for the bureaucrats and Ministers but it would be a democratic addition, especially in an age of increasing complexity and technicality.</P>
    <P>This should be the European House, and I do not mean inviting MEPs here once in a while to tell us what is happening in Strasbourg or Brussels. This House should be organised in such a way with proper research and secretarial backup to ensure European legislation, whether it is one month, one year or five years away, is fully examined, debated and scrutinised.  There is a huge deficit in this regard.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs does not do that and it depends on people who are already too busy, although they do their best.  If a House of Parliament rather than a committee was dedicated to the job of scrutinising European legislation, it would go a long way towards addressing a deficit. It could be a House to which Commissioners, as Neil Kinnock did and others will in the future, could come so that people could put their point of view on legislation which may affect theirs interests and who have no option at present but to go Brussels to the Commission or to Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>Many ideas were put forward in speeches over the past couple of days.  I refer to an interesting point made by Senator Quinn.  He said legislation for the most part should begin in this House and that generally we are presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i> I believe he misses the point in that both Houses are generally presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i> Legislation is decided by civil servants, Ministers and pressure groups.  Working on the legislation committee of this Government and as Leader of the House, I am constantly astonished at the unconscious arrogance of civil servants who assume that because the legislation has come from their end of the system all Stages should be taken the next day between 10.30 a.m. and 11 a.m.  This constantly happens and there is a mind-set among civil servants and Minister which leads them to believe that the Houses are simply rubber stamps.  If we could move towards the German system, where this House could be used during <Col N="1629" /> the process of the formulation of legislation and where civil servants working on it could come here to discuss the reasons for its introduction and difficulties with elected Members, Members would have an input.  Ultimately, the Government is responsible for legislation, but at least points of view would have been listened to at an early stage.  It may be inconvenient and civil servants might not like what they hear, but at least it ensures participation.  I have more ideas which I will include in my submission to the all-party committee.</P>
    <P>This has been a useful debate.  On any cost benefit analysis, the Seanad more than pays its way and justifies its existence.  If one were to examine its overall contribution to the political system, which is more than what happens in legislation, it more than justifies its existence and does so at low cost.  We have an opportunity to take a great leap to change this House so that it can do the job it has been doing in a more visible way and where there is greater appreciation of its work.  This is a proud institution.  People such as William Butler Yeats and President Mary Robinson worked in this Chamber and made their input into legislation.  It would be a shame if through an unwillingness to defend ourselves, an incapacity to change or a timorousness in the face of new ideas, our case was to go by default.  I hope what Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has heard over the past few days will remove any doubt about the need for a second Chamber and will give the all-party committee food for thought in its suggestions as to how this House might be made more effective and relevant and add value to Irish democracy.</P>

    <Title>Fisheries (Commissions) Bill, 1997: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Fisheries (Commissions) Bill, 1997, is to validate the establishment of the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission and the appointment of Mr. Séamus Keating as member of the commission to validate the actions of the commission and to provide an indemnity to the members of such commissions against all and any actions or claims.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission was established, and had certain functions conferred on it, by an order signed by me on 21 February 1996 following debate and resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In summary the Attorney General has advised that the order in question is invalid because the necessary authority to sign it had not been conferred on me as Minister of State at the time.  New legislation is needed to validate actions taken by that commission in exercise of functions purportedly conferred on it under that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> I would like to recall for the House the circumstances which gave rise to the establishment of the commission.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, provides that the Minister for the Marine may, by order, following a request from a fisheries board or after consideration by him of a report on the management, organisation and performance of a board, appoint a commission to carry out particular functions of that board.  The legislation was enacted on foot of a review of the existing legislation governing intervention by the Minister in the affairs of a fisheries board where exceptional circumstances warranted.  It was prompted by recurring allegations concerning the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>As soon as the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, was enacted, I appointed Mr. Dermot Rochford, personnel consultant, to report to me under section 2 of that Act on the management and organisation of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and the exercise by it of its functions in relation to its finances and staff.  His report concluded that the affairs of the SRFB were not, nor in the foreseeable future likely to be, managed in an effective manner.  He recommended that the Minister consider exercising his powers to establish a commission under section 3 of the 1995 Act while ensuring a working structure which would continue to harness the undoubted capabilities within the board itself.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Southern Regional Fisheries Board on 13 January 1996 giving notice under section 4 of the Act of my intention to make an order appointing a commission and conferring on it the management, conservation and protection functions of the board.  The board would continue to be responsible for the development and improvement of fisheries; the encouragement, promotion and development of angling; the issuing of licences; fisheries rates and the preparation of development plans.  The Southern Regional Fisheries Board responded positively to my proposal on 24 January 1996.  In accordance with the Act, a draft order establishing the commission was laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 9 February 1996.  On 21 February 1996 each House passed a resolution approving the draft order.  I accordingly made the order on 21 February 1996, under section 3 of the 1995 Act, providing for the appointment of a commission for a period of one year from 23 February 1996 to take over the protection, conservation and management functions of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.  Mr. Séamus Keating was appointed as the sole commissioner with effect from 26 February 1996.</P>
    <P>In causing a report to be prepared on the Southern Regional Fisheries Board, signing the order providing for the appointment of the commission and appointing Mr. Keating to the commission, I proceeded on the understanding that I was exercising powers conferred on me by the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, and the Marine (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) (No. 2) Order, 1995 (S.I. No. 199 of 1995).  The latter <Col N="1631" /> order delegated certain specified functions of the Minister for the Marine to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine.  These functions included functions under the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1994, in so far as they relate to inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>It was in the course of routine preparation of a draft order last December to extend the term of the commission that the Attorney General's Office discovered that the original order establishing the commission was invalid.  It transpired that, because the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, under which the order was made, post-dated by several months the Marine (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) (No. 2) Order, 1995, the specific new powers conferred on the Minister under that Act had not been delegated to me. The Attorney General's Office advised the Department of a potential problem on 18 December last and at a meeting the following day.</P>
    <P>Pending clarification of the legal situation, it was decided to proceed in any event with the laying of a draft order extending the term of the commission in the name of the Minister for the Marine.  This was laid before the Oireachtas on 20 December 1996.  Following definitive clarification of the problem after the Christmas break, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, the Minister and I agreed on the need for immediate action to address the legal difficulty. The Attorney General advised that primary legislation was required to validate the appointment and the work of the commission since its establishment.</P>
    <P>I regret that this situation has arisen, resulting in the need to introduce this legislation.  I assure the House that I signed in good faith, and with the agreement of the Minister and the approval of both Houses, the order establishing the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission.  I had at the time no reason to doubt that I had the necessary authority under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, and under the Marine (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) (No. 2) Order made earlier in 1995 to make that statutory instrument.  Indeed, we were all proceeding in good faith in the course of the debate of the order in this House last February.</P>
    <P>Equally, the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission has subsequently acted in good faith in exercising the functions conferred on it, as has the Southern Regional Fisheries Board in co-operating and working with the commission.  I will refer later to the constructive work carried out by the commission since its establishment in February 1996.  It would clearly not be in the public interest, nor in the interest of the Southern Fisheries Region, nor in keeping with the intentions of the Oireachtas, if we were not to address the legal deficiencies which have now come to light.</P>
    <P>The commissioner was informed of the legal deficiencies on 14 January last and the chairman of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board has <Col N="1632" /> been briefed on the situation.  I understand he has briefed board members and staff.  The legal situation, pending the enactment of this Bill, is that the Southern Regional Fisheries Board has all the functions of a regional board under the Fisheries Acts.  The Bill is designed to enable the constructive and valuable work of the commission to date to be validated and preserved and will allow that work to be completed in the best interests of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and Southern Fisheries Region.</P>
    <P>In that context I advise the House that, since taking office, the commission has undertaken a review of fisheries protection and surveillance in the southern region and has, where necessary, formulated revised working procedures in this operational area.  The commission has worked closely and constructively with the board which, under the purported order, retained responsibility for fisheries promotion, development and licensing and for fisheries rates.  The commission is also reviewing management systems within the board and, in conjunction with the Central Fisheries Board, has undertaken a review of the board's finances and financial systems.  I am satisfied, on the basis of regular reports to date from the commission, that it is in the interests of the efficient and effective management of the board for the commission to be allowed to complete the work it has begun.</P>
    <P>The detailed provisions of the Bill are as follows. Section 1 governs the interpretation of terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the validation of the order signed on 21 February 1996 which established, and conferred certain functions on, the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission and of actions taken in fulfilment of conditions precedent to the making of that order. Section 3 provides for the validation of all actions taken by the commission in the period since its establishment to the date, 14 January 1997, on which the commission was informed of the legal difficulties and the validation of the appointment of the sole member of the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 4 subjects validations under sections 2 and 3 to the necessary constitutional provisions. Section 5 provides for the extension of the order which purported to establish the commission, and which is to be validated under section 2, to 20 February 1998 or to such earlier date as the Minister may specify.  This will make the draft order laid on 20 December 1996 redundant.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the continuation in office of the existing member of the commission. Section 7 provides for the indemnification of members of the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission, and members of commissions which may be established in the future, against actions brought against them by virtue of their actions or omissions as members of commissions.  Section 8 provides for the non-abatement of prosecutions brought prior to the enactment of this Bill by either the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission or the Southern Regional Fisheries <Col N="1633" /> Board.  Section 9 gives the short title of the Bill, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  It will enable the commission to be put back on track and will allow for the substantive work already under way to continue and be completed as everyone intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill validates legislation passed in the House approximately 12 months ago.  At that time I was worried about the purpose for which it was intended.  It appears that constructive work has been undertaken by the commission since the appointment was made and it would be a pity to waste that.  I have no objection to the Bill passing through the House as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>As a former salmon fisherman and licence holder, I want to comment on the measures the Minister has introduced to conserve wild salmon. The Minister is limiting the number of licences issued for the drift net system which means people who had licences last year will not get them this year.  He is also reducing the distance from 12 miles to six miles and shortening the season. The same applies to the draft net system. While I am not totally against these measures because we need to conserve wild salmon, the Minister should provide compensation for these fishermen.  If a person loses their job, they will get compensation by way of redundancy payments. Yet fishermen lose their jobs each year but they do not receive compensation.  Although I support the idea of conserving wild salmon, many fishermen will not get licences this year as a result of the measures introduced.  I ask the Minister to consider giving compensation to fishermen who will not get licences and to those whose season will be shortened.</P>
      <P>I support the good work being done by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and I hope it continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Fitzgerald stated, the Bill calls for brevity but it also calls for the imprimatur of the various parties to vindicate the original action taken by the Minister of State.  At the time the original order was introduced, there was a serious problem within the Southern Fisheries Board and the Minister of State took decisive action.  With hindsight, it has not worked very well but the fact that the mechanism is defective is a matter for the bureaucrats, to which Senator Manning referred during the debate on constitutional reform.  Nonetheless, these things happen and the Minister of State received advice and took action in good faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General acted correctly in drawing this important matter to the attention of the Department and insisting that primary legislation should be introduced to resolve the problem. That is the correct way to do business.  I have no doubt about the effectiveness of the original order in terms of its implementation.  In the spirit <Col N="1634" /> of generosity, this House will correct the mechanical difficulties involved with it.  I commend the Minister of State for his original action.  This matter will be resolved through the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is important to state that he should be absolved of any blame in this matter.  It is not his fault that this Bill is before the House and he has acted with commendable speed to regularise the situation.  I would not echo the kind words used by Senator Magner in respect of the Attorney General's Office.  These difficulties might not have arisen had the staff of that office been more vigilant. The Minister of State will be relieved that I will not reiterate remarks made by Deputy Haughey when this matter was discussed in the Dáil.  The Deputy argued trenchantly that there were deficiencies of a serious nature in the Attorney General's Office which was part of the reason the legislation had come before the Lower House.</P>
      <P>I believe that the original legislation was correct. It was essential to resolve, in the manner intended, the serious problems which existed in the Southern Fisheries Board when that legislation was introduced.  I note that the commissioner has been in office for approximately 12 months but the fact that we are regularising this matter will not change the situation on the ground in terms of actions that were taken.</P>
      <P>Inland fisheries and freshwater fishing are immense natural resources and are important on a world scale.  It appears not enough people recognise that fact.  It is important that the Government, other State agencies and the tourism industry realise the magnitude of the resource.  Even were it not of such a magnitude, we do not have the right to destroy something which has been in existence since the ice age. That is what is happening.</P>
      <P>Recent news reports highlighted the problem of phosphates in Lough Corrib.  I began my lake fishing career on Lough Ennel which was destroyed.  Lough Sheelin was also destroyed and there is still prevarication about the disappearance of sea trout from the west.  Lough Conn is also being destroyed by phosphates.  Such lakes are extremely important resources and I am disappointed at the lack of determination to protect them.  It is important to stress that there have been success stories such as the River Moy and the River Erriff, which is managed by Jim Stafford. Ken Whelan's research at Burrishoole is another example of a success story.  However, we must be determined to protect these resources.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Fitzgerald's comments on salmon, I commend the Minister of State for the action he has taken in that regard.  However, I accept that, where livelihoods are affected, there must be a mechanism to allow people to disengage from the industry and receive compensation. There is a capital value to a fishery or an individual's right to fish which must be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> I accept the need for the legislation.  I hope that the resource with which the Fisheries Board is charged with protecting and developing will be enhanced and improved.  I look to the present Government and its successors to exercise the determination required to ensure that the resource remains in place and that the revenue to be gained from it in terms of domestic and international tourism can be sustained.</P>
    <P>When I began fishing on Lough Conn approximately 30 years ago, people travelled from America <i>via</i> Shannon Airport, hired cars, stayed in Connemara for a month, hired a gilly each day and eventually returned home.  Those people were quite affluent and did not mind where they spent their money.  They would travel to the Falk-land Islands, Alaska, Russia or wherever the sport existed.  If we provide the sport, they will come to Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>My knowledge of fishing does not match that of Senator Dardis.  By virtue of the fact that the dogs in the street outside the headquarters of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board were aware of the problems in that area and realising the great potential of our fisheries, one wondered how soon that matter would be rectified.  As it happened, the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, was enacted and a statutory order was introduced.  What was the nature of the difficulties associated with this matter? I realise that it transpired because the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, under which the order was made, post-dated the delegation of the functions but that should not be deemed to be a serious matter because it is easily rectified by amending the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is making a great impact in the area of fisheries and he must continue to do so because of the enormous potential that exists. Everything possible must be done, in accordance with the law, to develop and protect our fishery interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I support the legislation.  As he stated, Members are unanimous about the need for its introduction.  Senator Magner stated that there have been many problems in respect of the Southern Fisheries Board.  Does the Minister of State have access to adequate machinery to deal with this problem and does he have the respect of those involved in the fishing industry?  Are an adequate number of those involved in that industry participating in the commission he established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in an area where people have experienced endless trouble with the Foyle Fisheries Commission. I hope the introduction of the legislation will provide a solution.  However, I have a gut feeling that it will not because the Department of the Marine does not have the manpower, machinery or intention to pursue this matter.  I oppose the idea of bringing in civil servants from outside <Col N="1636" /> to become members of a commission.  Perhaps this is necessary to keep the Department involved and informed.  However, people involved in other industries are also involved in the managing and monitoring of those industries.</P>
    <P>I speak from experience but I will not inform the Minister of State about how bad things are in the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  However, I will read him a newspaper headline which states &ldquo;River Watcher Nets £40,000 in Religious Bias Claim&rdquo;.  The article to which it refers states that two Tyrone men were awarded damages totalling £40,000 on grounds of religious discrimination against the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>

      <P>The Senator is straying towards Lough Foyle.  If that is the amount of sincerity with which my contribution was taken, it would be better had I not made any.  I hope the Minister knows he has a sizeable problem in the management of the inland fishing industry and the area under his responsibility.  It has to be seen to be working to get the respect of fishermen because there is temptation to drive a horse and cart through any regulations introduced under the Bill.  I would like to be assured that the Minister has the capacity and the resources necessary.  As someone with a dedicated interest I think he is going nowhere if he does not recognise there should be an input from those involved in the industry to the management of the board.  I appeal to the Minister to appoint someone from the fishing industry to the new Southern Fisheries Commission.  He will only be successful if he intends to do that.</P>

He has contacted the Southern Fisheries Board who are agreeable to what he is doing.  The Minister is to be complimented on introducing the legislation dealing with the Southern Fisheries Board last year.  This legislation follows on from that.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald spoke about drift and draft fishing and raised an important question about the reduction in licences.  I agree with what he said about licences being taken away and that people should be compensated.  Perhaps some form of compensation could be paid to those who lose licences.  It would be a way around it and everyone agrees there should be a reduction of this type of fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned Lough Conn and Lough Cullen.  I compliment the Government for <Col N="1637" /> providing £250,000 for a new tertiary treatment unit for Castlebar sewerage scheme, which will eliminate phosphates going into the Castlebar river and ultimately Lough Conn and Lough Cullen.  This will be a great help in bringing the lakes back to life.  We are hopeful that we will get a new sewerage treatment unit for Crossmolina, which would greatly benefit those lakes.  I hope the Minister takes this up with his Cabinet colleagues. Everyone in the region is making strides to bring the lakes back to life.  The farmers are to be complimented as they are taking care with the spreading of slurry.  I compliment the Minister on this legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and all the Senators who have contributed for their co-operation and understanding about the need to correct an unforeseen legal deficiency which arose in the implementation of the Bill.  It is fortunate that the deficiency was identified and that we are in a position to correct it.  I confess I would have preferred if it had been identified at an earlier stage.  Sometimes flaws in legislation are not found until it reaches court and then it is at considerable expense to everyone involved, including the taxpayer.  On this occasion, the problem was discovered at an early stage and we are moving to correct it.</P>
      <P>I presume when Senator Dardis referred to Deputy Haughey, he meant Deputy O'Malley, who did make a trenchant contribution on this Bill in the other House.  It baffles me why Senator Dardis of all people should confuse the two.</P>

      <P>He made a number of points about inland fisheries generally with which I agree.  Senator Sherlock, Senator Belton and Senator Burke also identified the same issue.  Our inland fisheries are a valuable resource.  The extent to which the Government values those resources is reflected in the fact that the allocation for inland fisheries in the 1997 Estimates is the highest ever at over £16 million.  There is a big financial commitment, particularly through the tourism angling measure of the operational programme which is investing considerable sums of money, including restoring and saving the western lakes as the premier wild brown trout fisheries in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also thank Members for their kind remarks about the action we have taken to conserve our wild salmon stocks.  I am not sure Senator Fitzgerald's analogy of compensation and someone losing their job is accurate.  Nobody is losing their job as such.  I have restricted the number of available licences but I have restricted it to the number of licences which were issued in 1996.  There will be no reduction in the number of licences this <Col N="1638" /> year over those issued in 1996.  I have capped it at the 1996 level to limit the size of the fishery.</P>
    <P>Fishermen will be beneficiaries of the conservation measures taken.  There is a restriction on the fishery this year.  I intend to proceed to a second phase of conservation measures which will include the introduction of a quota system for the salmon fishery, the primary purpose of which is to allow more fish back into the rivers.  This will ultimately result in a higher salmon population and the beneficiaries will include the fishermen who are co-operating with the measures and who are being asked to restrict the fishery in the short term to allow stocks to recover.</P>

      <P>The case for improved allowances and expenses for county councillors has been so well made at this stage that it would be a waste of the House's and the Minister of State's time if I were to begin detailing the reasons.  To get to the core of the matter, the last Administration introduced a system of allowances and expenses for county councillors which was long overdue.  On the one hand it was widely accepted by councillors who felt they were at last being acknowledged but, on the other hand there was controversy over the manner in which the travel element of the allowance was being implemented. It meant not only that certain restrictions would be placed on the travel expenses councillors could claim, but also on the number of meetings for <Col N="1639" /> which they could claim those expenses throughout the year.  The system was introduced as a reform measure but the reality was &mdash; and still is, in certain counties &mdash; that it has not been universally accepted.</P>
      <P>The element on which I wish to concentrate concerns postage and telephone expenses which, I understand, comprise a figure of £1,000 per year made up of postage and telephone costs.  This figure was introduced at the same time as the reform of the expenses allocations in 1994.  Within a year the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, promised a review of the expenses.  The current Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, expressed his interest in monitoring the workings of the new system on an ongoing basis.  However, three years later there has been no review of the system despite the fact that Deputies and Senators have benefited through increases in some allowances and in the consolidation of others, most recently with the legislation passed before Christmas.</P>
      <P>There is an old cliché which says that nothing concentrates the mind better than a hanging. Nothing concentrates the minds of politicians like an election.  Perhaps people will say that Senator Mooney and other Senators will support increases because it is a good idea especially in an election year.  However, I do not want the debate to be interpreted in that way.  The files in the Department of the Environment will show that I and several other Members have made repeated requests to Minister Howlin and his predecessor to institute a review which would encapsulate the increased living expenses incurred by county councillors in pursuit of their duties.</P>
      <P>I am asking for either an increase in the £1,000 allowance or a 5 per cent index linked cost of living increase to that allowance.  The standard increase which insurance companies and others use is 5 per cent when inflation is below 5 per cent.  Why should councillors be discriminated against?  This House has the power to improve the pay and conditions of Members, which we do without apology, and rightly so.  We should make this modest acknowledgement of our elected representatives around the country who are giving of their service in a voluntary capacity.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Mooney for sharing his time and I support his call for a review of councillors' expenses.  As he said, there would be no need for this discussion if, like other organisations, councillors' expenses were index linked.</P>
      <P>Councillors carry out a very valuable service at enormous expense to themselves and their families. This Government &mdash; like the last Government &mdash; has given more powers to local authorities and in the context of reform of local government, now is the time to introduce this increase.  I also agree with Senator Mooney that the systems of allowances introduced three years ago should be index linked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of placing on the record of the House the Government's commitment to ensuring that councillors have a clear and equitable system of expenses and other support measures.</P>
      <P>The system of expenses for councillors which we inherited when we came into office was, basically, a good one.  Notwithstanding that, we have introduced a number of improvements as well as providing councillors with other support measures.  Last month the Minister for the Environment published <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change,</i> the most comprehensive reform programme ever, which seeks as one of its core principles to strengthen the role of councillors.</P>
      <P>It was the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, who in 1994 introduced a new and modern expenses system for councillors based on a composite annual allowance.  The allowance comprises three elements to meet general representational expenses, subsistence costs and travel expenses, based on the member's home location relative to council headquarters. The allowance is not intended to constitute a salary or remuneration which would be liable for tax, but rather to meet expenses actually incurred under these headings.  Expenses for attendance at conferences, seminars and certain other events continue to be paid on a separate <i>ad hoc</i> basis for each event.</P>
      <P>On coming into office the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Brendan Howlin, carried out an indepth review of the expenses system which at that stage had been in operation for only about a year.  The review took account of submissions received, expenditure data supplied by local authorities and all other relevant factors.  As a result a number of favourable improvements were notified to local authorities in August 1995. A key change was the automatic linkage of travel and subsistence rate alterations to those for senior officers.  This will increase subsistence rates from 1996 onwards, which will be notified to councillors shortly.  Another significant change in response to representations was a relaxation in the threshold for attendance at meetings in order to qualify for the full annual allowance.  It is, of course, a matter for councillors themselves to organise their meetings so as to maximise efficiency and effectiveness of operation.  The councillors' expenses system is but one area in which the position of councillors has been improved since we took office.  In the case of the regional authorities, an allowance for the cathaoirleach has been introduced thereby giving due recognition to the important role of this office.  The local authority associations &mdash; the General Council of County Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and the Local Authority Members' Association &mdash; now have an independent source of funding based on contributions from local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" /> In 1997 the local authorities will contribute around £450,000 under these arrangements which is, <i>inter alia</i>, used to meet the expenses of councillors for meetings of the associations and their committees.  The Minister has also arranged significant ongoing logistic and administrative support for councillors who are members of the Committee of the Regions.  Increased expenditure under the new councillors' expenses system speaks for itself.  Data derived from local authority estimates shows expenditure on councillors' expenses in respect of home and foreign travel and including allowances for cathaoirligh at around £6m for 1996, an increase of 16 per cent on 1994.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government is committed to ensuring that councillors continue to have proper recognition for their enormous contribution to the local government system and that is how it should be.  The current expenses system works well.  However, as indicated in <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change,</i> the expenses system will be adjusted where necessary in the context of the implementation of the various measures outlined in the programme.  It is in that context that I will pass on to the Minister the comments made regarding postage and telephone expenses.  The programme seeks to reposition the councillor within the local government system with the introduction of strategic policy committees supported by a programme manager, more support for councillors, better information and training, linkage with other public bodies &mdash; all moves designed to enable him or her to better fulfil the democratic mandate earned through the electoral process.</P>

      <P>I want to acknowledge the important information outlined by the Minister, the improvements that have taken place since 1994 and the reforming attitude that has been adopted by both the Minister and the Minister of State in this regard.  I am grateful that the Minister of State will convey the remarks made by Senator Burke and myself about index linking postage and travel expenses.  I am also grateful on behalf of members of LAMA that the Minister of State has acknowledged their concerns.  With regard to expenditure on foreign travel and seminars, not every councillor is afforded the opportunity, or can afford the opportunity, to travel. The system should apply across the board and not just to cathaoirligh and other people who may be able to travel.  I am grateful to the Minister of State.  Perhaps he will return with better news when the review is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am requesting the Minister for Education to approve the purchase of <Col N="1642" /> 4.75 acres of land at the rear of St. Fergal's college, Rathdowney, County Laois.</P>
      <P>The land adjoins the school's existing sports field which is totally inadequate for the 395 pupils and 27 teachers in the college.  The local councillor in Rathdowney, Councillor Mansfield, who is also a member of County Laois Vocational Education Committee, and a number of parents and teachers associated with the college contacted me to stress the importance of the purchase of this field for the college.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that the college has three hurling teams, three football teams, two camogie teams and three soccer teams.  That means there are 11 teams sharing less than 2.5 acres of land.  The school also has an excellent tennis court which is used by the people of the town throughout the summer.  In addition, the school has an excellent basketball team.  It is a school whose pupils have a great interest in sport.  I hope the Minister of State will concede the importance of agreeing to this purchase.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the students and staff on their successes to date.  The hurling teams have reached two All-Ireland senior hurling finals, the footballers have won the County Laois Vocational Education Committee championship and reached advanced stages in the national championships while the camogie teams have been most successful. Next Sunday the school's basketball team competes in the All-Ireland under-15 semi-final. It is obvious, therefore, that sport is an important part of the school's activities.</P>
      <P>The people of Rathdowney are anxious that the Minister for Education authorise the purchase of the adjoining land.  At present the 11 teams must share the existing field which is inadequate. Other students who are not on the school teams but who want to participate in sport do not have the facilities to do so.  There is insufficient room for both the teams and the other students who wish to participate in sport.  From a social point of view, it is important that there are adequate recreational facilities in the school.  The teaching staff are also anxious that the pupils remain on the school premises during recreational breaks.  If the facilities are not available the students will have to wait around the school or around the town.  In the interests of camaraderie and friendship among the pupils it is important that they remain on the school grounds.  It would also give teachers the opportunity to motivate students and involve them in sport.  An interest in sport that is generated during one's schooldays remains with one throughout one's life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, before the Minister can sanction the purchase of the land, there must be a valuation of the site by the Valuation Office.  Has the Minister contacted the Valuation Office to commission it to make the valuation?  If she has and has not received a reply, will she contact that office again and ask it to expedite the valuation? I have also asked the Minister of State to receive a deputation from County Laois Vocational Education <Col N="1643" /> Committee to allow its members to advance their case.  The Minister of State attended the opening of the extension of St. Fergal's and he was afforded the opportunity of seeing the site at first hand.  The members of County Laois Vocational Education Committee and other public representatives who were present thought he showed a great interest in the school.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will make every effort to expedite this purchase and to facilitate a meeting with the deputation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I conducted the official opening of the extension at St. Fergal's college and I have fond memories of the hospitality and friendliness of the people of Rathdowney.  I also remember the case the people made about the acquisition of the land and the need for greater facilities for the pupils and the community in the area.  I will outline the background to the situation in relation to St. Fergal's college, Rathdowney, County Laois.</P>
      <P>County Laois Vocational Education Committee requested my Department to approve the purchase of a 5.8 acre site at St. Fergal's college to enhance the playing space at the school.  The matter was considered by the Department's building unit and it was decided that, because of restrictions on the school site, the acquisition of the additional playing space was justified, on condition that the land could be obtained economically. The Valuation Office advised that a price of £30,000 was fair and reasonable for the property in question and, as a result, County Laois Vocational Education Committee was authorised to enter into negotiations for the purchase of the proposed site within the parameters suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vendor, however, was not willing to sell the property for the price offered by the Department. County Laois Vocational Education Committee subsequently requested a review of the valuation <Col N="1644" /> and was notified that the valuation remained unchanged.  The Department also indicated that, unless the land could be acquired at the price suggested by the Valuation Office, the school would have no option but to use the playing area already available.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committee has since informed the Department that the Vendor is now willing to sell 4.75 acres of the original site at a reduced price.  The post-primary building unit has recently requested the Valuation Office to provide a valuation for the 4.75 acres which County Laois Vocational Education Committee proposes to purchase.  When a valuation has been obtained, the matter will be considered further and the Department will notify the vocational education committee of its decision.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Department tomorrow morning to request the Valuation Office to expedite the procedure.  The Department accepts that, because of the restrictions on the school site, the acquisition of additional space is justified on condition that the price is in line with market values.  The principle that the school needs extra space is accepted.  It is now a question of price.  I will meet any group the Senator wishes.  The Department recognises the situation and it is a question of driving a good bargain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister look at this matter realistically?  We are talking about six acres of land at a total cost of £30,000.  I have not mentioned specific figures.  One would not get that land at that price if the intention was to build on it.  Will the Minister ask the Valuation Office to take a realistic, practical view of this? Rathdowney is a progressive town and this is not a realistic price.  I know someone who is trying to buy land in the town and the price being asked is far in excess of what this man is requesting.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 February 1997.</P>
