    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  All Stages of item 1 are to be concluded by 2 p.m. Contributions are not to exceed 20 minutes for spokespersons and 15 minutes for all other Senators.  In view of the serious situation facing the people of Clonmel I propose to take statements on Seagate between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. with item 2 to be taken at 3 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a small difficulty with the Order of Business.  It is a well established principle that the House does not have closure motions.  Item 1 must conclude by 2 p.m. It may well be concluded before then but, on principle, we will not accept that this item could be guillotined.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Leader has made time available to discuss Seagate.  It is an enormous tragedy for the people of Clonmel and surrounding areas. The Leader has responded quickly in making time available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The House recently had a detailed and serious debate on the question of refugees and asylum seekers.  However, although we requested it, we did not receive any information from the Minister on the full implementation of the Refugee Act and on questions regarding the procedures under which people are either accepted for the purposes of asylum or have this facility denied to them.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to attend the House and give full and clear details of all these matters, especially the procedures under which the status of applicants is determined?  Those who saw the series of television programmes on RTÉ this week will realise the urgency of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given you notice of a matter, Sir, which I understand you are still considering. It may be more appropriate to request the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order 29 to discuss Seagate.  The Leader has suggested we discuss it at 2 p.m. today.  However, it <Col N="186" /> should be the first matter to be discussed because there is no item on today's Order Paper which takes precedence over this as a matter of urgent national importance.</P>
      <P>This is a major blow for Clonmel.  It is also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but this is a matter of major national importance because it also affects Cork and Derry.  It should be the first matter to be discussed.  Will you, Sir, and the Leader give my motion priority over all other business today?  The Government knew about this three months ago but the workers only heard about it on the radio yesterday.  That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Leader that there will be statements on the devastating news from Seagate in Clonmel. Will the Leader urge the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to attend the debate?  The Dáil and Seanad will go into recess shortly when the momentum for remedying the situation in Clonmel could easily be lost.  Every Member would like to help the Tánaiste on this matter.  I urge the Leader to see if that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>That statements on Seagate closure be taken before item 1.</P>
      <P>This issue is engaging the minds of people throughout the country.  It is a crisis which has major implications and it is proper that the House shows its concern by taking this as the first item on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what the Leader said this morning about making time available for statements on the closure of Seagate and its effect on Clonmel and Cork.</P>
      <P>The continuing crisis in the beef industry means we should support the Minister for Agriculture and Food in his endeavours to provide intervention for 6,000 tonnes of beef by Friday. This is important particularly if these difficulties continue next year.  We will disturb the market, particularly in Russia, if we release beef from intervention at this stage.  If the Russians believe it is possible to get intervention beef they may not become involved in the Irish beef market.  It is important that the Leader raises these issues with the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my two colleagues' request under Standing Order 29 for time to be made available immediately to discuss this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise at this point.  Is the Senator seconding the amendment to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  It is important to discuss this issue which will be one of the most important in the lifetime of this Seanad.  The management and the Government knew this would happen three months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only necessary to second the amendment.  A speech is not allowed on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers want someone to speak for them, particularly as this company is not unionised.  It is scandalous that they were only told yesterday when the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the management knew about it three months ago.  Some of the managerial rats left the ship over the past three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Leader made time available to discuss the closure of Seagate. Senator Seán Ryan's remarks are inappropriate. If he wants to discuss this issue, he should wait until this afternoon.  I ask the Leader to extend the time allowed for this debate because a number of Members want to speak.  It is not just a matter for Derry, Cork and Clonmel as many people from Kilkenny, Waterford, Limerick and south Tipperary also work in Seagate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Leader's announcement that we will have a discussion on the closure of Seagate.  This is a devastating blow for the workers in my constituency of South Tipperary, many of whom I spoke to last night and this morning.  I hope the Tánaiste is present at 2 o'clock for this important debate.  She was not here last week for a Private Members' motion on another Tipperary town.  She should be here to listen to the views expressed on behalf of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure of Seagate is a blow not just for Tipperary and the surrounding area but for the country.  I am sure you, a Chathaoirligh, will make a decision about the request under Standing Order 29.  The Leader has made time available to discuss this matter, which is the way to approach it.  We should extend the debate so that any Member who wants to speak can do so.</P>
      <P>It would be desirable if the Tánaiste was here but she spent yesterday evening and this morning in Clonmel where she should be.  While we hope she is back in time for this debate, her priority is to speak to the management, the workers, IDA Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>She has done that already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the task force which has been set up to ensure that alternative employment is secured for the people of Clonmel.  We <Col N="188" /> will endeavour to ensure the Minister or someone on her behalf is here for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business.  This is an important issue which should be taken immediately after the Order of Business.  It not only has implications for the people of Clonmel, north Tipperary and the rest of Munster, but also for the social partnership. This is a clear breach of Partnership 2000 and we will see its reverberations in the future.  I urge the Leader and other Members of the House to support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not going to speak on the closure of Seagate because the Leader has made time available this afternoon, but it is imperative that Members on the other side of the House do not make cheap political statements on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an original statement; the Senator heard it on the radio this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to fully support the efforts being made to help the people in Clonmel get replacement jobs.  This type of discussion is not constructive.  Anyone who wishes to make a statement should do so this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all Members will join with me in extending our sympathy and best wishes to the young Army private and others who were injured in Kilworth Camp.</P>
      <P>I support what Senator Manning said about having guillotine motions two days after each other.  I ask the Leader to make time available between Second Stage and Committee Stage to allow amendments to be tabled.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I raised the issue of Members' facilities. I did not table an amendment to the Order of Business because of comments made by the Leader.  I was disappointed, however, that the Leader did not contact me or mention it this morning.  I and my colleagues are entitled to raise this issue.  In the Official Report, 17 September 1997, vol. 152, col. 28, the Leader said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support the request for an urgent meeting of the Committee on Procedure <Col N="189" /> and Privileges to discuss office facilities for Senators.  The Cathaoirleach is one of the convenors of that committee.  The new Senators are disappointed with the facilities available to them.  Those of us who have served for some time tend to accept them.  In comparison to office facilities in private enterprise, the facilities here are inadequate.  I will do everything in my power to ensure they are upgraded immediately.</P>
    <P>I propose to put down an amendment to the Order of Business &ldquo;That business be interrupted before item 1; that time, not exceeding one hour, be afforded to Members; and that if the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan, or someone on his behalf, attend.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I second that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I understood that this matter was ordered for today and I was asked by my group to speak on it.  This is why I did not raise it on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a point of order. The Senator has already spoken on the Order of Business.  It is a matter for the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My sympathies lie with Senator Cosgrave.  Senator Norris is whispering to me to second the motion but I presume Fine Gael is capable of seconding its own motion.  I asked my secretary to acquire a set of telephone directories for the entire country.  However, I was told that it was not the practice to make them available as they were too expensive and that we had to buy them ourselves.  It costs £6 for a set of telephone directories yet Leinster House cannot afford to supply them.  I know it can afford to do so.  Someone is playing games with Members of this House and it is time it stopped.</P>
      <P>The news from Clonmel is appalling but would someone clarify the more appalling prospect of the loss of 2,000 promised jobs in Cork?  Something stinks about this business.  I am not blaming the Government but there is something of the worst aspects of multi-nationalism about this matter. We need to take care of those who have suffered in Clonmel and to find out why this has happened.  This matter should be urgently discussed in detail.  That should be done with a degree of passion but not conflict between Government and Opposition.  This is too big an issue for a convenient row between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Leader on providing time to discuss Seagate.  I also support Senator Cosgrave's comments on the young, female member of the Defence Forces who was injured.  As Government spokesperson on Defence I record my appreciation for the Defence Forces who are serving at home and overseas and do a marvellous job in presenting a good image of Ireland as an international peace-keeping nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="190" />
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of weeks ago I asked the Leader if he would consider a debate on emigration and emigrant issues in the next session.  I reemphasise the necessity for such a debate in light of the annual report of the Irish centre in Camden Town which was published yesterday. The report states that there are an appallingly high number of homeless Irish citizens in London. Thirteen per cent of homeless people in London are Irish or of Irish descent.  The report details some of the more horrific examples of neglected Irish citizens.  One instance is of a man who died in a car park and whose skeleton was found several weeks later.  This is only one dimension of the social and economic difficulties faced by Irish emigrants who have not enjoyed success abroad.  They have not been part of the Celtic tiger's equivalent in the UK and other areas where the Irish settle.  I would be grateful if the Leader would give consideration to providing Government time for a debate on emigrant issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not on the Senator's left.  The Senator's sense of geography is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not only the Senator's sense of geography which is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for an immediate debate on Seagate.  I also support Senator Cosgrave's amendment.  This is the first time that I can remember a Leas-Cathaoirleach being forced to raise such an issue.  It should never have been allowed to reach this stage.  It should have been solved long ago and the current situation does no credit to those who run the facilities of the House. It is a difficult situation for everyone.  When looking at this issue we should also look at the Library which is terribly under-funded and under-staffed. The Library staff work extremely hard under difficult conditions.  This matter denigrates the House and the work of Members who do not have proper research facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Cosgrave's remarks and register our strongest protest at the undue delay.  I am reluctant to raise the other matters which I have been pursuing as I presume the Leader still has nothing to say to me. However, the Leader has easy access to Government. Perhaps he would revise the timescale for replying to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Senators raised the issue of Seagate and called for a debate on the matter.  I propose an open ended debate with eight minutes for each Senator if the House is agreeable.  As a result, statements on social housing will start at the conclusion of statements on Seagate which will start at 2 p.m. The Tánaiste is in Clonmel <Col N="191" /> today.  We will do everything possible to see if she can attend the debate.  However, the Dáil is also taking statements on Seagate.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised concerns about refugees and I will come back to him on this issue tomorrow morning.  Some Senators supported Senator Cosgrave's comments.  The matter is at an advanced stage.  The Senator has taken this action and he is a respected Member of the House and a constitutional office holder.  This makes the matter more serious.  Senator Cosgrave is facing a new secretarial problem.  When you were in that position, A Chathaoirligh, Fianna Fáil had to supply you with a secretary.  This is a new departure. As the former Leader, Senator Manning will know, new systems experience difficulties when being implemented.  I am confident that the secretarial problem faced by Fine Gael will be addressed.  It is 90 per cent solved this morning. If another Opposition party handed back its offices and accepted the electorates decision, Fine Gael's office problem would be addressed in five minutes.  I have made every possible inquiry and request of a diplomatic nature but there are only a certain number of offices available in the House.  Therefore, Members will have to accept the current position.</P>
      <P>I make a final request to Senator Cosgrave to withdraw his amendment.  At the conclusion of the Order of Business I propose to have a final meeting of the Leaders of the various groups in respect of this matter.  If agreement cannot be reached among the Leaders, what chance do I have of obtaining authorisation for secretarial facilities from the Department of Finance?  I am confident that I will obtain such authorisation today, but offices will have to be provided for the secretaries to begin work on Monday morning.  As Leader of the House, I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to agree to today's Order of Business.  If his requests are not met, he can raise his grievance tomorrow morning and, in addition to pointing the finger at the Leader of the House, he can point it elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader explain why the <Col N="192" /> requested debate will not take place following the Order of Business?  We were given a commitment on this matter yesterday.  The representative of the Independent Members cannot attend the meeting proposed by the Leader.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with two important issues relating to the courts.  First, it provides for an increase in the statutory limit on the number of ordinary judges of the High Court from 22 to 24, not including the President of the High Court.  Second, it provides that all future appointments of Chief Justice, President of the High Court, President of the Circuit Court and President of the District Court will be for a maximum, non-renewable period of seven years.</P>
      <P>I will deal first with the increase in the number of High Court judges.  Earlier this year the House was involved in the enactment of the Courts Act, 1997.  That increased from 19 to 22 the statutory limit on the number of ordinary judges of the High Court.  It was brought forward in the context of pressure on the number of judges in the court due to commitments arising from non-court duties involving the Nursing Commission and the then pending Dunnes tribunal.  The Act was welcomed by this House because its objective was to ensure the progress made in reducing delays in hearing criminal and civil cases before the High Court was not adversely affected by the temporary appointment of High Court judges to carry out other duties.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that the work of the Nursing Commission is ongoing and that further tribunals are being established.  Because of the involvement of High Court judges in the proposed tribunals, these developments threaten the considerable progress made in reducing delays, particularly in hearing personal injury actions in the High Court and in dealing with cases in the Central Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>Senators will agree that litigants, victims of crime and the community as a whole, which has an interest in the efficient operation of the courts system, should not be adversely affected by the developments to which I have referred.  That is one of the main reasons I have brought forward this Bill which, in section 2, provides for an increase in the statutory maximum limit on the number of judges of the High Court from 22 to 24, in addition to the President of the High Court. The Government has approved the filling of one of these new vacancies immediately and the need for the filling of the second High Court vacancy created by the Bill will be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 amends the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, to make provision for an increase by one in the number of judges in the Supreme Court or the High Court where one of the judges of those courts is appointed to the position of Commissioner in the Law Reform Commission. This is essentially a technical matter and all that is involved is a tidying up of earlier amendments <Col N="197" /> which have been made to the 1975 Act.  The second overall objective of the Bill is to provide that all future appointments as Chief Justice or as President of the other courts &mdash; who are described as presiding judges in the context of the Bill &mdash; will be for a maximum, non-renewable, seven year period.  This was recommended by the working group on a courts commission chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham in its second report entitled <i>Case Management and Court Management.</i> The relevant provisions of the Bill for that purpose are sections 4 to 12.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the working group in relation to seven year court presidencies was made with reference to the extremely heavy administrative workload that is involved in these key judicial positions, which must be managed along with the normal judicial functions of those positions.  For my part I think this is a sensible approach and it also reflects the modern trend with regard to limiting the term of senior office in areas of professional and public life.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is the central provision with regard to the new maximum periods of appointment for presiding judges and subsequent sections are consequential on that section.  There are a number of significant aspects resulting from the provision for new periods of appointment for presiding judges.  First, only appointments made after the enactment of these measures will be affected. Second, the Bill does not preclude the appointment as presiding judge of a person who has less than seven years to serve before full retirement as a judge.  Third, an appointment as a presiding judge will not be capable of being renewed at the end of the seven year period although the Bill does not preclude a further appointment as presiding judge of another court.  Fourth, when a presiding judge has completed the seven year term and has not reached retirement age he or she will continue to serve as a judge of the relevant court.</P>
    <P>This last element of section 4 gives rise to the need for the directly consequential provisions of sections 5 and 6.  When, for example, a Chief Justice completes his or her seven year term and then continues as a judge of the Supreme Court, the maximum number of judges of that court will be unaffected where another judge of the Supreme Court is appointed as the new Chief Justice. If, however, the new Chief Justice were to be appointed from outside the Supreme Court, the former Chief Justice continuing to serve as a judge of that court would breach the statutory limit on the number of judges of the Supreme Court.  Section 5 takes account of this by providing for an increase in the number of judges attached to a particular court in such circumstances, notwithstanding the statutory provisions relating to the limitation on numbers of judges of the courts.</P>
    <P>However, section 6 makes it clear that this increase in the maximum number of judges will be temporary or will not occur at all depending on the position in the relevant court with regard to vacancies.  Again taking the Supreme Court as <Col N="198" /> an example, where there is already an existing vacancy, the former Chief Justice will automatically fill that vacancy and the provisions of section 5 increasing the number of judges will not apply in that case.  Where there is no immediate vacancy the number of judges in the Supreme Court will be increased by one temporarily until the next vacancy arises and it will be filled automatically by the former Chief Justice.  Section 6 applies this provision for the filling of vacancies by former presiding judges to each of the courts. The new seven year terms may give rise to the presence on a court bench of more than one former presiding judge.  The provisions relating to increases in numbers of judges and the filling of vacancies take full account of that possibility.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill adapts existing provisions whereby the Chief Justice is <i>ex officio</i> a judge of the High Court and the other presidents are <i>ex officio</i> judges of the next superior court.  The section provides that when a presiding judge has completed a seven year term and continues as a judge of the relevant court, he or she will retain his or her position as <i>ex officio</i> judge until retirement. This is being done to ensure that no constitutional problem will arise out of the removal of judicial duties conferred by virtue of <i>ex officio</i> membership of a court.</P>
    <P>Article 35.5 of the Constitution prohibits the reduction of the remuneration of a judge during his or her continuance in office.  Accordingly, I have provided in section 8 that a former presiding judge will continue to be paid the salary payable to the presiding judge and that pensions and other entitlements will be paid at the higher judicial rate.</P>
    <P>Section 9 adapts existing provisions relating to the order of the precedence of judges of the Supreme and High Courts to take account of the position of former presiding judges.  A former Chief Justice will have precedence after the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court but before the ordinary members of the Supreme Court.  A former President of the High Court will have precedence after the President of the High Court and after the judges of the Supreme Court but before the ordinary judges of the High Court. A former President of the Circuit Court, who will be <i>ex officio</i> a judge of the High Court, will rank after the President of the Circuit Court but before the ordinary judges of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that only a presiding judge will be capable of exercising a statutory function of a Chief Justice or president of the court.  Any such statutory function will not continue to be exercisable by a former Chief Justice or president who continues to serve as a judge.  This provision has been included for the avoidance of any doubt in the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 11 takes account of various existing provisions conferring functions on the &ldquo;senior ordinary judge&rdquo; of the Supreme Court or High Court.  For example, legislation provides that the Chief Justice or, in his or her absence, the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court may determine <Col N="199" /> that an appeal before the Supreme Court may be heard by a division of five or three judges. Section 11 makes it clear that a former Chief Justice or a President of the High Court who continues to serve as a judge of the Supreme Court or High Court respectively will be the &ldquo;senior ordinary judge&rdquo; by virtue of his or her ranking ahead of the other judges of the Court under the provisions of section 9.</P>
    <P>Under the Courts Acts, the President of the District Court is permanently assigned by the Government to the Dublin metropolitan district. Section 12 provides that a former President of the District Court who continues to serve as a judge of the District Court will continue to be permanently assigned to the DMD but will also be in a position to avail of the normal transfer arrangements for District Court judges.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will appreciate that the provisions of this Bill are important in the context of the move towards a more modern courts system which is very clearly signalled by the Courts Service (No. 2) Bill, considered on Second Stage in this House yesterday.  As I have already said in this House, the establishment under that Bill of an independent Courts Service to manage the courts system more efficiently is a key priority for the Government.  I believe the public are entitled to expect an efficient quality service from the Courts and the Bill we are discussing here today will contribute in a significant way to the ongoing programme of reform of our courts system.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I had a script from the Minister, otherwise I might have found it difficult to keep up with the breakneck speed at which he delivered his speech.  We can welcome this Bill without difficulty and the Minister has clearly explained its implications.  The immediate reason for the Bill is that judges increasingly find themselves on tribunal duty and we have been well served in recent times by those judges who have acted as sole members of a tribunal.  It is a tribute to them that they are automatic choices when further tribunals take place.  Let us hope, nonetheless, that we do not have many more tribunals in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>The immediate occasion of the Bill is the retirement of Mr. Justice Declan Costello as President of the High Court, to whom I pay tribute.  There is a frequent interchange between the law and politics, examples of which include the Minister, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Government spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; I feel surrounded by lawyers.  Mr. Justice Costello had the distinction of serving as a TD for many years and Attorney General before going on to serve as a distinguished judge.  On a personal level, my involvement in politics stems from being inspired by him when I was a student in the 1960s.  I pay tribute to his great legacy in politics and as a judge and I wish him many happy and fulfilled years of retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> There can be no objection to increasing the number of judges.  However, is the Minister satisfied that the increased number is adequate to the needs of the courts system?  The number of judges increased dramatically during the lifetime of the last Government because of a definite need &mdash; the courts system was breaking down.  Perhaps in his reply the Minister could indicate whether, given recent changes, he feels the present number of judges is adequate to the provision of reasonably speedy, effective and accessible justice, which is, as he said, one of the principal concerns of his reforms.  Further to ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of the courts we would have no objection if the Minister felt further appointments were needed.</P>
    <P>The seven year appointments for the Presidents of the High and Supreme Courts bring procedures into line with those in universities and most companies.  The Members of the Oireachtas do not have the guarantee of a seven year term of office and I am sure the Minister would not presume to think that he will have a seven year term of office.  The Bill extends this term to judges.  My concern is that the filling of posts, which is an intensively political activity, will give rise to a great deal of lobbying two or three years in advance of a presidential appointment. However, I suspect that happens at present and is inevitable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish the Minister well in its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I praise his initiation of four Bills here this week &mdash; as somebody said, it is a record and given that the Minister is suffering from the 'flu and must attend the other House from time to time, it is a courageous indication of his ambition to have a comprehensive and wide-ranging reform of legislation.  This is the ninth or tenth Bill which he has presented in his short term as Minister and he is threatening us with another 20 or more next year.  That is an indication of his approach to law and order and the administration of justice.  I welcome this initiative and praise him for it.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Manning in paying tribute to Mr. Justice Costello who was a former Attorney General, an eminent lawyer and a former Member of the Oireachtas.  He has given a lifetime of public service and I wish him well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Justice Costello was one of the most, if not the most, eminent lawyers and jurists of his generation.  He was internationally renowned and highly respected.  I understand he is a former President of the High Court and held other significant positions with great distinction and honour.  I am glad to join Senator Manning in paying tribute to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I understand the need <Col N="201" /> for the appointment of two extra judges.  This has to do with the secondment of judges to tribunals of inquiry and the appointment of a judge to the Nursing Commission.  It is good that at short notice we can produce legislation to increase the number of judges from 22 to 24 when there is a need to do so.  As a practising lawyer I am aware of the great increase in the number of civil cases in the High Court in the last decade.  Due to the fact that the maximum award which can be made in the Circuit Court is £30,000, which is not a large amount, the volume of business coming to the High Court is increasing annually.  As a consequence there is a greater workload for judges there in civil matters.  In addition, the work of the Central Criminal Court must not be impeded by a shortage of judges in the higher courts.  There would be no point in the Minister or his predecessor introducing or having introduced legislation to combat crime &mdash; drug related crime in particular &mdash; if there were delays in the courts due to a lack of judges.</P>
    <P>Is it sufficient to increase the number of High Court judges from 22 to 24?  I have a particular interest in civil cases and I believe there should be a High Court judge based permanently in Munster to cover the High Court cases in Cork, Tralee and Limerick.  A similar situation may pertain in the west to include Athlone, Galway and Donegal.</P>
    <P>There is a continuing practical problem whereby it is necessary to bring frequently unwilling expert witnesses, such as neurosurgeons and consultant orthopaedic surgeons, to Dublin where everything happens.  On up to four occasions in recent years there have been sittings of the High Court in Cork for two weeks with two judges hearing cases.  However, this is not sufficient.  There are no economic or administrative reasons that there is no judge covering the Munster circuits, particularly Cork, Tralee and Limerick, and possibly Tipperary and Waterford.  Such provision would make good administrative sense.  I realise it is the function of the President of the High Court to attend to this matter, but I urge the Minister to address it in setting up of the new Courts Service which should come into force next year.  I am not being parochial, I foresee a similar situation in the west.</P>
    <P>It is significantly more costly when a case goes on for up to ten days in the Four Courts resulting in experts, including lawyers and barristers, plaintiffs, defendants and witnesses, such as engineers, coming to Dublin from west Cork, west Kerry or Donegal for the administration of justice.  It is inappropriate and improper and I hope it can be addressed.  Apart from August and usual holidays, there is no reason a High Court judge could not sit for four days a week in Munster, rotating between Cork, Tralee, Limerick and possibly Waterford, or in the west, rotating between Galway, Roscommon, Athlone and Donegal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> As secretary of the West Cork Bar Association and in my role as a lawyer, I could never fathom the logic why everything has to happen in Dublin. Unfortunately, the Four Courts is suffering from gridlock and a lack of facilities.  Tallaght, with a population almost similar in size to Cork city, does not have a Circuit Court or regular sittings. We must examine why everything revolves around the Four Courts while the rest of Ireland is forced to play second fiddle to the capital.  Most speakers in yesterday's debate realised the extent of overloading in terms of people, courts and functions that is evident in the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>High Court judges are being appointed to positions on the nursing commission and the various tribunals.  I understand that further tribunals are to be established.  Over the last two decades tribunals have become a regular feature of our justice and administration systems.  One of the first tribunals I recall and in which I was involved as an apprentice solicitor was the Whiddy tribunal which examined the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster.  We have also had the Stardust tribunal.  Both tribunals were set up as a result of huge losses of life.  Tribunals are becoming the order of the day to examine civil issues, including fraud and white collar crime.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised that a permanent High Court judge may be appointed to the Law Reform Commission.  I pay tribute to the work of the commission and the huge amount of research being done outside the Oireachtas.  Often much of the work and many of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, under the chairmanship of such eminent people as Judge Denham, are by and large taken on board in legislation introduced in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commission carries out much research and good work in an independent and non-political manner.  We must never forget the huge volume of work and the huge contribution the Law Reform Commission makes to the enactment of new legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides a new maximum period of seven years for the appointment of presiding judges.  This is a welcome provision.  Those in political life have no security of tenure and do not know how long they will be a Member of either House.  Seven years is a sufficient period of tenure for Presidents of the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  It also provides that those who have given lifelong service in any of the courts but who will retire within seven years can still be appointed president.  Generally, presidents of courts have given long service and it is rare for somebody with only short service to be appointed president. This provision is to be welcomed as the position of president involves significant pressure.</P>
    <P>Is it logical or possible to have one president based in Dublin dealing with the huge number of District Court judges operating throughout the country?  Perhaps the Minister will address this issue in his reply.  Does the President of the District Court require a vice-president to assist in the <Col N="203" /> functions of the court?  Due to the nature of the work of the District Court it has more judges than other courts.  This is not to take from the huge importance of the work of the Presidents of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of the Bill deal with financial issues, ensuring no reduction in salary for a president of a court following completion of seven years.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and I am glad it has been welcomed by Fine Gael.  I understand the argument put forward by Senator Manning and others that one should not rush legislation through the House on the same day or even in the same week. However, the important nature of this legislation, which is an enabling measure rather than a complete overhaul of the administration of justice, and the fact that its provisions have been recommended to us, marks this Bill out as an exception. Members must be magnanimous in accepting from time to time that we must work together when a Minister lays such enabling legislation of the importance of this Bill before the House.  We may not desire a time constraint but this Bill has been broadly welcomed.</P>
    <P>I compliment my Opposition colleagues for their patience and courtesy in dealing with the Bill in an efficient and speedy fashion.  I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill and I hope it will have a speedy passage.  I commend it to the House as significant and important legislation which will ensure the workings of the courts are not clogged up.  Two extra judges will be appointed for good reasons.</P>

      <P>I also commend the Bill and I am delighted about the sense of urgency the Minister has attached to it.  He has continued the work of the previous Minister in addressing the problems which have arisen in the courts due a great increase in their workload which was not matched by a similar increase in the number of judges and back up facilities.  It is incredible that only five years ago Supreme Court judges did not have adequate secretarial assistance.  The Bill provides money for an increased number of registrars and ushers for new High Court judges who will be appointed.  However, I hope good secretarial back up services will be part of this financial package.</P>
      <P>It is a compliment to the Judiciary that the public has such confidence in it and want judges to chair tribunals and public bodies established to investigate various problems which have arisen. The Houses of the Oireachtas have a duty to respond to this confidence by ensuring there is a sufficient number of members of the Judiciary available for the continuation of work in the courts and tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> I am concerned that the retiring age of District Court judges, an aspect I have raised on several occasions, has not been addressed to date.  District Court judges must be assessed on a yearly basis after they reach the age of 65.  These judges work at the coal face of justice in society and they must undergo assessments of their capability to remain on the Bench between the ages of 65 and 70.  However, the mental capacity of other judges, such as members of the Supreme Court, is not queried.  I am told the purpose of the yearly assessments is to ensure that judges retire at the same time.  However, this is not a good reason for continually inspecting District Court judges until they retire at the age of 70.  I ask the Minister to address this matter in another Courts Bill which he will probably introduce in the near future.</P>
    <P>There is much sense in Senator O'Donovan's suggestion regarding a geographical spread.  It is arcane that a huge number of matters are dealt with in Dublin when much of this work could be carried out by more regular sittings of the High Court in other cities.  I doubt legislation is required to change this position.  This system could be reorganised by the new Courts Service.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I ask the Minister to address the issue of the retirement age of District Court judges.  The assessment of these judges provides work for many of my medical colleagues, but I am sure they would willingly give it up if the judges could continue in employment on the same basis as judges of the Circuit, High and Supreme Courts.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing her time.  The Labour Party supports the Bill, which continues the reform of the courts system initiated by the previous Government.  I commend the work of Mrs. Justice Denham and her colleagues in examining the system from a professional perspective and making recommendations. I am glad the Minister is acting speedily on those proposals in this Bill and the Courts Service legislation.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states in relation to the financial implications of the Bill:</P>
      <P>The filling of one of the High Court vacancies that will arise out of the enactment of the Bill and the appointment of a Registrar and usher in respect of that additional judicial appointment will give rise to an annual salary cost of £121,750 per annum.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum continues:</P>
      <P>Because of the unpredictability and the temporary nature of the additional judicial posts which will arise due to the creation of 7 year Court Presidencies, the financial and staffing implications of the relevant proposals cannot be predicted with any precision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for some indicative figures on this matter.  I am sure the Department has made projections on various scenarios and I would like information on the possible outcomes.  I will deal <Col N="205" /> in detail on Committee Stage with the limitation of seven years on the term of court presidencies. This is not a life or death issue, although I am aware it was a recommendation of the working group chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham.</P>
    <P>The Bill continues the much needed reform of the court system initiated by the previous Government.  Any improvement in services requires a substantial commitment of resources. Three areas must continue to be addressed urgently with expansive resources to ensure that the requirements of the public, who pay for and use the courts, are dealt with speedily, efficiently and satisfactorily.  The appointment of extra judges in various courts is having the desired effect in terms of speeding up the hearing of cases and trials.  Some lawyers in the Dublin area now complain that one must be careful when one issues proceedings because the case might be heard in court sooner than one expected.  This is a good complaint because it is not long since people complained about the number of years it took for cases to be heard.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address two areas which are important for clients.  The first is access to the legal aid service.  Under the stewardship of the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, in the previous two Governments, there was a major increase in the number of legal aid offices throughout the country.  In my constituency offices were provided in Portlaoise and Tullamore and they are doing excellent work.  However, as the report of the Legal Aid Board shows, the demands on those offices are huge, and increasing in the family law area.  Members of the public who make inquiries and ask for advice in offices about taking proceedings are told family law cases take precedence. A substantial extra commitment of resources is required.</P>
    <P>I note the increase of 14 per cent under subhead K in the Estimates, but this only reflects, on a full year basis, the financial cost of the measures put in place by the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor.  I ask the Minister to ensure as a first step that law centres which have only one solicitor at present get a second lawyer.  The centres were led to expect this would happen quickly.  This would reduce waiting lists and ensure people get the service they require.  The law centres have built up a good reputation in recent years.  Prior to the expansion of the service under former Minister Mervyn Taylor, they were not held in high esteem because people had to wait so long and travel so far for appointments.  Their image improved tremendously in terms of access and speed, but this confidence will be lost unless second solicitors are appointed in each full-time centre and part-time centres upgraded to full-time status.  I ask the Minister to respond to this request as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>The second area is the vexed issue of courthouse facilities.  I am glad to note an increase in the capital Estimate for this area.  However, the amount provided is not enough, given the cost of work on courthouses.  The Minister for Finance <Col N="206" /> should supply more funding to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with this matter.  Senator Moylan and I are members of Offaly County Council and work in a building that serves as a courthouse, which happens all over the country.  The lack of court facilities is embarrassing for clients of the legal system, public representatives and county council staff.  This is particularly true on family court days, because consultation takes place in the corridors and there is no privacy.  That is not how a civilised society which has updated its family law recently should operate.  More money should be spent on the courthouses, especially on consulting facilities. The privacy of <i>in camera</i> family law cases should be observed in practice within the court building.</P>
    <P>The District Court clerks and their assistants are doing excellent work.  Recent legislation has increased their workload; there is the small claims court and they must process family law procedures. Their facilities need to be upgraded to cope with that increased workload.  Many of them operate unofficially as legal advice centres, and that must be recognised officially.  I am not arguing for a blurring of the distinction between the law centres and the District Court clerks, but if the clerks are advising people of their legal rights it should be recognised.  The service they are providing could be improved if specific training courses were made available to them, and the public would also benefit from this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, although I will return to one matter on Committee Stage.  The Minister should ensure that the quality of and access to our court services should be improved.  Cases will be held more speedily because of the provision of extra judges, but the quality of court facilities must be addressed.  I refer particularly to privacy for family law cases.  Full-time law centres should get a second solicitor, and part-time centres should be upgraded to full-time status.  The workload of District Court clerks must be recognised, and greater resources and training should be provided for them.  They are doing excellent work, though their names will never be in the newspapers because of High Court cases.  Their fine work must be recognised.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  Senator O'Donovan referred to judges being based outside Dublin for High Court sittings.  I understand his sentiments, but the regionalisation of the High Court is a matter for the President of the High Court.  The incoming President will take the views of the House into account.  Neither I nor the Government have any say in where courts should or should not sit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Manning and O'Donovan both referred to the imminent retirement of Mr. Justice Declan Costello, the President of the High Court.  I join with them in praising his role in Irish life.  He has had a very distinguished career in politics and the Judiciary, though it is as a member <Col N="207" /> of the latter that he will perhaps be best remembered.  He made an enormous contribution to jurisprudence in the State and is one of the finest jurists of his generation, blessed as he is with one of the finest and clearest legal minds the State has ever had.  I wish him every happiness in his well deserved retirement and I hope that he will continue to contribute to public life by writing and lecturing.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the retirement age for District Court judges.  The Courts Act, 1949, provides that a committee comprising the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General can extend District Court judges' terms in office from the ages of 65 to 70 by annual extensions.  I will consider the issue of District Court judges' retirement ages in the context of forthcoming legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher referred to access to legal aid.  We have made provision in the 1998 Estimates for increased funding for the legal aid service. This is to recognise the dramatic increase in business at legal aid centres because of the considerable <i>corpus</i> of family law legislation introduced recently.  I fully accept that some courthouses are in an unacceptable state, and the Vote for courthouses has increased considerably in the 1998 Estimates.  I hope to see further refurbishment and improvements to our courthouses in 1998.  The increased Vote for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a 10 per cent increase on last year.  This is unprecedented and reflects the importance the Government attaches to the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>There is now a facility to increase the number of High Court judges from 22 to 24.  I am glad Senators agree this is welcome.  There has also been a general welcome for confining the periods of office of the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the other courts to seven years.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 7, to delete &ldquo;24&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;25&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory.  What, if any, research or surveys were done before it was decided to have an extra two judges?  The tabling of the amendment was partly prompted by what Senator O'Donovan said about the need for High Court judges in Munster.  Why was it decided to have an extra two judges rather than an extra three or four?</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to delete &ldquo;24&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;25&rdquo;. Section 2 increases the number of judges of the High Court, other than the President of the High Court, from 22 to 24.  The Government has approved the appointment of one of these additional judges.  I propose to hold vacant the second additional High Court position having regard to the progress of non Court work &mdash; for example, tribunals being conducted by High Court judges.</P>
      <P>Given the considerable improvement in the position in the High Court, especially with regard to the hearing of personal injuries actions and criminal cases, I am satisfied that increasing the statutory limit on the number of judges of the High Court by three, which Senator Cosgrave proposes, is not warranted.  I assure the Senator that I am anxious that there should be no adverse impact on the progress made in the High Court and I am satisfied that the Bill enables me to make the necessary provision in view of the two upcoming tribunals.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that there would have been a considerable, indeed almost an intolerable, amount of pressure on the High Court were it not for this legislation.  It is certain that at least one additional High Court judge is required.  The Government will fill one vacancy.  The other vacancy, which the Government will be empowered to fill under this legislation, will be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The High Court has made considerable progress in recent years with regard to the hearing of cases.  Delays have been cut.  It is the Government's objective to ensure that this momentum is maintained.  In this regard I assure the House that if the appointment of the second judge provided for under the legislation is warranted, the <Col N="209" /> Government will take immediate steps to fill that vacancy.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the question of the tribunals, in which judges have been involved full-time in the past.  The Moriarty and Flood tribunals will sit after Christmas.  Is the Minister satisfied that court sittings will not be unduly affected by these developments?</P>
      <P>Problems arise with the centralisation of courts. For example, a number of the buildings in the Four Courts are not conducive to some of the work undertaken by the courts which sit there, especially where lengthy sittings are involved. There is a case to be made for locating courts in other areas, such as Cork and Galway.</P>

      <P>I understand the purpose of the amendment.  However, the number of judges in the High Court will be increased to 24.  There is an immediate requirement for one extra judge. This is being met by this legislation, which also provides for a second additional appointment if that becomes necessary.</P>
      <P>Judges move in circuit, for example, from Cork to Tralee, Limerick, Waterford and other towns, and the Presidents of the various courts decide where they will sit.  However, a permanent High Court judge should sit in the south and possibly the west.  In the meantime, the Minister's reply should be acknowledged.  We should also acknowledge that five additional judges will be appointed within the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>Senator Cosgrave wonders whether court sittings involving ordinary work will not be unduly affected.  The purpose of this legislation is to address that.  The Senator is also concerned about the impact of further tribunals to which judges have been assigned.  This was a major consideration in the framing of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Government is anxious that the progress made by the courts with regard to eliminating delays should not be stopped or stymied.  Accordingly, this Bill makes provision for the appointment of two additional High Court judges.  It is believed that one of these judges is required immediately to ensure that the momentum of the High Court is not stopped.  The legislation provides for the appointment of a second judge.  I assure the House that I will make such an appointment if, as a result of unforeseen factors, it is required.</P>

    <P>in page 5, subsection (1), lines 3 to 5, to delete &ldquo;, and, in a case to which paragraph (a) <Col N="210" /> relates, shall not be eligible for re-appointment as presiding judge of that Court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 4 gives effect to the recommendation of Mrs. Justice Denham's working group that the term of office for the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the other courts should be limited to seven years and should be non-renewable.</P>
    <P>Should there be an absolute ban on the re-appointment to presidency?  I am aware of the very heavy workload which faces the President of any court.  The provision is also in line with changes that have been made in other areas of public service.  I understand that Secretaries of Departments are now appointed for seven year terms, as are county managers, although there is no absolute bar on re-appointment in such cases.</P>
    <P>It is good to have turnover, new blood and new vision.  However, is it necessary to exclude the possibility of re-appointment, especially in cases where a President of a court may have done a very good job in presiding over the courts service and where he or she is willing to carry on for a further term of office?  Should it be the case that the law prevents that happening in any circumstance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Gallagher for his contribution.  The effect of the amendment would be to allow for the reappointment of a presiding judge who has completed a seven year term of appointment under this Bill.  I mentioned in my speech that a key feature in moving to a seven year non-renewable term was to take account of the heavy administrative burden attaching to these judicial positions.  The modern approach to terms of office and senior positions in public life is that they should be for specific and limited periods. This approach is reflected in the Bill in relation to court presidencies.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, the introduction of seven year court presidencies gives effect to a recommendation made by the working group on the courts commission which was chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham.  The working group examined the situation and concluded that in view of the heavy administrative workload that falls to be dealt with by court presidents, appointments to those senior judicial positions should be for a maximum non-renewable term of seven years.  I share the working group's view in this matter.  As the effect of the Senator's amendment would be to overturn that approach and make sections 4 to 12 of the Bill superfluous, I regret I cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the seven year term has been completed, the <i>ex officio</i> membership of the head of a higher court will not be terminated because to do so would interfere with the Judiciary by demoting a judge and would almost certainly be unconstitutional. The continuity of the judge concerned is maintained by him or her maintaining the <i>ex officio</i> status of membership of the court immediately above the court of which he or she is head. The seven year rule is desirable.  Senator Gallagher <Col N="211" /> referred to the heavy workload involved in heading up a court, which takes its toll.</P>
    <P>The new arrangement will be beneficial for the Judiciary.  While I accept it will mean that a good person will retire after seven years, this will be compensated for by the fact that a new and different approach will be adopted as a result of the change of presidency or in the office of Chief Justice. Just as life changes, courts also require change to keep pace with society.  These solid measures will benefit our courts service.  When the Courts Service (No. 2) Bill, 1997, is passed, the administration of the courts will be given to a new Courts Service.  It is appropriate that the Courts Service will be accompanied by fixed terms for those who are in charge of our courts.</P>

Judges often have difficulty getting things done as a result of heavy workloads.  Senator Gallagher mentioned District Court clerks.  They and many other people work hard providing backup in the courts.</P>
      <P>I only want what the courts system is entitled to and what should be applicable to any semiState body or the Houses of the Oireachtas. Senator O'Donovan and his colleague from Dingle have been in the firing line of recent disagreements between both sides of the House.  This is unfortunate, given the good relationship with Senator Tom Fitzgerald in the previous Seanad.  I ask the Minister to ensure that adequate secretarial staff is provided for the courts to do whatever job needs to be done.</P>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me latitude on this important amendment which is relevant to the matters we discussed yesterday, particularly the transitional period for the new Courts Service.  I ask the Minister to respond positively.</P>

Perhaps this amendment is more appropriate to the Houses of the Oireachtas than to the courts.

      <P>I appreciate the background to this amendment.  While I fully support the concept of ensuring that High Court judges have appropriate secretarial facilities, this is not a matter which requires specific provision in the Bill. When an additional judge is appointed the necessary support and back up services are automatically made available.  There is no need to provide for such matters in the Bill.  It would be strange if such a provision was made in legislation only in respect of judges appointed under this Bill, in other words, that there would be provision in this Bill for secretarial staff and no provision in other legislation for other members of the High Court. Most people would agree that this would be inappropriate. In any event, the staff are provided.  In these circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I stated on the Order of Business, there will be eight minutes per speaker.  The debate will be open ended and will conclude with the final speaker.  On behalf of the House I thank the Tánaiste for making a special effort to travel directly from Clonmel to be here by 2.30 p.m. I welcome her to the House.  The Tánaiste began her political career in Seanad Éireann and we are extremely proud of her achievements.  Long may they continue.</P>

      <P>: I thank the Leader for his kind remarks.  I wish to express my appreciation to the House for delaying the debate <Col N="213" /> for 30 minutes to facilitate my return from Clonmel. I extend my sympathy to the Seagate workers, their families and the people of Clonmel and the surrounding area.  The news they heard last night was devastating for all of them.</P>
      <P>Seagate came to Ireland in late 1995 following the previous Government's approval in June of that year of the project for the manufacture in Clonmel of hard disk drives.  Including working capital, the company was to invest just over £82 million.  This was a major investment and grant aid of £17 million was approved.  The company has received, by way of employment grant aid, slightly in excess of £11 million.  It was to employ 1,400 people by the year 2000.  It began production in late 1995 and quickly achieved its employment target.  The company currently employs over 1,100 full-time and in excess of 300 temporary workers in Clonmel.</P>
      <P>Shortly after I assumed office in August, I travelled to the United States on an industrial promotion trip with the IDA.  As part of that trip I visited the headquarters of Seagate for two reasons.  First, it is customary for new Ministers to visit client companies located in Ireland and introduce themselves.  Second, because there had been approval for a new investment project worth £148 million at Ringaskiddy, County Cork, which would create over 1,000 jobs by 1999, I wanted to discuss the progress of this project with representatives of Seagate.</P>
      <P>The meeting in question, which took place on 27 or 28 August, was attended by senior executives of Seagate and I was accompanied by the chief executive of the IDA and the Secretary General of my Department, Mr. Paul Haran.  The meeting was upbeat and positive and the representatives of Seagate informed me of the company's wonderful experience in Clonmel, complimented the workforce and informed me that rapid progress was being made in respect of the Cork project and that the planning process was well underway.  The representatives also complimented the various Irish consultants they had hired for their expertise and the speed with which they were prepared to provide assistance.  I left the meeting in a very positive frame of mind.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of October I was informed, through the IDA, that Seagate proposed to make an announcement that it was going to postpone the Cork project for six months.  The company informed us that this was not unusual &mdash; it has happened before with other major investors &mdash; and it was due to changed market circumstances. Because the investment in Cork was so great &mdash; £148 million &mdash; the company was clearly not going to bring a facility on stream until the products it manufactured were needed in the marketplace. I was informed that the construction on the facility would begin shortly before the products were required.  I was disappointed with this news but accepted the company's assurances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of days later the IDA was informed that the company intended to carry out a review of its operation worldwide.  As part of that review <Col N="214" /> process, the Clonmel plant would come under scrutiny.  When I heard that news on 3 October I telephoned the company's senior vice president, Bill Watkins, who has responsibility for this area. It took some time to contact him because he was travelling in the Far East.  I spoke with him on the following Friday afternoon and he informed me that all of the company's operations were being re-evaluated and reviewed in view of changed market circumstances.  He said that the market for the hard disk drives manufactured in Clonmel had become stagnant, that Seagate had a declining share in that market and that some products cost less to produce in the Far East so the company had to re-evaluate and retrench its operations.</P>
    <P>I asked Mr. Watkins if he would meet with senior executives of the IDA so that we could be involved in the re-evaluation process and he agreed to do so.  Martin Cronin, the second highest officer in the IDA, travelled to the United States with other executives that weekend and met representatives of the company on Monday, 6 October.  Mr. Cronin received assurances that the IDA would be fully consulted in respect of the review and re-evaluation.  That consultation subsequently took place.</P>
    <P>I made arrangements to travel to the United States on 26 October to meet senior executives of Seagate.  I met them on 27 October at the company's Californian headquarters where I was informed that the review involved two matters as far as Clonmel was concerned.  First, the company was considering upgrading the Clonmel facility and investing more money in it so that an upgraded, viable product could be manufactured there.  Second, there was a possibility that the workforce at the plant would be reduced by something in the region of 750 following the introduction of automation which would make the product more viable.  I emphasised the importance of upgrading rather than downgrading the plant.  I assured the company that there would be IDA support if it was decided to make a further investment in Clonmel with a view to producing a more upgraded and viable product.  I was informed that the review would be carried out in subsequent weeks and that representatives of the company would visit Ireland as part of it. That visit took place on 5 to 6 November because the representatives wanted to meet with the management in Clonmel to discuss the various options.</P>
    <P>Mr. Glen Peterson came to Ireland on 5 November and met the management of the Clonmel plant.  He discussed the options and met representatives of the IDA before returning to the United States.  He informed the IDA the he would recommend that the workforce at Clonmel should be downsized to approximately 750 and automation should be introduced.  He stated that his recommendation would be put before the board of Seagate which would make a decision on 8 December.  Unfortunately, neither of the options about which I was informed were taken <Col N="215" /> up and the board made the decision to close the Clonmel plant.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday last, when I became aware that representatives of Seagate were coming to Ireland to inform us of the decision, alarm bells began to ring.  I knew they were not coming to give us good news because that could be conveyed by telephone.  I believed that we would be informed that fewer than 750 jobs could be maintained at Clonmel.  However, when I met the representatives yesterday, following the Order of Business in the Dáil, and they informed me that the plant would be completely closed, I was shocked as were the executives of the IDA who were present.  At no stage were we led to believe that the Clonmel facility would be closed.  I expressed in the strongest terms my anger and that of the Government and of the workers at Clonmel.  It is unprecedented that a company which made such a major investment should close within such a short time.</P>
    <P>When I asked the company why it had come to this conclusion, it instanced a number of factors in addition to those I mentioned.  It said that shortly after it decided to come to Clonmel in 1995, it acquired another company, Conner Peripherals, which also makes hard disk drives.  As a result of acquiring Conner Peripherals, there was an overcapacity in the organisation in relation to disc drives and the market was declining, as was its share.  Therefore, it could not justify keeping another operation anywhere making disc drives. It was not closing the Clonmel plant to move the facility elsewhere, it was simply taking what was is done in Clonmel out of the equation completely. It also said that producing disk drives is much more economic in the Far East where they can be produced for about one-third of the cost of producing them here.  It told me the market was stagnant and that currency issues were also a factor in its considerations.</P>
    <P>I regret this has happened, particularly because many of these workers have gone through this process before.  Many are former Digital workers and it is not that long since Clonmel, like Galway, experienced the gloom and disaster arising from that closure.  The company asked for an embargo time of after 6.30 p.m. yesterday.  Clearly, I did not want to break it, although I informed the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern.</P>
    <P>I decided to travel to Clonmel later yesterday evening to meet community leaders and the workers.  I wanted to show solidarity with workers facing a bleak Christmas because of losing good employment which they had only for a short time. The Seagate workforce is dynamic, young, enthusiastic and highly motivated and will be an asset in seeking to get a replacement industry.  I also wanted to talk to community leaders because Seagate was worth £20 million per year to the local economy and 95 per cent of the workers come from within ten miles of the town of Clonmel. <Col N="216" /> Clearly, this closure has huge economic consequences for Clonmel and the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>I have decided to establish a task force comprising local business people and chaired by the county manager.  It will also have a workers' representative. The job of the task force will be to help me, IDA Ireland and others to find a replacement industry and to look at the training and other needs of the workers to advise the Government and other agencies on what they can do to assist.  I got an assurance from the company that it will make the facility available to a new investor at a reasonable price.  The facility, which is state of the art, will be attractive.  We have a number of new projects in the pipeline for next year and a number of companies currently looking at sites around Ireland.  IDA Ireland will now take those companies to look at the Clonmel site. The fact that it will be available shortly and that we have a readily available workforce will make Clonmel extremely attractive.</P>
    <P>I also got an assurance from the company on severance payments.  Somebody working in the company for two years will get an average severance payment of 15 weeks pay while somebody working there for less than that period will get an average of 11 weeks pay.  I am not suggesting that is wonderful, but it is better than what it might have been.  These workers do not have statutory rights because of the short time they have been employed by the company.  The company will repay in full the employment grants it got because it has not stayed for the requisite time.  We have a legally binding commitment from the parent company on that matter.  I also asked the company to make money available to establish a job centre to help workers obtain training for other jobs, which might be necessary for some, provide counselling and help with the other needs workers will have at this difficult time.</P>
    <P>This morning I met in excess of 400 workers and, notwithstanding their devastation and the fact that many have huge commitments in terms of mortgages and young families &mdash; in many cases two members of the family work at Seagate &mdash; I found them extremely positive.  They want to look to the future; they want alternative employment and for me to help them bring that about.  I gave them an assurance that I would do so.  They feel angry at what has happened and their experience with Seagate has not been good.</P>
    <P>Although Seagate told me this morning that the Cork project was still on because the products it will make there will be of much higher value, more capital intensive and will make more sense in the context of the Irish Republic than what it produces in Clonmel, I would find it difficult to recommend to IDA Ireland and the Government, without a serious re-evaluation, to proceed with the Cork project because of this experience.  This has been a bad experience for the Government and the workers.  Our experience of Seagate has been disappointing.  If Seagate comes back next April when the review of the Cork project is completed and tells me it wants to proceed, we will <Col N="217" /> be very cautious before recommending that more taxpayers' money be given to this company.  I do not want workers in Cork to face what those in Clonmel have to face.  It would be irresponsible of me, as Minister, to close any door because one must not do that in politics.  We will, however, move forward cautiously.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for facilitating me.  I will be happy to stay for the debate and look forward to hearing contributions by Members of different parties.  A debate will begin in the other House at around 3.50 p.m. so I would appreciate if I could leave to be there for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader and the deputy leader for arranging this important debate.  I would like it to be a constructive one because this is probably the most serious issue this Seanad will discuss.  I am delighted the Minister made an effort to go to Clonmel and to come to the House to hear what we have to say.</P>
      <P>I come from the constituency of South Tipperary and know of the devastation felt in my constituency since hearing the news yesterday. Tipperary is a proud county which has led the way in many fields, including hurling and business. Tipperary people have a strong tradition of loyalty and pride in their county but that pride was savagely dented yesterday evening with the announcement of Seagate's decision to close the Clonmel plant.  This closure not only affects Clonmel but all of South Tipperary.  Some 200 people from Cashel are employed by Seagate while 50 people from the village of Ardfinnan close to Clonmel work there.  This closure will have an impact across South Tipperary.</P>
      <P>People have taken out car loans and mortgages and committed themselves to 20 years of repayments. The worst story I heard was that at 3 p.m. yesterday a young couple signed for a mortgage in a building society in Clonmel, yet at 6 p.m., they did not know from where their next pay cheque would come.  That is the saddest situation in which a person could find themselves.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister said, this company has a lot for which to answer.  I will not go into the details but I would like to know where we will go from here.  Would it be possible to ask the company to stay on until we get a replacement industry because it would fill a vacuum over the next few months?  The Minister is committed to getting a replacement industry.  By asking the company to stay on, we would be showing solidarity with the people of South Tipperary.  As the Minister said, there are projects in the pipeline &mdash; companies ready to come to South Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of this plant also highlights the severe problem in south Tipperary.  As the Minister will be aware, I was a member of a deputation from Tipperary Town which met her on 1 October.  Senator Ó Murchú was a member of that deputation also, as were members of the county council, Tipperary Urban District Council, representatives of IDA Ireland and other officials.  Tipperary town has suffered greatly as <Col N="218" /> has my town, Cashel.  All the towns and villages throughout the county are badly affected.  I welcome the setting up of the task force headed by the county manager, Mr. Ned Gleeson, who I know will do everything possible.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to give a commitment that other measures, such as the relocation of a Department, will be put in place in south Tipperary in tandem with finding a replacement industry.  Every public representative in the constituency has spoken at various times about this and it would be a positive development.  The Government has a chance to show solidarity with the county which has suffered most by announcing the relocation of a Department there.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned of the severance package for the workers.  It is not great, but it is better than nothing.  However, 300 part-time workers are being thrown to the wolves and, according to stories which I have heard from the constituency, these people will get nothing.  Can the Minister do something for those people?  Three hundred jobs is a huge number and some avenue should be found to help those people because, even though they were part-time jobs, many of those workers were of as much service to the company as some of the full-time workers.</P>
    <P>The whole of south Tipperary has been affected by this closure and I ask the Minister to do her utmost to address this very bad problem in my constituency.  We are relying on the Minister to do what she can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister although I, like everybody, regret the occasion which has warranted her attendance here.</P>
      <P>When Seagate Technology was set up in Clonmel in 1995 the move, which was approved by the previous Government, was widely welcomed. Seagate Technology was a blue-chip company and a market leader in its field.  It ran a good show and, as a replacement for the Digital plant, it made an enormous contribution to Clonmel and the surrounding area to the tune of £20 million, as the Minister outlined earlier.</P>
      <P>The decision that the plant is to close is devastating. The announcement, 14 days before Christmas, is a severe blow to the 1,400 employees in Clonmel and I want to convey to these people my personal sympathy at their plight.</P>
      <P>In 1992 Digital in Galway faced major difficulties in its hardware manufacturing facilities and subsequently the company had to make the decision to close that section of its business.  At that time the people in Galway and I, as an employer in the region, felt that Galway would become a ghost town and no longer prosper. There was enormous despair and a great fear of the unknown.  Employees, suppliers and towns-people all wondered how they would cope, but I assure the House, the people of Clonmel, employees, suppliers and all involved in Seagate Technology that we did.  Indeed, as I will outline later, things have improved significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> In August, the Minister visited Seagate Technology in the United States and there was no mention of problems there.  In October when the Tánaiste and IDA Ireland became aware that there were clouds on the horizon, the matter was immediately addressed and senior IDA Ireland executives went to the US to meet the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister travelled to the US at the end of October to meet Seagate Technology management. At that point the parent company was reviewing the situation.  As the Minister outlined there were a number of options; down-sizing or upgrading the plant.  However, the outcome of the review, as we all know today, is the closure of the Clonmel plant, the loss of employment and source of income of 1,400 employees, and the loss of a major contributor to the area.</P>
    <P>At this stage we could all get bogged down in attributing blame, in recriminations and in cheap political point scoring, but what good would that do?  What we must do is look to the future.  Let us remember the old cliché: nothing ventured, nothing gained.</P>
    <P>In the real world, he or she who hesitates is lost.  The Minister has not hesitated but has taken decisive and positive action.  Yesterday evening she travelled to Clonmel in recognition of the enormity of the blow to the town and its environs.</P>
    <P>The Government has already commenced the task of rebuilding.  It is committed to supporting the employees and the people of the area.  As we speak, I am aware that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is finalising details on the establishment of a task force.  As she said, the Minister is consulting at all levels &mdash; Government, support agencies and local &mdash; to see who should be represented on this particular initiative.  I plead with all present, particularly those who spoke earlier, to support this task force in spirit and vocally.</P>
    <P>These initiatives work because of the concern, commitment, innovation, hard work and dedication of all those involved.  Continued criticism and recriminations are not helpful and do nothing to assist the task at hand, that is, the replacement of the 1,400 jobs in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>To prove that task forces work and give people a feeling of optimism, I want to outline the success of the Galway task force.  Digital's software division in Galway has expanded and employment has increased.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Boston Scientific created 2,500 new jobs in Galway; APC, 550 jobs in Galway and 245 in Castlebar; Saville Systems, Thermo King <Col N="220" /> Ireland Limited, and Nortel have continued expansion.  Other companies, including S &amp; P Media International, Nelipak Thermoforming Ireland Limited, Biocompatibles Cardiovascular Ireland Limited, Contech Medical International Limited, Data Dimensions, Multistream International Limited, DER and AND Ireland Limited, which have set up in Galway are tangible proof of the success of a highly motivated and committed task force.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concern for Tipperary. All I am saying is that this has worked in the past.  I cannot comment on other task forces in other areas; I can only comment on what I know.</P>
      <P>I also know that the people involved in the Clonmel task force will be committed hard working individuals and, with our help, support and encouragement, they will be highly successful. That is the hope of everybody in this and the other House.</P>
      <P>Let us not forget that, in a world of enormous competition, Clonmel and its environs has two major assets at this stage: a hard-working, highly skilled, well trained, committed workforce of 14,000 people; and a high-tech state of the art site and building.</P>
      <P>The economy is attracting outside investment every day and Ireland is a major player in the global market when it comes to attracting jobs and investment.  Representatives of IDA Ireland are working extremely hard.  Let us spare a thought for them because their feeling of loss and failure is great.  Their sense of regret is second to none, but they will rise to the challenge as they have done in the past, pick up the pieces and continue to do their job in the most effective and productive manner.</P>
      <P>We should support the efforts of the Government and the Minister to address this challenge and not deal in the language of recrimination and blame.  It will not secure replacement jobs for the 1,400 people in Clonmel.  We will no doubt learn from this disaster and that knowledge will be invaluable to us in future.  For now, we need support, optimism, commitment and an all out effort. The Minister has made this effort.  I applaud her quick action and convey full support to her in her actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  She and I are old friends.  I share with my colleagues the most brutal sense of shock which the people in Clonmel must also feel.  As the Minister rightly said, this matter is unprecedented.  I welcome her willingness not to show the usual diplomatic restraint and to say she is angry, because everyone is entitled to be angry about this.  While we should not seek to apportion blame, this is nevertheless <Col N="221" /> an appalling way to treat people.  No one should be treated like this.  It is also the wrong way to treat this State which, some would argue is excessively generous to multinationals, but which always meets its side of the bargain.  I wish the task force well and I am sure it will be successful. If there was ever a time when it was less unpleasant to be unemployed, it is probably now when opportunities are available and possibilities exist.</P>
      <P>There are lessons worth learning from this. What happened between 13 June and 6 October when we went from the announcement of 1,000 new jobs to a position where everything was up for grabs?  The marketplace does not change that dramatically.  No major economy of which I am aware has flipped into recession in that period. Japan is doing badly but it was doing badly last June.  Something stinks about this operation.  IDA Ireland needs to dig a little deeper into the causes of this not for the sake of recrimination but because we need to learn more about it.  It is extremely important we learn from it.</P>
      <P>This multinational is playing games with us and I will give some examples.  The Minister mentioned the suggestion of introducing automation and reducing jobs.  If Seagate was not operating its Clonmel plant at the limits of technology when it started, it had no intention of staying.  No dramatic new technology exists which it could have considered introducing.  Automating such a plant is an ongoing process and is not something which can be postponed until a great day dawns.  That suggestion makes its motives more suspect.  The suggestion that the Cork operation might be proceeded with because it is so different from Clonmel is meaningless.  Such a dramatic change in hard disk drives does not happen.  The idea that the company would close a factory in Clonmel, open a factory in Cork and train a new workforce is absolute bunkum.  I believe they are conning the country.  We need to dig deeper into this.  I do not suggest the setting up of a public inquiry but there should be a detailed investigation and all the information should be published.  There is something very suspect about announcing 1,000 new jobs at a stage when a company is obviously on its way down.  It is unprecedented.</P>
      <P>I greatly sympathise with the workers and it is ironic to hear that they will ask SIPTU to assist them in organising themselves.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has conducted a long standing campaign to get trade union recognition in multinational firms in the information technology sector.  The workforce deserves to be organised as a matter of principle as it gives it a negotiating position, something these people do not have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the financial institutions that queued up to give these young people mortgages will develop a level of compassion.  I hope they will not force considerable interest payments on young people who took out mortgages in good faith and are now left with no means of paying them.  The Minister could remind the financial <Col N="222" /> institutions that they have social obligations to people other than their shareholders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with virtually everything Senator Brendan Ryan said because, above all, this is a human problem.  Seeing these people on the television was a nasty reminder of the depressing days of old when we did not have a Celtic tiger.  Once again, the first time they heard of the closure was on the news.  They had not been told by their employer that it was going to happen.  That is the most inhuman and unacceptable way of treating any human being.  I can understand why multinationals close factories here, as can everyone, but I can see no reason they should do it with such a cruel and ruthless streak.  They are treating human beings like machines.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister.  This situation has been thrust upon her and everyone in this House agrees with and supports her genuine efforts, the way she has treated this as a matter of urgency and the courageous way she has taken on the multinationals.  I gather she said this morning she had some harsh words to say about Seagate.  It is not easy even for a Minister to take on a multinational because it will come back for more and political goodwill can be extorted from it at a future date.  Ministers can always use multinationals to announce new jobs, thus receiving some sort of kudos.  The Minister has not succumbed to that temptation and it is a matter of great credit to her that she has taken on Seagate.</P>
      <P>I have not heard a decent credible reason this has happened.  I do not believe multinationals who throw out words such as &ldquo;overcapacity&rdquo;. Senator Brendan Ryan is correct.  How can there be such dramatic overcapacity now when it did not exist two years ago or even six months ago?   I do not understand and I do not find it credible. I do not believe the mutterings and implications that we are becoming uncompetitive in terms of labour and that it is cheaper for companies to locate elsewhere.  That cannot have happened in such a dramatic way in two or three months.</P>
      <P>I would like two outcomes from this brief debate.  First, we should have some sort of inquiry.  I do not mean a witch hunt but rather an inquiry to find out why this happened.  It should not be a case of IDA Ireland being asked if corners were cut or whether someone did this, that or the other, but rather that we know so that we do not make this sort of mistake again in future. If it means not trusting multinationals that is the lesson to be learned.  I do not know whether it means that.  We must find out how this happened because it remains a mystery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, if that inquiry is held, we should also ask ourselves whether this has more serious implications for the Celtic tiger than we believed possible 24 hours ago.  I do not know the answer to this question either.  Is there something fragile about the Celtic tiger which is breeding an over-confidence in our belief in this economy?  Is this company the first of others which are going to <Col N="223" /> move for similar reasons or because we are making a fundamental mistake about multinationals?   We need that sort of reassurance.  Will the Minister hold such a constructive inquiry into why this happened?  I congratulate her on the extremely dignified and human way she has behaved in this crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank her for returning at short notice to take this debate which I know she was anxious to do.</P>
      <P>Everything which could be done in this case has been done; but despite that the company has decided to put 1,400 people out of work, with all the devastating consequences that entails.  It was with a great sense of shock and depression that we heard the unexpected news of the closure of the Seagate plant in Clonmel.  It is difficult to imagine the scale of the shock of the workforce in Seagate and of the surrounding community in Clonmel and its hinterland.  The blow is huge and is especially harsh in falling so close to Christmas. Many employees have entered into mortgages and other financial commitments, and the immediate priority for the Tánaiste, the Government, the State agencies and Seagate itself must be to minimise the effects of the closure on the workforce and to ensure that a replacement industry or industries is provided in the Clonmel area, so that new employment opportunities are created and hope is restored.</P>
      <P>I have faith in the ability of my party leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, to secure such a replacement industry for Clonmel.  She recently succeeded in attracting a replacement industry to the Packard Electric plant which closed in Tallaght last year.  She will give her total commitment to securing a similar success in Clonmel.  I applaud her for her swift response to this crisis. She has already established a task force which will commence rebuilding and finding jobs.  I also note her remarks about recovering the grants which the State put into the industry.</P>
      <P>She is also to be congratulated for going to Clonmel as soon as she heard yesterday's announcement and meeting Seagate workers, Corporation members and community leaders in the town.  As we have frequently seen in the past, it is all too easy for Ministers to make high profile, PR-friendly outings when new jobs are announced, new companies are brought here or premises are officially opened; it is far more difficult and unusual to find a Minister prepared to turn up when a plant is closing, to explain issues to workers, to listen to people and to co-operate with the local community in dealing with events and to attempt to put the pieces back together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also perfectly clear that the Minister discharged her responsibilities by going there. Consequently, it was wrong to demand that she be present in the House at the commencement of business today because that was impossible.  It was only shortly after the Order of Business that <Col N="224" /> she became aware we were seeking a debate and, to her credit, she came here to take it.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, neither a debate, political point scoring nor facile soundbites will keep Seagate in Clonmel.  I wish it were otherwise but that is the way of the world.  Successive Governments have sought and encouraged large, multinational companies to locate and invest here.  Thankfully we have moved away from the &ldquo;keep the multinationals out&rdquo; philosophy which had some currency several years ago.  The historic scale of our unemployment could not have been tackled other than by an integrated policy of encouraging indigenous industries, especially those based in the food sector, complemented with large-scale inward international investment.</P>
    <P>The success of this policy has been striking. Employment in overseas electronics companies based in Ireland has gone up from 8,000 in 1986 to 33,000 today.  The IDA and everyone involved deserves credit for this performance, which is also a handsome tribute to the quality of the Irish workforce, and to the type of skills in Clonmel and elsewhere.  These companies now account for a third of total Irish exports.  In my county, Kildare, companies like Intel and Hewlett Packard have transformed the employment prospects for many people.  It is also worth recording that nearly half the companies in this sector have been here for more than ten years.  While we accept this is a volatile industry &mdash; Seagate is a casualty of this volatility &mdash; and that some of these companies have a short life cycle, the strike rate is nonetheless encouraging.  Without wishing to understate the severity of the blow suffered in Clonmel at Seagate, and previously suffered at Digital, Packard Electric and Semperit, it is clear the successes greatly outweigh the failures and that there has been a good record in finding replacement industries for the failures.</P>
    <P>It ill behoves anyone in Seanad Éireann to politicise this grave matter.  I note and welcome Senator Hayes's comments in that respect.  It should be the task of all parties to co-operate with the Government and the IDA so that we continue to bring industries here and provide jobs.  Sending negative signals, whether from this House or elsewhere, does not help such a process and may be detrimental in terms of attracting those industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she was taken aback by the suddenness and severity of the Seagate announcement, as were the workforce and the former Ministers who presided over its establishment and opening.  Even at a meeting between the herself and the company in America last August, there was no hint of the difficulties which caused this closure.  The first inkling of potential trouble was only two months ago, and the Tánaiste and the IDA acted swiftly when the future of the planned Cork plant became questionable. It would have been totally imprudent and irresponsible to breach confidentiality while there was any hope of rescuing the Cork investment <Col N="225" /> or the Clonmel plant.  Such breaches in the past have put new inward investment at risk.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ryan and Senator Ross that it is difficult to see how a company such as Seagate, with £670 billion in sales and £470 million in profits, cannot make money in Clonmel. One sometimes wonders about how losses are apportioned between plants and within corporations. Transfer pricing, and costing, can be factors in establishing a case which otherwise might not be made.  Substantially lower production costs in the Far East, compared to those in Ireland, are cited as one of the reasons for closure. I know from a senior source in an American computer company based both in Ireland and the Far East that unit costs of production can be lower here because of the high productivity of the Irish labour force, even though wage levels may be higher here than in the Far East.  It is important that this country should state that in a highly competitive and volatile environment, we can compete with the lower cost economies of the Far East.</P>
    <P>The immediate task facing us is to put this unfortunate episode behind us, to find replacement jobs in the Clonmel area and to continue to attract new companies to provide the jobs needed.</P>

      <P>Like others, I am saddened at the loss of Seagate in Clonmel.  I welcome the Minister and I understand how hard it must be for her to travel from place to place to explain the loss of 1,400 jobs.  We must proceed with extreme caution. Previous speakers have spoken about the number of multinational companies with which we deal, particularly those from America.  We were not careful enough in choosing some of the companies we lost.  The Minister said we must be more cautious and I welcome that remark.</P>
      <P>I am a simple person and I cannot understand why the announcement was made on 13 June if the plant was not going to open.  I also do not know why the announcement was not made before the election; we might have a different Government now if it had been.  We must again emphasise the importance of not continually bringing the same type of industry to one area. Many parts of the country have several high-technology computer plants.  Our workforce is highly trained but we should not give the impression that this makes us better able to compete with, for instance, Far Eastern countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jobs in the company's proposed plant in Cork are being advertised in the national and local newspapers and some people have applied and been interviewed.  It is frightening to think that just a few months ago the company could announce the creation of jobs in Cork when there <Col N="226" /> must already have been problems in the Clonmel plant.  I do not understand how that can have been done.  I realise the Minister is seeking an explanation.  I would not hold out great hope for the Cork plant.  I cannot understand how Seagate might close the Clonmel plant and open another more advanced plant in Cork.  Naturally, I would welcome it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that she will be extra cautious.  We must ensure that in the long term we are not dependent on such multinational companies if we wish to build an industrial infrastructure.  The Celtic tiger is bounding at such a speed that we must be cautious of such companies setting up shop here and leaving two or three years later.  We must create an infrastructure for the future.</P>
    <P>In the Cork region the setting up of a particular plant was objected to on environmental grounds. I would much prefer to have had that plant rather than have had the announcement of an industry on 13 June which may not now come into being. I hope it is built but not at the expense of jobs in Clonmel or anywhere else in the country.  We must not allow a situation to develop whereby the multinationals can decide to move from one region to another at the expense of all involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cregan for sharing time.  I welcome the Minister and thank her for being present.  I have great sympathy for the workers in Clonmel.  What has happened must be a great shock to Clonmel and the surrounding region.  The greatest shock must be the loss of livelihood for the workers and their families.  The people of Ballina had a similar experience a few months ago when the Asahi plant announced its closure.  I understand the Minister is travelling to County Mayo tomorrow and I hope she will have good news for the people of the region.</P>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator Ross made interesting points.  I agree with Senator Ross that if an inquiry is to be set up it must seek explanations for this closure.  I welcome the setting up of the task force.  A task force can carry out good work and have an important input in attracting industry to regions.  Senator Cox referred to the Galway task force and I congratulate it on its work in attracting industries to that area and saving others.  Credit for the jobs with APC in Castlebar must go to the former Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny.  It was acknowledged last week in Castlebar by the president of APC that the jobs would not have been brought to Castlebar were it not for the efforts of Deputy Kenny.</P>
      <P>If there is a will there is a way.  Members of Government can achieve more than a task force because they can direct the IDA.  With regard to finding a replacement industry for Asahi in Ballina I urge the Minister to bring that matter to a conclusion.  I have great sympathy for the people of Clonmel and I hope a solution will be found.</P>

      <P>I come from a neighbouring county to County Tipperary and I am disappointed at what has happened in Clonmel.  As other speakers have said, there is little point in recriminations.  I thank the Minister for getting involved immediately in trying to soften the blow, difficult as that will be, for those who may be made redundant in the near future.</P>
      <P>Clonmel has suffered greatly, but there is little point in blaming the multinational companies exclusively for the job losses there.  Two multinational companies have caused problems there, Seagate and Digital, but an indigenous company, Kent Corporation, also did so.  When we criticise multinational companies we must remember to examine carefully indigenous companies that develop beyond their capabilities.  The Kent Corporation not only caused problems in Clonmel but seriously affected Mahon and McPhillips in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>Multinationals have had a reasonable track record in Ireland and the large numbers of people working for them are satisfied.  The multinationals have given a great boost to the economy over the past few years.  However, we must be careful in the future.  The Asian tiger economies were the precursors to the successful Celtic tiger economy.  However, the economies of South Korea, Japan and Thailand are collapsing.  Hong Kong was supposedly one of the most successful tiger economies, yet 65 per cent of the people there live on benefits.  That economy benefited the few, yet people criticise the hand-over from Britain to China.  Hopefully, when the Chinese take over the Hong Kong economy the benefits will extend to more of the people who work there.</P>
      <P>This debate seeks a replacement industry for Clonmel, be it multinational or indigenous, but we must be careful not to suggest that one failure should lead us drive out international investment. International companies come to Ireland because it is beneficial for them, but we also benefit from their presence.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny is close to Clonmel and it has also lost investment from multinationals.  However, there remains a certain amount of such investment in Kilkenny.  Last year's chairman of Kilkenny County Council is one of those who has lost his job with Seagate.  It is not just Clonmel which will suffer from this closure.  We must ensure that we do not drive away multinational investment.  It is a matter of grave concern and we must do our best to replace the jobs in Clonmel.</P>

      <P>I concur with the speakers and thank the Minister for coming to the House to listen to us.  I assure her of our full support for her efforts in dealing with this problem and congratulate her on setting up the task force under <Col N="228" /> the chairmanship of the County Manager, Mr. Ned Gleeson.  As Senator Cox said, there are many benefits to such a task force as is obvious from the experience in Galway.  Hopefully what happened in Galway will happen in Clonmel.</P>
      <P>We have a very good, young workforce.  The Seagate complex is a state of the art building, so there are a number of positive factors from which the task force can work.  The reputation of this company preceded its coming to Clonmel.  Seagate has made enormous profits and employ a huge number of people.  Members are shocked, as I know the Minister and her officials are, by the short notice given to the workforce.  Is it possible that this company would show its genuine concern for the people of Tipperary, Kilkenny, Cork and the rest of that locality by deferring its decision and giving the workforce three months notice?  We have heard of the personal traumas of young people in particular who have mortgages and other overheads.</P>
      <P>It is a hard business decision but Ireland is a friendly destination where multinationals make significant profits.  The efficiency of the staff employed here by multinationals is way above that of other countries.  Senator Lanigan, a senior Member of the House, shared his experience of visiting many countries.  The Irish workforce is second to none.  We have a great young Minister who is respected everywhere she goes.</P>
      <P>We call publicly on this company to state, if it is genuine in maintaining good relations with the Government, the Oireachtas and the Minister, to defer this decision for three months to allow time for the IDA, the Department, the Minister, the Government and everybody concerned to put another factory in place in Tipperary.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with my colleague, Senator Gallagher.  I welcome the Minister and commend her for making a special effort come to the House.  I also hope her injury heals as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>As I listened to the litany of events outlined by her, I had a sense of <i>déjavous.</i>  All the classic signs of closure were apparent from August with the postponement of the Cork project for six months, the announcement of a global review and the comments by the vice president that the disk drive market was stagnant, that Seagate had a declining share of the market and that the Far East provided the same products more cheaply. The warning signs were strong at this stage.  Did the Minister communicate with the workforce at that time or did the IDA seek to intervene and raise the problems with the management on behalf of the workforce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was informed that the company was going to upgrade equipment and introduce automation in order to reduce the workforce to 750.  It must have been clear by then that the company <Col N="229" /> was going to close.  Did anybody tell the workers what was happening?  There was no union in the company because the management would not allow one.  In the absence of a union the Minister must be responsible for the welfare of those working in that factory and there is a special onus on the Minister in that respect.</P>
    <P>Why has there been no word about the factory in Derry where 1,400 people are employed?  Has the IDB, the Northern Ireland counterpart of the IDA, been more successful in retaining the Derry plant?  Although it does not seem as though there will be an expansion at that plant, it will retain its workforce.</P>
    <P>I support what has been said in relation to an inquiry.  The smoke screen presented by the company is a sham.  The manner in which the decision was announced suggests one was made some time ago, and I would like an inquiry established to examine this matter.  The minimum the company should do is introduce a phased withdrawal, as Senator Cassidy suggested, to allow a considerable period of time to elapse before the final withdrawal takes place.</P>
    <P>Our main concern is for the workforce and the human tragedy of those who have taken out mortgages and who heard the announcement on the 6 o'clock news before the Minister was able to directly inform them that their jobs were gone. What does the Minister intend doing in relation to the task force?  Will she place a workers' representative on it?  This should be an essential element of the task force.</P>
    <P>There has been a fundamental breach of the labour/employer relationship in this case, with no consultation with representatives of the workforce. This constitutes a shattering of Partnership 2000.  The lack of consultation is unprecedented. The future of Partnership 2000 must now be in question.  It is also directly contrary to Article 2.1 of the EU directive which states that &ldquo;where an employer is contemplating collective redundancies, he shall begin consultation with the workers' representatives in good time with a view to reaching an agreement&rdquo;.  Why was this course not followed?   The company has breached European and Irish law.</P>
    <P>We also must examine the company's refusal to allow its employees to be members of a union. If there was a union it could have negotiated with the management and the outcome would have been different.  Will the Minister say whether the Government will promote union representation in multinational companies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the workers in Seagate in Clonmel.  I come from a town which lost a major industry earlier this year while in September another of our major industries was put up for sale.  I am aware of the sense of shock which such events send through a community.  At least four months notice was given in the case of Atlantic Mills in Tullamore while Sherwood Medical is remaining in touch with the workforce regarding its future intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> I wish the task force well.  Such groups have worked in other places, although I wonder how successful they can be because of the number of them which we have in place.</P>
    <P>The workforce has been treated very badly by the company as there was no consultation.  I would have expected some mechanism to have been found, with the Government acting as an intermediary, if there were difficulties about which the workers were not being told.  Workers have a right to be informed and consulted and that should have been done.  Consultation does not prevent jobs being lost but it does help people prepare and make some advance arrangements. In this context I ask the company to defer its closure for a period of months to allow for some adjustment.</P>
    <P>We must agree that the rights of members of a workforce to organise themselves and to be represented should be a fundamental part of industrial and social policy.  I agree with the point about the need for examination not only with regard to Seagate, but other companies setting up in Ireland.  We are glad they come to this country and all public representatives seek them for their areas.  We depend on the IDA and the Department to vet these companies and to ensure a reasonable level of job security.  I am amazed that in this case and others, such as Sherwood Medical in my area, large amounts of public investment can be authorised only months in advance of announcements about the detrimental futures of plants.</P>

      <P>: I thank the Chair for facilitating me and the Senators who contributed to this responsible and calm debate. Members did not try to score political points and that is as it should be; I will not seek to score political points.  Many people are asking with the benefit of hindsight and 20/20 vision if this plant should have been located in Clonmel.  However, at the time it was a very good decision and the previous Government was right to support it.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Costello's query, there will be a workers' representative on the task force.  In relation to trade union recognition, trade union membership is voluntary in Ireland.  People are not mandatorily required to join a union.  In Ireland 48 per cent of the employee workforce belong to a union, but in France, where there are a number of mandatory requirements, the level is only 10 per cent.  A working group under the auspices of Partnership 2000 is currently examining the issue of trade union recognition and I understand it will report to me soon on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did it happen?  I asked the company that yesterday because it is incredible and there are some questions I cannot answer.  The company is a world leader in its field and we were delighted when it decided to locate in Clonmel in 1995.  I <Col N="231" /> am not an expert on computers.  I only knew about them in general before I was appointed and I had to learn about hard disks, disk drives, peripherals and the other jargon in this sector.  The company is making a commodity product in Clonmel in what is called the peripherals area of the industry.  It is a low value added product which is labour intensive.  It is essentially an assembly plant.  The company has a much more high tech, capital intensive, value added operation in Derry; the proposal for Cork also involved this type of operation.</P>
    <P>The company made the point to me that it can make low value products much more cheaply, at a third of the cost, in the Far East.  In addition, soon after Seagate decided to locate in Clonmel, it acquired a company called Conner Peripherals which made hard disk drives.  This immediately created over-capacity.  I asked why Seagate purchased that company within a couple months but I did not receive satisfactory answers.</P>
    <P>Soon after it purchased Conner Peripherals, which had a capacity of 1.3 million square feet of factory space, Seagate closed down 0.5 million square feet in Italy, Scotland and Asia.  It also told me the market has changed in two years.  The electronics industry is a very fast changing market. A representative of a major employer in Dublin told me recently that over the next 15 months the company will not only change the products it makes in Ireland but also the process involved.  This is how quickly the sector is changing. There are 150 electronics companies in the Republic which employ 33,000 people and account for £7 billion of exports.  By and large, they are outstanding employers.  Over half of those companies have been in Ireland in excess of ten years.  It is a most important sector involving high quality employment.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of how the closure in Clonmel is being handled, I was involved in the Packard Electric plant closure.  It probably does not matter how or when one hears about a closure but there is a way of doing business and that is that the employer should tell the workforce. Packard Electric workers learned their fate on the 9 o'clock news and that hurt them because they had worked there for a long time.  I spoke to only a few people yesterday about Seagate, three members of the Government and officials in my Department and the IDA, because I did not want the news to leak.  I was driving to Clonmel when I heard it as the headline story on the 6.30 p.m. news.  I was bitterly disappointed because I knew the effect it would have on the workers.  Husbands and wives who heard it on the news arrived at the gates of the plant last night to tell the employees of their fate.  This added to the tragedy and sense of disaster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how that happened. Many people heard about it during the <Col N="232" /> afternoon when meetings were called by the company. The workers began to realise something was afoot when they were asked to attend meetings between 6.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>Regarding the grant Seagate received and comments that it conned the country, it has been an expensive exercise for the company.  It was an investment of £82 million, including a fixed capital investment of £21.6 million.  It drew down employment grants of £11.6 million which it must repay in total.  This was also a factor in its considerations. The cost of severance payments will be over £6 million and many other costs will be associated with the closure.  Why did it happen?   Mr. Ron Verdoorn was central to the company's decision to locate in Ireland but he no longer works for the company which has new management. The company repeated yesterday what it told me in October, that if the decision was being made now it would not locate a disk drive facility in Ireland.  The representatives were talking with the benefit of hindsight but they said it is a stagnant industry.  In addition, disk drives are now more powerful and consequently fewer are required.  This is another reason for the over-capacity.</P>
      <P>The job of the task force will be to help the workers, their families and the area and to come up with suggestions for alternative employment. It will try to drive the move to find an alternative investor.  I hoped to announce the membership of the task force this afternoon &mdash; I want it to have a business focus &mdash; but a number of the key businessmen I want to take part in it are abroad.  I want to speak to them personally and ask them to participate before I make an announcement. One of the people to whom I wish to speak is travelling in the United States.  I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in the next few hours.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Cregan's point, the Cork proposal was leaked during the election.  The Clonmel facility was opened on 4 June.  I am not making a political point but people knew Seagate intended to locate in Cork and they wanted to release the news.  The former Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, did not announce it until the day after the election and I acknowledge the honourable role he played throughout.  He was one of the people I telephoned before 6.30 p.m. yesterday. He was involved in bringing Seagate to Ireland and I felt I should tell him the position as a matter of courtesy.  I do not suggest he was involved in leaking the news of the closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy is dependent on multinationals. Ireland currently attracts between 30 and 40 per cent of projects coming from the United States to Europe, notwithstanding the fact that it has less than 1 per cent of the European population. These companies come to Ireland because of the low corporate tax rates.  The 10 per cent tax and the skills base are major attractions.  However, the tax only comes into play if a company makes a profit.  Seagate has lost $63 million in Clonmel, which is equivalent to IR£45 million.  Last year <Col N="233" /> the Irish subsidiaries of foreign multinationals paid £700 million in corporate taxes.  If they had been located in other European countries, they would have paid three times that amount.  They saved approximately US$2 billion by virtue of their location in the Republic.  The rate, which remains a major attraction, and the professionalism of the IDA are the reasons Ireland is doing well.</P>
    <P>However, we must learn lessons in relation to the lower end of the market.  Ireland would not support many textile sectors because they are very labour intensive and they do not make sense in this economy.  For every worker in Germany, one can get two Irish workers.  However, for the two Irish workers, one can get 126 workers in some parts of the Far East.  I do not suggest Irish wage levels should be reduced to those of the Far East.</P>

      <P>That is the competitive world in which we operate.  How do we survive and thrive in that world?  We must continue to aim for value added products, high-tech activity and labour intensive development.  A re-evaluation is being carried out in my Department and by the IDA as a result of the shock announcement yesterday.</P>
      <P>As regards telling the workforce, my job as Minister in dealing with client companies is to maintain confidentiality.  I acted as I did for a number of reasons.  First, I did not want a company which was in difficulty to have more difficulties. Second, I want companies to know that they deal with me in complete confidence.  That must also be how they deal with Government. Third, I did not want to talk down the company. If I had gone to the workers and said, as I was led to believe on 6 November, that the most likely decision was 750 job losses and the implementation of some automation in Clonmel, I would have created panic.  In addition, I would have been asked which 750 jobs were to go and I could not have answered those questions.  At that stage it was only one of two possible solutions.  We were told it was the most likely one, but we were not told that closure was even on the agenda.</P>
      <P>All Ministers have been involved in rescue missions and company restructuring, and nine times out of ten the problem is sorted out.  It would not have been right for me, when told on 6 November that 750 jobs were likely to go, to leak this information. It would have been wrong because it was the duty of Seagate as an employer to tell people what was happening.  I wish this had been done differently, especially coming up to Christmas. Some of the Seagate workers were having a Christmas party tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on radio, one of the saddest things that happened last night was when I met a 16 year old schoolgirl with a bad heart condition.  Her father had not worked for years but got a job in Seagate a year ago.  She cried when she asked me if he would ever work again.  When one saw the <Col N="234" /> workers this morning, one could not but feel that things should have been handled differently.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for the very dignified debate. It will be appreciated by the workers.</P>

      <P>I apologise.  I suggested the second week in February to the company, as they were going to close for two weeks at Christmas. They informed me that they had lost $63 million, £45 million, and that the board decision taken on Monday was final.  The meeting yesterday was hot and heavy.  We were very angry and shocked because we were never led to believe that this was on the agenda.  That will have to be taken into account in future dealings with Seagate.  It would take a lot to accept the credibility of a company that could come to this decision after such a short period.  We will have to move very cautiously in connection with this company.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that we will not all be able to address the Minister directly as she must address the Dáil, but I thank her for outlining the steps taken before and since this terrible event occurred.  She toured the country and was satisfied that Seagate was in Clonmel to stay.</P>
      <P>Some might wonder at a west of Ireland Senator's interest in Clonmel.  My interest is threefold.  Like everybody else, I sympathise with those people who are facing Christmas in desolation. They are wondering about their future and are concerned about mortgage and car payments. Second, I spent some years in that area and I know people who are now unemployed.  I sympathise with them and their families as well as others who will be affected, such as shopkeepers. Everyone in the area will suffer as a result of this closure.  My third reason relates to the experience in Galway when Digital closed.  The devastation in the city was almost like that of a death in the family.  A vacuum was left that people did not know how to fill.  We did not know how those jobs would be replaced.  Those jobs were not lost to the Middle East but to Scotland, which offered greater grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with the point made by speakers on the dramatic and sudden way this happened. There were no signals that this was about to happen, which indicates that we must be very wary. Those living in towns dependent on American industries would like clear markers when such <Col N="235" /> companies intend shedding jobs or closing down. I am not suggesting an investigation, but warnings should be given.</P>
    <P>We will have to look at the skills available in an area.  Assembly by machinery is simple.  The machinery does not go on strike or demand pay increases.  It is easy to move it from one country to another.  We must attract skilled jobs and establish research and development to ensure that industries stay here.  A company that is tied down by research and development is not as likely to move.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that the company has no intention of staying on.  The way this factory closed dehumanised the people of Clonmel. They were treated as objects rather than people. This side of the House has been supportive of the Tánaiste.  We have not used rancour but have acted in this debate in a way that indicates our concern that something be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in thanking the Minister for addressing the House. I regret she has had to go to the Dáil, but that is understandable.  She seemed to be able to write with her left hand, but I look forward to her right hand being taken out of its sling, because she needs to give a good handbagging to whoever in the IDA needs it as well as the Seagate management.</P>
      <P>This is a devastating blow not just to Clonmel but the entire country.  The loss of 1,400 jobs is a huge human tragedy, and it was shocking that the workforce were informed by the media.  The Tánaiste and the IDA were apparently aware of the dangers last October.  What, if anything, did the IDA do since then?  Where does Seagate stand in relation to repayments of £16 million in State grants?  I accept the Minister's statement that the company has mentioned repayment, but how secure is that commitment?  The company has been in Ireland only two years.</P>
      <P>Clonmel suffered another serious blow in the closure of Digital.  When is its bad luck going to end?  Where does this leave the projects we were lead to believe were in the pipeline for Cork and Derry?  The Minister has said that Seagate explained that it is in a declining market.  If that is so, surely that would have been spotted when it opened the Clonmel factory.  Questions must be asked about the IDA vetting procedures.  The Minister also stated that the decision was contrary to the options outlined to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was taken by Senator Dardis's contribution on the possibility of transfer pricing on costs, which relates to the IDA's vetting powers.  It is serious because this could have been a rationalisation decision rather than one based on other factors, as we have been lead to believe.  The Minister stated that Seagate intend manufacturing higher value products in Cork.  Why did the company not show good faith and transfer some of the Cork operation to Clonmel, given that there is a skilled <Col N="236" /> workforce already there?  Senator Tom Hayes mentioned 300 part-time workers who will receive no recompense.  The Tánaiste must see what the State can do to help them receive some payment.  We experienced this in Killarney in 1995 when the highly skilled Pretty Polly workforce lost their jobs.  The Pretty Polly factory is still vacant and those highly skilled workers are mostly idle.  I wish the taskforce and the Minister well in their efforts.  I hope the IDA show the necessary degree of urgency in providing replacement jobs in Clonmel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">

      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for arranging this debate and the Minister for her prompt and positive response and for giving us an opportunity to express our concerns to her.  The closure of the Seagate plant in Clonmel will go down as one of the most surprising and sudden closures in our industrial history.  The traumatic news of this closure will send tremors of earthquake proportions to the foundations of the morale of the people of Clonmel, Tipperary and the south-east region.</P>
      <P>It is evident from the Minister's contribution in the House that she, too, was taken greatly by surprise.  She gave us a very astute and expert appraisal of the background to this problem and the present position.  She left no room for misinformation. This must be the starting point of any action we bring to bear on this situation.</P>
      <P>My colleague from south Tipperary, Senator Tom Hayes, set the right tone for this debate.  We should have positive concern for this matter, coupled with a concerted and united approach to finding a solution, namely, a replacement industry for Clonmel of the same size and value.</P>
      <P>Not only must the workforce bear this news at a festive time of year, the fact that it is a holiday period means there is a very grave danger that the momentum for a solution will be stifled. Opportunities could be lost as a result of the Dáil and Seanad going into recess for several weeks next week.  If the necessity arises, the Seanad and Dáil should be recalled over Christmas.  It is quite evident that all Members, irrespective of where they come from, realise the seriousness of this matter.</P>
      <P>When one remembers the gloom when Digital withdrew from Clonmel in the early 1990s, great credit is due to the community there for the manner in which it responded.  I come from Cashel in South Tipperary and I am keenly aware of Clonmel's successes in that regard.  A few weeks ago I complimented members of Clonmel Chamber of Commerce and Clonmel Corporation on their success in developing the town, not only in the context of urban renewal but under many other headings also.  There are echoes of the early 1990s in this present difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many commentators tell us the disk drive industry is subject to three year phases, going from boom to bust.  It that is the case, we must bear it in mind in any future developments.  Many of the skills used in computer technology are <Col N="237" /> transferable and the computer industry is exceptionally buoyant in some parts of Munster. However, we must put down a marker against seeing that as a total solution because it is most unlikely the unskilled workers in Clonmel could travel to Limerick, Cork or any other part of Munster.  The solution must be within Clonmel itself.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say a taskforce has already been established.  I am not too clear if she mentioned whether the grant aid paid to Seagate would be repaid.  I have seen newspaper reports that that is the case and I would expect it to be the starting point.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we will not achieve anything or serve the people of Clonmel by instigating recriminations or witch hunts about multinationals because there is not a town or city in this country which would not welcome a multinational industry.  However, we must ensure that the jobs which are provided are secure.  The people of Clonmel, having suffered twice in the past three or four years, will find it difficult to restore morale to the level at which it was 48 hours ago.</P>
    <P>The financial institutions should also be part of finding a solution.  Reference was made to the necessity for them to show understanding towards those who find themselves in an unexpected position not of their making.  It is vital to the morale of the people of Clonmel and Tipperary that everything is done to ensure no extra pressures are brought to bear on them.  There should be a formal liaison between the people of Clonmel, the taskforce and the financial institutions to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>I hope the momentum which the Minister has set in motion will be continued on an hourly, rather than weekly or monthly, basis.  Given the economic success of much of the rest of the country, it should be possible to direct all our energies towards Clonmel in the immediate future.  I thank the Minister and the Opposition who have set a tone of unity and co-operation.  We would not be thanked for giving the people of Clonmel any less than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her swift response to this industrial catastrophe in Clonmel. Senator Burke referred to her visit to Ballina tomorrow.  We have great expectations in Ballina, and I am not talking about Dickens.  I am sure her visit will be in different circumstances to those which have her in this House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sudden announcement of this closure raises serious questions about strategic planning and management at Seagate.  Last May, great hopes and expectations were raised about an impending announcement by the company in Ballina <Col N="238" /> regarding the creation of 1,500 jobs.  It involved much effort and commitment over a considerable period by officials of Mayo County Council, Ballina Urban District Council and industrial committees.  However, at the end of May, we were told that Seagate would not consider our location as viable because we could not guarantee the company 1,500 jobs, this in an area where there are 9,000 unemployed on the live register.  We subsequently discovered that Ringaskiddy was to be the beneficiary of the company's expansion, but this was subsequently put on hold and we know what has happened since then.</P>
    <P>In view of these developments and the company's strategic management programme, serious questions must be asked about Seagate.  We all know that businesses close and that they are subject to economic and market conditions.  A company such as Seagate should be able to withstand temporary blips in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú referred to the problems in the hard disk business.  New developments in laser technology are overtaking hard disks at a furious rate and there will be major changes in the industry within the next few years.  This probably influenced the company in its decision to close Clonmel.  However, that is no consolation to the people of Clonmel and the employees at the plant who now face a bleak Christmas.  The economy of the south-east will be plunged into considerable despondency by this announcement.</P>
    <P>The company must be questioned on the manner of its decision.  The announcement takes the biscuit in terms of bad industrial relations.  With its record of encouraging false hopes around the country with major expansion plans which apparently could not be justified, the company decided to close the factory without prior consultation.  It lost money hand over fist in Clonmel but nobody was aware of this.</P>
    <P>The decision underlines the way growth in the economy is fuelled by hi-tech and electronic industries.  We welcome them; I am not here to denigrate any foreign company.  Foreign investment is vital and more of it is needed.  However, we must be careful.  The Celtic tiger is riding on the back of these industries.  There should be liaison between the Department and major multinationals regarding their accounting and invoice systems.  Questions need to be raised as to how a company such as Seagate, with all its expertise at management and other levels, could incur such huge losses.  It is unbelievable that a company could collapse in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>The disappointment in Cork is acute.  However, our main concern must be with the workers, families and community in Clonmel who have suffered repeatedly.  They face a bleak Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> The Tánaiste said the plant was worth £40 million per year to the local community.  It is a lot of money to take out of a community and is only a statistical measurement of the tragedy.  The human dimension is unspeakable.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on her prompt response and hands-on approach.  She went to Clonmel and confronted the company with openness, honesty and great courage.  In the circumstances she got the best bargain available in the short term.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for her work in establishing a task force.  I wish that body well.  I also commend her for her hands-on approach in attempting to secure the best available redundancy settlement and for her efforts in ensuring that the premises occupied by Seagate will be kept and hopefully made a home to a replacement industry.  I hope such an industry will be found sooner rather than later and that it will be of sufficient size to at least compensate for the loss of what was a promising plant in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>There are facts regarding Cork which I wish to put on the record.  On Monday, 26 May the national daily newspapers reported that 1,000 new jobs in Cork were to be created by the hi-tech hard disk manufacturing firm, Seagate Technology. As if to qualify the leak, it was also reported that a formal announcement was not to be expected until after the general election.  On 3 June the newspapers reported that there was grave disappointment in the north-west following the decision by Seagate to locate in Cork.  On 13 June it was reported that the Cabinet backed the Seagate plan.  Given these circumstances, expectations were raised in Cork.  Plans were put in place and investments made in expectation of the company's plans becoming a reality.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's first priority must be Clonmel, these facts cannot be ignored.  Every effort must be made to get a firm and honourable commitment from Seagate to honour its promise to Cork.  The company was described by one newspaper today as being somewhat footloose.  If this long-term commitment cannot be extracted from the company a proper and adequate replacement industry must be found for Ringaskiddy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone's sympathy is with the people of Clonmel and the workers who have lost their jobs.  Clonmel has a chequered history. When Digital closed a few years ago it had a traumatic effect on the area.  This was quickly followed by the demise of Kentz Engineering.  There has also been serious flooding in the area on a number of occasions.  The people of Clonmel have had a bad time over the past few years.  This closure is more than many of them can take.  We must be concerned about people and their quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement, her extremely prompt action in dealing with the problem and her offer to help the people of Clonmel <Col N="240" /> to find a replacement industry in the not too distant future.  I welcome the establishment of the task force.  It is unfortunate we must have such task forces but they have worked well in the past. I have no doubt this task force will be the same. Clonmel has suffered many difficulties over the past number of years but it has got off its knees on innumerable occasions and it is capable of doing so again.  The Minister mentioned the people's positive attitude in these circumstances which will help the task force in its work.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators expressed their desire for an investigation into what has happened and the role the company and IDA Ireland have played over the past number of years.  The Minister said the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and IDA Ireland were re-evaluating the situation to see what can be learned from this tragedy and to ensure it does not happen again.  It is extremely important to move forward and to find one or a number of replacement industries for the people of Clonmel.  The people involved in peripheral activities, such as servicing this plant, must also be considered.</P>
    <P>It is important to find out if IDA Ireland's policies are focused in the right direction.  Computer technology is changing at a phenomenal rate, so we must keep pace with what is happening.  We must be careful when assessing new projects.  IDA Ireland's role in building the Celtic tiger has been extremely good and one of which it should be proud.  It is important that it carries out this investigation to see if mistakes were made so that we can learn from them and move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, appreciate the fact that the Leader made time available for this debate, that the Minister was here and that she is now represented by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy.</P>
      <P>This debate should send a message to the workers in the plant in Clonmel that they have the full sympathy of all Members of this House. The manner in which the company treated its employees is despicable and inhuman.  People in companies throughout the world should not be treated in such an inhuman manner.  It is unacceptable to tell people such news two weeks before Christmas.  I hope the Government and IDA Ireland conveys our condemnation to the management of this company.  Such behaviour is not in keeping with basic human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This company has been in Clonmel for only a little over a year and a half.  Modern technology is developing at a rapid rate and those involved in the electronics industry recognise that.  It is unacceptable to suggest there was no warning because I am sure it was known what was happening. This incident is similar to what happened in Digital in 1993 when its hardware plant was moved to Scotland.  There were shenanigans behind the scenes with the industrial development authority in Scotland and the owners of the company in Massachusetts.  It came down to the <Col N="241" /> Social Chapter and the Maastricht Treaty and the fact that bigger grants were offered by the industrial development authority in Scotland than those negotiated here.  This happened during a change of Government when our eye was off the ball.  A task force was set up and a replacement industry was found which has been successful.</P>
    <P>Another similarity is that Digital and Seagate were not unionised.  The Minister said that only 48 per cent of workers are members of unions while 52 per cent are not.  Senator Ó Murchú said we do not want to criticise multinationals because we are heavily dependent on them.  Nevertheless, many workers in multinational companies are prevented from becoming members of unions. Workers should be free to become members of unions if they so wish.  The workers in Seagate did not have union representatives to negotiate with management.  The Minister and IDA Ireland must consider this issue when negotiating with companies in the future.  Individuals should be given the right to become members of a union in any company.  There will be other such scenarios in non-unionised companies throughout the country. I do not come from a unionised background but I recognise the need for unions.</P>
    <P>There were warning signs as early as last August.  Is there a special unit in IDA Ireland which closely monitors companies in difficulty?   While I accept that Seagate manufactured basic hard disk drives and that the market changed, I do not accept that this company or IDA Ireland did not know what was happening.  If they did not, their eye was off the ball and that is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this is an expensive investment for the company as it has invested over £82 million in the plant and received grants of £11.6 million, which will be repaid in total.  This is not an expensive investment for Seagate.  It is transferring operations to another country where its products will be manufactured for one third of the cost.  In real terms, the actual cost to Seagate is small.  I have no sympathy for the company as it is going to make money on this move.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey noted that the Celtic tiger's success is based on hi-tech industries.  This closure shows politicians, the Minister and Forbairt that we must be increasingly vigilant when it comes to these hi-tech industries and the massive changes which are taking place.  We must have our finger on the pulse so that we know exactly what is going on.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill expressed her anxiety to get Seagate into Cork.  I would question any constituency wishing to attract Seagate given the despicable manner in which it has treated its workforce. It is an unpredictable, unreliable company and we do not want to repeat this experience. Seagate has let down the people of Clonmel in an appalling, despicable manner coming up to Christmas.  I hope that the people who came together in Clonmel in the past will do so again successfully in conjunction with politicians, the various agencies and the enterprise boards.  It is <Col N="242" /> an enormous task to replace 1,400 jobs.  My sympathies go out to the workers and their families who are facing this disaster at Christmas.  I hope that every effort made will be more than successful.</P>

      <P>The number of Senators who have taken part in this debate is an indication of the seriousness with which this matter is being viewed.  I am very concerned about what has happened in Clonmel and I commend the Minister on her speedy reaction.  Her reaction to the company's decision indicates that she has a hands on approach.  She did everything she could have done and the House should acknowledge that the Minister and the Government did their best. However, they were dealing with a multinational company which had other concerns.</P>
      <P>I condemn Seagate's behaviour.  However, we have many fine multinational companies and we should not tar them all with the Seagate's brush. There are many fine multinational companies in</P>
      <P>Cork.  We have had our problems.  When one considers Seagate's behaviour towards the 1,400 people employed in Clonmel, the Tánaiste should look again at the arrangements under which the company is coming to Cork.  The foundation on which it based its move to Clonmel was not successful. If a similar foundation is being used for its move to Cork then one must ask if this is a safe and sound company?</P>
      <P>The expectations raised by the various investments announcement by Seagate are quite significant. What has happened is wrong at any time of the year.  Perhaps the investigation announced by the Minister will provide answers as to what went wrong in bringing such a cruel industry to Ireland. We welcome and need inward investment by multinational companies, but we need good investment.  Perhaps we should change the ground rules before locating any company similar to Seagate in any part of the country.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for her speedy reaction to this serious matter.  Someone must pay the price for this decision.  The ball is being tossed from pillar to post and no one seems ready to take the blame.  The blame must lie with someone.  President Truman said that the buck would stop at his desk and the buck will have to stop at someone's desk for this tragedy.</P>
      <P>It is sad that 1,400 workers in Clonmel are facing a bleak Christmas with no future job prospects. Some people say that multinationals are welcome to our shores.  However, these companies are coming to a tax haven offering low corporate tax rates.  They should be vetted before they come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> Some Senators suggested that Seagate's business involved a three year operation.  Someone should have informed the financiers, such as the IDA, that this was a shaky company.  Perhaps they should not have been brought here at all. We might have been better if these jobs had not been created in the first place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the creation of jobs and I compliment the Government on those it has created. Senators have spoken about the Celtic tiger shouting and roaring around the country. However, there is not a &lsquo;pusheen&rsquo; growling in Kerry never mind the Celtic tiger.  Not one job has been created in Kerry in the past ten to 12 years.  We would welcome any employment. Kerry experienced two major blows in the past 12 years.  The closure of Neodata with the loss of 103 jobs was a devastating blow to Listowel.  In the past four or five months the closure of Melchert Electronics resulted in the loss of 35-40 jobs.  This proved the ruination of a small town in north Kerry.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to relocate jobs throughout the country so that everyone shares in the boom of the Celtic tiger.  We have an educated workforce and the space.  On Kerry Radio the former Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, stated that the reason jobs were not being attracted to Kerry was because companies were looking for green field sites.  We have nothing but massive green field sites in Kerry.</P>
    <P>There is something radically wrong with the IDA, because when it invites visitors to Ireland it seems to bring them to the most attractive places situated within the shortest distance from the airport at which they arrive.  It is not inclined to transport them to other parts of the country. There is an airport in County Kerry which cost an enormous amount of taxpayers' money to build.  The county is lacking in major infrastructure &mdash; it does have the best waterway in western Europe &mdash; but it remains undeveloped.</P>

      <P>I am aware that when the IDA invites visitors to Ireland it only takes them as far as Limerick or Galway.  However, they are not brought to County Kerry because IDA representatives believe the distance involved is too great.</P>
      <P>As I stated at the outset, someone must pay the price for this blunder because Seagate was allowed to establish its business in Ireland and given grant aid.  Someone must take responsibility for the suffering of the people in Clonmel.  Who invited Seagate to Ireland?  Who investigated Seagate and carried out research into its operations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the time of year at which this situation has arisen, I feel sorry for the people of Clonmel. I hope a replacement industry can be introduced there.  I compliment the Minister for the honesty she displayed in addressing the House.  I congratulate her for the attempts she made to protect <Col N="244" /> the workforce at Clonmel in a way in which their counterparts at Packard were not protected. Seagate has another subsidiary company in Ireland and I suggest that officials of the Department communicate with it to discover their future plans.  I welcome the debate and I thank the Minister for her swift action.  I hope a replacement industry can be put in place in the near future.</P>

      <P>Níl morán le rá agam, ach ba mhaith liom cúpla poinnte a phlé ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>I join with other Members in sympathising with the workers in Clonmel who are distressed by the announcement of the closure of the Seagate plant.  At the beginning of her contribution, the Minister stated that she was not computer literate when she assumed office.  However, I believe she displayed an impressive grasp of the issues affecting the industry and an understanding of the problems involved and the manner in which they arose.</P>
      <P>The closure of Seagate is a mistake of monumental proportions.  In a situation such as this there is an obvious temptation to point the finger and find a person or parties responsible.  In most cases that tends to be a futile exercise.  Obviously someone will be held accountable.  While the workers have been badly affected, I have no doubt that the management of the company will be obliged to be accountable to its shareholders for the mistake which appears to have been made.  While the closure appears to be a dramatic <i>volte face</i> on the company's part following such a short period, it is involved in an industry where technology changes rapidly.  To some extent, that may mitigate our criticism of its actions.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise two points.  First, it is important that what is a local disaster not only for Clonmel but the entire south-east region and bordering regions does not begin to undermine the information and computer technology industry, which is a very important sector in the country's economic base.  The industry is an important component of the thrust of the country's economic development because we have concentrated on educating and training young people to be able to work in it.  In the circumstances it is important that the industry is calmly appraised to ensure that any lessons to be learned will be taken on board and that necessary changes in policy will be applied in the interests of maintaining the major overseas investment which is vital to employment and the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point involves the IDA.  Some Members remarks may have implied that the Clonmel project was not evaluated properly at the outset.  From my experience, the IDA has a tremendously impressive track record in respect of attracting industry to Ireland.  It competes strongly with agencies in Britain which, in many instances, has access to greater resources.  Despite that fact, the IDA has done exceptionally well.  It is important that the agency should not be <Col N="245" /> inhibited in its efforts by our applying criticism to it in this instance.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a suggestion based on my experience of visiting overseas industries, particularly those in the United States.  Over the years, a strong group of companies from the US have become involved in industrial development in Ireland . There is a need for the overseas section of the Industrial Development Authority to consider closer liaison and communication with the parent companies of multinationals established in Ireland.  I visited the headquarters of a number of these companies and I was informed that while they were examining the feasibility of establishing in Ireland there was close communication and liaison and meetings took place constantly.  The IDA should introduce a <i>modus operandi</i> whereby, subsequent to their establishment, regular contact with the parent companies could be maintained.  This might flag any prospective difficulties well in advance, but it does not apply in this instance because there has been close communication with the company.</P>
    <P>I support the thrust of Senator Taylor-Quinn's contribution.  Everyone in Ireland has the constitutional right to join a union and that right cannot be taken from them.  However, the industrial relations climate in the US does not accord with our system of adopting a partnership approach to business.  The Americans have a major consideration &mdash; and this is not borne out in light of the reality of industrial relations here &mdash; to take into account when establishing in Ireland whether they must recognise a union or make their own arrangements with the workforce involved.  We should not stray into that area in a situation of this sort.  Whether the workforce at Seagate were represented by a union or not, it must be conceded that market realities would presumably have forced the company into its current situation.</P>
    <P>Communications with the workforce is another issue of concern; and this should be addressed in any arrangement between employer and employee, where the relationship is commensurate with the progressive nature of the economy and that of most modern companies.  However, it is important not to introduce red herrings into what is a disastrous situation for the employees of Seagate.  If we do, we will find ourselves at a significant disadvantage with neighbouring countries in terms of the constant competition to attract overseas investors to establish industry in Ireland.  I hope the lessons of Seagate will be calmly and suitably appraised and that any moderation or changes needed in policy will be applied as a consequence.</P>

      <P>I welcome today's opportunity to focus attention on the Government's social housing policy. Decent housing is a necessity of life.  Decent housing for all our people has for many years been, and continues to be, a basic concern of Government.  The Government's Action Programme for the Millennium states our commitment to the deeply held ideal of so many people - home ownership &mdash; and also identifies a number of key priorities which include: a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary housing bodies; improvement and extension of the range of social housing options; refurbishment of existing inadequate housing and action on behalf of homeless people and travellers.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have subscribed to the same broad overall aim for housing policy, which is: &ldquo;to enable every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice.&rdquo; This policy has stood the test of time and has enabled significant development in our response to changing housing needs over the years.</P>
      <P>In the strategy for realising this aim, the guiding principle is that those who can afford to provide housing from their own resources should do so with the aid of the fiscal incentives available, as appropriate.  Those unable to provide adequate and appropriate housing from their own resources should have access to social housing.  In the past this almost invariably meant local authority housing but more recently it embraces a wide range of social housing options.  It is with the needs of those unable to provide housing from their own resources and the response to these needs that I will now concentrate my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of our current social housing policy is based on the 1991 housing policy document &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo; which sets out the range of social housing measures now operated by my Department and the local authorities.  &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo; was, in many ways, a ground breaking document.  It radically redirected social housing policy away from the traditional single solution of building local authority housing.  It brought to the fore many important concepts, such as counteracting social segregation which had not previously been a major objective of housing policy.  It brought choice into the social housing area in a radical way through programmes to expand housing provision by the voluntary sector, including the introduction of the <Col N="247" /> rental subsidy scheme.  It encouraged local authorities to consider systematically the purchase of existing houses to meet needs as opposed to relying almost exclusively on building new housing. By means of the shared ownership scheme, home ownership was made available to persons who previously could not have aspired to owning their own homes.  The plan increased the emphasis on better management of the public housing stock and introduced quality as a keyword in the area of social housing provision and management.</P>
    <P>The social housing landscape has changed radically on foot of the new thinking contained in &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;.  Moreover, there has also been an enormous increase in recent years in the financial resources directed to my Department's social housing programmes.  Capital funding for social housing in 1998 will amount to some £372 million compared to £152 million as recently as 1993.</P>
    <P>Social housing provision has grown in line with availability of finance.  The social housing needs of about 10,000 households are now being met each year compared to just over 6,000 in 1992. We have also seen diversification in social housing output.  Output from the voluntary housing sector is currently almost twice the 1992 level. Over 6,000 households have availed of shared ownership since its introduction.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for housing, my main priorities in the social housing area are securing adequate resources for the various programmes, ensuring that the individual social housing schemes continue to respond effectively to needs and developing, as appropriate, new ways and means of tackling social housing needs.</P>
    <P>The recently published 1998 Estimates of Expenditure reveal an overall provision of £453 million for the housing programmes under the aegis of my Department.  This represents an increase of almost 14 per cent on the estimated expenditure this year.  Local authority housing remains the mainstay of our response to social housing need.  The provision of over £214 million for the local authority housing programme represents an increase of £40 million or nearly 23 per cent on the estimated expenditure for 1997.  This will enable local authorities to meet commitments on their ongoing programmes and to fund a programme of 3,900 new starts or acquisitions in 1998 compared to an outturn of about 3,500 in 1997.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme of the late 1990s is fundamentally different in character to that of previous decades.  A key policy consideration is to provide housing in a manner which does not contribute to or reinforce social segregation.  Local authorities are now providing housing in small, well designed schemes often on infill sites and without recourse, as in the past, to large estates on greenfield sites at the edges of our cities and towns.  This new approach can be crucial in redeveloping rundown areas of our towns and cities.  New housing brings people and <Col N="248" /> life to an area.  The provision of a new infill housing scheme can act as a catalyst for the renewal of an obsolete, rundown or underutilised area.  As well as revitalising our urban centres, housing in infill locations provides a quality environment for residents, especially older or disabled people, in close proximity to shops, churches and other services.</P>
    <P>I also recognise the need to provide local authority housing in rural areas to meet the needs of these areas.  The expanded local authority programme is and should increasingly respond to needs in a much more sensitive, flexible and socially aware manner than in the past.</P>
    <P>The 1998 provision for local authority housing also includes £20 million to get the redevelopment of Ballymun underway.  The redevelopment project, including the provision of replacement housing, is estimated to cost some £180 million &mdash; at 1996 prices &mdash; and to span an eight year period. New housing to replace the existing flat complexes will be the key element in an integrated strategic plan for the social and economic regeneration of Ballymun as a whole.  The redevelopment project will transform Ballymun into a vibrant new town capable of contributing to and benefiting from our current economic and social progress.  The aim of the plan is to get Ballymun working as a town which caters for all local needs, attracts public and private investment, provides employment and embodies a better mix of housing in a rejuvenated physical environment.</P>
    <P>A new company, Ballymun Regeneration Limited, has been set up by Dublin Corporation and is currently overseeing the preparation of the strategic plan in consultation with the local community which is represented on the board of the company and which will be involved at all stages in the implementation of the plan.  The company recently held an open day for all the residents of Ballymun to hear their views on how the redevelopment should take place.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to alleviating the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or insanitary accommodation.  The elderly deserve our special consideration and their needs should be addressed with the minimum of formality and red-tape.  The Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly provides this type of service.  I am, therefore, pleased that an additional £750,000 has been provided in the budget to bring the 1998 provision for the task force to some £5 million &mdash; an increase of 21 per cent on the 1997 outturn.</P>
    <P>This scheme provides assistance for any works that are considered urgently necessary to improve living conditions and, typically, would include necessary repairs and improvements to doors, windows and roofs; the provision of water and sewerage, food storage facilities, etc.  It is funded by my Department but is operated on the ground by the health boards.  The health boards are, of course, the agency primarily concerned with the well-being of the elderly and have been able to use the scheme in conjunction with their other <Col N="249" /> services to the elderly with a minimum of formality and to good effect.  Since its inception in 1982, the housing conditions of some 30,000 elderly households have been improved under this very worthwhile and cost effective scheme.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing sector is now established as a key element in the social housing system bringing with it many unique and positive features and a more diverse and sophisticated approach to meeting social housing needs.  This is particularly the case in our response to special needs such as the elderly, the homeless and people with disabilities.  The voluntary housing sector also encourages people towards a greater sense of responsibility for their own housing and housing estates, encourages co-operation and partnership and helps to foster participation in, rather than alienation from, the local community.</P>
    <P>I recognise and appreciate the great efforts of the many voluntary housing groups in the provision and management of social housing.  With the expansion of the sector in recent years, some voluntary housing bodies are relatively new in the field but some, such as the Iveagh Trust, have been providing and managing housing for the less well off members of our community for over 100 years.  I am, and will continue to be, very supportive of their efforts.</P>
    <P>Recently, there was a regrettable slow down in voluntary housing activity after a period of sustained growth.  The voluntary housing sector provided around 1,000 housing units in 1995 but this declined to just over 900 last year.  This year the best we can hope for is a further 900 completed units.  This downward trend has resulted principally from increases in building costs which have not been matched by improvements in the level of the assistance available under the voluntary housing schemes.  I was aware of the serious difficulty faced by voluntary housing organisations as the gap between what was available under the capital assistance scheme in particular and actual building costs widened.  Accordingly, one of my immediate priorities on taking office was to review the full range of social housing measures with particular reference to the voluntary housing schemes.</P>
    <P>On 13 November last I was happy to announce a comprehensive package of improvements to the range of social housing measures, including the capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes.  The changes made to the voluntary housing schemes were significant and will, I hope, help to restore the positive growth momentum which had been built up but which had faltered over the past year or so.  Bearing in mind the lessons of the past, I will do my utmost to ensure that the levels of assistance available under the schemes will in future remain in line with the real costs faced by voluntary housing organisations.</P>
    <P>The capital assistance scheme has, over the years, focused largely on meeting special housing needs &mdash; the needs of older people, people with disabilities, the homeless.  It is a straightforward <Col N="250" /> effective scheme with a long and successful track record.  I want its success to continue.  I, therefore, increased the maximum assistance for one and two person units from £27,000 to £32,000, and for family type housing, from £33,000 to £40,000.</P>
    <P>In addition, l have also taken the opportunity to refine the scheme somewhat.  It is a fact of life that it is more expensive to provide housing in some locations than in others.  I, therefore, introduced for the first time under the scheme higher levels of assistance in the Dublin area and in the cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. In these areas, maximum assistance of £36,000 will be available for one and two person units and £43,000 for family type housing.  These new limits are £9,000 and £10,000, respectively, higher than what was available prior to my announcement.</P>
    <P>There are, however, other areas where building costs are even higher than in our major urban centres whose needs may in the past have tended to be overlooked.  I refer, of course, to a long standing concern of mine, improving the conditions for the population who live on our offshore islands.  I have seen the regrettable circumstances of elderly persons having to leave their homes and neighbours on the islands often never to return because the type of sheltered supportive accommodation they needed was simply not available on an island.</P>
    <P>I decided that the significant additional costs of transporting labour and building materials by sea to the islands warrants specific recognition under the voluntary housing schemes.  The overall maximum unit cost limits on offshore islands are now £5,000 per unit higher than the limits applying in urban areas.  This means that where assistance of £27,000 was previously available to provide a one or two person unit of accommodation on an island under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme, £41,000 is now available.  The limit for the larger units is going up from £33,000 to £48,000.  I look forward to seeing voluntary housing projects on the islands and, indeed, not solely for the elderly.</P>
    <P>I recognised that these new levels of assistance were overdue.  Accordingly, the increases are being applied to voluntary housing commenced on or after 1 July, 1997.  This is practical recognition in a real sense and a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to those bodies that stuck with their projects in the hope that revised limits would be introduced in a way that would help bridge the shortfall between the actual building costs and what was available under the schemes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rental subsidy scheme, l increased the unit cost limits from £41,000 to £47,000 and the higher limit for certain built up areas from £46,000 to £53,000.  In addition, the limits for the islands will be £58,000 per unit.  I also acceded to a long standing request of the voluntary sector that the management and maintenance allowance be increased from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent.  This applies with effect from the subsidy year commenced on 1 July last.  I believe this is an important development which will help to <Col N="251" /> ensure that adequate funding is in place to provide for the long-term maintenance and improvement of our stock of rental subsidy dwellings.</P>
    <P>In response to concerns which were put to me, l reduced rents under the scheme, both for the tenants and for subsidiary earners.  This is achieved by reducing the basis on which rent is assessed from a current level of 20p in the pound to 18p in the pound.  I also introduced, for the first time, a cap of £20 per week on the rent payable by any subsidiary earner.  These amendments were also backdated to 1 July last.</P>
    <P>I had also been aware that the income limits for the scheme operated in effect to confine the scheme to the lowest income groups and even precluded, on income grounds, some households who could qualify for local authority housing. Accordingly, l introduced two important changes to the eligibility criteria.  First, the current income limit of £9,000 per annum for 75 per cent of tenants in a project was increased with immediate effect to £10,000.  Second, and more importantly, the income limit of £11,000 per annum which applied to the balance of tenancies was removed where the applicant is approved for local authority housing.  As a result, while the scheme will retain its objective of focusing on the needs of low income families, voluntary housing bodies will not in the future be forced to turn away households approved for local authority housing on the grounds that their income was too high.</P>
    <P>One of the most valuable aspects of the voluntary housing movement is the way in which it successfully builds communities and fosters a spirit of co-operation and partnership.  I recognise that it is fundamentally important to the success of housing projects that adequate assistance be available to provide communal facilities.  I, therefore, increased the assistance available in respect of communal facilities from £2,000 to £3,000 per unit of accommodation, backdated to 1 July, 1997.  The previous overall limit of assistance of £80,000 for each rental subsidy project was increased to £100,000.</P>
    <P>The measures which I have already taken are testament to my faith, and that of the Government, in the relevance and future of voluntary housing.  I believe that growth and momentum in the voluntary housing movement will be restored as we move towards the next millennium.</P>
    <P>I have also improved the terms of the shared ownership scheme.  This scheme assists those on the margins of home ownership who wish to own their own home but are unable to do so under traditional mortgage arrangements.  Since its introduction, the shared ownership option has been availed of by more than 6,000 households, many of whom would otherwise have had to rely on local authorities to meet their housing needs. My aim is to continue the success of that scheme.</P>
    <P>Many challenges remain.  At this time of the year, we tend to think particularly of the plight of homeless people.  Since 1988, local authorities have had wide and flexible powers to address the <Col N="252" /> accommodation needs of homeless people.  Generally, they have been making good use of .these powers.  One can get some appreciation of local authorities' increased activity in recent years in this area from the remarkable increase in their day-to-day expenditure on securing accommodation for homeless persons.  My Department recoups 90 per cent of this expenditure to local authorities and recoupments from my Department have grown from about £7,000 in 1989 to £6 million this year.  A significant amount of recent expenditure relates to the provision of emergency accommodation for the increasing number of asylum seekers in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The expansion of local authority and social housing provision in recent years has benefited homeless people in common with other categories of housing need.  The voluntary housing capital assistance scheme has been particularly successful in meeting the accommodation needs of the homeless.  Since my appointment as Minister I have visited several of the Dublin hostels and met the voluntary body personnel operating them.  I was very impressed by the dedication shown by these personnel and, indeed, the response to the needs of homeless people in the Dublin area and elsewhere is very much dependent on the voluntary sector.  I want to pay particular tribute to the many voluntary organisations and individuals who work with, and on behalf of, homeless people.</P>
    <P>I look forward to continued productive partnership between the State and voluntary sectors on behalf of the homeless along the lines of the Dublin homeless initiative, which involves the Dublin local authorities, the Eastern Health Board and voluntary organisations working together to deliver a comprehensive range of services to meet the needs of the homeless.  I recently approved funding of £1.5 million for Dublin Corporation to purchase and redevelop premises in Marlborough Place as a hostel for homeless people.  The corporation will carry out these works early next year.</P>
    <P>There is a need to continue to improve living conditions in social housing estates.  My Department helps improve the physical condition of local authority housing through the remedial works programme and the bathrooms subprogramme. Over £170 million has been made available to local authorities since 1985 for the improvement and upgrading of substandard local authority housing, pre-1940 dwellings and run down urban estates.  In that time, major improvements have been carried out to some 9,500 houses and works are underway or are about to be commenced on a further 6,000.  In addition, local authorities spend some £100 million annually on the maintenance and management of their housing stock.  I encourage local authorities to achieve better value from this expenditure, improved local involvement in estate management and a lasting commitment from tenants to their housing.</P>
    <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, <Col N="253" /> 1997, came into force with effect from 1 July 1997. Its primary purpose is to provide for a range of measures to assist housing authorities and approved voluntary bodies in addressing problems arising on their housing estates from drug dealing and serious antisocial behaviour.  The Act forms part of a wider range of measures undertaken by the Government to deal with the issue of drugs and related crime.  It is designed to assist housing authorities discharge their housing estate management function in a positive manner in conjunction with various other initiatives taken to promote improved estate management.  These new powers are designed to help housing authorities and voluntary housing bodies with the ongoing management of their housing estates. More importantly, however, they are designed to help individuals to live and local communities to develop in an environment where statutory organisations can act against serious antisocial and drug related activities.  A key element in the successful operation of the provisions in the 1997 Act is the need for a co-ordinated approach involving local authorities, other statutory agencies &mdash; particularly the Garda and the health boards &mdash; voluntary housing organisations, tenants and representative groups.</P>
    <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium commits the Government to delivering a new deal for travellers.  I intend to put in place the legislative and administrative framework necessary to deliver the required accommodation within a reasonable period of time.  Legislation, which is urgently being drafted, will impose an obligation on housing authorities for the first time to adopt five year programmes for the provision of accommodation required to meet the needs of travellers.</P>
    <P>Accommodation to be provided will range from standard and group housing to permanent residential caravan parks and transient halting sites.  Assistance will also be available under the improved social housing options, either directly to travellers or to approved voluntary bodies acting on their behalf, to supplement accommodation provided by local authorities.  Accommodation will be built to high standards, and to this end I recently published revised guidelines for residential caravan parks for travellers.  Further guidelines in relation to other forms of accommodation are being prepared in consultation with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group on which national travellers organisations are represented.</P>
    <P>Programmes will be required to address the existing backlog in meeting needs and also to meet the expected increase in demand during their life.  Programmes must be prepared in consultation with travellers through consultative committees to be set up in each area.  Provision will also be made for the public to comment on the draft programmes and to have their views taken into account before the programmes are adopted.  Financial assistance is available to local authorities for improved management and maintenance <Col N="254" /> of halting sites, including the encouragement of pilot initiatives to facilitate greater participation by travellers in this area.</P>
    <P>Supplementation of private rents through the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs's supplementary welfare allowance scheme has assumed a significant role in recent years.  Expenditure on rent supplementation has grown from just £6 million in 1989 to over £80 million in 1997.  Notwithstanding the scale of the cost increase, this form of income support is now recognised as an appropriate and cost effective response to certain social housing needs.  It is important, however, to ensure maximum value for the money spent.  My priority in this area will be to achieve greater ongoing co-ordination between the local authorities and the health boards in the delivery of their local services which impact on housing in accordance with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to maximise co-ordination of housing policy.</P>
    <P>There is significant concern about the affordability of housing having regard to trends in house prices.  As a consequence, I have appointed consultants to undertake a study of the factors underlying recent increases in house prices.  The study will involve an analysis of the main factors influencing increases in house prices since 1994, with particular emphasis on the situation in the Dublin region.  The consultants will also assess likely future developments in the housing market generally and their effects on the affordability of housing.  I hope to have the findings available to me next March.</P>
    <P>However, in advance of the consultants' report, a number of positive steps have been taken.  A special £15 million fund over three years has been established specifically for the purpose of providing water and sewerage services which are required to open up land for housing and other development.  The fund will generate an investment of some £35 million to £40 million in such works over its lifespan.  In addition, in revising the terms of the various social housing measures including the voluntary housing and shared ownership schemes, I was particularly conscious of the need to take account, as far as possible, of increases in house prices and construction costs.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I acknowledge that successive Governments have accorded social housing considerable priority in their programmes.  I intend to continue this priority.  In particular, this Government is delivering on its commitments in the social housing area through increased financial resources, significant improvements to the social housing options and ongoing work in a number of important areas, including affordability of housing and the need to promote the conservation and improvement of the housing stock, both private and public.</P>
    <P>Social housing policy is now about much more than bricks and mortar and the simple numbers game it once was.  It is about building lasting communities and addressing new needs in an appropriate <Col N="255" /> and flexible way as they emerge.  Our responses to these changing needs must constantly evolve if they are to remain relevant.  I look forward to hearing the views of Members of the House on social housing policy today and assure them I will take careful note of what is said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome the comprehensive statement he made on social housing.  The reason we are taking statements on this is because of the recent escalation in house prices.  Members have continually asked on the Order of Business for statements and the Minister said there is a significant concern about the affordability of housing having regard to trends in house prices.</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement comes at an opportune time, especially after the release of a survey yesterday by the Irish Auctioneers' and Valuers' Institute which revealed that house prices have risen by 50 per cent in the past three years and will increase by about 12 per cent in 1998. According to the report, prices soared to an alltime high this year.  The Dublin area outstripped the rest of the country with prices up by 20 per cent over 12 months.  It appears that demand is fuelled by potential housebuyers being compelled to buy houses now, because they are worried about not owning their own house if they do not take action now.  The report expects the average price of a new house in Dublin to reach the magical £100,000 figure by mid-1998.  The average price of a second hand house in Dublin has already reached that mark.  The accuracy of this report was brought home to me recently when a house needing repair in a local authority estate close to where I live was sold for £130,000.  It was one of 250 houses built by Dublin Corporation in 1952 on land which was compulsorily purchased for £16,000.  This shows how huge has been the escalation in house prices.</P>
      <P>In the past year prices rose higher than anyone could have forecast, often confounding expectations. At public auctions houses have reached twice the asking price.  The all-encompassing nature of the boom is underlined by the fact that it is not confined to Dublin &mdash; house prices have also risen in Cork, Galway and Limerick, with the price of second hand houses growing by 25 per cent between 1994 and 1996.</P>
      <P>These figures point to a market thriving against the backdrop of an unprecedented mix of favourable ingredients, with GNP climbing by about 6 per cent per year, employment growing by 2 per cent yearly and markedly subdued inflation.  The demand generated by these factors has been further fuelled by interest rates, which bottomed out at a historic level of 6.25 per cent earlier this year, and the unparalleled willingness of financial institutions to make house loans and house approvals generously available &mdash; some £300 million was available in 1996, an increase of 50 per cent over the 1994 figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> Another factor which must be taken into account is the extremely favourably demographic trends.  The age group from 24 to 39 is the crucial house buying age group and by virtue of the high birth rate in the early and mid-1970s, people of this age are flooding on to the residential property market.  Traditionally a large share of this group has tended to leave Ireland; but now we have a young, well educated and relatively well paid population, supplemented by emigrants returning to Ireland.</P>
    <P>A new study carried out by the Society of Chartered Surveyors indicates that the demand for housing in Dublin will outstrip available supply into the new millennium.  This will increase pressure for fresh rezoning of land and will force the price of new homes in the suburbs further upwards.  The survey indicates that the number of households in the Dublin region is likely to grow by 9 per cent over the next five years.  Should this occur, it will place increasing pressure on housing supply in the greater Dublin area, will require the rezoning of significant new areas for housing to meet the growth in demand, and will lead to further upward pressure on house prices in Dublin. The effect of this growth in demand will also be felt in the counties surrounding Dublin &mdash; increases are already happening in Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  The acute shortage of zoned land in Dublin is inspiring developers to look beyond the city limits to towns such as Delgany, Arklow, Maynooth and Celbridge.  One imaginative estate agent has advertised Tullamore as part of Dublin's new commuter belt.</P>
    <P>With only 3,200 acres of land available for residential building, the stock will be exhausted by 2002 if the current pace of development is sustained. Prices in the capital are likely to come under increasing pressure if demand does not collapse. There is no sign of that happening.</P>
    <P>One of the main factors generating the current level of house prices is undoubtedly the shortage of zoned and serviced land in Dublin.  Many of my fellow councillors have been severely criticised for going against the advice of planners by rezoning land where services were not available. I believe they were right to zone land for housing and now there is a great responsibility on the Government to provide necessary finances to service the rezoned land.  I believe it is not a shortage of land but rather a shortage of serviced land which is causing the escalation of house prices.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Government has initiated a fund to assist local authorities in increasing the supply of serviced land, but is it sufficient in size to meet the urgent need for such land?  The construction industry has identified the lack of available suitable serviced land for development as a contributing factor to escalating house prices.  There is a responsibility on the Government to meet the need by providing for more serviced land as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to one of our building societies which is considering a radical new approach to mortgage lending in an attempt to curb rising <Col N="257" /> house prices which are putting new homes out of the reach of many first time buyers.  The society has been investigating whether it should build apartment schemes as well as advancing &ldquo;part mortgages&rdquo; to suit buyers and help them afford bigger houses.  The part mortgage scheme would allow people who otherwise would not be able to afford to buy their own house to get a foothold in the market.  The institution usually buys the land and builds houses, often in partnership with a builder, and then advances a mortgage on 50 per cent of the house.  At a future date there is an option to buy out the remainder, which is held by the building society.  The scheme has been popular in Britain but unfortunately a key obstacle to this approach is the high price of land.</P>
    <P>As well as providing financial assistance to local authorities to enable them to service housing land, there is a responsibility on the Government to encourage private investment to do likewise. Unfortunately, the restrictions on capital allowances for private investors announced in the recent budget have cast a cloud over the commercial property industry as it moves towards one of its best years since 1989.  The restriction is expected to slow down private investment in commercially developed land and, more importantly, the measures will create great funding problems for commercial projects earmarked for the Dublin docklands, where 1,300 acres of redundant land are due to be redeveloped over the next 15 years.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Dublin Docklands Council, I am conscious of the effect the new ceiling on capital allowances may have in deterring private investors in this particularly run-down area of the inner city.  The docklands area will provide for over 10,500 new residential units and possibly far more, 20 per cent of which will be designated for social housing.  It is clear the new social housing in the docklands will not be two to three storey houses with front and back gardens, such as in were built at City Quay.  The new models on offer will most probably be of four to five storey apartment blocks, laid out around semi-private courtyards where children can play safely.  In its submission to the Dublin Docklands Council in support of 20 per cent social housing, Dublin Corporation warned that water, drainage and sewerage services in the area are not adequate to cater for an extra 25,000 new residents and up to 40,000 additional jobs.  It is imperative that the Government should encourage private investors into areas such as the Dublin Docklands and for that reason I am gravely disappointed that the Government has put a ceiling on capital allowances in the recent budget.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation has had problems with social housing.  It carried out an assessment of housing needs in 1996 which revealed there were 3,000 on the housing list, as well as 300 senior citizens, 143 homeless families, 500 homeless single persons and 58 travellers, and over 900 applicants in private rented accommodation seeking local authority accommodation.  This came to a <Col N="258" /> total of 5,000 applicants on the housing list.  The corporation has revised a number of applicants on its housing list since 1 November 1997.  This revealed that the number of applicants seeking accommodation had increased by in excess of 1,000 households.  There were also 5,000 applicants on the transfer list.  I have no doubt the increase in the numbers on the housing list has been fuelled by the phenomenal growth in house prices in recent times.  A number of young people of modest means could have bought houses in Dublin over the last number of years but the huge increase in house prices has made them unable to do so.  They must therefore apply to the local authority.  Dublin Corporation has a dilemma because there is no building land available in the city for local authority housing.  I encourage the Minister to give special preference to the dockland area, where 20 per cent of houses are allocated for social housing.</P>
    <P>Another worrying factor is the increase in the number of houses being repossessed.  More than one in ten people fell behind in mortgage payments last year and an average of three homes per week were repossessed by building societies, according to figures published recently by the voluntary housing agency Threshold.  Its report, entitled <i>As Safe as Houses</i>, warned that more people would fall into arrears and have their homes repossessed as a result of the property boom.  Huge increases in property prices now mean that the average house costs £35,000 more than a person on an average wage can normally borrow.  This is a serious problem and I urge the Government to provide a mechanism whereby young people may easily purchase private houses or social housing is available to them.  There is a responsibility on the Government to provide accommodation, especially for young couples.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.  I welcome his comprehensive statement on an area of great importance.  I have a simple political philosophy, which is that everybody is entitled to the opportunity to work and the opportunity to have shelter.  It is noteworthy that the House has spent considerable time today talking about the Seagate closure and its impact on the workers, especially coming into the festive season.</P>
      <P>Social housing has become an important element of providing accommodation.  As the Minister of State said, the plan for social housing introduced in 1991 is now operated successfully across the country.  It has made a good contribution to housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a high level of home ownership in Ireland relative to our EU partners and we should be proud of it.  Concern has been expressed about escalating house prices.  It is difficult to see how one can interfere with market forces to change that but we must address the matter. If we fail to do so it may lead to a grave situation in the future.  We must be mindful of what happened in south-east England in the past few years when the property market overheated <Col N="259" /> and led to considerable distress for the many who found themselves with negative equity.  We should take steps now to avoid such a development here.  However, it is not an easy matter to tackle.</P>
    <P>Many years ago a system of certificates of reasonable value was operated by the Department. It was withdrawn because it gave rise to prices being increased in many instances.  Builders found themselves in a position where the certificate of reasonable value certified valuations which were not attainable in the marketplace at that time.  The circumstances in construction industry at that time were the converse of those at present.  I wonder if there is merit in reconsidering that system.</P>
    <P>The private sector has played a part, particularly through the section 27 and section 23 reliefs, in providing good quality private housing. I am not sure if Senator Doyle was correct with regard to the capital allowances and the Minister of State might clarify the matter.  I understood that the change in capital allowances had more to do with the partnership schemes which are often introduced to get tax relief on a hotel or similar construction investment.  I am not sure if it impacts directly on the market.  There was criticism that last week's budget, which I consider to be balanced, favoured the better off.  I do not think that is the case.  People with incomes of £200,000 or £300,000 a year were able to hedge a lot of their income in capital allowances but that has been addressed by the budget in that it will be limited to £25,000.  It is a reasonable step from a taxation perspective and it will not adversely impact on the provision of private housing.</P>
    <P>The capital assistance schemes for voluntary housing are playing a useful role in rural areas.  It is good to see that the level of non-repayable capital funding has been increased and ranges from £5,000 to £15,000.  The Minister of State should be commended for extending the limits for the islands.  It is important for the social fabric of the islands to try to maintain the populations there and we should have a bias in their favour. The island people need all the incentives they can get because they live in disadvantaged circumstances.</P>
    <P>The special grants for community facilities which are an important feature of the social housing scheme are to be increased from £2,000 to £3,000 per unit.  The grant is useful because it bonds the tenants of the schemes together, it gives them more of an identity with the area in which they live and creates more of a community atmosphere within the scheme.  It seems successful and I am at a loss to know understand why it has not been extended to local authority housing estates.</P>
    <P>In many local authority schemes there is a need to create a community feeling.  In my locality I am concerned about the number of people seeking a transfer to another housing scheme because certain of their neighbours are causing a nuisance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> We have made attempts to devise legislative provisions to deal with antisocial behaviour as part of the fight against drugs and we should interpret such legislation more liberally than at present.  If the law needs to be strengthened then it should be.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing compares favourably with private developments; indeed, it is often of a higher standard.  It is imperative that young people who are getting a good start in life in those houses are not deprived of enjoying the State's investment in providing them with a home because one or two people decide they will not conform with proper social behaviour.  There should be a system whereby such people can be removed easily from the houses, as would happen in the private sector if a tenant causes a nuisance to other tenants.  We need to apply the same philosophy to local authority tenants.  There is an onus on local authorities to be more diligent and apply themselves to this problem with more vigour than at present.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rental subsidy scheme for voluntary housing, I welcome the increase in the basic income limits from £9,000 to £10,000 and the provision that 25 per cent of applications may come from people with higher incomes.  This should be promoted by the Department in social housing schemes.  I have come across instances in which the promoters of some such schemes have tried to have everybody in the scheme within the income limits.  These schemes must have a social balance.  People with incomes in excess of these income limits should be part of them as they bring the necessary balance.  Often the leadership of estate or community groups comes from such groups.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decrease in rents from 20p to 18p in the pound.  However, I suggest this be applied to net income, a change which would be compatible with the changes in the budget regarding family income supplement.  Those in modestly paid jobs often find themselves disadvantaged <i>vis-a -vis</i> those on social welfare because the gross income is taken into account to decide on qualification.  This anomaly should be addressed.</P>

      <P>People might become indigent quite quickly if some of the suggested tax bills have to be paid.</P>
      <P>The improvements which have been announced are welcome and &mdash; I do not mean to be begrudging &mdash; overdue.  The spiralling cost of houses has affected the voluntary housing sector as much, and perhaps more, as other sectors.  In many cases house price increases are spiralling because of excess of money chasing limited demand.  The voluntary sector does not have such excess money and is therefore caught in the spiral without being a participant in it; neither does it have the capacity to progress in the market as house owners do.</P>
      <P>For social housing to succeed it needs funding, facts and flexibility.  Funding has to be available while policy has to be based on real needs and be sufficiently flexible when implemented to meet those needs.  The capital side of social housing is extremely well funded.  I am not aware of organisations which want to develop this area of housing being inhibited solely because of the absence of support funding from the State, a fine thing to be able to say.  We have diverged spectacularly from our neighbouring island on this issue over the past 15 years.  We have never abandoned our belief in the communal provision of a variety of housing types for those who need it.  This is a considerable achievement which successive Governments have supported, although I have quibbles about the details.</P>
      <P>There are a number of issues regarding the use of available funding to the optimum extent.  If social housing through the voluntary sector and local authorities for the homeless, an area with which I am familiar, is to be provided, a range of responses are needed.  It is necessary to know what is the problem.  A long standing criticism of the voluntary sector concerns the inadequacy of the various attempts which have been made to assess the level of homelessness.  I imagine there is a vast file in the Department with material from a range of voluntary organisations concerning this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey of the Department of the Environment and Local Government reported that there were no homeless people in one midlands town while voluntary organisations in the same town reported to the Simon Community that there were between 30 and 40 homeless people there.  We can argue about the margins of these figures and the definitions used, but the disparity in figures relating to a relatively small midlands town suggests an anomaly which needs to be addressed.  Counting homeless people is not easy: it takes a considerable amount of imagination, expenditure and resources and it is <Col N="262" /> necessary to expend such resources.  This is an extreme example.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where needs can be identified but responses must be flexible.  The housing needs of single homeless people are different from those discharged from psychiatric hospitals into what is euphemistically described as community care.  In some cases this latter type of housing works well but in other cases it does not work at all.  There is a need for high support hostels for former patients of psychiatric hospitals.  At present such accommodation does not seem to be provided, while existing hostels do not appear to work as they should.  This type of support must be provided if the job is to be done properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister described the internal migration of the elderly from independent housing in rural areas to nursing homes.  There is a serious question about utilisation of resources which are encouraging the construction of nursing homes and the possibility of using similar resources to facilitate the elderly to remain in their own homes through providing the necessary support.  It is a medical fact that the mental and general well being of elderly people who are moved from surroundings with which they are familiar deteriorate.  The elderly live by habit to an extent to which we do not appreciate and the disorientation, however well intentioned, will almost inevitably lead to a deterioration in their general mental capacity to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>We need to remember that an alarmingly high proportion of the homeless in Britain &mdash; approximately 30 per cent &mdash; are Irish, something Senator Mooney mentioned this morning. Another alarming statistic is that, of all the various nationalities who migrate to Britain, the only ethnic group whose health deteriorates is the Irish.  All other groups tend to have higher life expectancies in Britain than in their native countries.  I do not know why the Irish have the opposite experience.  We deal with many of the consequences of this trend as people tend to migrate back home.  As populations age here and in Britain we must examine the scale of future needs as emigrants who have no housing drift back here.  Such emigrants have no homes, no means and perhaps limited incomes.  We must consider how best to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Absent from the capital funding programme is some redress for the considerable burden of maintenance costs which have to be met by voluntary organisations.  This is an issue which is frequently measured and mentioned and needs to be addressed.  People who own their homes know houses are not maintenance free.  We need to consider the longer term.  If such an enormous burden is placed on voluntary housing groups and they are to provide the care we accept is needed, they will not have the resources to do anything else.  They have limited budgets and we must consider the needs which exist.  It is a good idea to ensure that such housing stock remains in good condition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> I am glad the Minister of State mentioned in terms of local authority and social housing generally the need to involve those who live in areas in the plans.  I am involved with a group in St. Michael's flats in Inchicore.  In my adult life I have experienced a number of the more unpleasant sides of the housing problem.  People live in appalling conditions in extremely good and high quality buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some apartments in terms of structure and space are extraordinarily good, but it must be extremely frightening to live in them. However, the extraordinary resilience of the tenants I have met there who want to do something about the problems amazes me most. There is always a need to find out who is involved and working in the community.  It has been suggested to me that some of the schemes involving tenants are more token than real.  A local authority official arrives in an area as the participation officer, assembles around himself or herself tenants who are prepared to be agreeable, calls this tenant self-government and then proceeds to do whatever the local authority wants done with the place.  I do not want to be specific about the location, but Senator Quill may be familiar with similar complaints.  We must ensure it involves real participation and not only another token gesture in terms of direction.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State mentioned travellers.  Their cause becomes fashionable and then less so, but their problems go on forever.  It is the case that greater provision must be made for them.  However, travellers in Cork made a point to me, which is probably true elsewhere, that trust between travellers and those who are supposedly making provision for them is also required.  Travellers in Cork complained to me that the firms which provide security on halting sites also provide security at nightclubs in Cork. They provide information to the bouncers to enable them identify travellers as they attempt to enter nightclubs and tell them they cannot go in. Trust does not exist in such circumstances.  This complaint has been made to me repeatedly.  The people looking after their sites during the day are looking after nightclubs at night.  They are nice to them during the day, but refuse them admission to clubs at night.  This is not the way to build trust and I hope the message goes back that people need more than such treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad that the Minister of State mentioned provision for refugees, although he did not comment on the matter.  Perhaps that is because we are close to reaching a position where a little nasty wave of racism and xenophobia will take over.  Unfortunately, the Government's response to the problem of refugees and asylum seekers and the decision to effectively abandon the Refugee Act are wrong.  It will be seen as a capitulation to a nasty small, but vocal, <Col N="264" /> xenophobic minority in society.  The idea that refugees and asylum seekers are draining the resources of the State in terms of housing or welfare is a myth.</P>
    <P>I wish to address in detail the issue of homelessness.  If we are to deal with people who are homeless, there must be somewhere for them to go.  Despite all the initiatives, there are not enough spaces in Dublin at present to meet the acute housing needs of people in emergency situations.  That is a regrettable fact and it needs to be addressed.  The problem is not necessarily money, but the need to make plans and address it.  The Minister of State mentioned the planned response in Dublin, the Dublin homelessness initiative.  Everybody accepts it is a good idea, although it took a long time for people to trust each other and begin to work together.  Why is there only an initiative in Dublin?  Homelessness is not exclusively a Dublin or urban problem. There ought be equivalent initiatives in every region.  Many bodies need to learn the real meaning of flexibility.  It means that if somebody is homeless at 10 p.m., he or she can be referred by somebody to a rudimentary shelter.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned affordability. However, I am not persuaded that affordable housing and the possibility of it becoming available will be helped in any way by a halving of the rate of capital gains tax paid on the sale of speculative housing developments.  People whose income tax has been already reduced will have more money to invest further in more speculative development housing.  I do not understand how that will do anything.  Others argue otherwise but I believe it will increase the amount of money available to buy houses, push up the price further and squeeze out more people.  It is time to consider how housing costs are accounted for in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to be contentious but homelessness is a consequence of inequality in society.  I very much regret that the Government's first budget has made inequality worse and will ultimately result in the frustration of the good intentions of the Minister of State and the Government.  If inequality  increases, homelessness increases and an increasingly greater need is created.  A major part of the solution to the problem of homelessness is to reduce inequality.  This cannot be done through the type of policy decisions announced in the budget last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and this debate.  I was one of the Members who called for a discussion on housing.  However, I specifically requested a debate on homelessness. I was prompted to do so by a horrible spectacle I witnessed one morning as I left my house for the railway station to take the train to Dublin.  It was one of the frostiest and coldest mornings so far this year and I saw a huge number of people sleeping rough.  It troubled my conscience so much, although not for the first time on this <Col N="265" /> matter, that I called for a specific debate on homelessness.  It is a particular problem which requires a specific set of initiatives.  The Minister of State has already demonstrated a huge understanding of the problem of the provision of homes and a good attitude towards social housing.  I hope the House will arrange another debate early in the next session to discuss the specific problems of the homeless.</P>
      <P>I was encouraged when the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, was given responsibility for the housing section of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  I am aware of his concern and detailed knowledge of housing needs.  I was further encouraged by his speech in Galway to which Senator Brendan Ryan generously referred.  I also received feedback on the speech.  People who are concerned about the provision of housing in my area in Cork assured me that the Minister of State had a solid grasp of what needs to be done and was willing to meet and listen to the priorities set out by those who deal with people who are homeless or at the low end of the housing market.  I heard good praise for the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Some of the speeches made about the recent budget concerned me.  I was not surprised to hear trade unionists asking why percentages were not adjusted, because that is the job I expect them to do.  That is what they are paid to do, and most of them are paid more than we are.  However, it was wounding to hear people relate solutions to poverty by adjusting tax bands and giving people an extra few pounds.  Poverty arises from different circumstances and must be approached differently.  The poverty that leads to homelessness or families living in dire, sub standard housing will not be cured by giving people a little more in the budget, though that would have been appreciated.  That poverty requires infinitely more targeted and specific sets of measures.</P>
      <P>I commend voluntary workers who help the homeless and those in poor housing.  I salute the Sisters of Mercy.  They have abandoned the frugal comfort of their convents and have moved out to live in rented accommodation on housing estates, assisting poor people there.  They help lone parents by teaching positive parenting skills, budgeting, homemaking and housekeeping. Those Sisters are an inspiration to those people, many of whom may have had very little education.  I salute them and thank them for what they are doing.  There must be people in Dublin doing voluntary work such as Focus Point, but I do not have a detailed knowledge of their activities.  However, I salute all those who work in a structured and comprehensive way with those who have very poor housing or no housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State for securing a 14 per cent increase in the capital funding for social housing this year.  I also salute him for securing an increase of 21 per cent for special housing for the elderly.  That is a clear <Col N="266" /> acknowledgement of the growing number of elderly people who have special housing needs.  I also commend the Minister of State for his attitude towards the housing problem. Thankfully, we now have an enlightened attitude towards social housing.  There was a time when a big housing estate shot up, the builder moved out, tenants were allocated and that was that.  That thinking has ended and not before time.  We now know that the provision of a good house means the provision of a good home and good neighbourhood.  It means the provision of a good community that can support families and children.  We must do more than simply shove up housing estates.  We must create conditions where children can grow up in houses with proper heating and lighting.  We must create an environment where they will receive an education, where they will see breadwinners going out to work and where they will get the protection young people need in their formative years.</P>
    <P>There is great potential in the estate management schemes now being introduced. These schemes must be well planned, and those which have worked are those where tenants are hand picked and have had perhaps six months of meetings and education.  That builds their selfconfidence, as some of these tenants are early school leavers.  A good investment is made in the tenants, and then those tenants are able to take over the management of the estate.  This system began in parts of England with a great flourish, but it has withered because there has not been enough planning and investment.  We can learn from that experience.  It is important that we invest in estate management so that the building of communities can, in so far as is possible, be taken out of the hands of council and corporation housing officials.  They should facilitate and not dictate.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that rents have been lowered. That has a direct input in smaller families.  The Conference of Religious in Ireland did not mention that, but it is important in helping to tackle poverty, especially in large families.  The practice of building houses away from the city centre is a bad one.  The initial outlay is often very expensive, and wherever possible we must encourage local authorities to use infill housing. That is where the services and tradition of a neighbourhood resides.  This is particularly true in our cities.  The Cork City Architect, Mr. Neil Hegarty, has been outstanding in identifying areas suitable for infill housing and then putting good quality houses in those areas.</P>
    <P>I have seen the opposite in the Kerry village where I was born and raised.  Kerry County Council's planning there has been very bad.  They will not be surprised to hear me say that because I have told them so many times.  In the last 15 years, a local authority housing scheme has been built on the east side of the village.  There is now a new scheme on the west side of the village, which is dying between them.  There are 11 fine <Col N="267" /> slate-roof houses, built in the 1920s and 1930s, unoccupied on one side of the street.  A number of widows also live in the village, many of whom are over 70 years and some of whom are over 80. In ten years the village will be dead.  The houses there will be vacant, and there will be two new housing estates on either side of the village.  If that planning is not driven by builders, I do not know what is.  It is not driven by proper planners. I cited my village as an example but this is happening around the country.  There has been a good deal of urban renewal but we need village renewal.  Local authorities should buy vacant houses and renovate and let them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State recently made an allocation to a little housing estate in Cork city called Madden's Buildings.  There are three sets of buildings in Cork city, known as Madden's Buildings, Roche's Buildings and Horgan's Buildings, which were built before the foundation of the State.  Madden's Buildings were opened in 1886, the year Parnell was elected as an MP for Cork, and were showpieces at that time.  The tenants were strictly vetted before they were given occupancy.  Although we tend to mock them at times, we could learn from the Victorian era.  Only tenants of good character who could be relied upon to protect their property and provide a good sense of neighbourhood were allowed in. That ethic and culture has lasted to this day. Although the physical fabric of the houses did not keep pace with modern times, people queue up for those houses because of the quality of the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for making one-third of a million pounds available within the past two weeks to enable Cork Corporation refurbish ten houses, which is the second last phase of the refurbishment programme for those buildings. When that work is completed only ten houses will remain to be refurbished.  I am sure the Minister of State will put his hand in the Department's pocket again as soon as possible to get the money required for the remaining houses.</P>
    <P>I told that story to illustrate the principle that fine houses have been allowed fall into dereliction, mainly because the housing programmes are often driven by builders.  From here on, as we face the new century, our housing programmes must be driven by a different set of priorities.  I am very confident about the future of housing when it is in the hands of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.  The House should unite to provide time for a debate on homelessness as soon as possible because that is the most acute part of the housing problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and congratulate him on his portfolio.  I have worked with him over the years, particularly when I was chairman of the General <Col N="268" /> Council of County Councils, and I have always found him to be co-operative.  He always put his hand on his heart when it came to developing the infrastructure of this country.</P>
      <P>I was amused by Senator Quill's remark about housing development in Kerry.  Perhaps she was just referring to the specific area from which she came.  My information is that there will be massive investment in infrastructure in that area in the very near future.  Somebody is trying to bring the DART from Dublin to Kerry.  I am expecting enormous developments in that part of the country.  I agree with her about the development of towns and villages but there have been vast improvements over the past few years in how local authorities deal with derelict sites.</P>
      <P>The quality of our local authority houses is far superior to those in many other countries.  People should be very honoured to receive those houses. In many countries people are housed in large blocks of flats.  Foreigners are amazed when we tell them we provide these houses on a social basis for our people.  Every Government since the foundation of the State should be commended for looking after its people in that way.</P>
      <P>In the past, local authorities built large numbers of houses in vast estates.  I am glad the Minister is now insisting on local authorities providing houses in small, well designed schemes. I was always a promoter of that approach, not only because it encourages tenants to keep their estates in a proper fashion but because tenants who buy their houses and wish to move on in life should be able to sell their house for a reasonable price.</P>
      <P>I am very interested in maintaining rural life. The only way to do that is to continue our housing programme in rural villages, rather than trying to move people into larger towns which have the necessary infrastructure and facilities. The required infrastructure should be put in place in villages to keep rural life alive.  Fr. Bohan and others are trying to assist people to return to rural life but we have an opportunity to keep people in rural areas by building small housing schemes to cater for their needs.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why there has been such a huge increase in the price of houses when inflation and interest rates have never been so low.  There must be something wrong somewhere. The Minister of State must examine why there has been such an enormous increase in the cost of housing.  Landowners or building contractors must be getting fat.  Local authorities always kept the price of their housing at a reasonable level and that must continue.  The only person who can stop the escalating price of houses is the Minister of State by controlling the price of local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quill referred to houses being built on the east and west sides of a village.  However, plots of land do not become available very often in rural areas and when the words &ldquo;county council&rdquo; or &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; are mentioned the price increases enormously. <Col N="269" /> I welcome the 14 per cent increase the Minister of State has given to the housing programme this year, which has gone from £152 million in 1993 to £372 million in the coming year.  That is important in terms of maintaining and increasing our housing stock.</P>
    <P>I am delighted a taskforce has been put in place for special housing for the aid of the elderly.  I am glad the Government is committed to alleviating the housing problems of elderly people living alone and has given £750,000 to the health boards.  The local authorities did not have the necessary resources or mechanisms to carry out small repairs, such as replacing windows and doors, or to install showers.  In such circumstances the local authorities did not have the resources or suitable mechanisms available.  The health boards have removed much of the red tape in these cases.  They will now provide a grant to the local community almost immediately.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister reported a decline in the take up by the voluntary housing groups regarding the provision and management of social housing.  He has expressed the hope that it will increase next year.  Not enough voluntary organisations are aware that a 90 per cent grant is available from the Government for this type of housing.</P>
    <P>There were no grants available for social housing when I first became involved in social housing in my own village 20 years ago.  With the aid of FÁS schemes and voluntary labour I built four social houses for people living in unacceptable conditions.  They were housed in a village with nearby shops and where people could keep an eye on them.  The message is not being sent loudly enough to the social groups.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the homeless, many of whom emigrated 25, 30 or 40 years ago and are now returning home.  I welcome them.  The Kerry Emigrant's Support Group has found many people who were missing for years and living rough in England.  We brought them back to this country and housed them.  That is what social life is about and we must not move away from it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased grants to the islands.</P>
    <P>There are many islands off the coasts of Counties Galway, Mayo and Kerry.  It is a pity such grants were not available when Peig Sayers was alive.  I am sure the Blaskets would not be as derelict as they are today.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State must look at shared ownership where many problems are arising, especially with regard to unmarried persons, including unmarried mothers, and those who wish to build homes on sites provided by their parents. There appear to be legal problems which should be addressed immediately.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the five year programme for travellers which the Minister of State has introduced.  This issue must be addressed. Travellers must respect the facilities and maintain the sites which are provided for them.  Like other citizens they must abide by the law and respect <Col N="270" /> the property of others.  They cannot be allowed to destroy an area and then move away.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on this exciting programme.  I look forward to it being implemented and developed.  He must keep an eye on it and endeavour to control the price of houses and housing stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.  I join with the other Senators who have remarked on Deputy Molloy's elevation to ministerial status.  As a former Minister for Local Government in the early 1970s he is not new to the issue of housing.  He has brought his own experience to bear on his proposals.  I welcome the commitment to social housing in the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>The statement by the Minister of State is comprehensive.  Some £453 million of capital and current expenditure is provided for all housing services.  Capital funding for the full range of social housing services, including local authority houses, has increased to £372 million.  The local authority housing construction programme received £214 million and £20 million for work on the monstrosity at Ballymun.  I commend the Minister of State on that last allocation.  At the time it was seen as the answer to a problem, but the remedy was far worse than the problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made a commitment to provide additional funding for housing on the islands, which are of abiding interest to me.  That is very important.  He has also provided for the additional cost factors involved, which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dan Kiely's remarks on rural housing.  As a countryman living in a town it is important to state that not everybody can live in towns and villages.  As a member of my local authority for 18 to 19 years I am pleased to say it has recognised this.  While we may not be Fr. Bohan in County Westmeath, we have adopted some of his principles.  The ability of local authorities to purchase houses which are already constructed in different parts of their administrative areas is a welcome development. Without that they face the difficulties of acquiring serviced sites.</P>
      <P>It is important to note the recognition given by the Minister of State to the voluntary housing agencies.  As a public representative I record my appreciation of Focus, St. Vincent de Paul and the voluntary housing organisations.  In the early days of my membership of Westmeath County Council I organised a 14 house co-operative.  It is important that this continues because it contributes in a major way to the reduction of housing lists.  It also gives people the feeling that they are providing their own home.  Those involved in housing co-operatives know that there must be a commitment and ongoing proof of ability to save.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My local authority area has difficulty dealing with disruptive tenants.  I have found that, more often than not, rather than seek a transfer <Col N="271" /> because of overcrowding applications are made to move away from disruptive neighbouring tenants.  That is a scandal and it is unacceptable. The Minister of State should liaise with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister of State has made a commitment to the travelling community. I have been a member of Westmeath County Council since 1979 and it has a proud tradition of catering for the housing needs of the travelling community.  Local authority houses should be given to those who need them most not to people who would buy and sell us all.  I will relate to the House one experience I had some years ago when I and others found it difficult to get a house for a member of the travelling community in Mullingar.  The first evening he came to my house it was raining heavily and he was so wet I offered to drive him back to his accommodation.  He said no because he was already wet.  However, the real reason was that he had a £40,000 vehicle parked on the road beside his local authority house. Imagine the fool I and my other colleagues felt who had worked so hard to get him a house.  We must eliminate that practice from our society.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quill that we should have a debate on homelessness.  We should differentiate between the people who are homeless because they do not have the resources to provide their own accommodation and those who are homeless by choice.  Many people who are not members of the travelling community, but are transient traders, park on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely and others referred to housing prices.  Successive Governments have improved the measures to assist people purchasing their own houses.  Although grants to new house owners have been improved over the years, there has been a corresponding rise in house prices.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned poverty.  We should differentiate between poverty and the inability of people to manage resources, which has a knock-on effect on housing.  That is why many tenants fall into arrears and why we see so many notices to quit on council agendas.  I want to express my appreciation for the Presentation Sisters and the Sisters of Mercy &mdash; Sr. Finbar Breslin and Sr. Kathleen Maguire in Mullingar are two examples &mdash; who explain to people the concept of resource management.</P>
    <P>I also want to express my appreciation for residents associations which have a pivotal role to play in estate management.  Parental control in housing estates is of the utmost importance.  It is grossly unfair, particularly at Halloween, for teenagers to annoy other residents.  I know I was young once but there is a code of practice which should be adhered to in housing estates.  There are a number of such tenants in local authority houses and something must be done about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come a long way since he and I served on the Association of Municipal Authorities <Col N="272" /> of Ireland some years ago.  I welcome the resources for the elderly.  However, the essential repairs grant is restrictive; it is almost not worth applying for.  I ask the Minister to examine that and to relax the criteria for applicants.  Perhaps he will also consider increasing the meagre sum provided for such repairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their valuable contributions to this debate on the Government's social housing policy.  I want to express my appreciation for the broad welcome for the measures introduced by the Government and the approach we are taking.  I am pleased I have the support of my colleagues in Government for the increased funding which is required to ensure that the objectives I have outlined will be achieved.</P>
      <P>Many valuable suggestions were made during this debate which will be taken into account.  I will be happy to act on as many of them as possible.  I agree with Senator Glynn's comments about the essential repairs grants.  I will review the operation of that scheme.  The disabled persons grant also needs to be reconsidered.  These are two excellent schemes.  The essential repairs grant is not available in all circumstances and is of little use in urban areas where similar problems exist.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Senator Brendan Ryan's generous words which were expressed in Irish.  From the first day he came into the Seanad, he has fought a long campaign to get the Houses of the Oireachtas to focus on homelessness.  He deserves great credit for achieving that.  I am glad he is back in the Seanad after being absent for some years.  I hope I will be able to fulfil the expectations he and his colleagues in the voluntary housing organisations have expressed in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the State has relied for so long on voluntary organisations to look after those at the lower end of the social housing scale. The State has not lived up to its full responsibilities in this area.  It is helpful and beneficial that many good people in our society have organised voluntary housing organisations to tackle the difficult problems at one end of the housing spectrum. The religious orders, which Senator Glynn mentioned, and many other people have dedicated their lives to providing better facilities for the homeless and their families.  They deserve great credit for their work.  The State must support them and become more involved in housing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The positive message I want to reiterate is that this Government is committed to a well resourced, high quality social housing programme. I have outlined what we have done in the first six months.  I hope we will be able to continue that level of support and make major inroads into helping to solve the problem.  Bearing in mind the wide range of housing assistance schemes in existence, there should not be any <Col N="273" /> need for involuntary homelessness.  However, that is not facing reality.</P>
    <P>Many unfortunate people fall through the housing safety net for whatever reason.  Rent subsidies are available from health boards to assist people pay for accommodation.  This costs millions of pounds but it is money well spent. However, there are still people who are unable to avail of schemes which would help them avoid becoming homeless.  In some cases people sleep on the streets out of choice even though schemes exist to provide them with comfortable overnight accommodation.  This is part of the difficulty.  Voluntary organisations and statutory authorities play a huge role in tackling this problem and I am grateful to the housing officers and those who work in housing departments in health boards for their dedicated work.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh raised the possibility of controlling new house prices through the certificate of reasonable value system.  I was the Minister who introduced this certificate in 1971.  It was an attempt to control a similar situation where house and land prices were rising and affordable housing was no longer a choice for many people.  One cannot control house prices by dealing with only one aspect.  New houses are not the only houses for sale on the market &mdash; a greater number of second-hand houses are sold.  These houses are determining prices and there is an interrelationship between new and second-hand houses.  If operated successfully, a certificate of reasonable value scheme might eliminate excessive charges by builders.  One would have to buy new houses at a lower price and then go into the second-hand market to make a profit.  It is a complex question.</P>
    <P>Many factors influence house prices and this is why I appointed consultants to look at this problem. Supply and demand is the ultimate factor. However, we need to find out what is clogging up the supply and what is creating the demand where people seem willing to commit so much of their income to paying for houses.  The market is testing people's willingness to pay these sums and this is feeding into higher prices.  A substantial increase is expected in the number of new families in the next three to five years.  These people will expect to buy a house but they are gasping at the thought of paying so much for a mortgage.  As Minister I have a responsibility to ensure that the matter is looked at carefully and that we take whatever steps possible to influence the situation.</P>
    <P>One possible step is to increase the money available for water and sewerage schemes to try to accelerate the flow of serviced land into the market.  If we can increase the flow of land we might take some of the heat out of the demand. Prices will rise if there are more bidders than there is land available.  We are not just waiting for the consultants' report at the end of March. People may feel that this report will gather dust like so many other reports, but we are taking action in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>The deregulation of financial markets and increased competition among lending agencies <Col N="274" /> have greatly benefited borrowers.  However, this is a complex question and we are not going to come to a simple solution today.  Some Senators mentioned the necessity for high quality planning, the effect of housing on the end of villages and the need to seek sites for in-fill development. There was also support for the concept of moving away from large housing schemes towards smaller schemes where there would be a better social mix.  This would avoid some of the problems of the past.  We will continue to make a major contribution in this respect.</P>
    <P>I hope to introduce a Bill after Christmas which will place responsibilities on local authorities to draw up five year programmes for the provision of suitable accommodation for travellers.  In the event of members not fulfilling this statutory obligation, the duty will fall on the managers to proceed with the preparation and submission of plans to the Department for funding.  The Government is committed to implementing the report of the task force on travellers and is allocating substantial sums of money for this purpose - £6.5 million in 1996, £9 million in 1997 and we have provided £11 million in next year's Estimates for the provision of accommodation for the travelling community.  This money cannot be spent unless local authorities produce proposals and forward them to the housing section of the Department for approval.  I hope they will respond to their new responsibilities and that a major national effort will be made to provide housing for travellers within five years.  That is the intention of the Bill and I am committed to achieving it.  It was prepared by the outgoing Government and supported by the present Government so I hope it will have an easy passage and that it will facilitate a serious attempt to draw up development plans for housing the travelling community.  A substantial level of funding will be made available over the five year period.</P>
    <P>Many Senators called for a separate debate on homelessness.  I recognise that homelessness is part of the social housing issue and I would welcome the opportunity to debate it at a later stage if the House so wishes.  Tackling homelessness is one of my priorities.  Some people are unable to avail of the emergency accommodation which is provided.  We want to see a society in which people are happily established in comfortable homes, enjoy privacy, where their families can visit, where they can rear children and where single people feel that they are wanted and can participate in their communities.  A broad mixture of housing, from communal accommodation to single dwellings with one or two bedrooms, to ordinary housing schemes, is required.  We must keep the community aspect of housing in mind at all times.</P>
    <P>That leads me to comment on a problem with which I have become familiar, namely, disruptive tenants causing major difficulties for peace loving families living in housing estates.  Unfortunately, this has become an issue which must be tackled. It will not be easily tackled and the resources of <Col N="275" /> many of the statutory bodies, working in tandem, will be required.  It is outrageous that vulnerable people living in housing estates in some cases feel they cannot enjoy the peace and contentment of their homes because of a small minority of individuals who are permitted to act in a disruptive fashion.  These people break windows, bang on doors and shout at elderly people.  This action is disruptive and unpleasant and leads to people wanting to move away from the neighbourhoods in which they live.  This is a new phenomenon and there is no point in stating that it does not exist. I do not know why it has crept into our society but it is of concern to everyone.  The fact that it was mentioned during the debate confirms my view that it must be given a higher priority than heretofore.</P>
    <P>In many cases, single people or unmarried mothers living alone feel terrified because they do not know when their front door will be burst in by a group of blackguards.  The growth of such harassment is frightening and we must ensure that the relevant agencies give close consideration to how we might deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I recognise that social housing needs and circumstances are constantly changing.  In the coming years I will be working on the continued development of the policy and on the delivery of various programmes.  Where necessary or appropriate, I will be glad to change existing programmes or introduce new ones.  I am open to suggestions from Members of either House in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the delivery of the various social housing programmes, I particularly rely on the local authorities which are developing their enhanced role <Col N="276" /> as social housing facilitators, in addition to being direct providers of social housing in their areas. As already stated, I also rely heavily on the voluntary bodies and I am glad to be able to have their help and assistance.  I appeal to all elected representatives in both Houses and in our local authorities to ensure that the full potential of the social housing measures is achieved.  If there is any way we can help to disseminate further information in respect of the facilities available to ensure that they are used to the fullest extent, we will do so.</P>
    <P>Members may not be aware that we have set aside a number of local authority housing starts for rural resettlement organisations.  My Department is assisting the Jim Connolly organisation in that way.  A large number of rural dwellings are funded through the local authority starts.  I am fully conscious of the need to ensure that rural Ireland is supported in the housing programme by facilitating as many people as possible in their wish to continue to live in towns, villages and rural hinterlands.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their contributions to this important debate.  I look forward to the challenge ahead and I hope that, together, we will be able to work toward major advances in this area.  I look forward to discussing these issues with the House at a later date.</P>
