    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1 will take all Stages and 20 minutes per speaker with the agreement of the House.  The Minister will speak for ten minutes and other speakers will have five minutes, if that is agreed. There will be a short discussion on item 2 and speakers will have five minutes or more if required.</P>
      <P>Item No. 3 will be taken from 6.30 p.m. until 9.30 p.m.  This is the motion on which Senators Kiely and Dardis have been seeking discussion for some time.  I suggest 20 minutes per speaker with the Minister to conclude no later than 9.15 p.m.</P>
      <P>I want to draw attention to item No. 4 on today's Order Paper.  I had hoped to deal with that tomorrow but, for two reasons, I am proposing not to do so now.  There are two net issues to be decided in that Bill.  The first is a contact register.  There is a Supreme Court case pending which will be material to the shape of the Bill. Senator McGennis, at the conclusion of Committee Stage, asked that Report Stage not be taken until the Supreme Court decision was available.  I understand the case is due to be dealt with in the Supreme Court at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The second reason concerns the difficulty in relation to the adoption of Paraguayan children. There is a major legal difficulty here in that the proposed amendment is not, in the opinion of the Attorney General and his staff, constitutional. This matter concerns children and their parents and it is important that we get the right answer in this case.  There are other possibilities which the Office of the Attorney General is currently examining and I have conveyed them to the parents involved.  Hopefully a resolution of the human problem can be attained through those discussions.  It does not make sense for the House to proceed with the Bill against the advice of the Attorney General and in the light of Senator McGennis's request.  If, after the election, this Government is back in office, as I expect it will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is obviously a doubt creeping in about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I will immediately seek the agreement of the House to reinstate the Bill on Report Stage.  I am sure that, if there is a change of Government, the new Leader of the House will be amenable to that and will have the full cooperation from the Opposition benches.  I will not be proceeding with item No. 4 on the Order Paper tomorrow.  If the Party Whips or group leaders wish to discuss the matter with me further I will be happy to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be disappointment that the Adoption Bill will not be dealt with tomorrow. However, the House must be led by the Leader's advice.  Whoever will be Leader on this side of the House after the election will, I am sure, concur with the Leader's views that the Bill would be reinstated at Report Stage following the anticipated Supreme Court decision.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader outline his intentions for the remainder of the week?  Is it his intention, in view of other events, that this will be the last week the Seanad will sit this session?</P>
      <P>Last week a report was published on the detrimental effects of Sellafield pollution reaching Canadian waters.  The House has, over a number of debates, been very supportive of the Government's moves to bring about the closure of Sellafield. That is an issue we should be taking up with our Canadian counterparts to highlight this issue, bring it on to the international stage and bring the closure of Sellafield nearer.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Bohan, raised the issue of refugees, their welfare payments, accommodation and so on last week.  He may have underestimated the real effects of the situation.  We heard today that a social welfare unit in Dublin had to be closed yesterday after a mini riot.  The trade union has now decided that the social welfare officials will not handle the work at this centre. I know the Garda is extremely concerned about this and I have been made aware that there was a designated unit which dealt with this issue but it no longer exists.  While I am aware that that is an operations issue, I ask the Leader to inquire, through the Minister, the commissioner's view on the present situation.  It may be necessary to establish what is called a red unit which, in the past, dealt with immigrants coming through our air and sea ports.</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, the chicken alluded to in today's national newspapers was a spring chicken and as everybody knows, a spring chicken never goes out of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the business of the week and Senator Wright's, I hope that whatever happens elsewhere the business of this House will continue.  I am sure the Leader recalls that in 1992 when a previous Government tried to ram through legislation with unholy haste in the time between the dissolution of one House and the <Col N="831" /> election of the other, he and those on the Independent benches walked out in protest.  The legislation at issue then concerned the Central Bank and building societies.  I hope the Leader will plot his course in the context of this House being in session.  The process of legislation and democracy should continue beyond the dissolution of the other House.</P>
      <P>I am disturbed by what the Leader said about the Adoption Bill.  The amendment he referred to was put down by me on Committee Stage and was supported by Fianna Fáil.  It is down on Report Stage in the names of Senator McGennis and myself.  I have met the people who hope to become adoptive parents of Paraguayan children and I know they will be devastated by this decision.  I have listened closely to both sides of the House giving a commitment that this matter will be dealt with on the election of a new Government.  This is heartening but I have seen this development before.  For example, there was a change in Government during the passage of the road traffic legislation in 1994 and the speeches from some Fine Gael Members changed dramatically when they crossed to the Government side.</P>
      <P>Many people will be upset that the Bill will not be processed before the election.  The question of Paraguayan adoptions is causing heartbreak, worry and concern.  Why can we not take Report Stage, accept the amendment and if it does need to be changed a new Government can do that in the other House if the result of the Supreme Court case causes difficulty?  The current legal mess could be tidied up in this way.</P>
      <P>I cannot comment on the constitutional implications but we need to give hope to parents who want to adopt and who have adopted Paraguayan children but who do not have legal recognition for the adoption.  I am upset about this and I ask that the decision be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Adoption Bill will not be passed through the House tomorrow. The Bill has been on the Order Paper for some time and I am concerned that it be passed as quickly as possible following the election of a new Government.  As Senator O'Toole said, the parents involved are very concerned about their legal situation and they had hoped the Bill would be dealt with during the lifetime of this Seanad.  I ask the Leader to give a commitment similar to that given by Senator Wright that this legislation will be processed as quickly as possible following the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Thursday we will deal with the Health Compensation Tribunals Bill which will put on a statutory basis the tribunal setting the compensation to be paid to those people infected by hepatitis.  The only outstanding matter in relation to this issue that remains to be dealt with is the State's strategy which was followed in the case against the late Brigid McCole.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, should this week publish details <Col N="832" /> and answer questions about the State's legal strategy in the Brigid McCole case.  This is important because all the other matters that have been fought for over the last three years would appear to have been granted, but this one outstanding issue is most important.  I would like to see it being dealt with before the end of the current Government's term in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago I asked that law and order should not be an issue in the forthcoming election.  It was an innocent enough request and obviously a naive one.  However, I rise now to plead that the peace process should be dropped from the electoral exchanges that are taking place.  Most of these exchanges are coming from the leader of a political party here.  How does he think the people of the North feel when they hear politicians down here saying &ldquo;We can settle the peace process better than you can&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>An impartial observer would wonder how a State that is contiguous with such a tortured and troubled state as Northern Ireland could carry on in this way during an election.  Britain has just been through the most vituperative election this century.  They tore one another apart with personal attacks, yet the bipartisan policy on the peace process remained rock solid throughout the election.  Is that not some sort of a lesson for politicians here where they are so much more concerned about the North?  I know for a fact that they feel more about the North.</P>
      <P>I am making a plea to politicians here, particularly senior politicians on the Opposition side, reminding them that the peace process is an attempt to cut down the rate of killing and injury in the North.  It is not a means of building a politician's reputation, whether that politician is a past or present leader.  Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to point out to the public the dangers of bringing the peace process into an election fight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that is one issue on which all parties in the House are united; to bring about peace through reasonable and proper understanding and negotiations between all the political parties.  I would remind Senator McAughtry that has been the base line of our policy for well over 20 years; agreement between Governments, between North and South, and agreement within the divided communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the means by which it is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That total commitment will remain the constant theme of our parties.  Continuing sectarian murder of the kind we have seen, which would be a blight on any land, should renew our commitment to bring about the terms for lasting peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan mentioned the Bill that will come before us on Thursday.  In the course of that <Col N="833" /> debate I hope the Minister for Health will deal with the statement he made yesterday, which is at odds with the experience of every practitioner in the Law Courts, including myself.  The Minister indicated yesterday that because he had been advised the State had no liability, he was not in a position to admit liability.  He must surely know that the fact that liability is formally denied in pleadings is no bar whatsoever to a settlement agreeable to both sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any need to give notice to the Minister.  The Senator will be able to give proper notice and will be entitled to make all these comments, and more, on Thursday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should observe the rules and procedures of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take that correction from Senator O'Toole who indulges himself every day by engaging in long statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Observe the rules and procedures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole.  As a matter of record and procedure, the vast bulk of cases listed in the High Court, even where liability is formally denied in the pleadings in the pretrial documents, are agreed by way of settlement by counsel on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement that he was pre-empted or prevented from doing that is palpably contrary to practice and procedure, never mind contrary to the human considerations that any Minister should bring into place.  I hope we can discuss that issue.</P>
      <P>The final issue with which I want to deal would not be quite relevant to the first item on today's Order Paper, that is, the Youth Work Bill, 1997, but it touches on it.  Colleagues will be aware that one of the biggest issues for young people who may be taking up employment for the first time is the prohibitive cost of motor insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take advice from Senator O'Toole how to raise matters which will not get any reaction from the Chair.</P>
      <P>We must all be conscious of the fact that young people are prevented from getting motor insurance because of prohibitive overloading by insurance companies.  I am simply suggesting that the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister the need for a procedure which would allow young people to satisfy, perhaps through special driving courses, the conditions which would give them the same right as every other citizen to be insured so that they will not be faced with these prohibitive costs.  They are being severely discriminated against.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>During the week a popular morning radio programme allowed a lady ten minutes to castigate the Garda Síochána for being unreasonable when a garda stopped her for driving an untaxed car.  The big BMW was 12 months on the road untaxed.  Gardaí have a tough enough job to do without radio presenters giving such people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask RTÉ where is the balance?  Why was a member of the Garda Síochána not asked to give the other side of the story?  It is scandalous that RTÉ is using its air time in this way.  The main reason was that the presenter wanted to be critical of the zero tolerance policy.  If zero tolerance ensures that cars are taxed, I am all in favour of it because there are far too many cars without tax or insurance on the roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am repeating what was said on RTÉ.  Senator Magner should make his statement. I will sit down and let the Senator make his point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not interrupt anybody.  All I would ask is that the rules of reasonable debate <Col N="835" /> be applied so that people can make their point.  It is sad that we cannot get that in this House.</P>
      <P>It was grossly unfair to use air time to castigate gardaí who are doing their job efficiently and properly.  I ask that there be balance in future. When such a person is being interviewed, the presenter should have somebody give the other side of the story so that we can hear the two sides on the same day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the plea to those involved in sectarian killings in Northern Ireland to cease their actions because they have not achieved anything.  I hope the House will be unanimous in its condemnation of these acts.  I do not take kindly to Senator McAughtry's statement that he wants to give advice to senior Members of the Opposition, among whose number I count myself.  I thought the Senator was elected to the Seanad to advise the Government on how best to tackle the problems in Northern Ireland.  Either Senator McAughtry or the Government has failed miserably during the past two years because matters are at a standstill.</P>

      <P>Concern has been expressed about the proposed amalgamation of Grand Met and Guinness.  This will have major consequences in Kilkenny, Waterford, Dundalk and Dublin.  It is suggested that there will be no impact on employment but, if we consider what happened during past amalgamations and rationalisations, there is no doubt that jobs will be lost.  In excess of 300 jobs have been lost in the brewing industry in Kilkenny during the past number of years.  The industry is now doing well as a result of the introduction of new products.  However, given the size of the proposed amalgamation of Grand Met and Guinness, I fear that the directors involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to raise two further points.  There has been an appalling earthquake in Iran and approximately 10,000 have been killed.  I compliment the Government for sending its first tranche of aid.  I sincerely hope people are as generous with aid to Iran as they have been to other areas and that they will forget there may be difficulties associated with its Government.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the aid agencies involved that we must look at the humanitarian problems caused by the earthquake, even though certain people might not agree with the country's politics?</P>
      <P>In view of what has been said about the North, Senators should compliment the courageous stance taken this morning by the Church of Ireland Archbishop, Dr. Eames, when he suggested that the Orange Order should look at their rules which state that they cannot talk to Roman Catholics. He got involved in an attempt to eliminate the problem in the North where Catholics and Protestants are being killed without reason.  This problem was again highlighted this morning.  We send our condolences to the family of the chairman of the GAA club in Derry for the loss they suffered as a result of another sectarian attack.</P>

Many people on all sides, including Fianna Fáil Taoisigh, have made heroic efforts to try to settle the Northern Ireland question.

      <P>First, I will address item No. 4 on the Order Paper which was referred to by Senators Wright, O'Toole and Honan.  It does not give me pleasure to ask the House to postpone the completion of the Bill.  As I said, there were two reasons for doing this.  Senator McGennis requested that we do so in light of the Supreme Court case where it was indicated the Bill would be examined.  The Attorney General has given strong advice that the amendment proposed is unconstitutional and clearly no Government can go ahead with such a proposal.  Senators Wright, O'Toole, Honan, McGennis and I have been active on this issue.</P>
      <P>This is not like an ordinary Bill which might be shunted to one side in the course of a change of Government.  There is a possibility that the problem which is of vital importance to a small number of people can be addressed in a legally safe way.  I cannot be expected to put a Bill which is not legally and constitutionally safe through the House.  The Department, the Attorney General and I are committed to resolving this problem.  I give a solemn commitment that if this Government is returned to power and I am back in this position, the Bill will be reinstated on Report Stage on the first or second day of the first session. Senator Wright has indicated he will give the same commitment if the Opposition is in power.  It is a human problem which I want to resolve in a proper manner and one which will last.  I thank Senators for their understanding on this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wright raised the business for the rest of the week.  It is as circulated by the Whip.  I hope we can complete outstanding business on <Col N="839" /> Friday, presuming that events in the other House, in which we take a small interest, take place on Thursday.  I give Senator O'Toole an undertaking that business will not be steamrolled through a depleted Seanad.  I am sure the same will apply to the Opposition.  The events in 1992 should not have happened and I am sure they will not happen again.</P>
    <P>Senator Wright also mentioned Sellafield.  His suggestion is constructive, as is his interest in the subject, and I will convey it to the relevant Minister. I suggest that the issues raised by Senator Bohan last week would be more appropriately dealt with as Adjournment Matters, which may elicit a speedy response.  There will be a full possibility for discussion on the points raised by Senator Honan and Senator O'Kennedy in the debate on Thursday.  Senator McAughtry made his case well and fearlessly and it does not require further comment.  Senator O'Kennedy referred to the Youth Bill.  There will be an opportunity to make the related points about insurance.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Farrell about the interview to which he referred.  There is a danger that comments can be made on phone-in programmes without any great degree of responsibility.  They can be unfair to politicians.  Many of us have been the subject of these comments and are not in a position to respond.  Comments are left hanging in the air.  I heard the interview and given what has now transpired, the question has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Townsend raised difficulties on the Carlow-Kilkenny border.  I did not catch the full import of what he said but I will obtain a copy of his contribution and refer it to the relevant Minister. Senator McGowan raised Northern Ireland. Senator Lanigan raised the merger of Grand Metropolitan and Guinness.  This House does not have any involvement in that but I take his concerns on board.  His point on the earthquake in Iran was more relevant.  It is important that whatever distaste people have for the Iranian regime should not be allowed interfere with humanitarian considerations.  I am glad Senator Lanigan raised the outspoken, courageous and timely statement by Archbishop Eames this morning, which deserves the support of all parties in this House.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Senator Magner which do not need any elaboration. Senator Rory Kiely raised a question of which I was not aware.  However, the murder to which he referred must be condemned by all people and sympathy must be sent to the family.  We are all concerned about the spate of horrific and mindless sectarian killings in Northern Ireland in the past couple of days.  It is one of the worst symptoms of a society close to anarchy that we have seen for a very long time.  The condemnation and sympathy of all sides of the House goes out to the relatives concerned.  With Senator Burke, I commend the Department of Education for setting up the new examination review body.</P>

    <Title>Youth Work Bill, 1997: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to propose the Youth Work Bill, 1997, to the Seanad.  Since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for Youth Affairs I have accorded priority to the policy aspect of my youth work responsibilities. The Seanad has the opportunity today to debate this ground breaking legislation aimed at giving a sound framework to the provision, co-ordination, monitoring, evaluation and development of youth work programmes and services.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the result of many years of effort entailing detailed research, consultation and discussion among everybody interested in youth work.  The Bill is of considerable historical significance in the Irish youth work context.  Some historical events are chance happenings.  However, many do not just happen but must be deliberately planned.  This holds true for this Bill because it arose directly out of the December 1994 policy agreement, A Government of Renewal, made between the three parties that form the Government. That policy document included a particular commitment to prepare a Bill to provide a specific, detailed legislative framework for youth work.  This undertaking was repeated in the chapter on youth work in the 1995 White Paper on Education.</P>
      <P>These Government statements on legislation for youth work were inspired in large measure by the benchmark Irish youth work document, the report of the National Youth Policy Committee, chaired by Mr. Justice Costello, which was issued in September 1984.  Although the Government then in power included in its December 1985 document, In Partnership With Youth, a commitment that legislation would be introduced for youth work, there was, regrettably, little progress between December 1985 and December 1994 on the issue of specific legislation for youth work, with the notable exception of the rejected Private Member's Bill introduced by Deputy Deenihan in 1990 while my party was in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, although the period between December 1985 and December 1994 saw little or no advance on the issue of specific legislation for youth work, useful work was done in related areas.  For example, an excellent report was presented in November 1993 by the consultative group on the development of youth work to my predecessor as Minister of State, Deputy Aylward. That report made a number of recommendations on the development of youth work, particularly with regard to definitions, underlying principles, characteristics of youth work, evaluation and youth work structures.  This Bill draws <Col N="841" /> to a significant degree on the consultative group's report.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, although I set to work soon after my appointment as Minister of State, the job of producing the Youth Work Bill, 1997, took longer than expected, as all of us involved soon realised the implications of the rather complicated and lengthy procedure that is a normal feature of the legislative process.  Quite simply, these things take time.</P>
    <P>One reason for the delay was the evident need for me to outline my vision for the future of youth work, which I did in a chapter of the April 1995 White Paper on Education, and following that publication there was a clear case for further research, consultation and discussion.  Accordingly, I wrote in June 1995 to all the relevant bodies in order to give them the opportunity to present written observations on the youth work chapter of the White Paper.  In addition, my officials and I met representatives of several of the interest groups that made submissions.  In particular, we had especially valuable discussions with the National Youth Council of Ireland. Other important research was also undertaken, such as the obtaining of information on the legal and administrative framework for the provision of youth work services in Northern Ireland and England.</P>
    <P>Following full consideration of the submissions, the meetings and the research to which I have referred, and having undertaken detailed consultation with other Departments, the Government approved, on 2 July 1996, the general scheme of the legislation that we produced.  The parliamentary draftsman provided us with the draft Bill in December, 1996.  After some concluding liaison since the start of the current year between my Department and certain other key Departments, the Government approved the final text of the Youth Work Bill on 25 February 1997.  The way was then clear to publish the Bill on 5 March.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill has a number of important features.  First, it gives a clear legal definition to youth work.  For the first time, this Bill provides a clear mission for youth work by defining it in section 2 as being a:</P>
    <P>programme of activity that is designed for the purpose of providing developmental and educational training so as to assist the personal and social development of young persons which</P>
    <P>(a)  requires the voluntary participation of young persons, and</P>
    <P>(b)  is complementary to academic or vocational training.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Youth Work Bill sets out the responsibilities of the Minister for Education and of the education boards regarding youth work.  In the first instance, the Bill formalises the Government's commitment to youth work because by setting out the Department's policy, co-ordination, budget, research, monitoring, assessment <Col N="842" /> and consultative functions, it will represent a clear and unequivocal Government commitment to the performance of youth work functions now performed on an informal and <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Second, the Youth Work Bill through stipulating that each education board will, in so far as it is practicable and within the financial resources available to it, ensure the provision of youth work programmes and services for its region, provides that the benefits resulting from subsidiarity are gained in the delivery of youth work services.  We will thus have a structure that is more responsive to the needs of the regions and closer to community interests.</P>
    <P>The resource allocation function exercised centrally by the Department at present in regard to local and regional youth work programmes and services will, therefore, be devolved from the Department of Education to the education boards.  As a result, not alone will decision making on regional matters take place at the more appropriate regional level, but also the Department will be freed up sufficiently to enable it to concentrate more closely on vital issues such as national policy formulation, overall planning and development, assessment of performance, financial management, quality assurance and the national distribution of funding.  This will be in full accordance with precedents of devolution in other European countries, most notably Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Sweden, Spain and Portugal, many of which had previously, like ourselves, a tradition of highly centralised control of all aspects of the education system.</P>
    <P>I must stress, nevertheless, that the regionalisation of decision making to education boards will not result in the establishment of a rigid State youth service and will not substitute public sector activity for voluntary sector activity in the youth work sphere.  On the contrary, the Bill sets out detailed procedures for ensuring that youth work services will normally be secured by education boards through grant aiding voluntary youth work organisations.  Section 4(7), (8) and (9) details a procedure that an education board must follow which will ensure that only in the most exceptional circumstances may it consider providing a youth work service itself.</P>
    <P>The Bill also formally provides that the Department will prescribe national voluntary youth work organisations and provides that the education boards will designate or name local voluntary youth work organisations.  This provision for prescribing national voluntary youth work organisations means, in effect, that we will have a proper system of recognising national voluntary youth work organisations.</P>
    <P>In this context I would like to inform the Seanad that my officials have recently initiated a process of consultation with the National Youth Council of Ireland in relation to the development of criteria for use in prescribing national voluntary youth work organisations.  This most recent initiative will assist in the process of establishing <Col N="843" /> a proper mechanism for the legal recognition of national voluntary youth work organisations. Similarly, the provision under section 23 for the designation by education boards of local voluntary youth work organisations will help to set up a satisfactory system for the recognition of such organisations.</P>
    <P>The Bill also underpins the primacy of the volunteer in youth work.  The most significant way in which the Bill will do this is through the establishment of voluntary youth councils and of volunteer youth leaders throughout the country. These councils will have several crucial functions, including the power to nominate 50 per cent of the members of each education board's youth work committee, the duty of advising the relevant education board in relation to its youth work planning and the role of providing a forum for local voluntary youth work organisations.  In this way, the Bill should help to ensure that volunteerism will continue to flourish in the youth service in this country.  This is a major concern for me because I passionately believe that volunteerism is the key to real success in the provision of youth work services.</P>
    <P>I want also to say in relation to the voluntary youth councils that, among the innovative provisions of the Bill, are that at least one-fifth of the membership of each council will be set aside for volunteer youth leaders under the age of 25, and that there will be special provision for volunteer youth leaders working with the travelling community.  Hence, the councils will encourage youth participation and will assist in the empowerment of the traveller youth work sector.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill does not neglect the all important issue of accountability in the expenditure of public resources.  Several of its provisions, especially those regarding monitoring and assessment, afford a means for demonstrating the benefits and value for money of youth work and of ensuring that public funds expended on youth work services are spent efficiently and effectively. I am confident, therefore, that the Bill should help to attract additional resources for youth work.  In fact, the many provisions of the Bill stressing integration, co-ordination, assessment and targeting will assist us in meeting the value for money requirement which must attach to all public expenditure as well as enhancing the measurement of the benefits of youth work.</P>
    <P>The application of terms and conditions to the allocation of grants is provided for in section 19 in the case of ministerial grants and in section 4 in the case of education board grants.  Sections 3 and 9 provide for a national system of monitoring and assessment of youth work services.  Specific provision is made in section 3(4) for value for money considerations to be taken into proper account, in that it stipulates that ministerial monitoring and assessment shall have regard to an evaluation of the expenditure incurred in the provision of youth work programmes and services. Section 4(1)(c) makes a similar stipulation in the <Col N="844" /> case of monitoring and assessment done by the education boards.  Another way in which the Bill emphasises value for money considerations is the special importance attached in it to co-ordination between youth work policies and other policies affecting young people, and to the youth work needs of disadvantaged young people aged ten to 21 years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the national youth work advisory committee proposed under sections 10 and 11 of the Bill is of central importance in regard to ensuring value for money.  The advisory committee will include nominees of the national body representing the views of voluntary youth work organisations and other Departments.  This model will permit the availability of the best possible advice regarding the optimum integration and co-ordination between youth work services and other services for young people, thus helping to ensure value for money through proper targeting of resources, integration of efforts and networking between agencies.  In a similar fashion, the proposed youth work committees of the education boards, by including representatives of the voluntary youth councils and of important statutory agencies such as the health boards, FÁS and the Garda juvenile liaison service, will also contribute to the value for money requirement.</P>
    <P>Following on from the theme of value for money, many of the features of the Bill that are important in that respect also have the effect of providing for consultation and partnership in decision making.  At national level, for example, the fact that the National Youth Work Advisory Committee will include substantial representation of the national body recognised as representing the views of the voluntary youth work organisations will ensure partnership and will also be a crucial guarantee of the voluntary nature of the Irish youth work service.  Similarly, sections 17 and 18 provide for a youth work committee to be established by each education board, which, through a 50:50 membership ratio between the statutory sector and the voluntary sector, will ensure real partnership in decision making.</P>
    <P>What is most significant about the Bill is that it should give everyone involved in youth work the opportunity of demonstrating the benefits of youth work, especially in terms of assisting the disadvantaged and marginalised.  I am convinced that youth work can help to prevent social ills such as juvenile delinquency and that such prevention is vastly more cost effective than the most sophisticated programmes of rehabilitation can ever be.  As I said when I spoke on Committee Stage in the Dáil, an article I read in a recent issue of <i>The Economist</i> made an impression on me because it stated that in England it costs more to keep a child in a young offenders' institution than it would to send him to Eton.</P>
    <P>Juvenile delinquency has been the cause of much tragedy in both Dublin City and Cork City in the recent past.  Easter weekend this year was especially tragic for the family and friends of all those killed in the so-called &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; incidents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> As I also mentioned in the Dáil, an event that made a marked impact on me was the 71 year old mother of seven from Raheny, Dublin, who died after being struck by a car driven at high speed by a 15 year old.  That tragic event was followed by a deeply moving statement by one of those directly affected.  In a dignified response to the awful death of his dear mother, Mr. Joe McGrath made an impressive plea for improved recreational, developmental and sporting programmes and facilities for young people, particularly in disadvantaged urban areas.  While we need an increased emphasis on the standards of law and order if we are to maintain the integrity of our society, we must also address the root causes of problems such as joyriding.  Youth work can help our young people, including those at risk of getting involved in anti-social activities, to acquire the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to overcome the problems caused by unemployment, alienation, demoralisation, crime and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>In this connection also, the Bill is significant because it stipulates that in the development of youth work programmes and services particular regard will be had for the youth work requirements of young people aged between ten and 21 years who are socially or economically disadvantaged. I am a firm believer in the principles of social solidarity because, as the great Martin Luther King once said: &ldquo;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&rdquo;  The Bill helps, moreover, to address the justified concern of many people that expenditure on the formal education system and the non-formal or youth work system is incurred by means of administrative measures which are known only to a handful of officials and specialists but which are not readily available to the public.  Together with the Education Bill, this Bill will tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with some points of criticism that have been made in certain quarters.  First, it has been said that the Bill does not guarantee additional money for youth work.  Although the Bill is essentially aimed at establishing a legislative basis for youth work services that are, to a great extent, already in existence, the Government intends to implement the further development of youth work services on a phased basis within the financial resources available.  While the legislation will not of itself commit the Government to the provision of additional youth work services, it will provide a statutory framework in which the phased development of youth work services may be undertaken.  Moreover, since the Bill ensures accountability in the expenditure of public resources, provides the opportunity of demonstrating the benefits and the value for money of youth work and ensures that public funds expended on youth work services are spent efficiently and effectively, I am sure it will help to attract additional resources for youth work.</P>
    <P>Some have also wondered, in the light of the delegation of youth work functions from the Department of Education to education boards <Col N="846" /> following implementation of this legislation, if national youth organisations will continue to receive direct grants from the Department of Education.  The position is that, while responsibility for the funding of local and regional youth work programmes and services will in general be devolved from the Department to the education boards, sections 8 and 19 of the Youth Work Bill empower the Department to allocate direct grants to voluntary youth work organisations in respect of the provision of youth work programmes or services in two or more education regions.</P>
    <P>Section 8 also permits the Department to secure the provision of supplementary regional youth work programmes and services by allocating direct grants to voluntary youth work organisations. Accordingly, the direct funding of youth organisations by the Department will continue in respect of national and inter-regional youth work programmes and services.  However, youth work programmes and services particular to a specific education region will normally be secured by education boards and not by the Department.</P>
    <P>In addition, some have questioned our definition of youth work.  In this context, I point out that the general scheme or Heads of the Bill, as approved by the Government on 2 July 1996 and as subsequently submitted to the parliamentary draftsman, included the following definition of youth work:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Youth work&rdquo; means a planned systematic educational process which assists and enhances the personal and social development of young people, entails the participation of young people on a voluntary basis, is complementary to the formal education and training system and is implemented primarily by voluntary groups and organisations.</P>
    <P>The definition of youth work in the general scheme of the Bill was based on the definition produced by the consultative group on the development of youth work which reported to the former Minister of State for Youth Affairs, Deputy Aylward, in November 1993.  One of the tasks set for the consultative group was to devise a more precise definition of youth work.  The definition in paragraph 3.1 of the consultative group report forms, therefore, the basis of the general scheme definition.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the general scheme definition and in consultation with the Department of Education, the parliamentary draftsman produced the definition, phrased in appropriate legal language, that appears in the Bill.  The main change of substance between the general scheme definition and the definition in the Bill is that the phrase &ldquo;and is implemented primarily by voluntary groups and organisations&rdquo; was dropped because this is not an absolutely defining characteristic of youth work. That is to say, it is possible, even in the context of the situation envisaged under the Youth Work Bill, for non-voluntary organisations to provide youth work programmes and services in certain <Col N="847" />&mdash; admittedly exceptional &mdash; circumstances.  Since the phrase in question was obviously not a defining characteristic, it was decided that it should be omitted from the definition.</P>
    <P>In response to some questions that have been raised regarding the phraseology used in the Bill regarding gender equity, I wish to point out that much thought and effort was put into that phraseology both by staff within the Department of Education and within the office of the parliamentary draftsman.  Having particular regard to the need not to interfere with the single sex programmes and organisations that are necessary features of some aspects of youth work, we consider that the provisions made regarding gender equity in sections 3(2), 4(3), 6(7), 7(1), 10(2) and 14(3) are satisfactory.  The main focus of our effort in this sphere was to ensure overall gender equity but in such a way as to safeguard the aforementioned single sex programmes and organisations.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, rather than requiring equality of access of all youth work programmes and services and requiring an equal balance of participation in all youth work programmes and services, the aforementioned provisions regarding gender equity simply state that regard shall be had... to the treatment of males and females in relation to access to youth work and the number of males and females participating in youth work.</P>
    <P>Some questions have, moreover, been raised regarding the fact that, under the terms of the Youth Work Bill, voluntary youth councils will be entirely composed of volunteer youth leaders. Section 15(2) of the Bill clearly and unambiguously states that membership of voluntary youth councils is limited to volunteer youth leaders.  Our reason for limiting membership of voluntary youth councils to volunteer youth leaders is derived from a number of key objectives that have informed our work on this legislation.  One of those objectives is that we want to introduce a structure which will truly empower local communities, permitting them to play a key role in the development of appropriate responses to the youth work needs of young people.</P>
    <P>Another key objective is that we are anxious to afford youth work groups at local level a significant input to the formulation and implementation of youth work policy at local and regional level. We are also motivated by an awareness that it is through the work of volunteers on the ground that the bulk of youth work opportunities are provided in communities throughout the country and that volunteerism is something special to the Irish youth service which needs to be fostered in every way possible.  Accordingly, we strongly believe that voluntary youth councils, composed of volunteer youth leaders elected in the way described in the Bill, will meet our key objectives.</P>
    <P>The voluntary youth councils will also be the vehicle for the representation of the voluntary youth work sector on the education board youth work committees.  In fact, one of the vital functions <Col N="848" /> of the councils will be to nominate persons for appointment to the youth work committee of the relevant education board.  I stress in this regard, however, that it will be possible for voluntary youth councils to nominate whomsoever they wish for appointment to the education board youth work committees including, as the National Youth Council of Ireland requested, the National Youth Federation, Foróige and others and employees of youth work organisations.  In deference to the representations made by the National Youth Council of Ireland and others, I decided to withdraw my Committee Stage amendments in the other House to sections 14(2)(b) and 18(2)(c) circulated on 29 April 1997.  Those amendments were aimed at ensuring that only people actually in membership of voluntary youth councils could be nominated by the council for appointment to the relevant youth work committee.</P>
    <P>The effect of withdrawing those amendments is that it will be possible for voluntary youth councils to nominate whomsoever they wish for appointment to the education board youth work committees including, as I said, employees of youth work organisations.  Nevertheless, my fundamental belief is that people who are actually members of a voluntary youth council would normally be in the best position to represent the views and interests of that voluntary youth council. I also reaffirm my commitment to the empowerment of the volunteer youth leaders in local communities who give the Irish youth service its unique character and who provide the bulk of youth work opportunities.  Having said that, I accept, having carefully considered the well argued representations made by the National Youth Council of Ireland in particular, that there may be special circumstances where a voluntary youth council may wish to be represented on the relevant education board youth work committee by employees of youth work organisations.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill arises from an exhaustive process of consultation carried out with all the partners in youth work.  This consultation continued after the publication of the Bill.  For example, on Committee Stage in the other House, amendments proposed by me to sections 3, 4, and 6 were agreed.  Those amendments were made following consultation with the National Youth Council of Ireland which expressed concern that the existing wording might be interpreted by some education boards as meaning that the needs of disadvantaged young people should be dealt with prior to all others.  In the interests of consensus, I agreed to the council's proposal that the word &ldquo;priority&rdquo; should not be used.  The replacement phrase specifying that &ldquo;particular regard&rdquo; will be had to the youth work needs of disadvantaged young people aged ten to 21 will be satisfactory in terms of the achievement of the essential aim of the original wording.</P>
    <P>The other House also agreed to amendments to sections 11 and 22 that I proposed on Committee Stage following consultation with the National Youth Council of Ireland which asked that the <Col N="849" /> Department's commitment to partnership should be explicitly stated in section 11, which deals with the membership of the national youth work advisory committee.  I indicated in the Youth Work Bill explanatory memorandum my basic commitment to equality between the number of representatives of prescribed body representing voluntary youth work organisations on the advisory committee and the number of representatives of Departments and agencies.  On consideration of the views expressed, therefore, I decided to build provision for this equality into section 11, while retaining the right of the Minister to appoint an additional person to act as chairperson and at least one and not more than three additional direct ministerial nominees who would be experts with special knowledge of or experience in youth work.</P>
    <P>The Dáil also accepted my amendment to section 11 providing for the nomination by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a representative on the advisory committee.  This was done on the recommendation of the National Youth Council of Ireland and in recognition of the increasing international dimension to youth work.  The Dáil approved a technical amendment to section 22, which was aimed at ensuring there would be a correct cross-reference, in light of the substantive amendment of section 11, between sections 11 and 22 to the prescribed organisation representing voluntary youth work organisations.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, nobody can say I was unwilling to engage in wide-ranging consultation, which I did until the last minute possible.  The time has come, therefore, when all reasonable compromises have been made in this Bill and when more changes run the risk of diluting some of its central principles. Decision making time has, therefore, arrived and I do not want to be like those politicians whom Winston Churchill so memorably lambasted in the thirties when he said they &ldquo;decided only to be undecided, resolved only to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied there has been sufficient consultation and consideration and that the Youth Work Bill is good legislation.  Since becoming Minister of State, I have done my utmost to promote dialogue with maximum openness and transparency.  This Bill bears all the hallmarks of that philosophy.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the discussions with young people during its preparation. I thank the Minister of State for his help and kindness to the disabled, particularly one-armed golfers.  Disabled groups appreciate his recognition of their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill should be called the youth vocational training Bill.  I attended a technical school in the 1940s where the third year was used for work experience.  Students who were not academically motivated were given as much time as possible to <Col N="850" /> improve their practical skills.  They were sent to serve their time in shops or as carpenters, builders, plumbers, etc.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that vocational education committee schools are not included in this Bill, although FÁS and other such bodies are mentioned. Technical schools have a wealth of information on how to train young people.  Brainy people generally went to convent schools and colleges while the rest attended technical schools. Yet vocational schools turned out great students; they trained them for life.  My old teacher used to say: &ldquo;small things make perfection, but perfection is no small thing&rdquo;.  I would like the vocational education committees to have a greater say in this area.</P>
    <P>Secondary schools did away with many practical subjects and concentrated on woodwork and metalwork theory.  As a result, we now have many theorists &mdash; people who can write 40 foolscap pages on the shape of a penny without saying it is round.  It is a pity young people did not receive more training in practical subjects.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes special provision for the travelling community.  Vocational education committees run good programmes for the travelling community in practical and academic subjects.  I welcome its inclusion in the Bill.  Youth organisations are also happy with the amendments made to this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are spending a lot of money on crime but we are not dealing with the root problems.  This Bill is aimed at a section of our youth who are neglected and, therefore, become involved in crime.  I saw young people being interviewed on television recently and they said they dropped out of the education system because there was nothing in it for them.  We must come to grips with the fact we have failed these people.  A 14 or 15 year old who can hot-wire a car in two minutes has ability and brains.  We must work to ensure they use their brains in a more positive manner.  This Bill is aimed at those people.</P>
    <P>Young people become involved in drugs because they see no future in education.  Many volunteers work in this area and I am delighted they are mentioned in the Bill.  One could not put a price on the amount of good work done by volunteers. They are dedicated people who enjoy their work in the same way as I enjoy a game of golf.  I thank the Minister for using this Bill to encourage these young people to continue their good work because they often do not get the credit they deserve.</P>
    <P>I used to bring international work camps to Grange and on one occasion young people from the area spent three weeks making a car park. They notified the media, but I told them not to expect too much as I did not think there would be a big press reception.  Their hearts were in their boots that night because nobody had come to see the work they did, which is sad.  If those youths had wrecked a few cars in my village it would have been news and RTÉ would have had their cameras there.  So often we ignore the good <Col N="851" /> works done by young people.  We only see the bad deeds done by a small percentage of young people.  These people cause a lot of heartache to their families, schools and communities.  They take up prison places and make more work for the legal system.  We have to communicate with these people and try to help them.  This Bill provides that contemporaries of those young people will talk to them and give them an interest in life. The Minister mentioned that another Bill will be introduced to provide funds for this.  This is very important because although this Bill is good it is like giving a carpenter a kit of tools, instructing him to install a fitted kitchen but not giving him any timber.  It is like the councillor said: &ldquo;everything for the stirabout but the meal&rdquo;.  It is important to provide funds as well.</P>

      <P>No, the Minister must legislate to ensure funds will be made available.  It costs more to keep a criminal in jail than to attend Eton.  One cannot estimate the cost to society.  Many school leavers would return to school if we put more emphasis on vocational training.  I have said before that the vocational education committees missed out.  The vocational education committees became secondary schools because technical teachers were not good enough for them.  If these schools had remained technical colleges we would not have required ANCo and subsequently FÁS. The technical colleges catered for the needs of children who were not academically minded by providing practical courses for them.  I repeat that many young people who were very poor academically began to read up on metalwork or woodwork because they had developed an interest in these subjects and wanted to improve their skills. If these students were given the same book to read as an academic exercise they would not look at it because they were not interested in the subject matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many young people become involved in drugs and criminal activities because the educational system has failed them.  We are not giving them interesting things to do.  Technical colleges catered for these young people.  The day we closed down technical colleges was a sad day.  The vocational education committees should be brought more into play here; they have a wealth of experience in this type of work on which we could draw.  We must ensure this Bill works.  We must ensure we catch school dropouts and young potential criminals before they become involved with the wrong type of people and become a nuisance to themselves and society.  I believe every child born is good; it is the society in which they are brought up in that influences them.  Some of us were from a poor background but were reared in good homes.  As I mentioned before, in the 1930s and 1940s we had bad houses but we had good homes.  Today we have good houses but a <Col N="852" /> lot of bad homes.  Money has not solved everything for us in that regard.</P>
    <P>National schools have become very large and lack the personal touch.  When there were small two teacher schools every school had a football team.  When these schools were amalgamated with larger schools there was still only one football team which was not good for children or society.  We must be able to incorporate them all. If we had several graded teams it would be class distinction which was referred to in my younger years as the class behind the door.  It would be more feasible to have a small two teacher school on every street in the larger built up areas that would have 70 or more students for the first five years of primary education.</P>
    <P>I know that some children do not attend school at eight years of age.  We have lost track of these children in big cities.  In my generation every child went to school in rural and urban areas.  The local garda knew the truant children and visited their homes.  I heard a man say that when he went to England he was asked for his curriculum vitae or a paper stating what he achieved at school.  The man replied that the only paper he got from school was sent to his mother and was a summons for non-attendance.  In those days no child slipped through the education net.  Now, in a more enlightened time, we are letting so many slip through the net that we have a big problem.</P>

      <P>This welcome Bill seeks to look after young people and will solve a very big problem but only if another Bill is introduced immediately to provide funding for projects.  I appeal to the Minister to think of vocational education committees which should be incorporated in this system.  The vocational and technical schools did great work for youth down through the years. They have a wealth of experience to share and they should, at this late stage, be considered.  I am delighted with the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to deal with this important legislation.  Its need was identified as far back as 1984 by the National Youth Policy Committee which was chaired by Mr. Justice Costello.  A renewed call was reiterated in the 1994 Government of Renewal policy document and in <i>Charting Our Education Future</i> in April 1995.  The White Paper contained commitments to introduce this legislation and the overwhelming majority of those involved in youth work, including the bulk of those representing the voluntary youth work sector, favoured a legislative framework for it.  There is universal welcome for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the Minister for Education is that 90 per cent of all students continue to leaving certificate level.  The reality is that only 80 per cent of students do so at the moment.  It is generally <Col N="853" /> acknowledged that there is a large dropout figure and a sizeable number of early school leavers. School leavers are currently being catered for by a diversity of agencies but no statutory obligation is placed on any particular agency.  The Youth Work Bill is essentially concerned with establishing a legislative basis for youth work services which, to a great extent, already exist.  While the Bill will not commit the Government to fund additional services, further development to the Bill will provide a statutory basis for the development of a stronger youth work service on a phased basis and within available resources.  By providing a framework to demonstrate the value for money of youth work, the Bill should help to attract additional funds.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill, in setting out the Department's policy on co-ordination, budget, research, assessment and consultative functions, represents a clear Government commitment to the performance of informal and <i>ad hoc</i> functions.  The Bill requires the voluntary participation of young persons and is complementary to academic and vocational training.  I welcome the fact that a statutory obligation is to be vested in the education boards which will be more familiar with the problems of early school leavers than the people involved in the education process.  They will be in a very strong position to respond in a positive manner to these and to put in place projects in the areas of training and work to help young people.  The education boards will make use of the large pool of experience which is currently available.  I agree with Senator Farrell that much of this experience is available within the vocational sector and within agencies such as FÁS and the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill will greatly enhance the marvellous work being carried out by juvenile liaison officers, in co-operation with FÁS and the vocational sector, in providing support for the management of sheltered training workshops.  In discussing this particular Bill, it would be remiss of me, as an adult education organiser, not to pay tribute to the people already involved in the various boards of management of traveller and Department of Justice workshops.  These people, many of whom are very busy in their own walks of life, give of their time freely and willingly and bring wonderful expertise and life experience to the management table.  I have seen at first hand situations where people who run into trouble with the law regain a foothold in society through various schemes and programmes and become employable on completion of these.  The Bill will strengthen the role of these boards, supplement them and give them teeth.</P>
    <P>A great deal of good work has been done by adult education organisers throughout the country since 1979.  These people have been involved, in the main, in setting up programmes for disadvantaged people.  I hope that, in the running of any future programmes, adult education organisers will be given a role to play, perhaps in an <Col N="854" /> advisory capacity, as they have a great deal of expertise to offer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the national youth work advisory committee which will have a sizeable input from young people.  In the nature of its membership, young people, male and female, will be involved.  The committee will call on the experience of various departments already in existence and, with its excellent mix of youth and experience, it will lead to setting out a meaningful agenda designed to cover the needs of our young people, particularly those who are socially and economically disadvantaged.  We should also welcome the fact that this legislation will provide legal authority for the allocation of grants by the Minister for the provision of youth work services. As well as providing for the allocation of grants to education boards, the Bill will allow the Minister to allocate grants to national inter-regional youth work services and to supplementary services within a particular education region.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Allen is to be congratulated on having steered this legislation through the Dáil in keeping with the Government's commitment to the Education Bill.  There has been a lot of verbiage on the plight of young people by successive Ministers and Governments. I think it was the great American writer Walt Whitman who said that &ldquo;...words are like leaves, they can be scattered in many directions...&rdquo;; many words have been spoken in the past but little practical action has been taken.  The Minister of State has faced up to the challenge.  I compliment Deputy Allen for that and for putting into effect a legislative framework to cater for the needs of young people.  This is one of the most important Bills to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Its effects may not be seen immediately but in years to come, when the crime rate is dropping and when young people are engaged in meaningful activities, people will remember Minster Allen for bringing into being a Bill which will impact on society long into the future.</P>
    <P>I have noticed a phenomenon arising in certain parts of the country recently; I came across it at a board of management meeting in Gort, County Galway, yesterday.  Some prospective employers are taking students on for summer jobs immediately after the Easter holidays, which is exploitative.  These are students involved in fourth year programmes and the practice should not be condoned.  Though I urge employers to help young people by giving them summer jobs which provide them with work experience and badly needed money, I appeal to them not to exploit students by forcing them to take up positions after the Easter holidays.  There is a programme operated in many schools in fourth year in preparation for leaving certificate and it is as important a year as any other for students. Employers who force students to take up positions after the Easter holidays are doing a disservice to young people, their parents and the educational establishment.  I appeal to employers to <Col N="855" /> desist from this practice and allow students to continue their studies.</P>
    <P>The Minister deserves our sincere congratulations on the Bill as do the other people who have worked arduously on it.  It is one which caters for our most prized possession &mdash; the young people who are the heart and soul of our country.  As I travelled to this House from Galway this morning I heard a discussion on one of the radio programmes.  One speaker said that we must devise a plan for our young people as they are the people of the future but the other pointed out that young people are very much people of the present.  They are indeed people of the present and they provide great hope for the future.</P>
    <P>This is praiseworthy legislation which will have positive repercussions for our young population long into the future.  I compliment the Minister and those involved in drafting it and I strongly commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill which has been 20 years a-growing.  Youth organisations have been looking for legislation along these lines for a long time.</P>
      <P>We should remember that much work done by voluntary organisations concerned with youth does not involve children who get into trouble and it could appear that this Bill is being introduced to produce the diversionary tactics. However, the Bill is far broader because it takes into account the enormous number of children catered for by voluntary organisations who never run into trouble with the law.  It is marvellous that such organisations are being given the recognition they deserve on a national and regional basis. This is very important.</P>
      <P>Bureaucracy could be avoided through the simultaneous recognition of organisations at national and regional levels.  I would not like to see a situation where each organisation had to be recognised again when it came to establishing regional councils.</P>
      <P>It is important to have regulations and criteria for youth organisations and standards of good practice.  Perhaps the National Youth Council could draw up suitable guidelines.  It has much experience in this area and I am sure it would be willing to help.</P>
      <P>The most important question regarding the Bill is whether sufficient funding will be provided.  I see the Minister nodding and no woman will be more grateful than Sr. Mary Joseph of St. Catherine's Combined Communities Group about which I have written to the Minister on several occasions regarding funding for the inner city area.  If the necessary operational infrastructure for these organisations is not provided they will be unable to fulfil their obligations under the Bill. We understand the provisions will cost money but such expenditure is well worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The World Health Organisation defines health as not just the absence of disease but the presence <Col N="856" /> of spiritual, physical and mental well being. Involvement in voluntary organisations and the contribution they make to society is very important for the health of the nation.</P>
    <P>I am extremely pleased at the decision to give extra resources to disadvantaged areas.  Those of us who brought up our children in middle class surroundings know the value of having local football teams, scouts and cubs.  I am glad the Minister spoke of gender equality because guides and brownies are very worthwhile.  There is a tendency to think that only boys need to be involved in organisations.  Girls become involved in them if they are available.</P>
    <P>This is healthy living week and it is important to point out, particularly in the context of sporting organisations, that what we do in our youth sets the pattern for our later lifestyle.  Encouragement of various youth bodies involved in sport is important and I congratulate the Minister on what he has tried to do in encouraging these organisations to date.  This is very important for the health of the country.</P>
    <P>Children in trouble with the law are discharged from institutions into the same milieu from which they came.  Can youth organisations be asked to take account of this?  Perhaps there could be liaison between these children and what they consider to be the most suitable organisations for them to be involved with.  Children released from institutions are not often asked what they would like to be involved in.  They will become more involved in an organisation in which they have an interest rather than forcing participation upon them.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill success. Provision of the necessary finance will be important and I am sure the Department of Finance will acknowledge the savings in the context of it being cheaper to send a child to Eton than to an industrial school.  There is no school here which comes within one-tenth of the cost of keeping a child in an industrial school.  It is also important to recognise that this Bill provides for all children.</P>
    <P>Irish employers should be more open regarding summer work for children who should not be exploited.  Children are not meant to be a source of cheap labour.  Nothing is more useful for a child than the experience and discipline of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  It is no surprise that it is he who is bringing the Bill to fruition after many years.  His energy often scared the life out of the Labour Party in Cork and keeping up with him was a full-time job.  This is an important day for young people and for the institutions which cater for them.  The Bill signifies the value placed by the Government on that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Senator Farrell on his excellent speech which was the epitome of care and decency.  It was one of those speeches which helped to make this country what it is.  It was full of affection and care for children.  He wanted to return to the time of de Valera and dancing at the crossroads and I understand his nostalgia. <Col N="857" /> However, unfortunately we cannot have a computer in every two teacher school or ten schools in each estate.  However, I know where his heart is.  I also agree with his reference to the vocational education committees.  Their record in youth work and with the disadvantaged has not been adequately recognised by any Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted Churchill to good effect. I do not mean to be critical but I am reminded of Churchill when I look at the length of the Minister's speech which is 19 pages.  Churchill once asked his officials to produce a memorandum for him on the war in the south Atlantic and they gave him a similarly long speech.  He advised them that after the war they could publish the speech as a book but that in the meantime they might provide him with six pages.</P>
    <P>The section of the population dealt with in this Bill is probably the most exploited.  There are laws to protect those who are vulnerable and I realise many of these laws are connected with children.  However, insurance companies, club owners and drinks manufacturers often target their products at one section and rip them off with ferocious intensity.  The rip-off prices they charge for entry to clubs are an absolute disgrace. If they see somebody under the age of 23 or 24 it is open season on that particular person.  I think it is disgraceful.  If someone wants to insure a car &mdash; even if he could pilot an aircraft &mdash; it is open season in terms of loading, irrespective of how well he drives.  The idiocy of the matter is demonstrated by the fact that, not too far from here, people aged 19 and 20 are flying fighter jets from airfields near Belfast, yet they could not get a banger insured in the Republic.  It is nonsensical.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State will be back again, perhaps not in that position, but he may have a junior Minister, and I would advise the Minister of State to let him deal with the question of exploiting young people.  It is not just about the disadvantaged or those who have no possessions. It is also about young people who work six and seven days a week to earn money which is then unmercifully filtered out of their pockets by a society which seems to see them as milch cows.</P>
    <P>They are also ripped off when they buy clothes, if one looks at the inordinate prices for branded items.  A pair of jeans is an ordinary item but if one sticks Levi or some other fancy name on them the price quadruples.  The youth market is led by association and advertising which is a total rip off.  The youth are ripped off in clubs, for insurance, drink and jobs.  Someone who is young, fit, willing or desperate enough for a job will be exploited.  I am not saying all employers do that, far from it, but a significant section of industry and commerce is only too willing to squeeze young people until the pips squeak.  It is a disgrace and young people need to be protected.</P>
    <P>There is no training involved in many job placements, including FÁS schemes.  Young people are put into shops, factories, pubs and clubs but there is no element of training.  The motto is get the job done.  I know the Minister of <Col N="858" /> State is conscious of the Government's responsibility to stamp out that sort of exploitation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Garda juvenile liaison service and this brings the zero tolerance issue into focus.  I do not mean it in a political or partisan way because I welcome the debate, but zero tolerance touches on an area of endeavour which exercises the minds, effort and time of the Garda liaison squad.  If one was to exercise every law to the full as is being suggested, one would bring a whole stratum of young people into conflict.  They would be sentenced in courts and have criminal records.  It would destroy a whole generation of people.</P>
    <P>The greatest dread of any parent is when their son or daughter does not arrive home at a particular time.  In such cases, parents hope their child has not been injured or involved in trouble. This is even more the case if one is a politician.  I am always telling my children to walk away from a row because if they do not I will be on the front page of the <i>Echo,</i> the <i>Irish Independent</i> or <i>The Irish Times</i>  with a headline saying &ldquo;Senator's son guilty of assault&rdquo;.  While we may exercise zero tolerance in our own families, that sort of policy outside the home would criminalise a whole stratum of society for no purpose.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that from the age of 12 or 13 to 19 or 20, there is every possibility, through youthful exuberance and who knows what else, of a young person coming into contact with the forces of law and order.  If there is no rationality behind that impact and if it is simply enforcing the law, there will be a major problem in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The work of the Garda liaison squad should be expanded and that is where money should be spent.  The Minister of State rightly made the point, quoting from <i>The Economist,</i> that &ldquo;in England it costs more to keep a child in a young offenders' institution than it would to send him to Eton&rdquo;.  That kind of money should be used to properly train Garda liaison staff who will work with youth organisations.  The problem will certainly not be eliminated because it is like trying to eliminate sin.  There will always be crime and this country is no more crime ridden than anywhere else.  In fact, it is markedly less so than most countries, but crime and sex sell newspapers and comics.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to maintain a sense of balance, and that is not to misread or devalue the real concerns people have about society and their general safety.  The way we tackle it is important. I have no doubt that zero tolerance in relation to young people is a recipe for total disaster.</P>
    <P>As regards youth organisations, travelling the length and breadth of the country one is astounded by the commitment, vision and sheer intelligence of the young people.  We are just about to start an election campaign.  From what I have read in the papers to date, we will continue to treat young and old people as if free second level education never came into being.  They are being fed the same old pap they got in the 1940s <Col N="859" /> and 1950s.  I hope this campaign will not alone be free of venom and slander but will also be free of hackneyed politics.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder young people will not vote. Why should they?  They see us making all sorts of phoney claims and accusations against each other. In 1992 I sat on the Government benches with Fianna Fáil, while Fine Gael was in Opposition. We tried to do our best for the country.  Fine Gael howled across at us and we howled back at them. In 1994 the positions were reversed.  We stayed on the Government benches, thank God, while Fianna Fáil went into Opposition and the same process started again.  It is sterile politics and young people will not vote because they know it is not real.</P>
    <P>I had no intention of speaking in any detail on the Bill but if I did not agree with it I would be on the Opposition benches.  I congratulate the Minister of State for steering the Bill through the Dáil.  I commend him for his energy.  I have no doubt that, like everything else he puts his hand to, he will not be deterred.  He is seldom deterred, not even by the Olympic Council.</P>

      <P>This is definitely praise the Minister week and it would be churlish of me not to join in.  I had better do so or the Minister of State will not talk to me again if I go down to Cork.  In the general spirit that has greeted this Bill both in the Lower House and here, I want to endorse all that has been said about the Minister of State's personal commitment to this concept as well as having steered this Bill through the legislative waters.</P>
      <P>He made a valid point when he said that, when coming into office, he did not realise the time lapse between initiating a concept and producing a Bill.  I sometimes think the general public does not always fully appreciate the legislative obstacles one must overcome in putting together legislation such as this Bill.  It naturally leads to frustration but, hopefully, the days of frustration are over.</P>
      <P>I was impressed by the statistics relating to youth and youth affairs.  There are 50 youth organisations with a combined membership of over half a million.  There are 40,000 voluntary adult leaders, 300 full-time leaders and upwards of 500 part-time ones.  These are astonishing figures by any standards.  When you contextualise them in the Irish experience, with a population of some 3.6 million people, it is an extraordinary commitment to one segment of the population. If we were to do nothing else here today, it is important that we should state our admiration for those who are working in youth development, youth affairs and youth work, and particularly those who are operating in a voluntary capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate that we are talking about youth work, I would be interested in teasing out the Minister's definition of youth work in the context of this Bill although he has referred to the <Col N="860" /> definition in the consultative documents.  One little caveat I would enter is that reference is made to a variety of organisations but omits one. The National Community Games is unique to Ireland.  There is no organisation like it anywhere in the world.  It started in 1968 as the brainchild of a most wonderful human being, Mr. Joe Connolly, from Walkinstown, Dublin.  He saw around him the very marginalisation and disadvantage to which we have been referring and to which the Minister referred in his speech.  The difference was that Mr. Connolly went out and did something about it.  He is still hale and hearty and I hope he has another 50 years in him.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing to think that the little acorn which he sowed in a working class district of Dublin in 1968 has now developed into a national organisation in which over 500,000 youngsters participate at parish and local levels, eventually progressing to the finals of the National Community Games at Mosney, County Meath. Although successive Governments and Ministers, including the Minister of State, have acknowledged publicly the role of the community games, appeared at functions and endorsed them, I have always believed that we have undervalued the movement.  We should be giving it millions of pounds because I am convinced its work has steered in the right direction many young people who may have contemplated taking another path and built them both in mind and body.  It would be irresponsible not to put on record my admiration for the community games during the course of this debate and, in so doing, state my interest in that I got involved in the community games in 1973 and was honoured to serve on the national games committee, which organises the Mosney games, for six years.  I had a unique insight into how this movement works.  I still have strong ties with the community games although time constraints prevent me, like many of my colleagues, from being more involved.</P>
    <P>In the context of the nominations to the various bodies, the Minister might clarify that the community games movement will be acknowledged although this Bill may not lend itself to that.  It is not a sporting or youth organisation <i>per se.</i>  In fact, it is unique.  It bridges all the gaps and the various aspects of activities for youth between the ages of seven and 18.  It is an astonishing movement.</P>
    <P>Youth unemployment has sadly remained stubbornly high.  Various Governments' initiatives have failed to solve this problem, which has been exacerbated in recent years by the virtual elimination of emigration.  I promise I will not make more than one reference to the Celtic tiger, an overused cliché, but the buoyancy in the economy has created certain advantages for the youth.  On the other hand, it has created serious disadvantages also.</P>
    <P>I do not wish my remarks to be misinterpreted but I was interested to note in the Minister's speech that he seemed to have listened to the representations of the National Youth Council of <Col N="861" /> Ireland to an extraordinary degree.  The council seemed to have a direct involvement in a significant number of changes to the Bill.  I do not question the bona fides of that fine organisation but there are other organisations.  I was particularly concerned about one of the Minister's amendments which was proposed by the National Youth Council of Ireland, to which the Minister referred.  He changed the phrase in relation to marginalisation and disadvantage from &ldquo;priority&rdquo; to &ldquo;particular regard&rdquo;.  I would be interested to know why the Minister felt he should have conceded on that point.  The Minister heard the views of Senator Henry and others and her point was well made.  There is definitely a perception, in spite of all the figures to which I referred earlier, that we are essentially addressing the comfortable, the well-heeled and the settled, those in functional families the vast majority of whom do not need the special care and attention which the marginalised and disadvantaged need.  I would have thought that because a significant percentage in society is marginalised and disadvantaged as they have left school without educational qualifications, the Minister would have held firm on his original phraseology even for purely ideological reasons and that the mission statement from his Department would be that the State would give &ldquo;priority&rdquo; and not just &ldquo;particular regard&rdquo; to the marginalised and the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Over 1,000 young people between the ages of ten and 14 left the primary sector without transferring into the secondary sector.  Some 3,000 have left the secondary sector without any qualifications. Therefore, for any year there is a cohort of 4,000 young people in its teens and beyond, which forms part of the intractable problem of long-term unemployment.  I hope this well meaning legislation will help to address the problems those people face.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to wave a magic wand and solve all the problems which affect young people today.  As I said at the outset, it is a problem which has defeated successive Governments. There are still the problems of youth unemployment and social disadvantage.  Many would agree that even if Ireland were the richest country in the EU, it would still have problems of marginalisation and disadvantage.  I would be interested in the Minister's definition of disadvantaged and marginalised.</P>
    <P>When I was growing up as a youngster in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, I used think that being marginalised and disadvantaged meant one lived in tenements in inner city Dublin where there were no green areas and one's parents, like their parents before them, were out of work. When I got to the stage where I was thinking about such matters I used think I was really very fortunate, but as I grew older I came to realise that living in rural Ireland had its disadvantages also and one could feel marginalised and excluded.  It is interesting that this has been addressed in the reports of the National Economic <Col N="862" /> and Social Forum, on which I had the honour to represent Fianna Fáil.  I am particularly pleased that a number of colleagues, especially Deputy Brendan Smith, made extensive references to the reports of the NESF in the areas which were under discussion.</P>
    <P>I hope the new structures will address marginalisation and disadvantage.  That should be the mission statement of this legislation.  The rest is bound to follow because there are 40,000 voluntary adult youth leaders and the existing structures are impressive.  I hope that these legal structures and the placing of youth work, and the participation of youth organisations in that work, on a statutory footing will result in radical change for those outside the mainstream of society.  They are the people about whom we, as legislators, should be concerned.  These young people are falling through the net despite the best educational opportunities available and the plethora of Government training and educational initiatives, sponsored and supported by EU funding which I hope will continue after 1999.  We have still not solved or come to terms with the real problems with which they are faced.</P>
    <P>The concept of devolution permeates the Bill. Anyone involved in public life will welcome that development.  To use an overworked cliché, we have the most centralised State machinery in Europe.  In the past, it was believed that Communist eastern Europe employed the most centralised State apparatus.  However, to all intents and purposes, that is no longer the case.  It is a credit to the Minister of State that during the past number of years there has been a real desire to change the kind of centralisation which has permeated our lives since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Brendan Smith and others, I fail to understand why it is necessary to channel the worthwhile initiatives in the Bill through the proposed education boards when the vocational education committee structure is already in existence on a county by county basis.  I am honoured to be a member of the County Leitrim vocational education committee and I have served as vice-chairman for the past number of years.  This has given me a unique insight into the workings of the vocational education committees across the spectrum.  The Minister of State will be aware that the Minister for Education initiated an audit of vocational education committees in advance of the legislative proposals before the House.  Those who carried out the audit were pleasantly surprised at the range of activities in which vocational education committees are involved and at the widespread commitment and dedication not only of those nominated to serve on these bodies but also of their executives and staff. If we are to be sincere about devolution, I do not understand why the Minister of State is devolving power to an intermediate tier which has yet to be established and which, if returned to power, Fianna Fáil is committed to abolishing, but not enhancing the role of the vocational education committees.  Surely, this Bill is ideal for the <Col N="863" /> vocational education committee structure? However, the vocational education committees do not appear to be given a role.  Will the Minister of State clarify the role of vocational education committees, specifically in the area of grant allocation?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will be aware &mdash; it forms part of his brief &mdash; that the vocational education committees receive an annual allocation for youth in sport.  I am chairman of the Country Leitrim sports advisory committee and I also serve on the youth affairs committee.  Will such committees be abolished following the enactment of the Bill and the statutory establishment of the education boards?  Will the role of vocational education committees in grant-aiding youth and sporting organisations be terminated?  I will be very disappointed if that role is terminated because it will remove another strand from the vocational education committee structure.</P>
    <P>From my experience of dealing with grant applications I am concerned about the entire structural development that will result from the enactment of the Bill, particularly in respect of the number of people required to staff the various councils at national and regional level.  I am disappointed that, despite the best efforts of the adult education officer in County Leitrim, who also serves as secretary to the sports and youth advisory committees, few of the sporting organisations operating in the county attend meetings arranged to discuss grant allocations being decided upon in their interests.  However, 99 per cent of these organisations respond in the correct manner to the advertising and publicity campaigns put in place in advance of the dispersal of grant funding.  There is a great deal of transparency and accountability in this process but few of the organisations involved attend meetings.</P>
    <P>When the structures proposed in the Bill are put in place, I hope that the broadest possible spectrum of expertise will be placed at the disposal of the youth councils.  I am concerned that they will be obliged to rely on activists as sometimes happens in the case of trade unions.  The majority of trade union members do not attend meetings which results in the views of activists being taken to represent those of the unions.  I am aware that the Minister of State will not be able to intervene personally in this regard but I hope that this will not be the case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the voluntary youth councils.  Will the Minister of State explain their role?  Will there be a statutory role for sporting bodies on such councils?  I also welcome the provision relating to public accountability but I suggest that the existing mechanism is transparent. Will the Minister clarify the position relating to annual grants to vocational education committees? I welcome the provisions concerning gender equity but existing resources in our schools seem to suggest a gender balance does not exist and the emphasis is more on the male than the female.  For example, my 9 year old <Col N="864" /> daughter would like to play gaelic football but there is no facility in her primary school to allow her to play because the sport is male-oriented. The same is true in many other cases.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions dealing with the role of youth leaders.  In paying tribute to the community games, I pay particular tribute to Foróige which has done outstanding work in rural areas. The Minister of State and Members involved in Foróige activities are aware of the energy, enthusiasm and excitement these young people bring to their activities, which is a joy to behold. We should acknowledge their contribution.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State clarify the position in respect of the change of emphasis with regard to priorities?  I welcome the proposals in sections 11 and 22 in connection with ministerial appointments. This may seem strange coming from someone who is more opposed to ministerial appointments than in favour of them, but the provisions in these sections may help to provide a proper balance.  If everyone is left to their own resources, the correct balance may not be achieved and it is important that the Minister has a role in this area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State explain the role of the nominee from the Department of Foreign Affairs?  I would like to believe he is opening a window of opportunity for people working with Irish emigrants.  I am aware that this involves the areas of sport and youth but will the Minister of State consider the inclusion of a person working among Irish emigrants in the UK rather than in Australia or the US?  This would represent a good beginning and would be a symbolic acknowledgement of the importance of emigrants.  I compliment the Minister of State on his initiative and I wish the Bill well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, on the work he has done on the Bill.  As many speakers said, it has been gestating for 20 years or more.  Promises to introduce such legislation have been made to the youth sector by previous Governments but it never became part of their legislative programmes.  In the short time Deputy Allen has worked in the Department of Education he has shown great leadership.  The Department had been more well known for its concentration on sports as opposed to the youth policy.  Organisations and volunteers involved in this sector compliment him for raising the status of youth work in the community and for introducing the Bill.  The inherent democracy it will establish in regard to youth services is to be welcomed and that is why there is cross party support for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Farrell. He described a golden age in Ireland and there was a fundamental decency to his contribution. The role of volunteers, particularly in regard to youth services, has been referred to by many colleagues. I, like many others here, come from a fundamentally privileged background having had good educational opportunities and breaks and great encouragement from my parents.  There is an onus on us to give something back to those <Col N="865" /> who are not so fortunate and who do not come from the same background.  My generation must give more back.  The State has provided an education system through which we have come.  If one is lucky enough as a graduate to obtain employment in our booming economy or abroad, the focus is then on mé féin.  We live in an industrialised society which focuses on the pursuit of one's goals.  However, youth work concentrates on giving to others.  My generation should ask whether it has more to give to those younger and older than us.</P>
    <P>We must focus on that because in many of our cities and towns the same small group of people carry out voluntary work in their communities. They carry out fund-raising, bring children to the country and help them to organise soccer tournaments and debates.  Their personal lives are strained because of the huge role they take on in sport, youth work, etc.  My generation should take a lead and become much more involved in voluntary activity, otherwise, many youth groups, such as the CBSI and other sporting organisations will not be there in the future.  When I speak to people in my constituency, I find this is an issue. Where are people who will take up positions of leadership in those communities?  I believe young people who have come through the system must take a leading role.</P>
    <P>The changes in Czechoslovakia following the velvet revolution were initiated by students and young people.  This notion is perforated by the media slagging off young people but one can point to the tremendous advances and changes that occur in society when young people get involved.  Our role is to lead them.  Instead of going home to watch television, we have a responsibility to help youth groups become established and to ferment.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to disadvantage in rural communities.  I concede that, but I represent a predominantly urban constituency, mainly comprising Tallaght and Clondalkin.  There is a fundamentally different sense of disadvantage in urban settings, particularly those which sprawl in Limerick, Cork and Dublin, in comparison to rural settings. If one grows up in rural Ireland, one interacts with a cross section of society.  It is much more interactive than an urban setting.  In some parts of my constituency, there are children who have not been to the beach, or seen some of the more beautiful parts of Dublin, or experienced a sense of history and culture in one of the oldest cities in Europe.  Urban Ireland has a much deeper and ingrained sense of disadvantage because of a lack of interaction between various groups in society.</P>
    <P>There are also huge environmental problems in young housing estates because there are no community centres, churches have only been built recently and the public transport systems are not good.  Such children are disadvantaged because the areas have been allowed to sprawl without proper development taking place.  For example, <Col N="866" /> in Tallaght 40 per cent of the population is under 18 years &mdash; a massive youth population.  This is in contrast to the national average.  Every year the demography of the country is changing in terms of the number of young people coming on stream for college and the labour market.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the negative imagery sometimes attached to young people, a good example of which was seen at Easter.  Had elements of the media nothing better to do than go to Tallaght and create a story which helped to increase the sense of alienation felt by people in that community?  The story was dragged out over three weeks and did nothing but harm to my community. The media have a huge responsibility to young people who suffer from the negative imagery that opinion leaders and so-called experts portray.  I am concerned about that.  This legislation and public policy can do so much but we must portray both sides.  Some of the imagery regarding young people is blatantly wrong.  We hear about delinquency and children out of control but what about the good work being done in the thousands of projects and community organisations throughout the country?  The same focus is not on them nor was it evident two days before the problem in Knockmore in Tallaght when the Circuit of Ireland rally was launched.  There were no television cameras or microphones there then because it was good news.  When it was bad news connected to teenagers, it was sprawled all over the newspapers, because there was nothing better to report.  Responsibility attaches not just to politicians and parents but also to the media.  They have a responsibility to portray young people in all lights, not just in a negative one when it suits them.  I know the Minister feels passionately about this, as I do, and he referred to it in his speech.</P>
    <P>Young people should be involved in politics.  I had the privilege of working for my party and with the National Youth Council for two and a half years.  Every party acknowledged the difficulty of getting young people into politics.  Senator Magner may have been right when he said that young people are turned off because of the antics at political level.  In the 1980s a third of all members of Fine Gael were also members of Young Fine Gael.  They came from youth groups and wanted to be involved in politics and change the system. Other parties have experienced the increasing problem of getting young candidates and people to give up their time for nothing.  This is reflected in the make-up of the other House in particular.</P>
    <P>I hope that political parties will do everything in their power to encourage more young people to enter politics.  The more young people who do so, the better the chance is that the issues which affect them will be brought to the fore.  I am aware of my responsibility, given that there are so many people under 25 in this country.  We have a vested interest in speaking loudly on their behalf.  Other interests &mdash; business, trade unions and women's interests in terms of parliamentary <Col N="867" /> life &mdash; are well articulated.  However, young people's interests are not adequately addressed. This is a result of not having a specific committee for young people, as we do for women's affairs and the interests of small businesses.  We need to focus on young people, and we will only do this by getting more young people into both Houses and county councils.</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator Mooney, I welcome the intervention of the National Youth Council of Ireland in the legislative process.  Democracy is at work when expert views are listened to in the public domain and their concerns are considered when amendments are made on Committee Stage. While this legislation gives effect to much of what people in youth services are asking for, more funding is required.  Perhaps it is time to consider a full Cabinet position for youth affairs and have a Department standing on its own, rather than including it in the area of sports.  It is important that the Minister for Finance provides resources for youth services every year.  I congratulate the Minister of State on this legislation.  If he was able to do this in two years, we should consider what would happen during a five year term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He is pleasant and good-humoured, and that is half the battle.  I welcome the legislation but I am long enough in the House to understand nothing has ever been achieved by the introduction of legislation &mdash; it is its implementation that counts.  We are in a grey area at present although I have hopes and aspirations for the next three weeks.</P>
      <P>The legislation is acceptable and good in principle &mdash;&ldquo;an Act to extend the functions of educational boards in relation to youth work.&rdquo;  This sounds perfect and nobody in their right senses could quarrel with it.  However, I was hassled when I was involved in the establishment of an IT training centre in Letterkenny Regional Technical College.  The partners involved were Telecom, the IDA, FÁS and the Department of Education. We established the most progressive IT training centre for young people in the country and perhaps further afield.  The centre had a £2 million contract with the Board of Works as well as one with Europe.  It was successful and progressive. However, Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, refused to meet the director of this centre, Dr. Vincent Murphy, as he was too busy.  He did not refuse him on political grounds because Dr. Murphy is from Cork and one would not have to do much research to know he is not a Fianna Fáil supporter.  The IT centre employed 16 top staff experienced in advanced IT to teach bankers, council staff and those going for jobs who wished to do a crash course in IT.  It was fantastic and was the heartbeat of technology in the area.</P>
      <P>I was flabbergasted when I read the agenda for an industrial conference in Pittsburgh, which included Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, giving a keynote address on the development of IT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> I would have found it hard to sit down and listen to that Minister who would not receive a deputation from the IT centre in Letterkenny.  Unfortunately, after ten years of building up that centre, we had to close it down.  It was jointly managed by Letterkenny Regional Technical College and jointly financed by the partners to whom I referred &mdash; Telecom contributed £180,000.  There was a shortfall and neither the Department of Education nor Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, would contribute £1 towards rescuing the project.  This legislation sounds good, but if it is not intended to implement it, the paper it is printed on is useless.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed when the Department of Social Welfare wrote to about 20,000 young people telling them the summer jobs they had applied for were not available.  This happened at a time when the local authorities and the commercial sector were prepared to offer jobs to young people.  My local authority advertised jobs for young people.  Some young people got a letter from the Minister for Social Welfare indicating that because they were not excluded from drawing a social welfare payment they could not be placed in a job.  The Minister for Social Welfare professes to be concerned for the disadvantaged and the unemployed and he might be classified as a socialist but such experiences make me sceptical about the Government's intentions to implement any actions which will create jobs for young people.  My scepticism is borne out by the fact that no jobs have been created in the west.  I am not surprised that the Minister for Tourism and Trade had to retract his announcement of 2,000 jobs at Knock Airport nor am I surprised that the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, announced a gas pipeline from Shannon to Derry via the west, a project which he would have known was not feasible. They were attempts to appease people who are desperate.</P>
    <P>The Government has no intention of delivering jobs to the north-west.  This Bill will not create one job unless there is the commitment to implement it.  Not one job has been created in the west and in the southern Border counties, with the exception of County Louth and the worthwhile employment at Fruit of the Loom in County Donegal.  If Fruit of the Loom had not created 3,000 or so jobs, the north-west would have faced disaster.  I have read about the economic boom in Ireland but it has not reached the north-west.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may diplomatically express all the good aspirations in the world with regard to this Bill but we must be realistic.  Ultimately, we will have to explain to the electorate what, if anything, the legislation means.  My experience leads me to believe there is no commitment to fund education boards, regional technical colleges or FÁS.  There are over 70 job creation organisations, and the number increases almost weekly.  However, the Taoiseach found it necessary to set up a strategy committee under the control of his office largely because there are <Col N="869" /> so many organisations that the funds, from whatever source, are barely sufficient.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence recently from the Developing the West Together group.  I was at the launch of that group's strategy plan.  The bishops may have a greater chance of success through their communication with God than otherwise.  A number of groups have been set up to concentrate on development in the west but I do not believe they are getting anywhere.  I have seen no evidence of job creation.  It would be foolhardy of me to applaud the introduction of a Bill which makes provision for youth employment. I would rather see a measure of delivering jobs &mdash; perhaps 100 jobs per county.  Can the Minister of State indicate where jobs will be created in the west?  The present circumstances are not acceptable.  Will this Bill give additional funds to regional colleges or the new education management structures?  This Bill is a last desperate effort to stem the tide of disappointment.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes welcomed the Bill but it is useless without supporting funds and the intention to deliver on its commitments.  I have been bitterly disappointed over the last few years.  Our young people are educated, trained and prepared to work but there are few outlets for them.  During the election the young people of the west and the southern Border counties will give a clear indication of their disappointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's speech which explained his objectives.  It is hard to criticise those objectives and his achievements during his term in office.  He referred to the responsibilities of the Minister for Education and the education boards.  There is a danger that the work experience elements could be a time-filling exercise rather than the provision of work experience which will be valuable in the future.  If that happens it would be a serious waste of resources. I have tried to examine it from the perspective of what employers and business are seeking and the likely changes that business will require in the future.</P>
      <P>In the future the majority of jobs will be in services and not in manufacturing.  In the US over 80 per cent of jobs are in services while in Ireland the figure is just over 50 per cent.  Therefore, it is important to give young people experience in sectors which are likely to be open to them in the future.  In the future job creation will be in the services sector &mdash; for examples, entertainment, health care, education and telecommunications technology.  The jobs will be technologically driven and it is important to concentrate on supporting technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few people will expect to stay in the same job for their entire working life, given the way the world is changing.  When I left school most people expected to get a secure job in which they would be settled for life and they would not have to study any further.  That day is gone and people now have to continue to learn.  We must learn that jobs are not created by the State.  It was very <Col N="870" /> interesting to listen to the commitment, enthusiasm and dedication of Senator McGowan.  He asked how many jobs have we created.  Long-term jobs are not likely to be created except by those who will make jobs that will last for a long time.</P>
    <P>When we were talking at the Forum on Peace and Reconciliation about money from Europe, somebody said they hoped such money would not be put into swanky hotels but into the Border area where people need work.  I said I thought such thinking was incorrect.  A few days earlier I had seen the Slieve Russell Hotel in County Cavan which, dare I say it, is in the middle of nowhere but there were at least 100 cars outside. It is a beautiful hotel with a glorious golf course. It was said at the forum that money should not be invested in swanky golf courses and beautiful hotels, but at least 100 people are working in that hotel and golf course.  If it succeeds and thrives, those will be permanent jobs.  That is better than using funds to create jobs which will last a year or two but will finish as soon as the money stops.</P>
    <P>I am talking here about service jobs in new areas.  Few people can expect to stay in the same job for life so we must find a way for such people to continue to work.  I hope that will be recognised in the work experience element.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a concentration on general skills.  In the past our education system concentrated too much on focused skills.  For example, next month, for the first time, there will be an oral English examination in the applied leaving certificate; this will examine people's ability to communicate orally rather than just in writing. Up to now, the examination took into account written communication skills but most of us spend very little time communicating in writing. The vast majority of working time is spent communicating orally, which requires an ability to manage and work together.  Until now, there have been oral examinations in Irish, French and Spanish but never in the language most useful for acquiring jobs.  I hope this work experience will help young people acquire those general skills.</P>
    <P>A necessary umbrella skill, which can be applied to almost every job in the future, is the customer driven approach.  I do not think any future jobs will last unless workers recognise the existence of the customer.  Schools will not survive unless students want to go there.  Some hospitals will not survive if another hospital gives a better service.  I would love to see those on work experience beginning to appreciate that all these people are customers.  When I was in An Post one of my challenges was to get the employees to refer to those who used the services as &ldquo;customers&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the public&rdquo;.  For 150 years we talked about &ldquo;the public&rdquo; because of the lack of competition.  There is now competition from many organisations which can deliver messages, such as courier services.  Once we begin to think of the customer service approach in work experience, those young people will be much more valuable to employers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Another changing aspect of careers is that more opportunities are arising in the self-employment area.  I hope the work experience will teach them to stand up for themselves.  A huge number of the jobs being created in Britain and, even more so in the US, are not in big factories &mdash; what is called the smokestack industry &mdash; but by businesses employing one or two people and then doubling and trebling that employment.</P>
    <P>We spoke about this in the debate on the Finance Bill last week.  My fear is that if we only help small businesses we will send out a message that they should not get any bigger or employ any more people because they will lose the benefits they were given initially.  We should encourage people to be self-employed.  At one point I worked with a self-help group and realised that large capital investment was not required to set people up in jobs.  Possessing a ladder and bucket can get one into the window cleaning business at the age of 16 or 17 years, and this can build into something bigger.  That is how many businesses started.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that careers are becoming more international in many ways.  It should be recognised that work experience provides opportunities to use the skills on an international basis.</P>
    <P>The success of this Bill will depend on how we use the work experience element.  Work experience should not be used, under any circumstances, as something to fill time.  We should not pay people to just attend work; we should find some way of ensuring they can learn from the experience.</P>
    <P>I have a wish list of what we should attempt to achieve with work experience.  First, young people should know how to learn rather than just what to learn.  That umbrella skill should be looked on as the bedrock of experience.  It is easy to say that work experience should teach people something new every day.  However, employers should be challenged when they take someone on to try to give them different experiences rather than doing the same job over and over again.  I have found there is far more talent, ability and skills in young people if they are challenged.  If we give them something which challenges their abilities they will learn from their work experience and will be much more useful, both to that employer and future ones.</P>
    <P>Second, we should make young people independent rather than dependent.  In the future, jobs will not exist in &ldquo;me too&rdquo; companies but in businesses which are better than the next.  One of the tasks of employers in work experience programmes is to empower young people.  We had a theme in our company called SMILE, the &ldquo;M&rdquo; of which stood for &ldquo;make everybody a manager&rdquo;. Rather than giving young people jobs to do, they should be put in charge of something, even if it is only cleaning part of the floor.  They should be told to take the credit or blame for that job.  It is amazing how much talent can be found if young people are empowered in that way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> Third, young people should appreciate the difference between acquiring skills and acquiring facts, and how to creat the right balance between the two.  In other words, employers will ask not &ldquo;what do you know?&rdquo; but &ldquo;what can you do?&rdquo;.  The ability to communicate by the spoken word becomes much more valuable in that case.</P>
    <P>Fourth, young people should know how to apply what they have learned at school and through work experience to real life.  Many of us study subjects at school which we think we will never use again.  My father ran a holiday camp which had a ballroom which also functioned as a dining room and a theatre and we had to sweep the floor after each use.  After he had seen a team of three or four of us sweeping the floor he took me aside and asked if I studied geometry at school.  I replied that I did, to which he responded that while he never studied geometry there was something in it about the shortest distance between two points being a straight line.  He went on to say that he did not think we used geometry to sweep the floor.  He was correct.  When I thought it over I realised that we could have swept the floor in one third of the time if we did it differently and I then realised that this was a matter of putting to use in work what we had learned in school.  That is my fourth wish &mdash; to apply what young people learn in school in real life.</P>
    <P>My fifth wish is that future employees have some knowledge of the world of work.  That is why I welcome this Bill and what the Minister of State is trying to achieve.  It is much more likely to ensure that the person embarking on a first job will have experience of the world of work and will be a more valuable employee.</P>
    <P>My last wish is that young people going to work will have learned how to work as a team with others who have different skills and abilities and will realise that they can achieve far more this way.  In this Bill, the Minister of State has provided a foundation for the achievement of these wishes.  I hope we as a nation do not waste it.  I am pleased to see the Bill before the House and I am sure it will pass without difficulty.  I also hope that those charged with its implementation will make use of the benefits provided by the Minister of State under the Bill, that, we as a nation, will ensure we use it to the best of our ability and that it will achieve the objectives he has set for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their comments in praise of the Bill.  Senator Farrell stated that there was no reference to vocational education committees.  To avoid a needlessly complicated and administrative system, to ensure clarity with regard to the delivery of the service and to have regard to the fact that in many parts of the country Department funding for youth work is channelled directly to youth organisations rather than to the vocational education committees, there will be one tier of administration &mdash; the education boards.  Where vocational education committees are currently involved in youth work, their responsibility will be transferred to the education boards.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Henry, the Bill provides that the youth work committees of the education boards will include representatives from all of the relevant agencies, including juvenile liaison officers.  The Senator also referred to the co-ordination of effort with regard to young people.  My Department's contacts with the juvenile liaison services will ensure the co-ordination of efforts.  There is an emphasis on the need for co-ordination of the various agencies working at community level.  I would welcome further efforts in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney raised a number of issues, including the national community games.  Since most of its activities relate to sport it would fall to be considered under the sporting umbrella rather than in the youth work context.  I am mindful that a new role with regard to culture and history is being developed and we will look at the development of the organisation.  I wish to pay tribute to what the national community games has achieved.  In practical terms, getting young people involved in physical activity and sport will keep them away from the more negative activities of which we see so much.</P>
      <P>With regard to the disadvantaged, the aim of the original wording was retained in the new wording.  We must recognise that a coming together of needs is required in the youth work sphere, which is concerned with prevention above all.  Accordingly, youth work must encompass all young people and we are committed to paying special attention to the disadvantaged.  The new wording reflects that and to allay any fears Senator Mooney may have regarding what he sees as a watering down of our commitment, much of youth work relates to dealing with young people at risk who may fall between the systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator's point about the vocational education committees is similar to a previous point. Where vocational education committees are involved in grant aid for youth work, their functions will be transferred over time to education boards to avoid too much bureaucracy, administration and duplication.  We do not encourage sporting organisations to get involved in voluntary youth councils.  They are limited to voluntary youth work.  He also questioned why we are including a representative from the Department <Col N="874" /> of Foreign Affairs on the council.  It is essentially a recognition of the developing role of youth work and the developing European and international dimension to it.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney also questioned the purpose of the amendments to sections 3, 4 and 6, to which I referred at the outset.  I proposed them following discussions with the National Youth Council of Ireland, which had expressed concern that the existing wording might be interpreted by some education boards as meaning that the needs of disadvantaged young people should be dealt with prior to all others.  In the interest of consensus I agreed to the council's proposal that the word &ldquo;priority&rdquo; should not be used and the replacement phrase specifying &ldquo;particular regard&rdquo; will be had to youth work needs of disadvantaged young people between the ages of ten and 21 years was a satisfactory compromise in terms of the achievement of the original aim.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGowan that unless legislation is implemented it is useless.  I am committed to implementing this legislation over time and the necessary funding and structures will be put in place.  However, there was a misunderstanding about the objectives of the Bill.  It is not essentially concerned with youth employment.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Quinn's points, the Bill is not concerned with work experience.  Its purpose is to ensure that out of school experiences are provided to assist young people in their personal development and in social education.  In tangible terms, it concerns youth organisations and clubs, youth information centres, scout troops and special youth work projects in disadvantaged areas.  Youth work initiatives will be addressed in relation to combating drugs and other problems and challenges which young people face.  The Bill is not related to the direct creation of jobs for young people.  Its priority is their personal development.  The Senator mentioned teamwork.  However, the true principle of youth work is the development of the spirit of teamwork among young people.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators for their commitment and comments.  This Government has done something no previous Government did.  It has introduced the first ever Government sponsored legislation for the development of youth work.  This states, loud and clear, that the Government is entirely committed to youth work.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to providing adequate funding for youth work.  That concern was expressed during the debate.  Successive Governments have raised the level of funding for the youth affairs section of my Department from £3.765 million in 1987 to just under £14 million in 1997.  When one disregards the fact that funding for certain child care and substance abuse projects have this year been transferred from the youth affairs section to the Department of Health, the 1997 provision for the section represents an increase on the equivalent 1996 figure. It is worth noting also in this connection that the <Col N="875" /> 1996 provision represented an increase of over 10 per cent on the corresponding figure for 1995.</P>
    <P>The rise in funding in 1996 allowed me to extend provision under the grant scheme for special projects to assist disadvantaged youth, thus making more out of school youth work opportunities available to young people who are at risk due to a combination of factors ranging from early school leaving, low income, unemployment, substance abuse and social isolation.  It also permitted me to allocate sufficient funds for the maintenance and development of mainline youth work programmes and services provided by the national and major regional voluntary youth organisations through the youth service grant scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, the extra resources available in 1996 enabled me to undertake development in the network of youth information centres in terms of extending the network of centres and helping to meet the modern information technology requirements of that network.  Moreover, I recently succeeded in obtaining additional funding for youth work.  The Government recognises that there is significant potential for drug misuse prevention, intervention and awareness strategies in the youth work sector.</P>
    <P>Youth work programmes which equip young people with the social skills necessary to make informed choices and decisions for their own lives, encourage a positive self-image and build personal autonomy and promote an awareness of personal responsibilities, are fundamental to a positive prevention strategy.  Accordingly, the second report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs recommended the establishment of a youth services development fund.  The Government last week sanctioned the expenditure of £20 million over a three year period for this purpose and I envisage that measures will include developing youth services for young people in disadvantaged areas, the formulation and dissemination of a substance abuse programme for the youth work sector, training for trainers within that sector and a specialised Outreach programme for youth who are at risk.</P>
    <P>This additional £20 million over three years will build on the already significant contribution made by our youth work services to combating drug misuse.  For example, the national youth health programme, which is a partnership between the youth affairs section, the National Youth Council of Ireland and the health promotion unit of the Department of Health, provides, throughout the youth service, a broad based, flexible health education programme for young people incorporating information, training and programme development.  Furthermore, a number of special projects for disadvantaged young people, supported by the youth affairs section, operate specifically in the drugs education area.  In addition, most of the almost 200 projects supported under the grant scheme for <Col N="876" /> special projects to assist disadvantaged youth and operated by youth organisations and community groups throughout the country deal with a range of drug related issues.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of our youth work interventions in the drugs area, as in so many other spheres, will be enhanced by the provision of a legislative framework.  In that regard, I remind the Seanad that a long consultative process has been undertaken with all concerned in formulating the provisions of the Youth Work Bill. There is no doubt in my mind that the consultation undertaken has gone a long way towards improving mutual understanding among all of us involved in youth work.  It has also undoubtedly promoted an increased awareness of the huge importance of partnership, co-operation and consensus.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill represents a job well done.  It will not only give a legislative basis to the provision, co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation of existing youth work services but also give a statutory framework to the further development of these services.  Above all, the Bill provides opportunities to show the benefits that young people, and especially disadvantaged young people, can derive from participation in youth work.  The Bill should greatly assist us in meeting future challenges and help us to secure a continued increase in funding for youth work.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my appreciation for the work done by the youth organisations, my officials and the Department in formulating the Bill.  The legislation is the product of consultation and agreement and I pay tribute to my officials who worked long and hard on the Bill.  I also thank my special adviser, Mr. Tom Daly, who was very involved in the preparation of the Bill.  His expertise, knowledge and contacts in the youth services were invaluable.</P>

      <P>Section 5(2)(a) of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, provides that the institute shall have such other functions, which may include the function of conferring degrees, post-graduate degrees and honorary awards as may be assigned to it from time to time by order made by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Section 5(2)(c) of the said Act provides that &ldquo;Whenever an order is proposed to be made under this subsection, a draft of the proposed order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;  The consideration of this order by the Houses of the Oireachtas following the successful completion of the review group process on degree awarding status is another step in the history of the DIT.</P>
      <P>I am happy to return to the House with this draft order so soon after the future of the Dublin Institute of Technology was debated here.  This House has had an important role and most effective input into the formulation of policy in relation to higher education.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress my role in initiating this process.  I put the formal mechanism to evaluate the institution for degree awarding powers in place.  I asked the Higher Education Authority to establish an international review team to recommend whether degree awarding powers should be given to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  This was not a general review of the legislation governing the operation of the institute, rather it dealt in detail with the important issue of degree awarding powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group recommended principally that the Dublin Institute of Technology be granted authority to award its own degrees in respect of undergraduate and post-graduate courses, with effect from the academic year 1998-9.  The Higher Education Authority endorsed this recommendation.  The group also recommended that the system of quality assurance and quality improvement in the Dublin Institute of Technology should be subject to periodic <Col N="878" /> review and that the Dublin Institute of Technology should ensure that its organisational structures and processes are firmly in place and operating effectively.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the international review team, the order we are discussing will, when signed, formally grant degree awarding powers from 1998 onwards.  The draft order assigns to the institute the function of conferring degrees, post-graduate degrees and honorary awards with effect from 1 September 1998.  The effective date of 1 September 1998 is to allow the institute time to put the necessary procedures in place.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee entered a partnership agreement with the University of Dublin in 1975 whereby a number of college diplomas were recognised by the university for the award of its degrees.  Since that time, more than 8,000 Dublin Institute of Technology graduates have become eligible for degree awards of the University of Dublin.  The institute has developed academic links with other universities, including Dublin City University and University College Dublin.  Post-graduate degree programmes have also been initiated by the institute in collaboration with a number of universities within the European Union.</P>
    <P>This is evidence of the fact that the institute has over 20 years active experience in a rigorous course evaluation process where new course programmes are proposed for degree recognition. An academic council has been functioning in the institute since 1970, before being established on a statutory basis under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, and in recent years the institute has put considerable effort into the development of its quality assurance procedures. These developments are further evidence of the institute's endeavour and commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>The conferral of degree awarding powers on the institute must also be seen in the context of the policy framework set out in the White Paper on Education.  The White Paper sets out the Government's approach for the overall development of higher education.  It notes that developments in higher education in Ireland have been based on a differentiated system of third level education.  One part is formed by the universities and the designated institutions under the Higher Education Authority, with State funding allocated by the authority and the other part includes the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology, with State funding allocated directly by the Department of Education. The White Paper clearly states that &ldquo;the diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also states in relation to the Dublin Institute of Technology:</P>
    <P>Particular considerations apply to the Dublin Institute of Technology, given its historical <Col N="879" /> development, size and present academic profile. The work currently under way to create a single unified Institute, including the establishment of appropriate academic and administrative structures, will be continued and completed. Given the existing level of degree provision in the Institute, the guidelines in relation to the balance of provision will allow for more degree provision than in Regional Technical Colleges generally, while still maintaining a substantial level of provision at certificate and diploma level.</P>
    <P>The institute has, since its statutory establishment in 1993, made great progress in building a single integrated institution.  It has a vital role to play not only throughout the Dublin region but throughout the country in providing a comprehensive and high quality range of third level programmes. Conferral of degree awarding powers on the institute will greatly enhance its already high academic standing both nationally and internationally and meet the growing need for the highest possible attainment in educational standards.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to again congratulate the DIT on the progress it has made since 1992 in building a single integrated institute.  The DIT has a vital role in higher education in providing qualifications at certificate, diploma, degree and post-graduate levels.  Building on its legislative base put in place in 1993, it has made major strides with the active support of my Department. I stress my commitment in my time as Minister to the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Staffing and student numbers in the Dublin Institute of Technology have increased substantially in this time.  Many new courses at certificate, diploma, degree and post-graduate level have been developed.  There is now recurrent funding of over £50 million in this academic year.  In addition, since 1993 over £18.5 million of capital funding has been invested.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention two further elements of the recommendations of the review group.  The review team recommended that the funding and oversight of the Dublin Institute of Technology be transferred from the Department of Education to the Higher Education Authority.  There is a commitment to this in the White Paper.  It is my intention that the appropriate legislative and administrative changes will be brought forward to do this.</P>
    <P>The report of the review team also recommended that the relevant authorities should consider whether the key features of the university legislation should be extended to the Dublin Institute of Technology and its legislation amended.  In particular, this was in the context of a reference to the devolution of increased levels of responsibility under the universities' legislation so that institutions could run their affairs within budgetary and staffing constraints, subject to appropriate statutory obligations in relation to the discharge of those responsibilities.  Arising <Col N="880" /> from this, the Dublin Institute of Technology made a strong case for inclusion in the Universities Bill, 1996, over the past few months.</P>
    <P>The Universities Bill provides, for the first time, a statutory mechanism in section 9 for the recognition of a third level institution as a university.  I listened carefully and with interest to its views and have announced that when the Universities Bill becomes law I will request the Government to appoint a body pursuant to section 9 to advise it on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university, the Dublin Institute of Technology should be established as a university. The outcome of that process will be for consideration on another day.</P>
    <P>This is a momentous day.  I ask the House to approve of the draft order and thus support the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology. I ask that the said resolution be agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus an t-ordú.  Today at the meeting of the UCD governing body there was a great welcome for the Universities Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the draft order which gives the Dublin Institute of Technology the function of conferring post-graduate degrees and honorary awards. In 1992 the six colleges were amalgamated and have a student population of 22,000, both full and part-time and apprentices.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the Universities Bill provides for the first time a statutory mechanism in section 9 for the recognition of a third level institution as a university.  All Members wish the Dublin Institute of Technology to receive university status.  Senators Ormonde, Dardis, Norris, Henry, O'Toole and Lee supported the amendment on the last occasion.  Senator Ross was the only Member to oppose this amendment.  Where is Senator Ross?  He could lend his support today in giving university status to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I support the draft order before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that under section 9 consideration will be given to granting university status to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  This is long overdue.  The Minister and her predecessors looked at this issue in the past.  For too long, universities were separated from other institutes of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Cork representative and someone who lives in the regional technical college area I believe it must be given recognition.  I know there are requests for recognition and they must be considered properly.  I understand what happened with Waterford Regional Technical College. When I look at how Dublin is being treated and at section 9 of the Universities Bill I would remind the Minister that there are over 10,000 students in Cork Regional Technical College.  A few years ago there were only 3,000 students in Cork Regional Technical College.  I did not receive third level education but I recognise the importance of a proper education.  So much good <Col N="881" /> has come out of Cork Regional Technical College that it must be given due recognition.  I know the Minister has established a body to look at the granting of a higher status to regional technical colleges and I hope she will promote that.  It is very important for many areas, in particular, Cork Regional Technical College.  I welcome this long overdue resolution and I congratulate the Minister on it.  This will be the last occasion we will be speaking to each other as Minister and Senator, at least for a while.  However, the Minister has done an excellent job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister on an excellent job.  As a representative of the Dublin Institute of Technology graduates I welcome this order.  Giving the institute degree awarding status will give it more flexibility.  It will be the master of its own destiny.  I hope it will respond to the educational needs in a positive and distinctive way.  For example, the institute knows what industries such as software, technology and electronic engineering require and I hope it will maximise its strengths.</P>
      <P>As an independent body that will award its own degrees, I hope it realises the value of its degrees and does not believe it must emulate other universities. As I stated during the debate on the Universities Bill, one of the great strengths of Irish universities is that their ethos, tradition and admission systems are so different.  That must be fostered.  I hope the Dublin Institute of Technology will continue on the path it has chosen. We should remember that it gave members of our society access to third level education who would not otherwise have had such access.  This is a very significant step in the evolution of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister mentioned in her speech that the next step for the institute is its recognition as a university.  I hope the Universities Bill is enacted before the Minister leaves office so she will be in a position to ensure the body is set up by the AGA to examine the institute for degree awarding status.  Naturally the Minister will be able to take up whatever portfolio she is offered.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the first undergraduates who will enter the Dublin Institute of Technology knowing they will be awarded degrees from there will do so in 1998.  Students will make their choices on the central application forms with this in mind.  Within a few years we may have postgraduate degrees from the Dublin Institute of Technology as given the diversity of courses that will be available, many people will apply for masters degrees of one or two years duration.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing this forward. I hope the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology will be examined by the body to see if it can achieve university status.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to return to the Seanad to discuss our most important national industry.  The past 14 months have been difficult for certain elements of the agricultural sector.  The House of Commons announcement in March 1996 was a watershed causing beef prices to fall substantially and causing problems in many of our traditional markets for beef and cattle.</P>
      <P>Farm incomes in 1996 were very close to the record level achieved in 1995 despite a 13 per cent decline in output value in the beef sector. Incomes would have been much lower were it not for the BSE compensation packages which I negotiated last June and October.  Some sectors, such as the sheep and pigs sectors, enjoyed very good outturns throughout 1996 while the milk sector held its value at the high 1995 level.  Cereal producers had a good year as lower prices were somewhat compensated by a very good harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revaluations of the Irish green pound occurred on the 8 November 1996, 11 January 1997 and 29 March 1997.  This was a new and unwelcome experience for the agriculture sector since it had the effect of a significant reduction in CAP support prices in terms of Irish pounds.  However, the regulations provide for a system of aid in such situations and at the Council of Ministers' meeting on 17 and 19 March I secured agreement for the payment, in 1997, of EU funded compensatory aid to producers in the milk, beef, cereals and sugar sectors in respect of the first two revaluations.  The compensation will amount to <Col N="883" /> £46.1 million in 1997, £30.7 million in 1998 and £15.4 million in 1999.  I am planning for the payment of this compensation to producers in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>In relation to the further revaluation of the green rate, which occurred on 29 March 1997, additional EU compensation aid amounting to £25.4 million in 1997, £16.9 million in 1998 and £8.5 million in 1999 has been agreed.  There would be some amendment to these figures if the Irish green pound were to devalue between now and 30 June but it is not clear at this stage whether or not that will happen.</P>
    <P>The green rate applicable to the CAP reform premiums, including payments under the accompanying measures, was not affected by any of these green rate revaluations.  These premia do, of course, now account for a very significant part of farmers' incomes.</P>
    <P>As regards funding from the national Exchequer, I received the agreement of the Government for the payment of £17 million to the beef sector because of the particularly adverse market conditions being experienced by that sector.  This represents a significant gesture by the Government at a time when there are very many demands on the Exchequer.  The scheme of payments requires Commission approval but my aim is to have payments made as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The current problems facing beef producers result from a combination of factors, the most important of which are the continuing difficulties on the beef market arising from the BSE problem, the cuts in export refunds to enable the European Union to comply with the GATT Agreement and, as I have already mentioned, the revaluations of the Irish agricultural conversion rate.  All of these factors are closely interrelated.</P>
    <P>As far as the BSE problem is concerned, the announcement in the House of Commons on 20 March 1996 indicating a possible link between BSE in cattle and CJD in humans precipitated an unprecedented drop in beef consumption right across Europe and created enormous concern in many of our important third country markets.  My Department immediately recognised the extent of the problem and, together with An Bord Bia and the diplomatic service, undertook a major diplomatic offensive to protect the position of Irish beef exports both on European and third country markets.  High level delegations at official and political level visited all of our major international markets to reassure the authorities there of the safety of Irish beef and beef products.  The success of these efforts can be seen from the fact that Irish beef exports to international markets actually increased by almost 40 per cent in 1996 relative to 1995.  This stands in sharp contrast to the position following the 1990 BSE crisis, when Irish beef exports fell dramatically and virtually all of our eligible steer beef production was sold into intervention and it took a number of years to recover our position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> Apart from my efforts to keep open important markets, which I will come back to later, I also successfully lobbied the European Commission to introduce emergency intervention measures at an early date in the crisis.  The Commission agreed to temporarily waive the 340 kg intervention carcase weight limit and to extend intervention to grade 04 steers.  In addition, export refunds were increased by 12 per cent in May 1996 in order to improve the competitiveness of European traders on third country markets.  All of these measures helped to provide substantial support for the market at a time when it was most needed and I am satisfied that they prevented a collapse in prices. I also persuaded the Commission, during the autumn and again earlier this year, to maintain the intervention support system at a higher level than the Commission had originally intended.  For example, I intervened directly with Commissioner Fischler last December to ensure that grade 04 steers remained eligible for intervention and the intervention weight limit has also been maintained at 360 kg as a result of my efforts and those of my Department.  I should also point out that the additional classes which were added to the intervention system at the beginning of the BSE crisis in April 1996 have been removed from intervention in all member states except Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This disproves the contention of those commentators who argue that Ireland does not have any influence with the Commission in the management of the beef market.</P>
    <P>The major success last year was the negotiation of the two BSE compensation packages last June and October amounting to £100 million for Irish farmers.  By any standards, this was a very sizeable package of aid and it has made a very substantial contribution to relieving the hardship endured by producers arising from the sharp drop in cattle prices following the commencement of the BSE crisis.  The June package was worth approximately £70 million to Irish producers and was paid in September and early October.  The second compensation package, which was worth £30 million, was agreed in principle by the EU Ministers last October but was not formally accepted by the Council until December.  I have already announced the arrangements for the payment of this package and payments should commence this week.  The House will recall that I decided, for administrative reasons, to run this scheme together with the agri-monetary compensation package which became available as a result of the revaluation of the Irish green pound last November and again on 11 January.</P>
    <P>Many of the current problems in the beef sector stem from the fact that the beef surplus in the European Union is significantly greater than the quantity of subsidised beef which can be exported to third countries under the GATT Agreement. That, in a nutshell, is the kernel of the problem. While I fully recognise that the European Union has to comply with the GATT ceiling, I do not <Col N="885" /> agree that cutting export refunds is the best strategy to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>When the problem first arose in January I succeeded in persuading the Commission to reduce the period of validity of export licences in order to ensure a more orderly approach from the trade to applications for export licences.  I hoped this approach would avoid any further upsurge in applications for licences and accordingly the need for action on export refunds.  However, this proved not to be the case and there were a number of further occasions when applications reached very high levels.  Unfortunately, the Commission believe the most effective way to dampen down demand for licences is to reduce export refunds and they have done this on three occasions since the beginning of the year.  As I have already said, I do not share the Commission's view that this is the best strategy and I have suggested instead that a more effective mechanism would be to apply reduction co-efficients as is the practice in the case of tendering for intervention.  The Commission is extremely reluctant to adopt this course of action because of its bad experience when it was applied to intervention tendering in the early nineties.  On that occasion traders responded to the application of reduction co-efficients by submitting enormous tenders.</P>
    <P>Regarding revaluation of the Irish green pound, the strengthening of the punt is a direct reflection of our buoyant economy but, unfortunately, it has a downside in that it reduces the level of support prices available to Irish producers. Members will be aware that the upswing in the value of sterling has also affected the situation. Clearly, in view of the importance of the intervention system and export refunds in supporting the market in the beef sector, particularly in Ireland, the successive revaluations of the Irish green pound combined with reductions in export refunds have imposed downward pressure on cattle prices here.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, compensation for this was forthcoming and the European Union has approved two aid packages which I have already detailed to compensate producers for the fall in prices.  I am very pleased that the Government acceded to my request to top-up these packages by a further £17 million from national resources.  Subject to the approval of the Commission, I intend to use this money to fund a £50 per head payment on all male cattle and heifers slaughtered in the period 1 April &mdash; 10 June.  Finished heifers sold through marts will also qualify.  Because of this applications for heifers will only be processed after 10 June and where two applications are received for the one animal we will make payments to the first owner of the animal.  This package reflects the strong commitment of the Government to beef producers.</P>
    <P>I also wish to point out that I negotiated a reduction in the trigger of the deseasonalisation premium last June to ensure the retention of this premium for 1997 and future years in the face of strong opposition from many member states who <Col N="886" /> see this premium as a special export subsidy to Irish beef producers.  This premium will be worth approximately £20 million to Irish producers this year and is equivalent to 7p per lb.  In addition the adjustment which I negotiated to the extensification premium last October will be worth £15 million to producers this year without any reduction in stocking densities or ratios.</P>
    <P>The cumulative effect of these various income support measures is significant.  The two BSE compensation packages for income losses in 1996 arising from low prices amounted to £100 million. The agri-monetary compensation packages including the £17 million from our own resources are worth approximately £49 million while changes to the DSP and the extensification premium are together worth £35 million.  In other words, in the course of the last 12 months I have negotiated a range of measures worth £186 million to beef producers which by any standards is significant and without precedent.  Obviously these measures will make a significant contribution to protecting producers' incomes in the course of this year.  They are also a clear reflection of a constant stream of activity to deal with the problems in the sector.</P>
    <P>Of course, the long-term solution to the problem is to rebalance the beef market in the European Union.  A recent study by the Commission concluded that the measures which the European Union took last October to reduce beef production combined with the destruction of beef from animals over 30 months in the United Kingdom should restore balance to the market at least temporarily from 1999 and that it will be possible to dispose of intervention stocks within the GATT ceiling by 2002.  While this study is based on a reasonably optimistic assumption about beef consumption it does nevertheless indicate that there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Clearly, in view of our dependence on market supports and export markets, it is in our interest that market balance is restored as soon as possible. I am very pleased that the measures which as President of the Agriculture Council I piloted through the Council last year have set the framework for restoring the market to balance at least for a period from the end of 1998 to 2001.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity of setting out the position regarding beef and cattle exports to key markets since the BSE problem erupted. The beef industry in the EU and worldwide markets were thrown into chaos.  Consumption fell to one of the lowest levels recorded in recent times and important third country markets were closed. In a word it was one of the most serious difficulties to beset any product.  Given the extent of the BSE crisis the export performance of Irish cattle and beef industry in 1996 was better than expected and the reliance on intervention was on the lower side of projections made at the time. Since 20 March 1996 the Government has, as already outlined, spared no effort in dealing with the situation.  The full services of my Department, the diplomatic services, An Bord Bia and other <Col N="887" /> Departments and Government agencies have worked effectively together to protect our most important industry.  The net effect of this offensive is that we are trading normally on a wide range of international markets.</P>
    <P>Russia is by far the most important third country market for Irish beef.  This trade is covered by a veterinary Protocol concluded in November last which, <i>inter alia,</i> categorises counties according to their level of BSE.  The dire predictions made at the time have not materialised and the Protocol has worked well.  Russian interests have signalled their commitment in the long term to trade in beef from Ireland and a figure in excess of 100,000 tonnes is forecast for 1997.  Further discussions with the Russian authorities are envisaged in June when members of the Russian Government, hopefully accompanied by Dr. Avilov, will visit Ireland in order to have the situation reviewed.</P>
    <P>Egypt is the largest market for Irish live cattle and our second largest third country market for beef.  Imports of live cattle from Ireland were banned in January with provision for a review date after six months.  New veterinary requirements were also introduced in respect of beef but agreement was quickly reached on a revised veterinary certificate to accompany beef exports thus allowing that trade to continue.</P>
    <P>I travelled to Egypt last week with a view to reopening the live cattle market.  The meeting was positive and arrangements are being made to finalise a Protocol which will enable the trade to resume in the near future.  It has been suggested that the market would have reopened anyway after the six month period.  This was not the case and was not the view of anybody with a knowledge of the situation on the ground.  Without concerted high level political pressure a framework for amending the ban would not have been secured.</P>
    <P>I visited Libya in July 1996 and met a technical delegation when they visited here in March this year to observe our controls first hand.  I am continuing my efforts to have this market reopened and believe that positive results from Egypt will have an important bearing on that market.</P>
    <P>Iran is an important, if seasonal, market. Again, considerable effort has been devoted to re-opening that outlet.  Technical discussions are continuing with a view to agreeing an acceptable veterinary protocol.</P>
    <P>In terms of volume the United Arab Emirates market takes between 6,000 and 8,000 tonnes of Irish beef per year.  While Qatar, Jordan and Oman import smaller amounts, they are useful and lucrative outlets and have some strategic value.  Following active lobbying the UAE authorities recently lifted their restrictions and a veterinary certificate to accompany beef exports has been agreed.  I understand that Qatar will follow suit in the coming weeks.  It is to be hoped that this in turn, will be followed by Oman.  Jordan has <Col N="888" /> also imposed a ban but it is hoped to establish a joint technical committee to review restrictions.</P>
    <P>Regarding BSE, the most immediate issue we have to face is restoring confidence within the industry and thus bringing the market back into balance.  I have succeeded in obtaining funds from the Commission to assist in this respect.  The hypothesis posed by the UK announcement on 20 March 1996 was whether the new variant strain of CJD could have been caused by the consumption of offals from UK beef before 1989 when the ban on the consumption of such offal was imposed.  There is as yet no proof of such a link, but as long as the possibility exists it is my primary concern to protect consumers against any possible risk to human health however remote this may be.  To that end I have excluded every bit of those parts of cattle, which laboratory experiments show may carry the BSE agent, from the human food chain.  These include the brain and spinal cord.  As a result we can guarantee that Irish meat is perfectly safe, having also, of course, undergone an ante and post-mortem veterinary inspection.  It is important also to remember that BSE has never been found in muscle meat.</P>
    <P>The greatest protection we could give our consumers is to eliminate the disease from the national herd.  As everybody knows, we depopulate the entire herd, track down the progeny and birth cohorts of the affected animal and slaughter them, and render all the resultant carcases into meat and bonemeal, which we have currently stored pending destruction.  The cost is borne entirely by the Exchequer and amounted to £7.3 million in 1996 &mdash; a figure which could rise to £12 million this year.  These actions will, no doubt, eliminate some potential cases and allay consumer concerns but essentially, if we want to get rid of this scourge, we must eliminate the root cause, that is, the feeding of contaminated meat and bonemeal.  I have, therefore, introduced regulations since last October, which I hope will separate entirely the production and use of cattle feed from other feeds in which meat and bonemeal is incorporated.  It is now an offence &mdash; and I intend to have the full rigour of the law brought to bear on cases &mdash; for anybody farming cattle or sheep to have mammalian meat and bonemeal or feeding stuff containing such meal on their premises without a licence.  My Department's inspectors are actively carrying out inspections to ensure that these regulations are carried out to the letter.</P>
    <P>Testing for the presence of meat and bonemeal in ruminant feed is carried out by the microscopy test, which is the most sensitive test available. Because of the very minute nature of the fragments of bone detected by this method, it cannot distinguish between poultry bone, which poses no risk as far as BSE is concerned, and mammalian bone.  I have, therefore, made an order requiring a licence for the use of poultry offal as an animal feed ingredient and I hope by these measures to eliminate any risk of contamination of ruminant feed by mammalian meat and bonemeal. <Col N="889" /> Because of the long incubation period for the disease the results will not show through until four or five years' time.</P>
    <P>My Department is committed to the highest possible standards of food safety.  Consumers are entitled to be able to rely on the integrity, quality and knowledge that Irish food has been manufactured and produced to the highest international standards of safety and hygiene.  Food safety arrangements are extremely effective and I intend that they should remain so.  My Department has identified the need for additional safety measures in areas such as animal traceability, quality assurance and residue testing.  In this context the safety of beef will be assured through the implementation of the national beef assurance scheme, details of which will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of food safety involves a comprehensive approach by several Departments and Government agencies working together.  All of these improvements, together with extensive existing legislation, will ensure that Irish food continues to enjoy a good reputation in terms of safety and quality.</P>
    <P>Turning to the dairy sector, let me remind the House that the performance of the sector during 1996 was quite strong against the background of weakening world prices from their historically high levels in 1995.  Output in the dairy sector in 1996 was valued at £1.2 billion which was a rise of 6 per cent over 1994.  The situation which prevailed in 1995 was one of great buoyancy in the international market for dairy products, contributed to in no small way by demand for butter from Russia.  The buoyancy in the market was reflected in prices paid to Irish producers.  Milk prices during 1995 and on into 1996 show this clearly.</P>
    <P>During 1996 international markets began to weaken as a result of a combination of greater competition from New Zealand and the absence of major Russian purchases.  The effects of this are now being passed on to Irish dairy producers as milk prices come under pressure.  There are also the effects of currency developments which gave rise to revaluations of our green rate and, in turn, to a weakening of the support and subsidy levels.  The fact that this came at a time of greater reliance on these supports meant the effects were even more apparent than might have been the case in different circumstances.</P>
    <P>In relation to the revaluation of our green rate, I have already announced the payment of compensation to dairy producers to take account of the effects of the revaluations and arrangements are in place at present to pay an amount equal to approximately 1.9p per gallon to all producers who delivered milk during 1996/97.  This will go a good way towards offsetting the negative pressure on milk incomes during the current year.  For example, a producer with deliveries of, say, 30,000 gallons would receive in the region of £570.  While it is extremely difficult to predict with accuracy how the market situation will <Col N="890" /> develop over the coming year, I think it is fair to say that the likely outturn for 1997 will be considerably better than forecasts made earlier.  The EU supports are in place and will function as required during the year.</P>
    <P>Turning to the broader picture, an examination of future policy for the EU dairy regime is about to get under way within the Council of Ministers. The existing quota regime is in place until the year 2000 and it is necessary to consider the most suitable policy framework for the period thereafter. It will be a long process but one which must be given all the time and consideration it deserves.  The pivotal position occupied by milk within the CAP and its importance to the economies and rural societies of member states, will ensure that any changes to the existing regime will be considered very seriously.  There are external forces which may impact on how the EU conducts its dairy policy, such as WTO and the likely enlargement of the European Union.  What is needed now is calm deliberation and analysis of all the options so that all concerned within the industry, at farm level and beyond, can plan their operations for the years ahead with the maximum certainty.</P>
    <P>The current development strategy for the food industry covers the 1994 to 1999 period and is proceeding satisfactorily.  A key feature of the strategy is its integrated nature.  In addition to capital investment, support is provided for research and development, marketing and promotion, and human resources.  Committed public expenditure under all measures up to the end of 1996 totalled some £105 million from national sources.  The strategy is subject to a current midterm review.  I regard this as a very important exercise that will allow account to be taken of changes in the industry's environment and appropriate adjustments to be made to the support mechanisms.  My aim is to ensure that the industry will have the capacity and capability to respond to future opportunities.</P>
    <P>Numerous factors will influence future developments in the food sector.  These include those relevant to agriculture such as further trade liberalisation, CAP adjustments, EU enlargement and the single currency.  In addition to taking account of such factors, the industry must also remain responsive to trends at retail and consumer level. Such trends may well include increased emphasis on animal welfare and environmental concerns, increased purchasing power in the hands of multiples, and an increased role for the catering sector in overall consumption.  These, allied to continuing priority for safety and quality, are likely to be the critical considerations.</P>
    <P>The food industry has shown its resilience in the face of challenges and its responsiveness to opportunities.  The growth in the consumer foods and food ingredients sectors is indicative of its adaptability to changing demand.  Such adaptability will remain a key success factor.  I am confident that the integrated and cohesive nature of <Col N="891" /> the current development strategy will help to ensure that it is retained.</P>
    <P>Last year was a good one for tillage, with grain growers achieving excellent yields for spring barley, winter wheat and high quality malting barley. I was very pleased to see that the good result of 1995 was surpassed and that national production recovered to over the two million tonne mark for the first time since CAP reform, which is a very encouraging outcome.  It is worth noting that this was achieved while we remained some 52,000 acres below our national base area.  The output value of the 1996 crop is estimated to be £130 million.  When arable aid payments of some £90 million are added we see a very satisfactory outcome for growers again in 1996.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we continue to aspire to production levels which will ensure our self-sufficiency in grain.  The single set-aside rate of 5 per cent, which I was able to have adopted during our Presidency, and the continued facility of eligibility transfers within holdings should, given favourable weather conditions, help to maintain or even increase production again this year.</P>
    <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by producers about the possibility of an overshoot of the national base area, which would give rise to penalties under the arable aid payments system.  In keeping with the commitments given in <i>Partnership 2000,</i> I am seeking a change in EU regulations which would enable the targeting of penalties only at producers who contribute to any overshoot of the national base area.  My Department is at present drawing up a register of grain growers in anticipation of the necessary legislative changes being adopted.  This register would contain an area which, for existing producers, would receive either total or partial protection from penalties.</P>
    <P>Approximately 23,000 hectares of ware potatoes were planted in 1996, an increase of 2.6 per cent over the previous year.  It proved to be yet another difficult year for producers.  The availability of old season potatoes from refrigerated stores, coupled with imports and the delayed maturing of first earlies, had an adverse affect on prices obtained in 1996 by early potato growers. Crop yields were generally satisfactory.  However good yields throughout Europe adversely affected producer prices and many growers were obliged to dispose of stocks at uneconomic prices. Average prices obtained in the September 1996 to May 1997 period were approximately 40 per cent down over the same period in the previous year.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for reduced plantings in 1997 throughout Europe if supply is to match demand.  It is reckoned that total EU plantings must be reduced by 7 per cent to 1.45 million hectares if growers are to achieve reasonable returns.</P>
    <P>Our seed potato industry, which is small in comparison with some other member states of the EU, is facing a formidable challenge to produce and supply adequate quantities of the varieties <Col N="892" /> demanded by growers and consumers.  Seed producers must increasingly be prepared to enter into binding contracts with ware potato growers to underpin successes already achieved.  The fact that Ireland is recognised under the EU seed potato regime as a high grade seed area should assist further development of our seed potato industry.  The recent increase in the acreage of foundation and super elite stock grown for certification is a promising sign and should lead to an increase in the area grown for seed certification in 1997.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1996 detailed discussions took place with the various social partners on a new national programme, following which agreement was reached on Partnership 2000, to which the farm organisations are signatories.  This agreement addresses three essential economic and social challenges: maintaining an effective and consistent policy approach in a period of high economic growth; significantly reducing social disparities and exclusion, especially by reducing long-term unemployment; responding effectively at national, sectoral and enterprise levels to global competition and the information society.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of macro-economic policy is identified as to secure and strengthen the economy's capacity for sustainable employment, economic growth and social inclusion.  In this regard it was agreed that fiscal policy should incorporate the following: an action programme on social inclusion involving extra expenditure of £525 million; tax reductions of £1 billion; annual growth in gross current supply service expenditure to be kept as close as possible to 2 per cent in real terms; and a general Government deficit of not more than 1.5 per cent by 1999, and a debt/GDP ratio of 70 per cent by the same year.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 includes a chapter on action to develop agriculture, food and forestry and a section on rural exclusion, which elaborates policy on a wide range of issues.  It also contains a number of commitments on special tax relief for agriculture, as well as for general taxpayers and business.</P>
    <P>The 1997 budget implemented the following agriculture tax measures which are, together, worth over £25 million a year to farmers.  The flat rate VAT refund for farmers was increased from 2.8 per cent to 3.3 per cent.  A special capital allowance provision will allow farmers to write off 50 per cent of expenditure on necessary pollution control investment in year one with the balance written off at 15 per cent per year for six years and 10 per cent in the final year.  This is worth £800,000 in 1997 and £2.5 million in a full year.  Farmers will also benefit from the increase in agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax from 75 per cent to 90 per cent of the value of land, buildings, livestock and machinery transferred by gift or inheritance.  The existing 25 per cent stock relief &mdash; for income tax &mdash; which was due to come to an end has been extended for a further two years to April 1999.  Young farmers <Col N="893" /> will benefit from the extension of two measures which were due to lapse and which are, together, worth £5 million in a full year.  These are the extension for a further two years to April 1999 of 100 per cent stock relief for young trained farmers and the extension of the special stamp duty relief for young trained farmers for three years to December 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition, farmers will benefit from the general taxation reductions, including: the reduction in the standard rate of income tax from 27 per cent to 26 per cent and the widening of the standard rate band by £1,000 for married couples; the increase in the personal allowances by £500 for a married couple and other allowances; and the increase in the income tax exemption limit to £8,000 for a married couple under 65 years of age.</P>
    <P>Agri-business will also obtain benefit from the budget, including reductions in corporation tax to 36 per cent and 28 per cent for small companies on the first £50,000 of company income; the earnings limit for the lower, 8.5 per cent, rate of employers PRSI has been increased; the reduction in the tax wedge on personal incomes should assist firms to recruit; and new firms will benefit from the provision of relief for expenses that arise before a company commences trading.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to say a few words about the outlook for the future.  With regard to the remainder of 1997, it is difficult to give an accurate assessment of likely outturn for the full year.  As Senators will be aware, 1997 prices for both cattle and milk are behind 1996 levels. Sheep producers enjoyed record prices during the first three months of the year and, although these then dropped back as is traditional for post-Easter slaughterings, recent prices have again stabilised.  Pig prices were back on the very high 1996 levels but have recently been rising and are expected to continue to rise because of an outbreak of classical swine fever on the continent. Present cereal prices are also down.  On the other hand, I believe that the record levels of direct payments made in 1996 can be matched in 1997, and perhaps even increased, while input costs are likely to fall.</P>
    <P>The record shows that this Government has shown strong loyalty and support to the agricultural sector, especially the beef sector, during difficult times.  Considerable progress has been made in preparing the sector for the challenges which lie ahead, and particularly that we have a dynamic market-led food industry.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members of the House for their patience.  Unfortunately, I must attend a series of meetings this evening and I can only stay for some of the debate; but my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, will be present.  He will conclude the debate and report any observations made.</P>

      <P>This is an important debate because agriculture is in a crisis.  I am amused that the Minister concluded his speech as follows:</P>
      <P>The record shows that this Government has shown strong loyalty and support to the agricultural sector, especially the beef sector, during difficult times.  Considerable progress has been made in preparing the sector for the challenges which lie ahead, and particularly that we have a dynamic market-led food industry.</P>
      <P>The farming community in general would not agree that the Government has shown loyalty to the agricultural sector because of the differences which are evident in this Rainbow Coalition to which I will refer.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a member state of the EU and it is heavily dependent on the beef and dairy industries. The special position of the beef industry is recognised in several European Protocols and nine out of ten bullocks raised in Ireland must be exported.  Exports are destined for European countries and third country markets and there must be a balance between the live trade and the finished products.</P>
      <P>The industry is experiencing a severe crisis at present but, regrettably, political support and sympathy does not exist when and where it is most needed.  The composition of the Government gives a clue to the reason for this.  I note that Senator Townsend, who was vocal in his demands for a debate on agriculture, is conspicuous by his absence this evening.  Listening to the address of the Leader of the Labour Party to his party conference in Limerick recently, farming families must have felt let down when he ignored agriculture &mdash; he did not mention it once.  Last night when the Tánaiste was asked the issues facing the electorate on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;, he did not consider agriculture to be one of them. The Tánaiste did not mention rural Ireland or rural issues, never mind the crisis in farming. Apparently, the Labour Party is entirely oblivious to it.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, has done nothing to assist our largest industry to maintain its vital market share of foreign markets.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Left Leader and Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, is so accustomed in his prejudice that, in response to a question about the difficulties of farm families on a recent television programme, he said: &ldquo;The farmers are rolling in it&rdquo;.  Farmers are the victims of the political bigotry and bias of the Left-wing parties in the Rainbow Coalition.  They are not rolling in it.  Some farmers might be earning big money but 90 per cent of the farmers who are dependent on agriculture are on the bread line, as the Government knows well.  What is the Government doing about it?  Nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The litany of broken promises to farmers by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry can be explained by <Col N="895" /> the political cowardice of Fine Gael.  No other sector of society has been so let down or ignored by Government.  The collapse in farm prices, the closure of foreign markets, the repeated costs in export refunds and the failure to deliver on the promise of matching compensation for green pound revaluations add up to a litany of lost opportunities and broken promises.</P>
    <P>The Minister has run from one photo opportunity to another and neglected the real work which needs to be done in Brussels, Cairo, Tripoli, Tehran and Moscow.  This aspect has been omitted from the agenda.  He is unable to use his clout at Cabinet and in Brussels.  It is regrettable that farmers, the industry, co-operatives and the PLCs are the losers.</P>
    <P>On 14 and 20 April, the IDA issued statements to the effect that it would hold the Minister to a specific commitment he gave to livestock farmers to deliver Exchequer funding to match EU money provided in respect of revaluation compensation. In April, an article in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> stated that a £17 million package of national green pound compensation was announced in the Dáil by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.  It also stated that details of this were given at an IFA beef farmer meeting in Dublin.  The article went on to state that approximately £50 per head would be paid for bullocks and heifers slaughtered in export factories and abattoirs during the period 1 April 1997 to 10 June 1997 and that the compensation is likely to be paid in July following the submission of applications in late June.</P>
    <P>I contend that £17 million will not match the money received from the EU.  Approximately four times that amount should be provided.  I cannot understand why £50 per head will be paid for bullocks and heifers slaughtered in export factories and abattoirs in the period 1 April 1997 to 10 June 1997.  I welcome this development but what about the cattle slaughtered from 1 January to 1 April?  Why is £50 per head not being paid for these animals?</P>
    <P>I recently raised a matter on the Adjournment, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, responded, asking whether the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, could guarantee that the prices prevailing before Christmas would be maintained in the new year.  He could not do so. The prices were not maintained and farmers suffered losses during the period from December to March.  Why were these individuals not compensated? They incurred losses of 7p per lb. which meant that the slaughtering scheme was of no value to them.  At that stage I warned that factories had a captive market.  However, the Minister has only now become aware of this and he stated that the factories are engaging in price fixing.  I informed him that this was the case last December but he did nothing about it and farmers suffered.  There is no way farmers, particularly those raising beef cattle, are being well served. The Minister must tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> There is a spin-off to this issue because farmers must purchase meal to finish their cattle. However, had they known last December that the prices would not be maintained they would not have kept their cattle.  We are now informed that these people will not receive compensation and it will only be paid in respect of bullocks and heifers slaughtered in export factories and abattoirs during the period 1 April 1997 to 10 June 1997.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Minister of State to reconsider this matter and include bullocks and heifers slaughtered from 1 January onward in the compensation scheme because farmers have produced such animals at a loss.</P>
    <P>The sooner the better this Administration realises that farmers and their families are the backbone of the country.  This has been the case throughout history.  If they are removed, the entire structure of rural Ireland will fall apart. Unlike most countries in Europe, farmers in Ireland are central to the stability and future of the economy.  They have made a major contribution to the development of Ireland's agri-business and have never been slow to reinvest generously in farm buildings, equipment and machinery or to upgrade systems and everyone has benefited as a result.</P>
    <P>Farmers and their families maintain a key presence in many industries.  Where would the tourism industry be without farm guesthouses which provide good food for tourists who marvel at our beautiful landscape and the good work being done?  If farmers trying to eke out a living and pass on their farms to their children cannot look to the Government for support in a time of crisis and difficulty, morale will be sapped &mdash; it is currently at an all-time low.  Regardless of how the figures are considered, farmers and their families are central to our hopes for prosperity.  However, under the left wing dominated Rainbow Coalition there is no hope.  The agricultural Celtic tiger which Fianna Fáil fed and nurtured is becoming anorexic and will soon fade away.  The roar of that tiger has not been heard in rural Ireland.  The Minister of State lives in a rural area and he should ensure that farmers benefit from the current boom.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is conscious of the importance of farmers and their families to the economy.  It has always been the party of farming families, villages and small towns.  The schemes and programmes that matter to farmers, education schemes, the Operational Programme for Rural Development, the Leader programme, etc., were put in place by Fianna Fáil which has roots in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil negotiated the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which provided the most farreaching initiatives for farmers, including the ten month and 22 month beef premiums under which cattle farmers obtained an additional £420 per head.  Fianna Fáil also negotiated the extensification and deseasonalisation premiums and the ewe premium for sheep farmers.  While this has not been dismantled, it has been torn apart and reduced by £6.50 in the current year.  Hill farmers <Col N="897" /> need this premium more than most.  I note that the Minister made only passing reference to sheep farmers.  He stated that they were enjoying good times but they might be obliged to appeal to him to when things are not so good.  We cannot neglect any sector of agriculture and we must ensure that progress is monitored.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that the farm prices crisis coincided with the term of office of the left wing dominated Rainbow Coalition.  Farm incomes are under serious threat and many farmers will leave the land; it is estimated that 3 per cent have already left.  Beef farmers, particularly beef finishers, have been badly let down.  They have no hope and the opportunity was not taken to ensure that the generous package negotiated in Brussels filtered through to them.</P>
    <P>The position regarding live shipping is clear.  If we do not regain these markets in the next six to eight weeks, again there will be serious problems in the autumn.  There was euphoria in the House last week when it was announced that the Minister had negotiated the resumption of live shipments to Egypt.  However, according to his earlier contribution, the Minister hopes that such shipments to Egypt and other countries will be resumed.  It is important that he does his utmost to ensure that shipments of live cattle to these countries resume.  We must also deal with the problem of shipping live weanlings to Europe.  I hope the Minister will use his influence with his colleagues to ensure that full shipping facilities are made available for the transport of weanlings in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is because there is an election in the offing, but the Minister is very active at present.  However, it is sad that he was not as active heretofore to ensure the survival of farmers, particularly the live export contingent. The rural development initiatives and supplementary measures to boost alternative enterprises and off-farm activity will be worthless if the commercial heart of agriculture is unprofitable.  Pre-election gimmicks may win votes but they will not stop the slow death of rural Ireland.  Halting that decline and restoring confidence in farming is the task confronting the Minister and the Government and their record to date does not inspire confidence.  We need fewer photo opportunities and more action.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the role of the Celtic tiger but that tiger is silent in rural Ireland.  It is not only farmers but rural communities in general who are experiencing terrible difficulties.  There can be no doubt about the strong bias of this Government against farming and rural Ireland. When discussing water charges weeks ago, I was amazed that the Minister for Social Welfare found it necessary to launch an attack on farmers by stating they wanted free water.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They have been provided with water and will pay for it.  Fianna Fáil stated people living in rural Ireland should be treated similarly to those living in cities.  We were <Col N="898" /> not just referring to farmers.  The Minister never loses an opportunity to launch a blistering attack on the farming community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister of State entered office in a great year.  There was good weather and prices and the Government lapped it up.  Farmers were getting £1.07 per lb. for beef but today they get between 78p and 80p per lb., a reduction in income of 25 per cent.  However, the reduction is almost 50 per cent when other factors are taken into account.  Would any other section of the community tolerate that?  I cannot understand why farmers and farming organisations are silent in this time of crisis.</P>
    <P>Farmers were paid £1.20 per gallon of milk while today they receive 98p per gallon and they will be paid less next week.  I was canvassing in west Limerick recently with the local Fianna Fáil candidate.  I called to a farmer who generally votes for Fine Gael.  He told me that a few days before, Senator Neville canvassed him but left in a hurry when he was told the facts of the farmer's problem.  Is Senator Neville conveying the plight of farmers in west Limerick to the Minister?  I am sure if he did, something would have been done a long time ago.  It is too late to do anything on the eve of an election.  The farmer maintains that because of the revaluation of the green pound his income will be about 25 per cent less in 1997 than it was in 1996.  No other section of the community would tolerate this.  The Government should recognise this.  It is living in cloud cuckoo land. The Minister said he was fascinated by Ben Dunne drinking cider with ice when he was receiving £2,000 for his election fund but that does not mean much to farmers in rural Ireland. They will not be found near Ben Dunne.  They cannot even afford to go to their local pub, never mind go to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Farmers are visiting the clinics of every rural Deputy to ask for support to address the current fall in prices, a problem which they have not faced for many years.  They face a loss of £22 per head in cattle prices and an average dairy farm faces a loss of £57 per week in milk prices.</P>
    <P>We read recently about outbreaks of brucellosis in west Limerick.  The Minister introduced the disease eradication scheme last year.  I warned him at that stage about the introduction of such a scheme and he has to answer for that. Small milk producers account for 90 per cent of production.  They are on the bread line and nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>A recent article in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> under the headline &ldquo;Clawback yields no milk&rdquo; stated:</P>
    <P>The ten per cent clawback on land sales and leases introduced last October has failed to provide a reserve which can be distributed to priority category milk producers including young farmers and new entrants.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture confirmed in the Dáil that as of the middle of last month the clawback has only succeeded in attracting 2,231 <Col N="899" /> gallons into the reserve &mdash; the milk of two cows.</P>
    <P>Farmers are appealing for more milk.  The Minister should wake up to the situation and ensure rural Ireland does not die.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is timely as we are on the verge of an election and it is good that we air our views on the agriculture industry.  There is no doubt there are problems, as there are in every other industry.  The Minister gave a comprehensive report on all factors affecting the industry and, more importantly, he gave a commitment to continue to support those in it.</P>
      <P>Milk and beef are the most important areas in agriculture.  The dairy industry is one of the strongest and most valuable assets in our economy. It provides milk for human consumption and a large volume of manufacturing milk.  It also provides approximately 1 million steers for the export market.  It is impossible to put a figure on the value of the national herd to the economy.  In 1984 we came under the quota system.  Since it was introduced, there has been a 9 per cent reduction in output.  It created problems for people because it was necessary to maintain lower levels of production to stay within the system. Unfortunately, during debates in 1984, certain undertakings were given that if consumption rose in respect of milk products, markets would be secured in other areas and quotas would be extended.  This has not happened and is not likely to.</P>
      <P>I do not understand how other countries, some of which are in the European Union, increased production over that period.  The Italian quota has increased by approximately 10 per cent and some new entrants, particularly Greece, have had a quota increase of 16 per cent to 18 per cent. This does not make sense when one considers that our producers, who have a serious transport problem, have faced a reduction in quota of 9 per cent.  That is unfair.  Other countries, such as Australia, have continuously increased their volumes of milk production during the same period.  The GATT agreement was meant to prohibit any further increases in volumes of milk world wide. This has not happened and these issues must be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our position is serious as the cost of production has not decreased significantly.  The cost of producing milk has remained almost the same for 1995, 1996 and 1997.  There was a reduction of 10 p and more per gallon which equates to a 10 per cent decrease in the gross price of the raw material.  In some cases, depending on one's level of borrowings, this represents a 20 per cent decrease in net price.  While some areas of production and manufacturing can survive a price decrease of 20 per cent, very few can sustain that type of price reduction in net profits.  I ask the co-ops across the country &mdash; we cannot blame the Minister &mdash; not to take advantage of this.  They should ensure their level of profits does not <Col N="900" /> increase when there are severe reductions in producers' output.</P>
    <P>There is a large variation in the price of milk from one co-op to another.  This is unsatisfactory and cannot continue.  In February, March and April the variation can be as much as 10p per gallon.  This is very unfair.  While Senator Rory Kiely said that last month people received 98p per gallon, some people received as low as 90p per gallon.  This is not the fault of the Minister or the Government.  The co-ops, run by farmers, are taking advantage of a difficult situation.  This is also important for beef production as co-ops provide a huge number of steers for export.  This cannot be forgotten.  I appeal to co-op managers, irrespective of where they are located, to allow a reasonable margin of profit to producers.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement by the former British Health Secretary, Stephen Dorrell, in the House of Commons on 20 March 1996, the European beef market was plunged into disarray.  In Ireland the immediate impact was a reduction in cattle price of 8p per pound or 65p per head.  In addition, our beef export markets in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the Gulf States closed.  Live export markets to Egypt and Libya were also closed.  Following high level political intervention, the market in Egypt was reopened.  We should thank the Minister and the Government for their great work in doing this.  Through a combination of diplomatic and technical initiatives, our export markets to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States were also reopened.  However, unfortunately, the important markets of Iran and Libya remain closed.</P>
    <P>In August 1996, due to inadequate intervention support and the lack of price competition in the trade, cattle prices fell by a further 10p per pound.  This cost farmers £80 per head.  At this stage the total price reduction since March 20 was 18p per pound or the equivalent of £150 per annum.  This is a huge reduction which in some cases represents the full profit on an animal. Exports to EU markets suffered significantly from the drop in beef consumption and a strong preference by consumers in individual EU member states for domestic products.  As the largest net exporter of beef in the EU, this problem seriously impacted on Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the number of cases of BSE increased above 1995 levels, the veterinary authorities in our largest export market, Russia, decided in October to exclude beef produced in Counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.  This exclusion was further extended in early February to Counties Meath, Wexford, Limerick, Cavan and Donegal. When this second exclusion zone is included, over 40 per cent of Irish steer beef was excluded from our largest export market.  This had a devastating effect on the beef industry.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry Deputy Yates, the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, did everything in their power to try to avoid this.  All negotiations took place at a high <Col N="901" /> level but they were unable to solve the problem. I hope the live trade with Russia will be reopened in the future.  I encourage the Minister and the Minister of State to lose no time in securing the opening of this market.</P>
    <P>We are approaching midsummer when there is a large influx of cattle on the market, which could result in real collapse.  Unfortunately, factories, like milk co-ops, are not playing fair with the people.  I am glad the Minister has established an inquiry to see if a cartel is operating.  It is extraordinary that every Monday morning one takes up the paper and finds there is not a difference of one penny per pound from one factory to another, even though 14 or 15 are involved.  This is extraordinary.  If the price of beef is reduced in any factory &mdash; for example, in Donegal &mdash; the same reduction is imposed in Wexford and Cork.</P>
    <P>Prices are at a very low level.  We should look at the price of beef in supermarkets and butchers shops and ask the consumer if he or she has gained as a result of the reduction in prices.  Taking cows, heifers and steers into consideration, the average price of beef, in the last month in particular, is somewhere in the region of 76p per pound.  If one asks any housewife what she is paying for beef, she is paying £1.10p per pound at the lowest level to £2.80p for the more expensive cuts.  If supermarkets reduce the price of beef, there will be higher consumption.  The consumption in Ireland has increased.</P>
    <P>Extra efforts will have to be made in European markets.  I am not criticising anyone because I know the difficulties which have existed in the past number of years.  I believe we are over the worst of the BSE crisis, not only in Ireland but in Great Britain and across Europe.  We must move in on markets now.  There must be a shortfall in Great Britain because the slaughter as a result of BSE is very high.  With the reopening of the live export trade to Russia and, hopefully, Egypt, and some extra effort on marketing, we can get a reasonable price for our beef by the end of the year.  I and other people involved in agriculture have seen collapses in the past 25 years.  Unfortunately, factories are inclined to take full advantage of this.</P>
    <P>In early January 1997, the Egyptian Minister for Agriculture signed an order banning the importation of live animals from Ireland, France and Portugal.  Having recovered to a price of 90p per pound in 1996, cattle prices immediately fell to 86p per pound by February 1997.  The BSE problem resulted in the loss of the major beef export markets to Russia and Iran; loss of live cattle export markets to Egypt and Libya; the reemergence of our dependence on intervention support and the gross income loss of about £214 million.  While compensation of £100 million was paid, for which we must thank the Minister and the Government, there was a net loss of in the region of £100 million.  The crisis also resulted in major damage to consumer confidence, which we are glad has been restored and which we hope <Col N="902" /> continues, and severe income difficulties of individual farmers.</P>
    <P>We thank the Minister for his efforts in securing high levels of compensation.  While we have been criticised by the Opposition for providing that compensation should only apply from April to 10 June, that is the time of the year when the last cattle are taken from their houses.  Until February, prices were at 90p per pound but have now fallen to 80p per pound.  We could go back to January and justify paying £50 per beast, but I am glad £50 per beast is being paid and that we are paying it on heifers.  Heifer production constitutes almost 50 per cent of the beef industry but it has received little or no support &mdash; there are no ten or 22 months premia.  I am glad the Government saw fit to include heifers as well as steers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech:</P>
    <P>Food safety arrangements [in Ireland] are extremely effective and I intend that they should remain so.  My Department has identified the need for additional safety measures in areas such as animal traceability, quality assurance and residue testing.  In this context the safety of beef will be assured through the implementation of the national beef assurance scheme, details of which will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Department to announce this scheme as quickly as possible.  Whether one is selling beef in Ireland or any other country, traceability is very important.</P>
    <P>Most of the cowboys, so to speak, in the industry are being eliminated from the market and any who remain should also be eliminated.  They have been excluded from the farmers' organisations and the factories.  It is the small percentage of cowboys who destroy the industry for the other producers.  I am glad they are being dealt with severely and I encourage a continuation of such action because every county has its share of such operators.</P>
    <P>We have a consumer driven market, and whether the consumers are Irish or foreign, they want to know what they are buying.  We have the best beef in the world.  I have eaten steaks in Germany, America and elsewhere but one cannot beat a good juicy Irish steak.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely said that Fianna Fáil introduced all the subsidies.  In 1981, when the Minister for Agriculture was Deputy Dukes and I was Minister of State, we went to Brussels and secured the calf, ewe and lamb subsidies.  Fianna Fáil secured other subsidies but the livestock subsidies were secured by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dukes, and I who drew up the policies to get those subsidies which had to be matched by the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely criticised Fine Gael for being afraid.  We are not afraid of anything.  Fine Gael has a proud record on agriculture.  I have served in the Oireachtas for 20 years and my main interest in political life has been agriculture.  I am conscious of the need to prevent the depopulation <Col N="903" /> of rural areas and I am aware of the present problems facing agriculture.  However, I am also aware that the Minister, Deputy Yates, and the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, have a commitment to rural areas.  If Fine Gael was not committed to these areas I would not be in the party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We pressed for an opportunity to make statements on agriculture but I wonder about the value of the statements.  The Minister read a 30 page statement and then left the House. It is not for me to be critical&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister explained that he had an important engagement and had to leave the House.  The Minister of State is present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that is probably the truth.  The Minister of State is capable, but I know the procedures well and I am not confident that the system works.  Presenting a case to a Minister of State is not the same as the opportunity to put questions to the Minister.  I am disappointed.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister, Deputy Yates, when he was in Opposition.  Nobody else seemed to have so many answers to all the problems of agriculture and he expressed them eloquently.  At the time the media wondered whether he would become leader of his party because he seemed to be so brilliant.  However, never has a Minister delivered less to the agricultural community at a time when the agriculture industry is in total crisis.  It is the small farmers who have suffered most, those who are least organised.</P>
      <P>Senator D'Arcy spoke of his concern for agriculture and rural Ireland.  There has never been a move away from small farming and rural Ireland such as is taking place at present.  We will never get people back on to the small farms because they could not sustain even half an income. People are desperately seeking other jobs and they are being encouraged to consider information technology or the hotel industry.  Slogging on the farm in a pair of Wellington boots is not an attractive prospect, especially when one ends up without enough money to pay for equipment or electricity.  Anybody who has experienced life in rural areas knows what I say to be true.  Agriculture is on its knees and the small farmers will not recover.  Whatever funds are available from the EU are going to the large farmers who can lobby strongly at EU level.  The strong lobbyists have a far more powerful voice than the small hillside farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A small sheep farmer who wishes to transfer a quota cannot do so without permission.  If one small farmer wants to transfer a sheep quota to another he cannot do so.  I have written to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry about such a case and I had hoped he would stay in the House so that I might put the matter to him.  It involves two small farmers, one of whom <Col N="904" /> cannot make a living.  He decided to rent his land and quota to the other farmer but he could not do so due to the bureaucracy involved.  The farm was not in the name of the first farmer but in that of his late father.  The legal system would not let him transfer the quota.  In effect he was tied up in red tape.  I wrote to the Minister but he could not help me.  That is the situation facing small farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister was a strong advocate of afforestation. People in rural Ireland are being told that we are overgrazing, overplanting and overfishing. The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has designated areas which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was encouraging small farmers in economic difficulty to plant.  The two Ministers were unable to get their act together and designate land.  John Brown, who lives on a small farm on the side of a mountain and has land which has been designated by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, has been left in limbo and the Minister will not even answer his letter after two years, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, is encouraging him to embark on afforestation.</P>
    <P>Small farmers have never before encountered such confusion.  This is happening in my county and other counties.  There is a serious problem in the west because people are being driven off the land as never before.  I had hoped the Minister would stay long enough to address some of my questions and problems, but there was no chance of that.  It is a pity the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who had all the answers when he was in Opposition, could not clarify the position tonight for the few who still depend on the land for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>Other Senators referred to the confusion about the milk quota system.  I am amazed the Minister is not in a position to take some action on that.  I have raised this issue in the House before because nowhere is that confusion more clearly seen than in my area.  On my way to this House I see tankers of milk coming from the North to Donegal. Will somebody write to me and explain how this works?  Tankers of milk come from the North to creameries in Donegal to be processed, and on the same day milk comes from Northern creameries to be retailed in Dublin at half the price of the milk retailed in Donegal.  There are no controls, suggested retail prices or suggested prices for farmers.  It is a free for all.  The previous speaker agrees with me on this.  I maintain that the confusion is greater in the areas close to the Border.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to Donegal having had an opportunity in the Seanad to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry some questions. I would like to try to explain to the people of Donegal how a tanker of milk from the North can be processed in the South and retailed at different prices.  Those who send bulk tankers of milk from the North also process milk which they send to the South, including to Dublin.  There must be some control, regulation and price guidance. I understand that we operate in a free market <Col N="905" /> where prices are determined by supply and demand.  However, there is a lack of concern for the very poor who depend on milk as part of their staple diet.</P>
    <P>I will not continue with this because I do not believe I will get a satisfactory reply.  I am expressing my anger but nothing is being delivered. This is not the kind of debate on agriculture I would have liked &mdash; I would have liked the Minister to challenge me and tell me I am wrong or to give me an answer.  This is not a debate but a speakers' corner.  I am disappointed.</P>
    <P>I would like to receive a letter from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry telling me whether there are any controls on the milk industry or if it is a free for all.  Have the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry never had an opportunity to get together to sort out which land has been designated and which land the Minister would like to have planted?  Is there an agreement on who will be paid compensation, how much they will receive and when it will be paid?  Those are very simple questions and if I cannot get an answer, what chance does John Brown, living on the side of a mountain in Donegal, have?  He has no chance.  I am wasting my time here; I will leave this matter to the judgment of the people in the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Farmers are not fools; they live in the real world and can differentiate between fact and fiction.  Many of the problems, and potential problems, facing the agriculture sector stem from the CAP reform and the EU GATT agreement, both of which were signed, sealed and delivered before 1992 when Ray Mac-Sharry was the EU Commissioner for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>We hear a great deal about the crisis in the beef industry.  However, the farmers were protesting at the gates of Leinster House before the BSE scare was announced in Britain.  There is no point blaming the BSE scare for the crisis in the beef industry because it predated the scare, although the scare made matters worse.  We all saw at the beef tribunal how the beef industry was managed. We know that backhanders and the nod and the wink were the order of the day.  When one of the major players &mdash; or crooks &mdash; at the beef tribunal was asked why he sold beef out of intervention, he said they were all at it, in other words, they were stealing beef by the shipload.  It is a reflection on our beef industry that we still have an industry after all that happened during that time and how it was managed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, certain steps could be taken.  The IFA is not satisfied with the way the beef management committee regulates and decides on export refunds.  It would prefer if that was done on a monthly basis rather than at the end of the year when big reductions in export refunds result in big <Col N="906" /> reductions in prices at the wrong time of the year. Another mechanism would be helpful.</P>
    <P>The sale of prime Irish beef in Russia for 25p per 1b. cannot continue nor can the situation where a beef producer received a cheque for £205,812.74 under the slaughter premium scheme when he was paid for approximately 4,000 head of cattle.  Change will be inevitable, but it must be managed in a way that will not damage agriculture.</P>
    <P>Many people believe that there should be no live exports.  However, at times when there were none, beef plants always formed a cartel and screwed the farmers to the ground.  A balance must be struck; there must be live exports to promote competition.</P>
    <P>New Zealand is able to export lamb to the EU more or less as it wishes, subject to a quota. Sheep farmers tell me that it would be helpful if such imports were regulated, perhaps on a planned monthly basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to cereals, the present system of area aid payments to growers, where last year six growers received £2 million between them with the largest receiving £232,297.46, does very little for the smaller grower.  That must be looked at.</P>
    <P>With regard to the £20 million merger between Guinness and Grand Metropolitan, it will not be reported in any of the newspapers, including the <i>Irish Independent,</i> that this year Guinness will buy its raw product, malt and barley, for approximately £80 per ton, which is the same price as it paid 20 years ago.  Its raw material is being subsidised.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the farmers cooperatives and the dairies on the way they have handled milk.  They have increased standards and hygiene and have worked for the national interest.  People can buy dairy products anywhere in the world with confidence, knowing that it is a very good product.  If those in charge of beef had taken the same approach it is doubtful if that sector would be in such difficulties today.  Between 25 and 30 per cent of milk is produced by dormant milk producers, who do not keep or feed cows.  They lease their quota to others and pay up to 35p per gallon for the privilege of producing milk.  There is something wrong with that.</P>
      <P>There is a big debate over quotas.  Many say they should be abolished to allow farmers to produce more milk.  However, this would create problems.  While it is almost inevitable that they will be abolished over the next ten years, it must be done in a managed way to ensure that people do not suffer loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People working for Greencore in Counties Carlow and Cork are in the seventh week of their strike.  The company made a profit of £50 million last year, of which £28 million was made from its sugar sector.  Some of the workers in the sugar plant in County Carlow are paid so badly that the Department of Social Welfare has to subsidise <Col N="907" /> their wages with family income supplement. People on a flat week, who do not work overtime, etc., earn less than county council road workers. Companies making that kind of money should not, and cannot, be allowed to treat their workers in this way.  Some work anti-social hours because they can earn more if they work shifts and on Sundays.  However, many earn very little.  By contrast, the executive directors have a cosy cartel and have arranged share options among themselves. Recently, when a director retired they divided his income, which included approximately one million shares, between them.</P>
    <P>Earlier, Senator Rory Kiely alleged that because I was not in the House I was not interested in agriculture.  At the time, I was trying to ascertain the present position on the strike.  I have been informed that, in an attempt to break it, the company is importing sugar from Holland and France which it is assembling in a shed in Kinsealy Lane where the sanitary conditions are far from what they should be.</P>
    <P>In importing sugar, Greencore is giving a foothold to foreign companies which will be very hard to break when the strike is over.  Perhaps there is a hidden agenda here in that the company may be attempting to close down one of the sugar factories in County Carlow or County Cork.  It would be driven by greed in this regard and would not have a social conscience.</P>
    <P>The sugar industry is in very bad hands at present.  Not only do the workers have a grievance, but the growers are also in dispute with Greencore.  The company has been brought before the EU with regard to malpractices in the distribution of sugar.  The actions of the executive directors remind me of the actions of those in charge of the beef industry some time ago when they paid themselves well and used their workers as slave labour.  The survival of the sugar beet industry as we know it, where sugar is produced from beet grown by farmers, is at stake.  We are on the slippery slope and Greencore is not doing a good job in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a good job over the past few years.  The next five years will be critical for agriculture because change must be managed. The person who holds the portfolio in the next Government must have a good track record and know what is involved.  There is nobody better than the current Minister and it is in the national interest to reappoint him after the election. Fianna Fáil's only policy on agriculture appears to be to blame the Labour Party and Democratic Left.  That is not good enough nowdays.</P>

      <P>It may be a temporary little arrangement.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  Much to my surprise, I agree with much of Senator Townsend's contribution, with the exception of his closing remarks about the Minister.  I hope there will be a change of Minister after the election.</P>
      <P>The Minister's address to the House was profoundly depressing.  Anybody with any decency and sense of fairness would have at least conceded that there is a problem.  There was no such concession in the Minister's statement.  I was again confronted by a document produced by spin doctors which purported to show all the efforts made on behalf of the industry.  I acknowledge that some efforts have been made, but I expected the Minister to make some concession with regard to the crisis which attracted 1,000 people to a meeting with him and other spokes-persons in the Red Cow Inn.</P>
      <P>It was extraordinary that the Minister said at the outset that farm incomes in 1996 were close to the record level achieved in 1995.  Figures published by the Irish Farmers' Association, which quote Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and CSO statistics, show a change of -25 per cent between April 1995 and April 1997, a more relevant period, with regard to product prices for cattle.  The product price for milk was down by 10.5 per cent and by 11.7 per cent for cereals.  It was down by 10.7 per cent for sugar beet, by 5 per cent for sheep and by 13.6 per cent for pigs. There is a fundamental contradiction between the Minister's statement and the figures purported to be those of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the CSO.  I am interested to know how those contradictory sets of figures can be resolved.</P>
      <P>I on behalf of my party and Senator Rory Kiely on behalf of Fianna Fáil have sought this debate for several months.  On 10 April last, my party tabled a motion which stated:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to take urgent and effective action to deal with the income crisis in farming, and in particular, the collapse in the cattle trade; to seek the full restoration of the EU export refunds and the extension of the special beef premium; to negotiate the reopening of export markets which have been closed to live cattle and carcase beef and to bring forward proposals to compensate farmers affected by revaluations of the green currency.</P>
      <P>I sought an emergency debate on that matter but the Cathaoirleach ruled it out of order.  However, the House should have debated a substantive motion this evening and not just had bland statements about this industry which is in crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The theme of the Minister's speech was welcome to this wonderful world, where nothing is <Col N="909" /> wrong and all this activity has taken place on behalf of producers.  There was not even a nod in the direction of the crisis which is forcing people off the land and destroying the winter fattener industry.  The Minister made a remarkable statement in recent weeks to the effect that we should consider returning to grass based summer production. I come from County Kildare where there is an active winter fattening industry.  That was an extraordinary statement.  The inference is that we should return to pasture based peasant agriculture which we hoped we had left behind when we joined the EU.  Millions of pounds have been invested in capital spending on buildings and equipment for a winter fattening industry which is of huge importance.  The inference of the Minister's statement is that all that money was spent in vain and the national investment, which was supported by domestic and European funds, was a waste of time.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned high level delegations. One has a vision of delegations comprising Ministers and officials flitting all over the world and bringing back good news.  When the BSE crisis struck, I was one of the first people who said Ministers should get onto aeroplanes and go abroad to talk to our customers and try to ensure that our markets were protected.  However, that did not happen and we paid a price.  It is late in the day to launch some of the initiatives mentioned by the Minister.  They should have been launched much sooner.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should attend food shows, represent the country and assist in the selling of Irish produce. He should also meet his counterparts to ensure that closed markets are reopened.  However, I wonder about the necessity of bringing Irish journalists on trips which are aimed at selling Irish produce to foreign markets.  I do not understand the logic behind that, unless it is to bring home public relations stories on behalf of the Minister.  Am I correct that the trip to Cairo was paid for by Bord Bia and that the Minister specifically requested the board to include a journalist who was omitted from the original list? If I am correct, that is profoundly depressing.  I am a practising journalist and I have been brought to places by various commercial companies and the Department.  However, I do not understand the relevance of bringing Irish journalists on a trip to Cairo aimed at selling Irish produce to foreign markets unless it was for a public relations spin.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was a 40 per cent increase in Irish beef exports.  He said the Department recognised the extent of the problem and it undertook a diplomatic offensive in conjunction with Bord Bia and the diplomatic services.  The Minister said the success of these efforts can be seen from the fact that Irish exports to international markets increased by almost 40 per cent in 1996 relative to 1995.  Was the 40 per cent increase due to that initiative?  I suggest it was a <Col N="910" /> direct result of the crisis in March 1996 and nothing else.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he intervened directly with Commissioner Fischler last December to ensure that grade 04 steers remained eligible for intervention. It is not clear whether the Minister was on his knees at the time but he intervened directly with the Commissioner.  I regard it as an obligation on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to intervene directly with Commissioner Fischler, the Commission and everybody in Brussels on behalf of this industry.  There is also an obligation on the Minister to try to get export refunds restored to the beef industry.  It is not good enough to tell 1,000 farmers in the Red Cow Inn that the crisis is due to GATT and nothing can change.  That is the case with regard to EU export refunds.  However, Senator Townsend rightly identified the obscenity of the position where some people are receiving large sums of money in the arable sector.  It appears that because the price of cereals did not fall to the extent expected in CAP reform, it can be changed because money will be brought back into Europe but it cannot be changed if money is leaving Europe.  That fundamental contradiction must be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this disproved the contention of those commentators who argue that Ireland does not have any influence with the Commission in the management of the beef market.  If there is such influence with the Commission, why has it not been used to ensure that the ridiculous system of GATT management in terms of quantities and export refunds is rectified?  That would have a beneficial effect on Irish farming.</P>
    <P>During his meeting in the Red Cow Inn, the Minister said fiscal policy was not decided in Kildare Street.  That is correct because it is decided in Merrion Street by the Department of Finance, although there is collective Government responsibility for it.  However, the Minister mentioned it at the end of his speech from which I presume we are meant to interpret that he is personally responsible for it, although he is not.  The major tax concessions are wonderful.  The people to whom Senator McGowan referred and the people I know are not worried about paying tax but about surviving.  Despite the rosy picture painted by the Minister, there is £120 a head less being given for beef animals than was given before Christmas.  There was a £144 a head or 18p a pound reduction between March 1996 and March 1997.  That reality should have been recognised in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we must comply with the ceilings proposed by GATT because it is a formal international agreement but he did not agree that cutting export refunds was the best strategy. None of us agrees it is the best strategy, but the question is what will be done.  Perhaps he admitted there was a problem when he said there was light at the end of the tunnel.  He also said there will be further discussions with the Russian authorities in June to review the situation.  Will that <Col N="911" /> be before or after 6 June?  Will those talks take place in Kavanagh's pub in Enniscorthy, in Dublin Airport or both?</P>
    <P>Who is benefiting from the money which has been secured from the European Union to fund Irish agriculture?  If that £30 million a week was given to producers, 2,000 to 3,000 would not be leaving the land each year.  The Minister made huge play of the lack of competition in the industry and what the meat factories were doing when he spoke at the public meeting.  He has since referred this matter to the Competition Authority. However, he did not mention it in his speech this evening.  Why has he remained silent? Why did he not mention the need for live cattle exports to ensure competition in the industry, which was correctly identified by Senator Townsend, and the fact that support moneys must be passed on instead of being swallowed up in the system?</P>
    <P>Currency is also a factor.  Farmers can operate if the currency is stable, but not if there are constant revaluations and devaluations or if the Minister for Finance sends out a signal which has a catastrophic effect on the market, although I accept that effect has been beneficial in the case of our export industry and farming.</P>
    <P>We need a national plan for the beef industry. We had a plan for the pig industry, which was sponsored by the IDA and which, to many people's surprise, achieved many of its objectives. However, if a Martian saw our grass, beef and farming systems and he knew there were 380 million people in the European market, he would question why this industry is not thriving?  The reason is that there has not been a coherent national strategy at technical, marketing or support level to ensure the industry moves in the right direction.  We should have immediate traceability and there should be computer backup. There should be an assurance campaign and production systems which can be promoted by Teagasc. There is a realistic expectation that despite instability in the market, efficient people can survive and prosper.  I suspect if we allowed Grand Metropolitan and Guinness to take over the Irish beef industry, they would make a better fist of it because they would see the 380 million mouths in Europe and they would realise that if they increased their market share by 2 or 3 per cent there would be huge national benefits.  We must take a commercial approach and not reduce people to peasant farming.</P>
    <P>How do we explain EU policies which are isolated from each other?  One EU policy states that calves should be slaughtered while another states that suckler cows should be subsidised.  How do we square slaughtering calves with subsidising suckler cows?  That does not make sense.  How do we have a scheme for environmental protection when, because of a European system which encourages people to put more sheep on the mountains, there is environmental degradation on the mountains on a scale not seen for generations <Col N="912" /> and which will take generations to rectify? How do we reconcile those two policies?  Politicians, Departments and civil servants make policies, but they can be changed.  If policies could not be changed, what would be the point of having a system of government?</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of the disposal of special risk material &mdash; the heads and spines of carcasses. There is a £3 per head levy, but damage is being caused to the environment because people are burying carcasses in fields.  There is no consistency in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the dairy regime must be examined.  There are two categories of people who should be accommodated within the revised policy.  The first are those who can survive and produce a lot of milk at low cost in a hostile international environment.  They should be allowed to do so because it is in the national interest to keep the volumes going through our processing plants so that the unit cost will come down and we will be able to respond to international market signals to produce more milk, rather than allowing New Zealand or America to take up the slack.  The Irish dairy industry must be compelled to invest in those areas because that is where the extra milk will come from.  That is the reason we need high level commercial people to exploit the market. There is also an obligation to protect the small weak farmers who cannot survive within that environment.  I do not see any inconsistency in allowing those things to happen and it is possible under the GATT rules.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he aimed to ensure the capacity and capability of the industry to respond to future opportunities.  We all agree with this.  He said his Department is committed to the highest standards of food safety.  One journalist describes this as a culture of voluntary blindness.  We have to realise that as regards the BSE crisis the consumer rules.  Even if there is no quantifiable connection between BSE and CJD, the variant strain of BSE, and meat and bone meal, the consumer wants BSE free meat.  If there is no proven connection between the use of anabolic steroids, not angel dust, and the quality of meat it is the consumer who demands hormone free meat.  The consumer will decide and we better get that message through our heads.</P>
    <P>There should be a register of cereal growers. The area aid maps scheme is a disgrace.  The Dutch potato industry markets its potatoes.  The Irish seed potato industry should be like its Dutch counterpart.  The reason the Dutch potato industry has a better health status is its people marketed their product throughout the world and sold potatoes.  We can talk about having the best potatoes in the world but if nobody knows it we are wasting our breath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be able to comment on this very serious crisis.  It is almost too late for this Government to do anything about it. Much valuable time has been lost through months of indecision but it was not through lack of <Col N="913" /> prompting by the Opposition benches in both Houses.</P>
      <P>I am very critical of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring and his use of the Government jet.  The same Deputy complained about the use of the Government jet by the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  That Government negotiated billions of pounds that have been squandered by Departments since this Government's inception in 1994.  The media has not highlighted the issue of Deputy Spring and his use of the Government jet.  The Tánaiste has spent more time abroad than he has looking after the agriculture industry at home.  He should have been trying to secure live export markets.  Very little has been done for this sector.  For a few months we had inadequate shipping facilities for live cattle exports.  The press releases in <i>The Farmers' Journal,</i> the midweek farming section of <i>The Independent</i> and <i>The Examiner</i>  were indoctrination at enormous expense.</P>
      <P>Last week in the Dáil there was a parliamentary question on the cost of a Minister's photographer.  I wondered why the poor people of Ireland made this country free.  Some Ministers are squandering taxpayers' money on photographers instead of getting on with the job.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister, Deputy Yates and Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who is present, come from a rural background.  I do not think they got the support from Ministers Spring and De Rossa and other members of the Government that they should have in trying to cope with the major problems in the agriculture industry.  All we have is indecision.  Last week we had an announcement that the Minister, Deputy Yates would meet the Egyptians.  Contradictory statements were made by the Labour Party spokes-persons in various constituencies.  Nothing happened over the past few months but at the eleventh hour a meeting with the Egyptians has been arranged to take place in a few weeks time. It would be far better if the Taoiseach dissolved this Government immediately because he will not be back to collect the seal of office.</P>
      <P>The various farming sectors and their families are very annoyed because their livelihoods are at stake.  The spin-off industries are also at stake and the way in which they have been handled is a disgrace. Media coverage is of little use to the farming community who wants to pay its debts, educate its families, meet mortgage repayments, etc. The agriculture industry is very important but the people involved seem to be very greedy.  There were many shady business deals prior to the establishment of Greencore.  The people involved are not so green because they are watching the money in their pockets rather than looking after the farmers.  There is great anger at the manner in which the sugar beet crisis has been managed. There have been meetings on this issue in every county.  What is Greencore's agenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Blame can be levelled at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The TB and brucellosis <Col N="914" /> eradication scheme has lasted for the past 50 years, yet we still have both diseases.  This is a national scandal.  No one will take the blame for it.  Civil servants either receive golden handshakes, retire or move to Brussels leaving their mistakes behind them.  I know of an instance where a herd of dairy cows was destroyed because a cattle dealer who rented grazing land brought every known disease into the area.  The whole parish was nearly wiped out.  The Department, under successive Governments, was warned to tighten up on these areas.  Some Members did not know what we were speaking about because they were not from a farming background.  Billions of pounds have been wasted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry because nobody cares.  God speed the day when someone will be made responsible. Whether those responsible are in the private or public sector they will be booted out the door without any compensation.</P>
    <P>The Fr. Brendan Smyth controversy brought down a Government and almost brought down a subsequent Government when hidden files relating to the case were discovered.  The Government under Deputy Reynolds was brought down because a civil servant did not carry out his duties properly; the present Taoiseach was almost deposed because the same civil servant was not doing his duty properly.  That civil servant got a golden handshake of £85,000 and a pension.  God help Irish taxpayers.  That is where the lack of responsibility lies.  The same is happening in other Departments.</P>

      <P>This is a statement on agriculture. I am comparing the lack of responsibilities on the part of many senior civil servants who are the guardians of the public purse and the nation's affairs.  Nobody seems to care.  I do not like it and neither do many young people.  There is much indecision in agriculture as well.  Many advisers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry would not know a bullock from a greyhound. They get spin doctors to bring out statements but farmers are not fools.  When they see their income disappearing they know what the problem is.  The problem in the sugar beet industry has not yet been sorted out.  I am disappointed with the manner in which the Government has handled this issue over the past nine months.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry have a responsibility to ensure transparency, accountability and unity of purpose in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said earlier that Fianna Fáil had no agricultural policies when in office but the record shows otherwise.  The then Deputies O'Kennedy and Walsh, former Agriculture Ministers, together with Commissioner MacSharry reformed the CAP.  The experts in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i><Col N="915" /> and in some of the farmers' organisations decried what Commissioner MacSharry did saying that he would destroy agriculture and that the cheque in the post was not acceptable.  If the cheque in the post had not been available in the past year and a half, there would have been another famine in Ireland.  Small and medium sized farmers would have had nothing to live on. This is the kind of hypocrisy with which we must contend.</P>
    <P>The sooner this Government is dissolved the better.  It is too late to undo the neglect which has occurred at the expense of the farmers of this country.  If this matter is not sorted out in the next two months we will have a crisis similar to that in 1974 when the meat factories ripped off the farmers, and they are ripping them off now.  They have no conscience and it seems that a cosy cartel is in operation there.  It is a disgrace.  I know the Minister has made soundings in recent days that a special group is looking into the issue but it will probably report this time next year when the crisis has passed.  Consultants will probably be employed at enormous cost to show the Minister where the factories are and what bullocks and store cattle look like.  It is a scandal that the meat factories are making a bad situation worse.</P>
    <P>If the Minister or his Minister of State can do anything in the days ahead &mdash; I think their days are numbered and I am not being spiteful, bitter or sarcastic about that &mdash; they should do it.  Many months have been lost when action should be taken, not alone for the farmers and their families but for other workers whose jobs depend on agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the concerns expressed about the problems being experienced in this area.  I was very disappointed by the negative statements in the Minister's speech.  I thought he would come into this House, prior to an election, and punch home the fact that he was doing the right thing and that positive progress was being made.  It is worrying when the Minister comes in here and starts making statements to the effect that there is some light at the end of the tunnel when he should be saying there is a blazing light at the end of the tunnel and the tunnel is opening.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he understands Qatar will lift restrictions in a couple of weeks and that it is to be hoped Oman will follow suit.  He also hopes that Jordan, which has also imposed a ban, will be persuaded to lift its restrictions.  Is the farming community going to live in hope for the rest of its life?  The Minister was hoping and praying for some light at the end of the tunnel and he said that although the process would be a long one it must be given the time and consideration it deserves.  How much time does he want?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of his speech, the Minister told us what the budget meant to the farmers and how much they would gain in the widening of the tax bands and the increase in tax free allowances to <Col N="916" /> £500 and £1,000.  Surely he is aware that 50 per cent of Irish farmers will not benefit at all from this as they do not earn enough to even come into the tax bands.  The Minister has made an entire series of negative assumptions.  He says he will meet the Russian delegation again in June.  Will he visit Wexford as he did on a previous occasion?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, and I come from the same county and he is aware of the problems there.  He knows that the west has been decimated in recent years by young people leaving farms and seeking work in Dublin, England, etc.  We must introduce a positive policy to keep those young people on the land where they belong.  They should be working on the farms as their mothers and fathers did.  They are different to the Minister of State, Senators D'Arcy, Byrne and myself because they are living in an age where they expect to earn a positive income.  There is no positive income coming from farming which will encourage young people to stay on the land.</P>
    <P>Farming is in decline.  I am not blaming the Minister for the BSE crisis and the other problems which are not of his making &mdash; these things happen and the Minister must deal with them &mdash; but I am blaming him for not taking the kind of positive action to secure markets, etc., to make a positive contribution to farming which is our most important industry.  I have often heard it said that when the farmer is down, the country is down. That statement might seem strange to people working in other sectors but it is true.  The agricultural sector is going through a very tough time at the moment, not through any fault of its own, but because of bad handling by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. It is fair to say that this Government does not give agriculture the same priority and urgency it does to other sectors.  Without that priority, we are going to dig ourselves into a very deep hole.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to solve everything by going to Brussels and lobbying the European Commission.  Is that how things are done now?  I thought the Minister would go to the Commission with a positive group of solid people, including representatives of the farming community, the IFA, ICMSA and so on, to put up a strong fight. This country has been blackguarded for far too long by the EU which constantly reminds us of the billions of pounds which it gives us.</P>
    <P>I have always made a parallel between fishing and agriculture.  Ireland contributes £2.1 billion to the EU from its fishing waters.  The EU makes a big deal about giving us £6 billion or £7 billion in Structural Funds over five or six years.  However, this is only a pittance in comparison to what we have given them.  Since the London Convention of 1964 member states have fished our waters but no compensation has been given to our fishermen who are gradually getting smaller catches and greater penalties and quotas have been imposed. If the EU thinks it is doing us great favours it should start adding up our contribution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> I do not see how compensating farmers will solve the problem.  It will solve it this year and get them over problems in the short term but what we need is a proper agricultural policy. Agricultural advisers, who made mistakes in the past, told farmers they needed big milking parlours and huge silos with the result that farmers borrowed large amounts of money.  This happened under Fianna Fáil Governments also.  We can see these big sheds, silos and milking parlours in ruins and unused along the Dingle peninsula.  I am only guessing but I would say that, in the last ten years, half of those making a good living from farming in the Minister's and my areas have now left it.  Only the shells of buildings are left.</P>
    <P>One question posed on last night's &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme was what the big issues in the forthcoming election will be.  I could not believe it when everything was mentioned except agriculture.  This is the problem: the Government, Ministers and Members are focused on other issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Rural Ireland and agriculture will be forgotten and the attitude seems to be that the sooner it is out of the way and compensation is received for farmers the better.  The emphasis is on compensation rather than finding markets which can be exploited if there is the will to do so and a strong Minister to act.  I have nothing personal against the Minister or any other Minister, but I see the problems in agriculture and they are bigger than the Minister thinks.  His speech tonight was negative and full of doubt, offering a little light at the end of the tunnel.  He had nothing positive to say.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the £100 million received as compensation for the BSE crisis last June and October, saying that &ldquo;by any standards, this was a very sizeable package of aid and it has made a very substantial contribution to relieving the hardship endured by producers&rdquo;.  However, it has not ended the hardship which the Minister acknowledged exists.  I have always admired the Minister but he looked a beaten man in the manner in which he delivered his speech tonight.  He wanted to get the speech out of the way and get on with his business.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to do whatever he can in the last days of this Government.  I wish him well in the election and hope he is returned because he brought legislation through the House of which he can be proud.  I do not know much about the detail of agriculture, such as weight and prices for beef, but I see what is happening and I was very disappointed with what the Minister said and the manner in which he delivered his speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what Opposition Members have said the Minister gave a very comprehensive overview of <Col N="918" /> the agriculture sector, including agri-monetary compensation, the beef sector, the beef and cattle trade, food safety, the milk sector, the food industry, the tillage and potato sector and Partnership 2000.  I will confine my remarks to my areas of responsibility and take this opportunity to outline the progress made.</P>
      <P>Having a clear cut policy on rural development is now more important than ever and my Department has an increasingly important role in this. The main development in this regard in recent years has been implementation of the Leader programme.  This is the EU initiative based on the bottom-up concept of involving the local community in its own development.  I am happy to inform the House that following the success of Leader I, I negotiated the operational programme for Leader II with the European Commission to provide for the extension of the programme to all rural areas.</P>
      <P>Thirty four local action groups and two sectoral based groups with a rural tourism remit have been approved to implement local business plans which they have drawn up.  Today I announced additional allocations of funding to the groups approved to implement the Leader II programme. An additional £14.5 million was allocated to the 34 area based groups involved bringing to £87.5 million the funding available for the implementation of local business plans throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Leader programme has proved a tremendous success in providing a role for local communities to involve themselves in the development of their own areas.  The approved groups have responded to the opportunity presented to them by demonstrating clearly that they are willing and able to participate in and contribute to that development.</P>
      <P>Leader II has been operating for about 18 months in all rural areas.  Having established themselves in their areas the groups are well advanced in the implementation of their business plans.  One of the key features of the programme is its role in community development and we have insisted that each group undertake a programme of animation and capacity building in their communities to encourage and facilitate the development process.  I am confident that this is an activity which will support rural communities and improve their ability to engage in local development long into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the mid-term review of the programme my Department is seeking European Commission approval for a number of proposed changes which, if approved, will improve the delivery and impact of the programme.  We are also embarking on the programme of networking activities which will facilitate the exchange of information and experience between groups.  I am confident that the additional funding which has been announced, the proposed changes in the operating rules and the networking arrangements will provide a major boost for the Leader programme and will enable approved groups to <Col N="919" /> make a worthwhile contribution to the development of their areas.</P>
    <P>On a more general policy level, the rural development policy advisory group which I established in December 1995 to advise me on future policy is on the point of finalising its report.  This is a wide ranging review of the situation in rural areas and of the problems, issues, needs and opportunities for our rural communities.  The report puts forward its views on the vision of a society which we should strive for and the types of strategy and policy responses needed to achieve it.  I am planning to have the group's report published and widely circulated in the next few weeks.  I am confident that the deliberations of the group will provide a very valuable contribution into the debate on the future of our rural areas.</P>
    <P>The National Social and Economic Forum also published a report recently entitled Rural Renewal, Combating Social Exclusion.  This contains an analysis of the current situation and a range of policy recommendations to achieve greater social inclusion in rural areas.  The three core recommendations of the report are: that a Department of Agriculture and Rural Development should be established to take the lead role in policy matters relating to rural development; that a standing committee for rural development policy review and advice should be established; and that the Government prepare a White Paper on Rural Development.  The report of the National Economic and Social Forum has been referred by Government to my Department to co-ordinate the Government response to the recommendations.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group has been established and will be reporting back to Government on the issues raised in the very near future. I can assure the House that rural development policy has been high on my list of priorities.  I am pleased the work of the rural development policy advisory group in particular, together with the other recent contributions, will form the basis for a comprehensive integrated strategy for rural development which will sustain our rural communities well into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>A considerable degree of co-operation exists in the development of cross-Border projects in the agriculture and rural development areas under the various EU operational programmes, community initiatives and the International Fund for Ireland.  This co-operation is given focus through the steering committee on cross-Border rural development, which was established by the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in 1991.  This committee, which is representative of senior officials of the Departments of Agriculture, North and South, concentrates its discussions on national structures for promoting rural development, including Leader and the operational programmes which do not have an existing cross-Border forum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Under Leader II, the transnational co-operation measure, which is particularly suited to encouraging joint project activity between groups here and in the North, was launched in January. In addition, under the Leader networking arrangements, it is the intention to promote and encourage regular contacts and exchange with the body responsible for networking in the North. The other main areas of contact and co-operation between the two administrations come under the International Fund for Ireland and the European Union INTERREG initiative.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the rural environment protection scheme (REPS), which is another of my areas of responsibility.  REPS is beginning to play an increasingly influential part in family farming. This is largely because of the part played by REPS in the household income of many family farms.  This becomes evident when one considers that there are now approximately 25,500 farmers approved for REPS payments.  Some 9,000 of these farmers have also received their second year REPS payment, while 700 or so have also received a third REPS payment.  Overall, REPS payments of close to £122 million have been paid to participant farmers to date.</P>
    <P>There is also a significant increase in the interest and commitment being shown by all farmers, and not just those in REPS, towards the protection of the rural environment.  Farmers have recognised that their land resource and the wider rural environment are finite resources and as such must be protected against practices which will downgrade the quality of the environment for themselves and others.  REPS has played a major role in concentrating farmer thinking in this regard and it is clear that most farmers now practice farming in accordance with REPS principles. Farmers must recognise also that the principles of sustainability and environmental farming will become increasing considerations in family farming.</P>
    <P>All the indications at EU level are that an increasing emphasis is being placed on the protection and conservation of the natural environment. This is evident from policies such as those applying under the Habitats and Birds Directives which have been the subject of recent implementing legislation by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  These directives require the Minister to designate Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs).</P>
    <P>It has been accepted that where existing farming practices have to change as a result of such environmental designations, a system of compensation should apply.  It is proposed that compensation in respect of SAC and SPA designations will apply through an enhanced Rural Environment Protection Scheme, or through a scheme operated by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The proposed compensation systems to apply are subject to the approval of the European Commission.  Discussions have now commenced with the Commission to this end and <Col N="921" /> my Department is hopeful that an appropriate compensation system can be agreed in the coming months.</P>
    <P>In my time in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry I have taken a keen interest in the organic farming sector and its development. This is a sector which I see as having tremendous potential for development.  In my view, organic farming is a long way from achieving its development potential in spite of great strides having been made in this area in recent years.  The attachment of a specific organic farming supplementary measure to the rural environment protection scheme has given the production of organic produce a tremendous boost. REPS offers attractive financial incentives to farmers already engaged in organic farming, while an even greater level of incentives is available to farmers converting to an organic farming system for the first time in accordance with REPS.  The attractiveness of the REPS organic measure can be seen when one considers that there are now over 600 registered, active organic farmers compared with the 175 farmers registered in 1990 when my Department first established its organic farming unit.  However, it is clearly of little value to have on paper 600 or possibly more organic farmers if the ensuing levels of produce, that is, food products of good marketable quality, are not significantly increased.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the orderly development of the organic sector and in particular the improved distribution and market availability of the increased levels of organic produce arising from REPS and from the increased consumer demand for such produce, my Department has secured funding from the 1994-1999 Structural Funds for a special scheme of grant aid geared towards the development of the organic sector under the headings of marketing, promotion and capital investments. Applications have been received in respect of the 1997 tranche of this scheme and these applications are being assessed at present.</P>
    <P>Further funding will be available under this scheme in 1998 and 1999 to assist other organic development projects.  The orderly and careful application of funds under this scheme should ensure that sound structures are put in place to secure an increasing market share for organic produce.  Incidentally, my Department recently held a symposium on organic farming in Portlaoise, which was very well attended.  This presents compelling evidence that the organic sector is gaining significant momentum.</P>
    <P>The scheme of early retirement from farming, which was introduced in January 1994, is helping to redress two of the main structural defects in Irish farming, namely, farm sizes and the age profile of farmers.  It provides a generous pension for farmers who retire and hand their lands on to younger farmers, very often the family successor.</P>
    <P>At the end of April 1997 some 5,999 farmers had qualified for pensions totalling £54.3 million annually.  In addition, 189,600 hectares had been released under the scheme to young trained farmers, <Col N="922" /> resulting in an average increase in their farm size from 31 to 49 hectares, which in itself is a significant structural improvement.  Over £94 million has been paid to date to retired farmers under the scheme, the average annual pension being £9,057.  The success of the scheme can also be gauged by the target of 7,000 participants being reached this year, one year ahead of target.</P>
    <P>Horticulture is a sector which has potential both as a mainstream farm activity and as an alternative supplement to other mainstream activities.  Its labour intensive character ensures that it retains a significant role in the overall economy.  A capital grants scheme for investments in horticulture was introduced early in 1995 under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-1999. In 1996, 112 projects were approved, involving £1 million in aid.  Approved projects were aimed at increasing volume, value and efficiency, improving quality or presentation, or enabling the producer to introduce a new product or to take advantage of a new market.  A further round of applications involving 300 projects is now being assessed.  In total, over 1,000 applications have been received since the commencement of the programme.  Other on-farm investments are catered for under the farm improvement programme, which is now confined to the horticulture sector.</P>
    <P>The reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, proposals for which were under discussion since late 1995, was completed under the Irish Presidency in July 1996.  The new arrangements for the sector apply from 1 January 1997.  The main trust of the reform is the strengthening of the producer organisations, which should benefit horticulture in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to an important Bill to control horses in urban area which I introduced in the Seanad, that is, the Control of Horses Bill, 1996.  I hope the measures which will be put in place by this Bill will soon be brought into effect by the local authorities.  It is up to the local authorities to put in place the by-laws.  I am confident that the provisions of this Bill will ensure that the problem of wandering horses in urban and, indeed, rural areas will be controlled at last.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to the development of the greyhound industry, which has made significant progress under my stewardship in the past two and a half years.  Over the past three years almost £9 million has been made available in grant-in-aid to Bord na gCon and invested, with considerable impact, in the development and marketing of new facilities.  The success of this approach, matched, as it has been, by the vision and hard work of Bord na gCon, is evident in the fact that the downward cycle in the fortunes of the greyhound industry has been reversed.  The year 1996 has seen increases in attendances of 9 per cent, in tote betting of 27 per cent, and in bookmaker betting of 1 per cent. 1997 is showing similar growth trends.  Attendances <Col N="923" /> are up already by 60 per cent, tote betting is up by 64 per cent and bookmaker betting is up by a similar margin.  The industry is thriving.</P>

      <P>The Government plans to continue with this assistance in an effort to ensure that the rate of progress achieved so far can be sustained and the industry is enabled to develop to its full potential.  Other changes brought about directly by this Government to assist the industry include a reduction in the VAT on greyhound feed from 25 per cent to 12.5 per cent in 1995 and the granting of an exemption from tax on income from stud fees was introduced in 1996.  I consider these to be of major benefit to the industry.</P>
      <P>Government approval was given late last year for my proposals on new greyhound legislation and the drafting of the Bill has already commenced. The Bill will include provision for a new greyhound racing authority to replace Bord na gCon.  It will be slightly larger than the existing board and will be broadly representative of the various interests in the industry, including the greyhound fraternity in Northern Ireland.  It is also planned to establish a new independent control and appeals board with a legal person in the chair and to provide for veterinary or scientific expertise on, or available to, that board.</P>
      <P>In March of this year I held a very successful Greyhound Industry Forum at Shelbourne Park which gave those involved in the industry the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to future policy formulation.  I arranged that a panel of experts attend the forum to speak on areas, including artificial insemination, conditions for trainers and breeders.  This forum gave those involved in the industry the opportunity to listen to the views of people with experience and expertise in various subjects affecting the greyhound industry, pose questions and have their views heard.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to some of the points raised by the Senators.  Senator Kiely, in particular, raised the issue of the £17 million compensation. I remind the Senator that this is the first time this level of compensation was given to the farming population by an Irish Government since joining the EU.  The £17 million is confined to cattle slaughtered between 1 April and 10 June because the main fall in prices took place after 1 April.</P>

      <P>I suppose one cannot satisfy everybody.  Before that date, cattle prices, while lower than in 1996, were roughly in line with expectations.  In other words, producers received the kind of price they expected when they purchased the cattle last autumn.  The £17 million compensation must be seen in the context of all the compensation packages.  Apart from the £100 million BSE compensation package, the agri-monetary packages for the three revaluations since last November amount to £31 million.  In addition, the changes negotiated by the Minister last October to the extensification premium are worth a further £16 million per annum.  It should also be remembered that the Minister negotiated the extension of the slaughter premium into 1997. This is of tremendous benefit to winter finishers.</P>

All the compensation which the Minister succeeded in getting in Brussels is worth over 40p per pound to the beef producers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan suggested that the Minister and I have done nothing to help agriculture while in office.  A quick glance at the Minister's speech, together with what I have said, would disprove that contention.  Let me take one statistic to show the results of our efforts.  One should look at the developments in direct payments, for example. These reached a record level of over £900 million in 1996.  The Minister was responsible for those negotiations in Brussels.  Even if he was accused <Col N="925" /> of going on his knees to the Commissioner, coming home with the money was what counted.  He did a very good job.  There was an increase of over £240 million over 1994, a massive 35 per cent increase.  In the past 12 months alone, Minister Yates negotiated compensation packages of £185 million.</P>

      <P>Approximately £40 million has been spent on direct payments in north Kerry.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan also referred to the transfer of ewe premium quota.  The rules governing the transfer of quota are set down by Brussels and are relatively straightforward when there are no problems relating to the legal title to the quota. The example highlighted by the Senator is not a good one because the problem in the case in question does not appear to have been caused by the procedures surrounding the transfer of quota but rather by the absence of proper legal title to the holding on the quota.  My Department has done everything in its power to simplify the procedures. This year a brokerage system was introduced which enables us to put farmers wishing to transfer a lease quota into contact with people in their area who want to purchase or lease quota. This service has been well received by the farming community.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Dardis' statement, it is not true that the Minister did not admit that a problem exists in the agriculture sector.  Senator Fitzgerald accepted this by stating that the Minister's statement contained too much doom and gloom.  If Senator Dardis had read the Minister's speech carefully, he would be aware that not only did the Minister concede that there are problems in the beef sector but he attempted to identify and explain the reasons for those problems.  I remind the Senator that these include the BSE crisis, the successive reductions in export refunds and the revaluation of the Irish green pound.</P>
      <P>We differ fundamentally from the Opposition in that we try to identify the source of these problems and do not attempt to pretend that they can be solved with a wave of the Government's magic wand.  No one on the Opposition side made a sensible or realistic assessment of how these problems might be addressed.  I did not hear one statement aimed at easing the problems faced by beef farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite Senator Dardis's protestations, the basic problem of the beef sector is that the BSE crisis has reduced beef consumption to the extent that the GATT ceiling on subsidised exports is now a major constraint.  There is no simple or obvious solution to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> The Senator also referred to the Minister's statement that exports to third countries increased by 40 per cent in 1996 compared to 1995.  This remarkable performance is directly due to the efforts of the Minister, the Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia in the immediate aftermath of the BSE crisis to ensure that these markets remained open.  This is in sharp contrast to the position in 1990 when, in the three years following the BSE crisis in that year, virtually all of our steer beef was sold into intervention.  These facts speak for themselves and Members will accept that, at that time, the majority of beef was being placed in intervention and very little of it was being sold to Egypt, for example.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, we have retained the market for our beef in Egypt and we have succeeded in increasing our exports to Russia.  These markets were kept open by the Minister and me.  I visited Russia and was informed that a decree was ready for signature which would close the Russian market to Irish beef.  Working through the Russian Government I was able to stall the issuing of that decree which would have ended Irish exports to Russia.  It would have been difficult to restore those exports.  I invited a delegation of technical experts to Dublin and, following their visit, instead of exports from the entire country being banned only those from three counties were halted.  Had that not happened, the beef industry would have collapsed.</P>

      <P>Senator Byrne made an impassioned plea and he accused some of the excellent civil servants in my Department of various wrongdoings in the past.  I take the opportunity to state publicly how impressed I am with the civil servants working in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who are people of high standing.  I enjoyed working with them.  They were co-operative and supportive at all times.  I reject any allegation about their standing, honesty and quality.  It is regrettable that people have decided to target officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and its former secretary, a Kerryman, who retired recently, for very unfair criticism. I stand over decisions made during my time in the Department, which, at all times, were in the best interests of the farming community and above board.</P>
