      <P>I have notice from Senator Cotter that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to confer disadvantaged status on the St. Louis junior school, Clones, County Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the urban renewal scheme to Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to address the marketing problems being experienced by farmers who have invested in Christmas tree production.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cotter and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Finneran as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is item 32 &mdash; referring a report to the Joint Committee on European Affairs &mdash; without debate; item 1 &mdash; changing the Order of the House &mdash; without debate, followed by Report Stage of the Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill, which I hope will conclude by 4 p.m.; item 2 from 4 p.m. until 6.30 p.m.; item 3, the Equal Status Bill, from 6.30 p.m. until 7.30 p.m.; and at 8 p.m. we will resume item 2, with an open ended debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Order of Business.  This side of the House likes to be as <Col N="78" /> responsible as possible and we will help in every way to facilitate the ongoing passing of legislation. The Leader has our support for the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader approach the Minister and the Government on our behalf to find a speedy solution to the paramedics' strike which is causing grave concern and hardship for many people?</P>
      <P>When is it proposed to take the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996?  I have had, as I am sure have other Senators, a great deal of correspondence on that Bill, particularly on that part of it dealing with Paraguayan adoptions.  I am now led to believe that the Minister of State at the Department of Health has the full legal advice required to clear that part of the Bill.  I hope it will be brought speedily to the Seanad so that we can enact that very necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>I am sure Senators O'Kennedy and Daly will deal with their Shannon River Council Bill, 1997. It is a very good Bill, Second Stage of which has begun in the House.  I ask the Leader to make time available for this Bill next week, even if we have to sit for longer.</P>
      <P>In regard to my Bill on fishing, I have had correspondence which stated that £2 billion worth of fish are taken out of our seas every year and brought to Europe.  We take £100 million worth of fish out of our seas.  I do not begrudge the farmers the special package they are getting because of their difficulties but nobody thinks of fishermen.  I call on the IFA and ICSMA to support fishermen in their call for a better deal.  That £2 billion is probably used to help farmers, which means they are all in the same boat.  I would like the farmers to make a greater effort in that regard.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Marine to come to the House to discuss the problems of the fishing industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the matters raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  I ask the Government to look very favourably on the paramedics' claim.  I know the Government has a difficulty because various Ministers predicted that when the the nurses' claim was resolved it would trigger a series of claims on a parity basis.  However, these people make an extremely valuable contribution to the welfare of some disadvantaged and disabled members of our society.  I would support being generous and decent to them, in light of the positive economic climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also raised the question of Paraguayan adoptions.  Last night I attended a meeting of Irish people in Wynn's Hotel, and I believe we have a problem closer to home in one sense, although I strongly supported the suggestions to deal with the Paraguayan adoptions. There is still not a proper contact register.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Currie, the strong view expressed on all sides of the House during a debate on the issue that a contact register is necessary and should be established as rapidly as possible, without waiting for Supreme Court <Col N="79" /> decisions?  The matter should be tested.  Virtually every country in Europe has such a register. Recent stories on the wireless described how a parent, a birth mother and her child, were simultaneously seeking each other and were deliberately given wrong information.  That is not tolerable in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise the question of genetic beet.  Will the Leader tell the Minister for the Environment about the serious concern many of us have about the proposal by the US based multinational, Monsanto, to establish an experimental planting of genetically engineered beet over the next few weeks or months in this country? Section 111 (1) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides that the Minister&mdash;</P>
    <P>may, for the purposes of environmental protection, for the prevention of danger to health or damage to property... make regulations for the control, management, regulation or prohibition of any process... involving a genetically modified organism.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader advise the Minister that the American Environmental Protection Agency has already come down in judgment on this firm on the basis of intentional misclassification of exposed and non-exposed workers, arbitrary deletion from the study of several key soft tissue sarcoma cases, lack of assurance of untampered records delivered and used by consultants and false statements about dioxin contamination in these products?  Will he also arrange for a debate on the question of genetically engineered plant life, because once they escape into the environment it will be impossible to recall them?  Will he pass on to the Minister the concerns for the long-term impact of this kind of experiment carried out by a company which has been discredited in its own country?</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that the House may sit until 7 a.m.  I propose that, in order to maintain the civilised standards of diet and debate that mark this House, we should adjourn for a light repast between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  I am sure at least one of my colleagues will support me in this.</P>

      <P>Are you moving an amendment or making a suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move an amendment and I hope it will be seconded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Order of Business.  I am also very concerned about the dispute involving the paramedics.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to advise on the steps he has taken to speedily resolve it?  Last night the Minister accepted that those involved had a legitimate pay claim.  While emergency cover is being provided, especially by physiotherapists, vulnerable people need the services of the paramedics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> I am very concerned that all routine orthopaedic operations are being cancelled.  Speaking this morning with the administrators in the hospital in Tullamore it is apparent that most of these operations involve elderly people awaiting hip replacements and people who have already waited up to two years for surgery.  It is distressing that they are being further delayed because of this dispute.</P>
    <P>Social workers and child care workers are also involved in the strike.  Most cases of child abuse or concerns relating to child care are emergency issues.  Given the vital services being provided and the vulnerable recipients involved, the dispute needs speedy resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean conceding the claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke to people involved in my constituency yesterday, all of whom were women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>She is asking him to concede claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an issue relevant to women, as was the nurses' dispute, and I have no doubt a gender issue exists.  If the Minister accepts they have a legitimate pay claim, will he do all in his power to resolve the issue quickly?</P>
      <P>I support Senators Norris and Fitzgerald in regard to the adoption legislation, particularly in terms of the Paraguayan adoptee association which has waited for the Minister of State to publish the legal opinion he was offered.  It has been circulated to us and I cannot see why it must be delayed further.  However, a contact register is vital and this needs to be acted upon immediately by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Dardis, asked me to raise the need for an urgent debate on agriculture. He has raised this on the Order of Business on a number of occasions recently and the Leader indicated that if there was time, he would accommodate it.  Did he mean if there was time before the election or if time could be fixed over the next few weeks?  There is great concern over the falling incomes of farmers, particularly in regard to cattle prices, and the effect it is having on rural communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone wants the paramedics pay dispute dealt with speedily.  There is concern about the wide variety of services which are affected.  However, I am concerned that we are being preached at by the Opposition in regard to the settlement of this dispute.  On the one hand, there are continual arguments about fiscal rectitude with regard to public pay and money coming out of the public purse and on the other, we are told we should not give in to pressure groups. One cannot have it both ways.  However, the dispute will be sorted out speedily by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support other speakers regarding the paramedics' strike.  Will the Leader do everything he can to get the Minister to resolve it?  It has a huge impact on the community. I refer particularly to social workers who deal with many issues of abuse in the education field.  It was stated that they should wait until the nurses' dispute was resolved and then their case would be looked at.  One cannot make fish of one and flesh of the other as it is an important area. While I appreciate we should not give in to pressure groups, they have concerns which need to be raised.</P>
      <P>Last week I raised the matter of young adolescents with mild mental handicap who are not coping in their communities.  I asked the Leader to look at this and he kindly said that if I put down a motion he would ensure it would be debated during Government time.  I have since put down the motion.  Will the Leader indicate when time will be allocated to debate this issue? It is an important issue, as he acknowledged, which concerns many families.  This problem must be tackled as individuals and families are vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to our Chief Whip for putting his weight behind my proposal that the Leader provides us with Government time as soon as possible to resume debate on the Shannon Council Bill.  All contributions on the Bill to date were supportive, including the Minister of State's, who agreed the Bill was acceptable in principle.  Will the Leader ensure that we are given Government time?  It is almost three weeks since we began the Second Stage debate and we should move on and conclude the Bill.  The Leader might indicate when this matter, on which there seems to be all-party consensus, can be debated in Government time.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan referred to the crisis in farm incomes, an issue I have raised in the past.  It is time the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry or the Minister of State came to the House to inform Members of the current position on the Government's action programme.  Yesterday, the Minister made an extraordinary statement in Luxembourg to the effect that he was going to propose that the Government bring in a compensation package.  This is months after the farm incomes crisis became rampant and despite our calls for a debate on this matter. He also said yesterday that he was going to contact, or had contacted, the Minister for Finance. Where has he been?  Farm incomes are in crisis.  It is time we had a debate on this and if the Minister cannot come here, the Minister of State should tell us what is being done to match the funds the EU made available a long time ago.  This an urgent matter.</P>
      <P>With regards to tribunals, I do not wish to refer to the current one but to the beef tribunal.  Would the Leader ask the Taoiseach to request the Tánaiste to have the bill for his costs at the tribunal, a tribunal he called for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was passed by a resolution of this House.  Those who demanded that a tribunal be set up &mdash; the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte in particular &mdash; also demanded the power to send for persons and papers but did not then disclose information themselves.  They should now ensure that their bills of costs for that tribunal are submitted and that that is done now rather than waiting until after the election.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, does not require any time to prepare herself to deal with Senator Mulcahy.  Would the Leader agree with me that there is tremendous anxiety on this side of the House, as there is on all sides, to bring the public service health workers' strike to an acceptable conclusion? There is no doubt about that.  Not alone does Senator Mulcahy give his usual dose of terror in the afternoon, but he also chooses to misrepresent the contribution made by Senator O'Sullivan, the leader of the Labour group.</P>

People are in need of medical treatment in every hospital and institution, yet they are not able to make appointments.  We have had one crisis after another in the health service.

      <P>Will the Leader draw the attention of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to the concerns expressed about his intention to license the television deflector operators?  This concern has not been expressed by any of the political parties.  People are not only worried about the possibility of owing millions of pounds but about what could happen if the Government was accused by other countries of not keeping a contract it has signed.  If industrial development authorities in other countries tell potential investors in Ireland that the Government breaks contracts, such as that made with MMDS and cable suppliers because it was afraid to upset a section of the community, it would endanger potential investment and we would lose the credibility we have established over many years.  I ask the Leader to draw the Minister's attention to these concerns.</P>

I have a different view from that of Senator Quinn.  Some 29 licences were sold for £20,000 each, which was like giving people a licence to print money.  It is important to have an opportunity to discuss this issue.  Many poor and middle income people are being asked to pay too much by MMDS operators.  In fairness to Senator Quinn, it would not be good if there was only one supermarket chain in Ireland.

      <P>I support calls for a debate on agriculture.  We must take action to solve existing problems in that area.  The largest problem experienced by the sheep and beef industries resulted from the GATT Agreement negotiated by Ray MacSharry some time ago.  New Zealand is allowed to export large quantities of sheepmeat to the EU as it sees fit and this completely distorts the market.  It would be helpful if the GATT Agreement was renegotiated so that New Zealand was permitted to send only a specified monthly quota of sheepmeat to the European market.  As far as beef is concerned, export refunds were reduced at the wrong time for beef producers whose cattle were coming out of the sheds between January and March.  If such reductions were on a planned basis during the year the market would not be distorted.  Will the Leader make time to debate this matter as soon as possible?</P>

I do not wish to correct the Senator, it is merely my intention to set the record straight.  Senator Quinn referred to the contracts in respect of the television system and I must point out that the High Court judgment gave South Coast Community Deflector Systems the right to apply for a licence.  The main issue involved was that the deflector system would interfere with the UHF frequency but that argument has been rebutted.</P>

      <P>I welcome Senator Fitzgerald's statement that the Opposition will be helpful and adopt a responsible approach to the business of the House in the coming weeks.  The reality is that there is a considerable amount of business, including a number of Bills, to be discussed and processed by the House during that time.  There are two ways this can be achieved.  We can try to be responsible in our contributions and engage in as full a debate as possible while moving briskly through our work or, alternatively, the House can sit late into the night or sit five days a week.  I do not want to ask Members to comply with the latter suggestion because many of them will be candidates for re-election to this House or election to the Lower House.  I will not declare the date of the election but we must assume that it will take place at the end of either May or November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> There is much work to be done and I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his assistance.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald and others raised the issue of the paramedics dispute.  Those of us who met the people on strike are conscious that they did not take that course of action lightly.  They have a case to make and the Minister for Health will do his best to end the dispute as speedily as possible. However, that must be done in an orderly way.  Senator Roche was right in his suggested approach.</P>
    <P>The Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, was also raised.  There is some confusion in that regard and it is important to clear it up.  I will come back to the House on the issue over the next two days with definitive information on the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators Fitzgerald and O'Kennedy raised the Shannon River Council Bill, 1997.  There is general agreement on it and we should be able to conclude the Second Stage next week.  Senator Fitzgerald raised the fisheries issue and I will do my best to have a debate on the issue before the end of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of genetic beet, which is a matter that might be raised on the Adjournment of the House.  I regret I cannot accept the Senator's proposal for a sos from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.  I would like to do so but we have a large amount of work to do today and it would not be possible to break in another hour and three quarters for an hour.  If we sit early into tomorrow morning I will try to arrange breaks so that Members and staff may refresh themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the issue of agriculture and I will try to find time to debate it next week. Senator Ormonde mentioned item 33 motion 26 on the Order Paper.  I will try to arrange at least an hour next week to begin a discussion on that motion.  It is an important matter and I will try to find time for it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the Shannon River Council Bill, 1997, to which I have referred, and the issue of agriculture.  I will try to have a debate shortly on the important issue of agriculture.  I have no function in the other matter the Senator raised.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Appeals Officers with independent authority to receive and investigate complaints from the public on any function or matter which has been assigned under this Act must be appointed in each Department or Agency where such officers do not already exist prior to the commencement of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many negative things can be said about the concept of ministerial responsibility; I can think of very few positive things to say about it or the manner in which it is operated.  However, there is one positive aspect to ministerial responsibility. <Col N="90" /> Despite its many warts and ills, which have been chronicled in every report on public service reform from the Devlin report onwards, a Minister can be questioned in the other House on any item of detail arising from an issue of administration &mdash; it is a great tragedy we do not have a questioning process in this House.  If used properly, this process provides tremendous protection to the rights of individual citizens.  For example, a person who has suffered because of maladministration, undue delay or the refusal of public servants to observe his or her rights can take his or her grievance to the highest political court in the land &mdash; the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not specifically refer to this matter. The Bill gives Ministers the right to allocate specific responsibility for particular areas of administration to civil servants, which I celebrate. The net effect of that on non-commercial State-sponsored bodies is the same as that which currently exists.  The concept of ministerial responsibility does not exist in the case of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, State-sponsored bodies, health boards and local authorities.  Therefore, when a parliamentary question is asked on any point of detail in these areas the question is, rightly, ruled out of order by the Chair in the other House.</P>
    <P>The Devlin report covered this issue in a most interesting manner in 1969.  A sub-group was established within the group which produced the report to look at the area of administrative justice. The group came to the conclusion with which I never agreed, that Ireland was not yet ready for an ombudsman.  It suggested that the system of in-house appeals officers with a statutory responsibility to hear appeals, listen to both sides of the argument and give a quasi-judicial view, should be extended.</P>
    <P>As the Minister and Members know, we have a very good appeals system in the Department of Social Welfare where officials who are fully <i>au fait</i> with the details of all the schemes in the Department are charged on a statutory basis with operating independently of their Minister and reviewing any cases where a complainant feels he or she is not getting their due rights.  This amendment suggests, as the Devlin report did in 1969, a way around the problems which will inevitably arise if one tries to curtail an area of administration and the operation of ministerial responsibility.  If we give a Minister the right to delegate an area of administration by statute, as is done in this Bill, we will be left without the current protection the citizen enjoys.</P>
    <P>The Minister could argue that things have changed since 1969 because we have an Ombudsman. I will anticipate this good argument because I know the Minister is well briefed.  I put it to him that the Ombudsman is currently handling fewer than 5,000 cases per year and is incapable of handling the myriad of cases which arise by way of written parliamentary question.  This Bill tries to achieve an objective I support &mdash; to modernise our administration and give individual civil servants <Col N="91" /> the responsibility and authority to release their talents and produce the modern administration this State needs.  Though this would be beneficial there is a danger that, in so doing, we may create a situation where the current protection which a citizen enjoys through the parliamentary question system, which gives effect to the concept of ministerial responsibility, will be negated or weakened.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see this amendment as a positive one, put forward not from a mischievous point of view but from the point of view of strengthening the Bill.  In this amendment, I suggest that the appeals mechanism which currently applies in the areas of revenue, the Valuation Office, social welfare and, which applies under statute in a number of specific cases in the Department of Agriculture and others, should be extended.  By means of such a statute we should seek to have an in-house, independent and autonomous appeals officer in every Department.  The cost of this would not be great.  It would be less than the £300,000 per week currently spent on researching parliamentary questions.  There would be a significant net saving if we could do that and we would have a first call of appeal which would obviate the need for parliamentary questions on points of detail.</P>
    <P>Let me recall some of the issues which have been the subject of parliamentary questions.  A parliamentary question some years ago concerned the number of crown newts in the Bourne Vincent Memorial Park; the Minister's predecessor had to answer this question in the Dáil with a serious expression.  Another of the Minister's predecessors was asked about the colour of the railings in the district veterinary office in Naas.  That is carrying parliamentary questions and scrutiny to the point of absurdity.  I recall speaking to the Deputy who asked the question and he defended himself by saying he was interested in the environment.</P>
    <P>The parliamentary question device provides protection but if we take an area of administration and ring fence it into an area of the Civil Service which is no longer the Minister's responsibility, we will be taking away that protection. The Minister will be aware from constituency work, as will other Members, that one of the extraordinary frustrations one is faced with is attempting to get information on the detail of how individual cases are handled by a number of our commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  Such bodies have been given the kind of statutory autonomy which we are going to give to specific executive areas of administration. Many of these bodies behave in a very decent fashion and deal correctly with queries but a degree of arrogance has entered the system in some cases.  Such arrogance exists because the protection of the parliamentary question device is not available.</P>
    <P>The parliamentary question system has been much abused over the years and the Minister <Col N="92" /> should look seriously at the idea of extending the in-house appeal system across the board.  It already applies in the areas of administration which have the most sensitive contact with the citizen, for example, health boards, social welfare, revenue and so on.  It would be worthwhile for the Minister to take on board the principle of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point made by Senator Roche.  This Bill is part of an attempt to streamline procedures within each Department. If procedures are streamlined there will be fewer appeals.  The public has recourse to parliamentary questions and can also appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman or directly to the relevant sections of the various Departments.  This Bill sets out and achieves what is intended, namely, the streamlining of Departments with a more business-like approach and less need for appeals.  This will be much better for the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt in detail with this matter last week when it was raised by Senator Lanigan on behalf of Senator Roche.  However, as it was initially raised by Senator Roche, I will repeat what I have already said.</P>
      <P>While it is true that some Departments or offices of State have appeals officers, their function is to adjudicate on decisions made by others which are challenged rather than deal with complaints. They tend to operate in relation to very specific categories of decisions rather than as local complaints officers as Senator Roche seems to envisage.  The Bill envisages a more formal assignment and recording of assignment of responsibility than exists at present.  Assignments are given from the Minister to the Secretary General and downwards through the hierarchy of the Department or office.  The range of matters to be formally assigned includes functions such as giving advice, assuring service quality, value for money, etc.</P>
      <P>Taken at face value, Senator Roche's amendment would provide for somebody within each Department to deal with complaints against the Secretary and others in relation to value for money, quality, advice, etc.  The Bill provides a formal statutory basis for certain arrangements which have come into being and which have operated on an informal non-statutory basis for many years.  It does not give statutory powers to the relevant civil servants which could be exercised outside the purview of the Minister, the Oireachtas or its Committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill clearly provides that everybody below the level of Secretary General within a Department to whom a function is assigned is accountable to the Secretary General who, in turn, is accountable to the Minister.  Accountability will not be a mere formality, particularly as it is <Col N="93" /> meshed with a system of performance management.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche, who has professional expertise in this area, is aware that we have an Ombudsman to deal with unresolved problems between Departments and clients.  The Ombudsman has spelled out in his report what he sees as acceptable standards of administrative procedures.  My Department is currently preparing a series of amendments to the Ombudsman legislation and legislation on administrative procedures which we intend to introduce as linked legislation or as a single measure.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche is particularly familiar with how the Civil Service works in practice.  He may believe that each official in the chain of command is so committed to rallying around any subordinate against whom a complaint is made that nothing less than 30 or so independent complaints officers can ensure fair dealing.  My own experience as a public representative and in the three Departments in which I have worked does not lead me to that conclusion.  I have sympathy for the underlying objective outlined by the Senator but the issue could be more appropriately dealt with in the context of the legislation to which I alluded.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that I do not think his suggestions in any way mischievous: they were constructive.  However, the approach suggested by him is not the most satisfactory and I do not propose to accept his amendment.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister said, the extension of appellant systems throughout the Civil Service would be beneficial.  There is an Ombudsman, but there is a limit on the number of cases his office can handle.  I still envisage a position where parliamentary questions involving certain issues could be ruled out of order as a result of the legislation.  I do not mind that because some of the issues raised in parliamentary questions are inappropriate.  However, in future, the Civil Service may have more autonomy in executive areas.  While I accept the Minister's comments, that aspect perturbs me.  On the positive side, as the Minister is aware, I have promoted the concept of an administrative procedures Bill.  This, with appropriate amendments to the Ombudsman Act, would achieve much of what I wished to achieve in this amendment.  I accept the Minister's response.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> The amendment seeks the deletion of the section relating to advisers.  I said much about advisers on earlier Stages but I accept there is a case to be made for having individual, independent and politically oriented advice available to Ministers. However, in recent years there has been a proliferation of advisers, programme managers and consultants in the public service.  I was not aware in my earlier contributions of the costs in this area but in the period 1995-6, the last year for which there are full accounts, £34 million was spent in the public service on consultants.  This sum was in addition to the cost of advisers.  What are public servants doing?</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated previously that the rule of thumb is three and two.  That rule of thumb is not fully observed in the appointment of advisers because I am aware some Ministers and Ministers of State have not utilised their full quota. However, it bothers me that there appears to be an extraordinary growth of public expenditure on advisers, consultants, programme managers, specialist back-up staff and constituency staff in Departments.  It is not clear where the line is drawn.</P>
    <P>I gave the example the last day of a person paid approximately £45,000 a year and who is canvassing by going from door to door.  I regard that as an abuse of the adviser's role; it is wrong.  The person is not attached to the Minister's office and I accept the Minister's adviser is doing what he was engaged to do.  However, evidence is available that there is an abuse of the system.  I pointed out previously that the junior party in Government now has more consultants than Deputies.  That is astonishing and total hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Several Members of the House and the Minister were in Cork during the by-election campaign when other political parties were pilloried by Democratic Left.  We were made the subject of ridicule because of the mercs and perks which surrounded political parties.  Democratic Left also attacked the Labour Party on that basis but it quickly forgot that aspect.  However, I have not forgotten its attack, part of which contained a grain of truth that this was an uncontrolled area of public expenditure.  There is a good public service and there is no need to spend £34 million a year on consultants.</P>
    <P>For example, in 1995-6, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications spent £12 million on consultants in addition to the cost of advisers, the programme manager and other special staff.  That is an unjustifiable scandal because there is also a significant bill for excellent public servants in that Department.  What are they doing?  Another choice example is that £6 million was spent by the Minister for Social Welfare in his Department.  He obviously forgot the Cork by-election.  It would interesting to know the number of consultants appointed by the Democratic Left Minister and Ministers of State. They have used their full quota and abused their position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> We do not have sufficient control on this new growth area.  The inclusion of advisers mars this fine Bill and this aspect should be removed.  The purpose of the Bill is not to give statutory respectability to advisers but to bring about long awaited administrative improvement.  I do not know the current full cost or exact number of advisers but the Minister will probably give it to me because he has the brief on it.  However, the figure outlined by the Minister today could be twice as big next month or next year.  The section writes a blank cheque and there is no need to include advisers in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Senator Dardis correctly pointed out during the last debate, it is astonishing that the positions of advisers or civil servants with long service to the State are not defined in law.  The issue of advisers is so ambiguous that it should be removed from the Bill.  We should be aware of the full cost involved.  If advisers are to be dealt with on a statutory basis, a severe upper limit should be placed on them.  This Administration is in its final weeks or months but the Bill will give the next two Administrations <i>carte blanche.</i></P>
    <P>This matter does not involve political point scoring because there was a grain of truth in some of the criticisms made by Democratic Left. However, it went over the top during the Cork by-election.  That grain of truth makes me uncomfortable.  The Civil Service is well structured and established on a statutory basis.  Civil servants are recruited on a non-political basis but advisers are not.  By and large, they are partisan. I have no problem with that but I have a difficulty with what is happening in this area.</P>
    <P>A nasty tradition had started to develop in the final days of Government, just before the interregnum period, that many people who were employed on temporary contracts were made permanent in the interests of the State.  When these people have statutory responsibility, there is no reason they cannot be given contracts which would be expensive to buy out.  For example, in the past, a contract was given to a person who was employed from outside the Civil Service. That was a scandal and an abuse because, when that arrangement was reached, the outgoing Administration knew the incoming Government would not countenance the appointment.  A cash payment had to be paid to buy out the contract.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates the opportunity for further abuse.  We have a good Civil Service and the Bill introduces an arrangement to make it better and give it more freedom.  There is no need to spend £34 million a year on consultants and many more millions on advisers.  It is an excess and the Bill would be improved by removing the section.</P>

      <P>In that case may I have your direction now?  I do not accept that amendment No. 5 should fall if amendment No. 4 is accepted.  Both should be accepted because both are worthy. Amendment No. 4 places a control on the number of special advisers who may be appointed but leaves open how many the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste may appoint.  At present there are 15 members of the Cabinet and one non-Cabinet member who attends Cabinet meeting.  Out of a total of 16, the only exceptions to the rule are the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  It is therefore possible to take amendments Nos. 4 and 5.  Can that be accepted?</P>

      <P>I have great difficulty with that. Amendment No. 4 shows the Government listened carefully to what was said on Committee Stage.  I congratulate the Minister for responding and taking steps to overcome the concerns expressed.  However, the amendment leaves a gap concerning the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and on that basis a future Government could allow them appoint many special advisers to a total which could exceed the maximum mentioned in amendment No. 5.  In my view amendments Nos. 4 and 5 could be accepted.  It may be that amendment No. 5 will be inserted at a different page or at a different line, but we should be allowed discuss it and perhaps the Minister would accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  We will have to consider that because it would be worthwhile to include the intention of amendment No. 5.  I am sorry for delaying so long on this point.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Roche's remarks on special advisers.  He argued that this is a worthy Bill and I agree.  I congratulate the Minister and we wish to support the legislation.  However, the Senator also argued it would be better to omit section 11, concerning special advisers.  I hope we can discuss how we can overcome any problem created if the section is removed.  Senator Roche suggests that we introduce another Bill or use another mechanism.  In withdrawing amendment No. 1 he has shown his willingness to make the legislation work and be worthy of achieving what it sets out to do.</P>
      <P>If we place a limit on the number of advisers that maximum may become a minimum but even with that danger it is better to include a limit. Parkinson's law states that work expands to fill the space available &mdash; in other words, if there is space for another desk a person will be employed simply because the space is there.  If we specify that a Minister may have two special advisers, they will automatically employ that number.  The same point arises concerning amendment No. 5 &mdash; if we specify a maximum of 100 we will have that number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am stunned by the number of special advisers, consultants, programme managers, etc., who have been appointed in recent times.  Senator Roche said there had been expenditure of £34 million on consultants alone, apart from the cost of special advisers and programme managers.  Over the years our Civil Service has been strong and loyal and has operated with high integrity.  We are now in danger of adding people to that system and giving them a freedom which this House will not be able to control.  Ministers of Finance have had trouble controlling outside experts, not just in this <Col N="98" /> Government but in the past.  I urge that we find a solution.</P>
    <P>I second Senator Roche's amendment No. 2 because there is a better way to deal with the issue than by including it in this Bill.  I am not convinced that we have found a solution and I look forward to the Minister's remarks on how we solve the problem of special advisers.  We require a solution but what is proposed in the Bill is not ideal.  The Minister's amendment No. 4 helps, as will amendment No. 5, but we have a long way to go before solving the problem.  The objective of Senator Roche's amendment No. 2 is to remove special advisers from the Bill to see if we can find a better way of dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>I wish to insert the words &ldquo;total maximum of 100&rdquo;.  It would focus our minds on where we are going, very much in the spirit of what Senator Quinn has just said.  The last day Senator Quinn said the present number of advisers is 79.  If another six were added for the six Schedules it would bring the number to 85, and one for each Minister would be a further 15, which would bring the total to 100.  Such measures appear to be very modest and, therefore, attract no public scrutiny.  I suggest a ceiling of 100 so that another debate would be required if there were an attempt to breach that maximum.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Quinn, I thank the Minister of State for tabling his amendment because it responds to a number of the anxieties expressed here the last day.  However, it excludes the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and, as it delicately puts it, the leader of another party who is a Minister.  If we had a coalition Government which was of full rainbow hue, as distinct from part rainbow hue, God knows how many special advisers could be launched into orbit under this legislation.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the spirit behind much of amendment No. 4, it still leaves a grey area where the uncontrollability of the number needs to be teased out further.  I did not know about amendment No. 4 when I tabled amendment No. 5, but my thinking along those lines induced me to insert the figure &ldquo;100&rdquo; to see how it would focus minds.</P>

The Minister of State told us the last day that he was not totally familiar with this Bill, which we accepted.  He told us he would advise us further on it on Report Stage and, in fairness to him, he has tabled an amendment which will place controls on special advisers.</P>
      <P>We all agree there are areas where Ministers and Ministers of State need advice and expertise. The Minister of State agreed to look at this matter for Report Stage, which he has done and on which I congratulate him.  Amendment No. 4 will provide the necessary controls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary for the Bill to accommodate the advisers because it is deals with chains of command and responsibility.  It is important to spell out in the Bill that there are categories of staff who are not accountable to the Secretary General but to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I was very taken by some of the arguments made last week.  Senator Roche has embellished them somewhat today by broadening the discussion to include consultants, who are not covered by this Bill.  I am concerned, as is the Minister for Finance, about the habit of some Departments calling in consultants rather than thinking through a problem.  I have seen the results of that in the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Some consultants' reports, which cost a great deal of money, are blatantly bad value.  The reason they often rest on dusty shelves is that they are no good.  I share Senator Roche's view on the drift towards getting consultants to look at problems.  I am sure Senator Quinn is familiar with that in his business.  It is often a cop-out for management rather than taking on the difficult job of solving a problem.  However, as I said, that is not covered under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The arguments last week on numbers were very compelling, which is why I tabled amendment No. 4.  I misled the House slightly, particularly Senator Lee, in regard to numbers.  I said &ldquo;three and two&rdquo; when I should have said &ldquo;two and one&rdquo;.  I was including personal assistants, who are a type of secretary, in the adviser category.</P>
      <P>The norm at the moment is a special adviser and a programme manager for a Minister and a special adviser for a Minister of State.  We propose to include in this Bill what has been the practice of this and the last Government, which is that a Minister has two advisers and a Minister of State has one.  In the case of two Ministers of State who are required to attend Cabinet meetings on a regular basis, namely, the Chief Whip and, in the present Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, they are entitled to the same number of advisers as a Cabinet Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to attempt to cap the number of advisers of the three party leaders in the same way, in that they have a much wider remit than that of a Minister.  Excluding those of the three party leaders, at present there are 43 special advisers and programme managers.  The <Col N="100" /> Taoiseach and the leaders of the other two parties have, in total, approximately 12 advisers, although there are one or two grey areas.  Therefore, the current total is 55 advisers.</P>
    <P>It would be imprudent to attempt to cap the number of advisers to the Taoiseach and whatever other party leaders might be in Government. The norm has been recorded here and if a Taoiseach or other party leader went completely berserk, in the manner outlined by Senator Roche, it would lead to huge public criticism and comment and I doubt they would get away with it.</P>
    <P>I have gone a long way towards meeting the concerns.  I am grateful to the Senators who raised the issue because we would be open to serious public criticism if we had left it as it was.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 5, it is possible to have both.  I defer to the Leas-Chathaoirleach in that regard but it is possible, with a rejigged amendment, to have such a capping.  However, specifying such a number would encourage the notion of having 100 advisers, which I would rather avoid.  Specifying numbers encourages the notion of getting up to the figure of 100 as if everybody was doing nothing unusual.  I would rather avoid it.  While under my proposal there is not 100 per cent control, there is significant control and clear guidelines have been set down.  I ask Senators to accept amendment No. 4 and not press amendments Nos. 2 or 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not acknowledge that, in indicating a ceiling, the Minister of State has picked up one of the main points in my proposal.  This is an improvement, but it is only the second best option; the best would be to delete the section. However, it would be churlish not to confirm that he has acknowledged the argument.  I see the point, made by him implicitly and explicitly by Senator Quinn, regarding unease about the concept of a maximum total of 100.  However, maxima always become the norm.  When the issue of the advisers is well established there will be pressure on Ministers to make appointments.  It is, therefore, a good idea to impose a maxima as this will prevent them from having their arms twisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We still do not have the full costs of advisers and the Minister of State was right to differentiate between advisers and consultants.  Successive Ministers for Finance have taken the view that there is an extraordinary abuse of the system whereby consultants are engaged in the public service.  Decisions to appoint teams of consultants tend not to be political but rather are made because people are frequently too lazy to produce ideas or else they fear that they will not be able to fight their corner against the Department of Finance.  The appointment of consultants is therefore advised.  They are given tight remits, are very costly and produce consultancy documents which, in many cases, lack intellectual rigour and are usually copies, incorporating the prejudices they wish to serve.  This is all then presented as a <i>fait accompli</i> to the Department of Finance as an <Col N="101" /> argument in favour of a specific policy or change. It is an abuse which is not new, but it must be brought it must be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand how the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications could conceivably spend £12 million on consultancies. The Department of the Marine spent £2.4 million on two separate consultancies.  Price Waterhouse was engaged, and spent £910,000 reviewing the management of the organisational structure of the fisheries service.  KPMG was engaged to undertake a separate study of the restructuring of the Irish white fish fleet.  Both should have been done together.  While I accept the Minister of State's proposal is an improvement to the Bill, it is a mistake to include the issue of advisers in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment because it is an improvement and brings the issue of advisers out into the open.  The Oireachtas should be more conscious of what is happening.  This is especially the case with regard to the Dáil, which has power over the public purse.</P>
      <P>The growth in consultancy is frightening and has happened under this and previous Administrations. Debate focuses attention on the issue, which in itself operates as a constraint.  If the Minister of State accepts the amendment it will improve the Bill because it will ensure that the issue is periodically debated in public.</P>

      <P>It is only because I do not consider that the amendment would improve the Bill that I am not inclined to accept it.  The amendment proposes that the Minister for Finance be empowered to fix the terms and conditions of special advisers appointed under the Bill made subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a novel proposition.  Various enactments regarding civil servants, office holders, members of State boards, etc., confer on the Minister for Finance, or some other Minister with his approval, power to fix terms and conditions of pay.  Ministers for Finance have exercised those powers responsibly over the years without any intervention by the Oireachtas, often to the annoyance of their colleagues.</P>
      <P>I do not see why that power should be curtailed in this specific and limited case.  There has not been, in the life of the Government or in the terms of previous Governments, any diminution of the rigour with which Ministers for Finance have approached these matters, simply because those whose terms they regulate are close to Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regime which currently applies, and has applied for some years, involves the application of a specific formula to advisers to Ministers and Ministers of State.  They are paid their existing salaries plus 10 per cent, provided the total does <Col N="103" /> not exceed the maximum of a specific Civil Service grade.  That maximum is, in the case of a Minister the maximum of the Principal Grade I scale, now £45,525, or, in the case of Ministers of State, that of Assistant Principal Grade I, now £35,493.  A few staff assigned to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs are paid marginally in excess of these limits.  That topic regularly attracts detailed questions in the other House and considerable media attention. Therefore, the possibility of inappropriate deals being concluded by stealth can virtually be ruled out.  In these circumstances, I am inclined to regard the proposal as a cure for a disease which does not exist.  I also have reservations in terms of the practicalities.  Prior approval may remove the scope which has to exist for dealing quickly with exceptional situations.  Appointments may arise during lengthy parliamentary recesses and negotiations may have to take place which take account of individual's earnings and skills and the needs of individual Ministers.</P>
    <P>This is a well motivated proposal but I do not accept it.  The Minister for Finance exerts strong control on these and many other issues.  In many cases, Ministers and Ministers of State have come to me and said that six months or longer after they had taken on their advisers, they were still not able to obtain agreement because of the rigidity of the Department of Finance.  There is strict enforcement with absolute impartiality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not imputing inappropriate deals or stealth.  Special advisers are not necessarily overpaid.  If they are as good as they should be, there are possibly underpaid.  However, I will not make an argument for raising the amount of money spent in the area.  I am concerned there should be rigorous scrutiny in the Oireachtas of the thinking behind the appointment of people at particular times.  It should serve as a continuing review of the effectiveness and usefulness of this type of appointment.  Amendment No. 4, which we agreed, may make it more difficult for the Minister for Finance to exercise the type of rigorous control he did in the past.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the leader of another party in coalition are the people whose numbers are not specifically controlled, it will put extra pressure on the Minister for Finance.  There is no reason the Tánaiste or the leader of another party could not be the Minister for Finance.  I suspect, in a changing scenario, this proposed amendment may become more potentially useful for public accountability in the broadest sense of policy formulation.  Will the Minister of State give weight to the reflection I expressed as the Bill progresses?</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I accepted an amendment from Senator Lee which would result in the office holders being empowered to take decisions in regard to assignments within the offices of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the applicability of the processes set out in the Bill to that office would be the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  I did so after explaining to the Senator my preference for a formula such as &ldquo;the Ceann Comhairle after consultation with the Cathaoirleach&rdquo; but he clearly did not like that and I understood why.</P>
      <P>Since Committee Stage there has been an opportunity for my Department and officials in the office of the Houses of the Oireachtas to discuss this formula.  I am advised that it could pose practical and legal difficulties.  This amendment uses a different formulation from my original proposal and that of the Senator which I accepted.  I am satisfied it protects the rights of each House in its respective domain by providing that the office holder in regard to the exercise of function directly affecting Seanad Éireann will be the Cathaoirleach.  He or she will be the sole exercising authority.</P>
      <P>I have also taken the opportunity in this amendment to substitute the titles of &ldquo;Chairman of Dáil Éireann and Chairman of Seanad Éireann&rdquo; for &ldquo;Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach&rdquo; which are those by which they are currently known in statute and in various statutory regulations.</P>

The authority of the Chairman of Seanad Éireann is limited specifically and explicitly to the business of Seanad Éireann.

The Minister of State may have referred to this in his reply before I came in. I understand he found that previous regulations referred to the Chairman of both Houses.  When and why did this happen?  Why was it necessary at any point since the foundation of the State that the terminology should be changed?  It has always been accepted practice that official terminology was in the first language.  I am concerned about this drift towards change.  I anticipate the answer of the Minister of State will be that there is a precedent for it but I am concerned that we are continuing down this road.</P>

I take it that the universities and the people who are responsible would have <Col N="109" /> to respond to those two objects.

Subsections (a) and (b) &ldquo;to advance knowledge through teaching... &ldquo;and &ldquo;to promote learning in its student body and in society generally&rdquo;, are integral parts of university activity but &ldquo;to foster a capacity for independent critical thought among students&rdquo; gives a sharper focus on the student as the product of at least part of this enterprise.

For example, there were many extraordinarily fine academic institutions in Germany until 1933.  They were also remarkable after 1933, particularly in the scientific area, but it is clear that they did not foster and promote independence of thought.  People can be brilliant in research and following patterns laid down by a dogmatic professor but that does not foster independent research.  The same is true in the case of China, which I have had the opportunity to visit on several occasions in recent years &mdash; I may be spending a considerable amount of time there in the next few weeks &mdash; and Russia.  I make that point in support of Senator Lee.  For those reasons I am very grateful that the Minister has accepted the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained my problem with this section of the debate on an earlier amendment.  I want to ask the Minister a couple of questions. Why is it necessary to provide for the object of a university in legislation?  There is a great danger that, in 20 or 30 years, or sooner, other objects will occur to people as has happened here already.  Will they then not be included because they are not provided for in this Bill?  Section 12 states that the &ldquo;objects... shall include&rdquo; but what happens if it is decided that they shall not include the particular paragraphs in section 12? That worries me.  Why is it necessary to provide for these objectives, which sound very worthy today but may not sound right in 20 or 100 years, in legislation?  Why can the Minister not trust the individual universities to decide their objectives and what they want to pursue in terms of cultural and educational interests?  I do not understand why this should be provided for in legislation.</P>
      <P>Who will decide whether a university is fulfilling these objects which the Minister provided for in legislation?  Who will be the arbiter?  Who will watch over the universities?  Who will decide on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis that these functions are being performed?  What sort of monitoring devices will there be to ensure that paragraphs (a) to (j) or (k), to include Senator Lee's amendment, are being performed?  That is important.  These items are just being pushed into the legislation but there are no monitoring procedures. I want to know how it will be judged and who will do it.</P>

      <P>There were two questions &mdash; why is it necessary and who will decide.  The Senator answered the first question when he accepted this was not an exclusive section.  It refers in broad terms to what universities are established to do.  We could continue having a philosophical discussion about whether these things should be included and whether statute is needed.  We are bringing forward university legislation to answer questions about the objects of a university, particularly when we had such a long discussion on section 9 concerning additional universities. I fall back on the definition that was arrived at here under the functions and objects.  It is not an exclusive list but it is a broad statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to who will monitor it, the universities themselves will be more than competent to do so. We have arrived at this position in close consultation with the universities.  Given the broad sweep of the section, I expect there is enough <Col N="111" /> confidence within the universities to decide what a university is about.</P>

      <P>We can refer to the section which deals with quality assurance.  There are enough links between what are set out as the objects of the university and what we have accepted is not an exclusive list of objects but a basic one.  Under other sections we have had discussions about setting things in statute, but if a Minister thinks this is the quality of the university's work it would be dealt with under the section on quality assurance.  However, in introducing the legislation we have accepted that the objects of the university would be laid down in broad terms.  I have tried not to be too prescriptive, but I know that is something the Senator cannot accept.  The legislation is being brought forward in that way and the Senator can agree to support it or not.</P>

I want to know if the Minister means what she says when stating that universities will decide how this is interpreted and that the Government will not interpret it in any way.

It is a statement of the objects of the university and unless a specific role is inserted I cannot follow the logic of the Senator's mind, although I am sure it is very logical.  The Senator has indicated that he cannot support this section, which lays out the objects of the university.  There is no role for, and no reason to expect, any interference by a Minister or a Government.  I am seeking support for the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I am not privy to the amendment, but have moved it on behalf of Senator O'Toole.  I have done so as it is necessary in order to keep it in play for Report Stage.

      <P>It is a proposed amendment to the functions of a university to provide that each university should provide courses through the medium of the State's two official languages. I consider that such an amendment would directly affect the academic freedom of universities to decide their own courses.  It could be unintentionally implied from the amendment that the provision of courses through languages other than the two official languages would not be encouraged.  I am not in favour of any such hint in legislation.  There would certainly be cases where a French literature course could be taught through the medium of French.  The proposal and the reasoning behind it would interfere too directly with the ability of a university to decide its own courses.  The recognition of both official language is fundamental to the Bill.</P>

On Report Stage I hope the words &ldquo;and use&rdquo; can be inserted in the objects, after &ldquo;to promote the official languages of the State with special regard to the preservation and promotion&rdquo;.  That is still aspirational compared to what Senator O'Toole's amendment seeks.

      <P>In page 11, subsection (2)(b), line 34, after &ldquo;research&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and publication&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may appear a pedantic addition to &ldquo;shall promote and facilitate research&rdquo;.  However, it was the case for a long time that while we had very good and often undervalued teaching in Irish universities, and while worthwhile research was often conducted, there certainly was not the trend towards publication in our value system that prevailed in the university systems of Europe and <Col N="113" /> North America in general.  That had to do with a lot of things, including resources and massive teaching hours.  That has changed significantly in recent years.  Now there is a trend towards publication as an integral part of the expectations of university performance.  It might be suspected that if we were to follow the English model too closely &mdash; I hope we do not &mdash; where the allocation of resources is on the basis of five year reviews and which is often mechanically linked to quantity of publication in a department, almost independently of quality, we would put excessive emphasis on publication.  Scholars have a responsibility to publish as well as to do research.</P>
    <P>The growth of private funding means there is a temptation in certain areas to do consultancy research which is confined to the donor.  I am not criticising it, but it could mean that people in universities do a lot of research but publish little and be handsomely rewarded through donations because they are hired by a private company.  I am a strong supporter of private support for universities but balance is required.  Part of a university's function is to promote learning in society and to disseminate the outcomes of its research in the general community.  It would be a little ironic if emphasis was not placed on promoting the outcome of research in the scholarly community. Inserting &ldquo;publication&rdquo; is not simply a semantic qualification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with Senator Lee but he touched on the danger of over-emphasising the significance of publication.  The phrase, &ldquo;publish or perish&rdquo;, echoed nastily through university corridors some time ago.  There is also a hierarchy of publication.  Some extremely significant and important work is published in the form of journals which may not be recognised by the university.  There is a type of intellectual snobbery among certain elements in a university.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;publish or perish&rdquo; ethos in the United States, in particular, has led to the publication of an enormous amount of twaddle and bilge because people must publish in order to climb up the ladder.  I see this in the case of James Joyce, who has become one vast academic Rorschach blot on which every loony in the universe, academically speaking, projects his or her fantasies. As if James Joyce was not sufficiently original for them in developing an entirely new language out of the melted down fragments of 50 global languages, they must also be original at his expense.  I am chairman of the Friends of Libraries so I am not inimical to books, but there are times when I think a good fire would help to clear out this rubbish and give other people pen room in which to sharpen their nibs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to including research as long as it is balanced.  A young colleague of mine was put under pressure to publish.  He agonised and got a mental block about subplots in minor Elizabethan and Jacobean dramas.  The world had held its breath for 350 years, so it could have <Col N="114" /> afforded to wait a couple of months longer. However, he was put under considerable pressure and tragically took his life.  We need to be careful about putting pressure on people, although that is not Senator Lee's intention.</P>
    <P>It is important to publish items which are of vital interest to the academic community, but it would be a pity to encourage people to publish rubbish for the sake of getting one incremental point on their salary scale.  I am glad Senator Lee said he wanted to include it in a balanced way.</P>
    <P>I am glad section 12(a) states that the objects of a university shall include &ldquo;to advance knowledge through teaching...&rdquo;.  My continued experience in university is that teaching is the least regarded of all academic qualifications.  However, it is an extraordinary talent to be able to teach, communicate the joy in one's subject and set young people's minds alive so they search for themselves.  I remember being told in Trinity College 20 years ago that if I was not careful I would turn out like old X.  It was the greatest compliment I was paid in my life.</P>

I talk at meetings of Trinity College graduates throughout the world and he is the one person who is remembered with affection and joy and as someone who illuminated their lives and taught them something.</P>
      <P>I accept the introduction of research but I am pleased the Minister put teaching at the beginning of section 12.  If I was asked what I did when I was employed by the College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Queen Elizabeth I near Dublin, I said &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; because that is one of the most honourable professions.  I did not say &ldquo;senior lecturer once removed&rdquo; or &ldquo;almost a professor&rdquo;. I am glad the Minister chose to highlight the fact that teaching is one of the most honourable professions by putting it at the beginning of section 12.</P>

      <P>Section 12(h) which states, &ldquo;to disseminate the outcomes of its research in the general community&rdquo;, covers the need to share information.  It may not always be easy to deal with a statutory obligation to publish. I cannot comment on the need to start a fire.  If we include a statutory obligation to promote and facilitate research and publication, it might not be disseminated as the outcome of research in the general community.  I ask the Senator to reflect on the necessity to include &ldquo;and publication&rdquo; as a statutory obligation because that is covered under section 12(h).  I am loath to state that I oppose it because the term &ldquo;publish&rdquo; is covered under section 12 which would allow universities to decide.  A statutory obligation is placed on universities by this section, which refers to the outcome of research. I leave it to Senators to decide whether to push the matter to a vote but I do not recommend it.</P>

However, I feel justified in tabling the amendment if only to hear the full flush of Senator Norris's tribute to his old, unmentionable Master in Trinity College.  While this matter is covered under the general objects, there is quite an amount of overlap and repetition between those objects and the general functions. For example, section 13(2)(b) states that as part of their functions universities &ldquo;shall promote and facilitate research&rdquo; while section 12(a) states that the objects of a university shall be &ldquo;to advance knowledge through teaching, scholarly research and scientific investigation&rdquo;.  I take the Minister's point and I do not want to make a major issue of this matter.  Therefore, I will withdraw the amendment without pressing it further.</P>

      <P>It is proposed in an amendment to the functions of universities to provide that a university may collaborate with convocations and graduates.  It would be beneficial if universities were allowed to do so.  I believe Senator O'Toole's amendment does not propose that such collaboration be compulsory.  Such <Col N="116" /> action was recommended in the Lower House but I have no wish to be to prescriptive.  However, because I agree with the spirit of collaboration without a necessity to make it compulsory, the provision as it stands allows for flexibility.

      <P>Representatives of the University of Limerick expressed concerns to me about section 13(2)(c) which states that a university &ldquo;may establish by incorporation in the State or elsewhere, or participate in the establishment of, such trading, research or other corporations as it thinks fit for the purpose of promoting or assisting or in connection with the functions of, the university&rdquo;. The University of Limerick underwent an unfortunate experience when such a corporation was established and later encountered financial difficulties.  There was a suggestion or fear that moneys granted to the university proper would be diverted to the corporation it had established, which would represent a misuse of public funds.  There is no evidence to state that this occurred but fears were expressed that it might have done.  I ask the Minister to take cognisance <Col N="117" /> of this situation.  Are there adequate safeguards in the Bill to prevent such an occurrence in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>My objections to this section are similar to those I expressed on the previous section.  In both cases a kind of wish list for universities is being put forward.  We are being offered the current and fashionable idea of the functions and performance of a university being put into legislation.  I suggest that those who are making these laws are not qualified to do so.  I do not believe anyone should decide the functions of a university except those involved in the university itself.  I believe the provisions of the section are restrictive, even though that may not be the intention.  The Bill is patronising and it allows a university to do things it should obviously be permitted to do without the need for legislation.</P>
      <P>Section 13(2)(f) states that a university &ldquo;may collaborate with associations representing graduates of the university both inside and outside the State&rdquo;.  I do not know why the word &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; is used because it is pejorative.  However, what place has such a provision in legislation? Why should a Government give universities permission in legislation to communicate and collaborate with people outside the State?  That is an obvious right and there is no need for its inclusion in the Bill.  Likewise, there is no need for any of the provisions in section 13.</P>
      <P>There is a difference between the provisions in section 13.  There are those which use the term &ldquo;shall&rdquo; while others use the term &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The provisions using &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be removed.  What is the point in informing a university that it &ldquo;may&rdquo; take action?  If such provisions were removed from the Bill, universities could still take such action.  If paragraphs in this section which state that a university &ldquo;may&rdquo; do something were removed, universities may do those things in any event.  Why are the provisions included?  They are patronising.</P>
      <P>The more definitive objectives and functions in section 13 use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I would have thought that these objectives and functions are so obvious that they do not need to be included in legislation.  However, in line with the concerns I expressed on the previous section, such provisions give the Government and the Legislature a certain interpretation.  If none of these provisions was included, surely universities would provide courses of study and promote and facilitate research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the need for section 13, particularly as its provisions are not exclusive?  Fundamental to <Col N="118" /> my objections to the Bill is the fact that if sections 12 and 13 were removed there would be more, not less, academic freedom and more, not less, freedom for universities.  I cannot see the point of putting these sections in legislation or of telling the university that, for example, it may or may not co-operate with graduates overseas.  I find it objectionable, patronising and symbolic of the Bill, 90 per cent of which is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Universities should be allowed to decide independently their own functions.  They should be allowed to decide what they want to do and their objectives.  It is dangerous to say that a university may do one thing or another when it is obvious that it may do so.  I oppose the section because it is patronising, unnecessary and may be varied in years to come.  Notwithstanding what the Minister said, if a future Government decides that a university is not behaving in accordance with the section the Government will intervene and start invoking the legislation.  That is the nature of Government.  If the section was not felt necessary it would not be there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator suggests that the section should be removed.  I disagree because there are elements which allow a university to take certain actions.  Subsection 2(c) is important in allowing a university to undertake certain functions. Paragraphs (g) and (h) allow a university to acquire, accept or hold land or other property. There are essential elements in the section which should be included in the Bill.  It is not necessary to delete section 13 and the Senator should withdraw his objections because the section does not hurt or affect anybody in any particular way.  Its interpretation will not allow anybody to penalise universities.</P>

      <P>Senator Ross is totally opposed to section 13.  Having set out the objects of a university in section 12, section 13 goes on to provide the statutory basis for the powers necessary to implement the objects.  The section provides for specific powers and functions including, for example, the awarding of degrees because at present degrees are awarded under different legislation, the provision of courses, engaging in research, establishing companies and collaborating with others.  Senator Cotter indicated that the <Col N="119" /> word &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo; is derived from Latin and we should not be bullied out of using certain terms.</P>
      <P>This is an important section because it is necessary to give a statutory basis to the powers necessary to implement the objects of the university. Section 13(1) indicates that: The functions of a university are to do all things necessary or expedient in accordance with this Act and its charter, if any, to further the objects and development of the university.&rdquo;  The Senator and I will have to disagree.</P>

What is the point of having legislation which does not affect anyone in any particular way?  I thought legislation was meant to affect someone in a particular way.  One wonders why such meaningless stipulations are included.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not indicate why the provision in paragraph (f), allowing universities to collaborate with associations representing its graduates inside and outside the State, is included.  Senator Cotter is right &mdash; whether that provision is included does not matter.  If it was not included it is unlikely that a university would be prevented from co-operating with associations representing its graduates outside the State.  Why is the provision included?

      <P>We have debated the objects of universities and Senator Ross opposed that section.  We have debated section 13 and the Senator has expressed strong opinions on it. Existing legislation, affecting UL and DCU, will be superseded by the provisions of this Bill. Section 9 opens the way for the creation of more universities.  In doing so we lay down the objects and functions of the universities.  The Department and the Government have consulted on the Bill with people who are already involved in universities and received the support of different bodies. Senator Ross is articulating fears which have not been expressed by other sectors.  It is his right to do so but I have not come to the House to be quizzed on every word in the Bill because I said I did not agree with him.  When I say I do not agree with him the Senator demands an answer. When I make a proposal he does the same.  I am satisfied that the objects and functions in this legislation will enhance the university system, some of which is old and has a great tradition and some of which is new.  We will map out the future. I recommend the acceptance of this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), lines 40 and 41, to delete &ldquo;being not less than 20 or more than 38, as determined in accordance with this Chapter&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;as determined by the university itself&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the kernel of this section, the governing authority of a university. This section puts the university in a straitjacket.  I cannot understand why it is necessary to enact in legislation that the numbers on the board of a governing authority of a university should be between 20 and 38.  This is not a matter for legislation. Why should a Minister decide between 20 and 38 members?  Why not 100 or 200?  Should it not be related to the size of the university?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section will give the Minister and future Ministers the power to play politics with the board of a university which they have not had before.  I would have thought there would be variants for different universities &mdash; such as DCU, Trinity College, Dublin University, UCD, NUI &mdash; and different requirements as they change.  This section does not give them that opportunity.  It says the numbers must be between 20 and 38 and, being very specific, states this must consist of between two and six academics, a certain number of full-time permanent members of staff, employees and students &mdash; one postgraduate &mdash;<Col N="122" /> and a certain number of fellows in Dublin University. Why can the university not adapt itself and say it wants a board of ten, 50 or whatever number of members without the Minister specifying the sections from where they should come &mdash; employers, trade unions or staff?  There are many specific requirements which have nothing to do with the State.</P>
    <P>I object not only to the specification that there should be county councillors but to the specification that there should be businessmen and trade unionists on the board because these people have different agendas.  They do not have an academic agenda.  Businessmen will be on the boards of universities because they want honorary degrees.  There are county councillors on the boards of universities because they represent political parties.  Others are on boards for different reasons, but you can be certain of one thing: they will not have academic standards or the so-called performances and functions of a university at heart.  They will be there for different reasons and fulfilling different agendas.</P>
    <P>There are representatives of agriculture, fisheries, community organisations, the professions, business and industry on governing authorities.  It is no good saying &ldquo;as the governing authority sees fit&rdquo;.  The authority is provided for in legislation but it should not be forced to have any of these people on the board if it does not want them.  It does not need to be set out in legislation.  If the governing authority wants outsiders on the board that is reasonable but it should not be done by a Minister.  This section is wrong and ought to be deleted.  The governing authority should be a matter for the university itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on this issue as someone who has been a member of the governing body of University College Dublin for the past 21 years. I was elected in six successive elections by the graduates of the university.  I owe my position entirely to the graduates, some of them former students.  Unlike Senator Ross, I have direct experience of being a member of a governing body of a university, as well as Senator Fitzgerald who is an extremely valued member of the governing body of UCD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a number of points arising from Senator Ross's contribution, apart from the general offensive elements.  To make a blanket condemnation of businessmen and say they only serve on governing bodies because they want honorary degrees is offensive and insulting nonsense. Business people who give of their time to serve on governing bodies generally do so out of a strong commitment to the university and because they wish to see it play a part in the wider community.  Frequently, business people will go to great lengths to help universities raise money for much needed projects.  I have no experience of people serving on governing bodies out of a desire to obtain honorary doctorates.  There is very little honour or glory to be had from serving on the governing body of a university; most of the <Col N="123" /> business is routine, as it is in this House, although there are occasional discussions on matters of great principle.  The idea that business people want to be on governing bodies for any unworthy cause is simply untrue.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross has already made his views known on the position of local and county councillors and people from the political world serving on governing bodies.  I speak from 21 years experience of such people and Senator Tom Fitzgerald is one of the finest members I have known in my time on the governing body of University College Dublin.  Local councillors tend to take their place at the bottom table out of choice. Their contributions are concise and they have much common sense and wisdom.  The ability to get to the heart of a matter is often lacking in some of the more academic members of governing bodies.  Local and county councillors have a valuable point of view and perspective.  Universities do not belong to academics; they belong to the people of Ireland who support them through their taxation and who have a right to expect certain things from them.  It is the presence of people whose feet are firmly in local communities and who know the real problems which makes this possible.</P>
    <P>Shortly after being elected to the Seanad I recall Senator Lee saying that when he first entered it he wondered about the calibre of people he would find here.  He found that the contributions of ordinary Senators covered a wide range of topics.  They were obliged to master a range of topics and have cognisance of a variety of disciplines with which academics would not be familiar because of their narrow training.  Excluding people on the grounds that a university should be run by a narrow group of academics has no merit.</P>
    <P>I recall being present at the L &amp; H in the old physics theatre in UCD in the 1960s.  The speakers included Seán Lemass, James Dillon and Garret Fitzgerald &mdash; whom James Dillon dismissed as a statistician because he did not really approve of people who were too interested in figures and sums.  I recall Seán Lemass being challenged by a student regarding the low calibre of Oireachtas members.  Mr. Lemass replied that he would dread the day when the Oireachtas would be made up entirely of graduates.  We could go a step further and say that the day when the governing body of a university would be made up entirely of academics or people with a vested interest would be a bad day.  Senator Ross said that the Government has no business specifying the numbers on the governing body.  It has every business doing that; the colleges of the National University of Ireland operate under a 1908 statute which lays down very specific details as to who shall or shall not be a member of the governing body.  The State issued such details because it felt that would provide the universities with the best possible governing bodies and by and large it has.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> The Minister's proposals in this section follow wide consultation with all the universities and have gained their approval.  The Provost of Trinity College &mdash; Senator Ross's own college &mdash; unambiguously and unequivocally accepted the Minister's proposals which are no different from what obtained in the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross maintains that the universities should be able to decide on the composition of the governing bodies.  This section provides protection against a situation where a cabal might take control in a university and where the president might decide he or she wanted a governing body comprising five people.  There might be a bout of midsummer madness and we could have a repeat of the 1969 situation where a university might be taken over by extreme leftists who might want a governing body of which everybody in the college would be entitled to become a member.  Such a governing body would have to be in continuous session and no decisions would ever be made.  The Minister is providing protection in this section by saying that a university shall not reduce the size of a governing body to the point where it would be controlled by a small cabal or increase it to the point where it would become a Croke Park, filled to the brim and in permanent session.</P>

      <P>I am a county councillor.  I work with other county councillors and look to them for advice.  Sometimes I get bogged down in my thinking and very often my council colleagues help me to arrive at the core of an argument.  I strongly object to Senator Ross saying that county councillors are all hacks who have a hidden agenda, who do not have a vision of Ireland and therefore cannot make a worthwhile contribution on the governing bodies of universities.</P>
      <P>Councillors play a huge role in reflecting local issues and problems as they have their fingers on the pulses of their localities.  It is a pleasure to attend the meetings of the general council of county councils as such expansive contributions are made there.  The core of every problem can be presented simply and I often come away after an hour's discussion with more knowledge than I would have after three or four hours, or indeed weeks, in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am an academic and am well able to mix the roles of academic and councillor.  Many of my academic friends applaud county councillors for becoming involved in governing bodies.  They want balanced representation, not one way traffic where the emphasis is on academic orientation.  I would be very angry if I thought we were going <Col N="125" /> down that road.  My academic colleagues often praise the contributions of Senator Fitzgerald and other councillors who serve on governing bodies and welcome their presence.</P>
    <P>I will table an amendment later which will seek to increase the membership of the governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In the light of amendments which will be discussed shortly we may also have to increase the membership of the governing bodies of universities.  We need a proper balance and fair representation on governing bodies in order to ensure that the views of all citizens are reflected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The academic staff in some universities look to the governing body to act as a counterbalance to what would otherwise be a severe managerial and executive style leadership.  A letter sent to many Senators by some of the academic staff of the University of Limerick states: &ldquo;In so far as the operation of the university has been concerned, the only effective protection against greater abuses has been the existence of a governing body independent of management&rdquo;. It also says that &ldquo;successive governing bodies in the University of Limerick have conducted their affairs with diligence and have provided a measure of balance to an unrestrained entrepreneurial ethos&rdquo;.  It is clear, therefore, that there is support for governing bodies within the universities.</P>

I am opposed to certain parts of the Bill but, unlike Senator Ross, I will not be disruptive.  I want the Bill to progress.  This is a good Bill and there is nothing wrong with the sections with which we are dealing.</P>
      <P>I was on a sub-committee of the governing body of UCD examining this Bill and I am happy that, while maintaining the confidentiality of the sub-committee, it was satisfied with the Bill. There are certain parts of it which need to be examined and there are some amendments which need attention but I wish we could progress the Bill a little faster without the needless interruptions of Senator Ross.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support section 15.  It is important that the composition of the board is defined in broad outline.  There is plenty of latitude to facilitate incorporation of the ethos of individual universities. It is important that the views and ideas of academia are leavened by views from outside. In questioning the motives of business people and councillors, we must also question the motive behind Senator Ross's approach.  He is currying favour with somebody or some group.  This is not a sufficient motive for this approach.  Most of us have some hidden agenda from time to time but <Col N="126" /> to accuse others of being on boards for spurious, dangerous motives is neither accurate nor acceptable.</P>
      <P>I support the section.  Ordinary people need to participate on boards of this nature to instil reality as sometimes people live on cloud nine. On many occasions over the past couple of years I have raised the effect of the points system on post-primary education.  Its focus is more narrow because of the influence of universities.  We need people on university boards who will talk sense and speak out on this issue.  Children begin their schooling at four years from which time parents tune in to the need for points to get places in third level.  The universities are dominating post-primary education and, to some extent, primary education.</P>
      <P>There are limitations on places available in universities and a method of filling those places has be decided upon.  However, little energy is put into deciding how best to do this.  The view is that the system in place is handy, easy to operate and therefore sufficient.  The universities are crucifying the nation in the interests of their own ease.</P>
      <P>The definition of education and the reality of post-primary education are totally different.  We hear derogatory remarks about members of council councils from time to time.  There are all kinds of people on county councils as in every walk of life.  County councillors understand what goes on at the fundamental levels of society.  They are people with different levels of linguistic ability representing the people to the best of their ability.  Most of them are re-elected and we should not be derogatory about them.  They have something to offer.  At worst, they represent the views of many people.</P>
      <P>It is well known that leaving certificate students with a particular gift who do not have broad ability across a spectrum of subjects are barred from entering professions where they would be brilliant.  They are barred because the universities have a particular way of accepting people into their ranks.  We need people on the boards to discuss such issues and to bring sense to bear.  I have raised this issue at every possible forum including the National, Economic and Social Forum of which I am a member and in the presence of university representatives.  They shun discussion on this matter.  They see it as a nuisance and they do not want to address it.  However, it is time they did address it and the composition of the boards will force them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody has supported me in suggesting that universities introduce a vocational aptitude test to provide opportunities for people with wonderful gifts but lacking the ability to perform well in a leaving certificate examination.  The universities have made no attempt to include these people. Parents, teachers and students say that the points system is a crucifixion.  If we had enough places for every student there would be no problem, but we do not.  We cannot afford it.  The universities are doing nothing to examine the effect their <Col N="127" /> points system is having on post-primary education. This issue should be researched.  Straight talking and good sense is called for.  The boards need to be broadened.  All possible views within society need to be represented on the board.</P>
    <P>I support section 15, with amendment, because county councillors who represent and understand ordinary people, should be accommodated on the boards.  I look forward to working with the Minister in achieving this.</P>

      <P>I have taken on board the concerns expressed regarding county councillors.  The limit has been raised from 34 to 38 but we will return to this issue.</P>
      <P>One of the core reasons for introducing this legislation is to amend NUI legislation, which the senate of that body invited me to do, and also to ensure that governing bodies reflect the wider community.  The number of people on the NUI, University of Limerick and Dublin City University governing bodies was set by earlier legislation. The sovereign of the time decided the membership of the board of Trinity College, Dublin, under the charter of May 1637.  Given that this is 1997, we owe it to ourselves to move forward and to introduce legislation which reflects the needs of those who benefit from a university education and to secure their position in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was elected for an area, like Senator Fitzgerald.  However, that does not give me any right to do anything else.  If I was promoted to another position, I would have a political agenda.  I would represent a political view on a county council.  My point, which has been so misrepresented by those who are elected by county councillors, is that politicians should not be on university boards.</P>
      <P>If one examines the Bill specifically and the case of University College, Cork, it is clear that the Lords Mayor of Cork and Waterford will automatically become members of the board by virtue of their office and not because they were elected by the people.  The same is true of University College, Dublin, and the University of Limerick where the Lords Mayor of Dublin and Limerick, respectively, will become board members of the two universities.</P>
      <P>People should not take my comments personally. It is incredible that Members have such thin skins on this matter.  That is not normally the case, except when they have a chance to defend their electorates.  This serious political point extends far beyond university education and university boards.  Everybody knows that is the case but they are taking the opportunity to defend county councillors because an election is coming up.</P>
      <P>Politicians belong in the Houses of the Oireachtas and local councillors belong on local councils because that is what they were elected to do.  To pretend that they have qualifications to sit on the boards of semi-State companies or elsewhere is nothing more than hypocrisy.  It is not a coincidence.  Why are Senators not allowed to sit on the boards of semi-State bodies?  It is correct that they should not be members of those boards but, apparently, county councillors, for reasons which are difficult to understand, should be allowed to be board members.  I do not understand the inconsistency in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald misrepresented me and his suggestion that I implied county councillors are not equal to other members of the boards is wrong.  I did not say that.  I said they were inappropriate because they do not have the necessary qualifications and they have a political agenda.  It is wrong to say they are not equal because they <Col N="129" /> are equal, indeed superior, in many ways.  They have a great deal of expertise in certain areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was my interpretation of the Senator's comments.  He said local issues cannot involve matters relating to a university. However, a local issue could involve a student trying to find a way to go to university other than through the points system.  Such people may have nobody to turn to except their local representative. If the representative knows a member of the governing body, he or she could bring that problem to their attention and it can be aired at a meeting of the body.  There is nothing wrong with that; a core principle of democracy is that local issues can be aired at any level.  It is a disgrace to suggest that local county councils are incapable of carrying that information through the process to the attention of governing bodies.  Senator Ross suggested that local councillors are not qualified to serve on governing bodies.  What are the necessary qualifications?  Must one be an academic or have a string of letters after one's name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I reject that view because I bow to county councillors.  They are superior to me in many ways in terms of making contributions. On the basis of my work with county councillors and my many dealings with my local county council, I bow to their knowledge.  They are much smarter than I am in terms of getting to the core of matters.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to add to Senator Ross's bad temper.  Apparently, it is fine for him to attack the motives of business people, county <Col N="130" /> councillors, etc., but as soon as people disagree with him, their motives are immediately suspect. Perhaps we have seen the true face of Senator Ross recently when he displayed his temper just because people disagreed with him.</P>
      <P>The Senator talked about people with hidden agendas but one does not need the Freedom of Information Act to know that 43 Senators are elected by members of county councils.  That is a matter of public record and nobody is hiding that fact.  His suggestion about hidden agendas is disingenuous.</P>
      <P>I wish to make another point about members of local authorities who are members of governing bodies on the basis of my experience over the last 21 years.  In all that time, I have never known a partisan political issue to divide a governing body or members of a governing body to vote along the lines of the parties they represent elsewhere.  They vote on the issues as they view them and they frequently split on them.  The idea that they carry the flags of their political parties is not true.  Senator Ross may say &ldquo;he would say that, wouldn't he?&rdquo;, because I have a vested interest, but I say it on the basis of my experience which can be validated by many other independent witnesses.</P>
      <P>This is a spurious argument.  The Minister's proposals have been widely debated and are the result of widespread consultation.  No one can be fully pleased but all the universities, including the University of Dublin, are happy with the proposals as they affect those institutions.  Today I received a letter from the Provost of Trinity College, stating how pleased the board and he were with the proposals.  They have no problems. Senator Fitzgerald said he spent months on a sub-committee of the UCD governing body &mdash; I do not know what happened on that sub-committee but there was wide consultation and ultimately the governing body said it was happy.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross has spoken a great deal about the imposition by this socialist Minister of a statist system of university governance.  The stake-holders, those most affected, have been widely consulted and are happy with what is being proposed. Who are we to tell them they are wrong? They have been consulted, they are happy and we should move on.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the exchanges with great interest.  Like Senator Manning I have served on a governing body although not for quite as long and not with an unbroken sequence, and it was not as a result of an election defeat that the sequence was broken.  I therefore know what happens on governing bodies and how to get there.  I do not recollect seeing a county councillor act in a party political way on the governing body of UCC.  Some of the frankest, most honest and most direct commentary I have heard on issues which were being clouded with a great deal of circumlocution, academic and otherwise, has come from political representatives of one party or other, perhaps from TDs who were also county <Col N="131" /> councillors.  This is not to say that a county councillor or anyone else does not have his motives.</P>
      <P>The main problem faced by outsiders on the governing bodies of universities &mdash; it probably applies to outsiders on the directorial board of any institution &mdash; is finding the time to keep abreast of the intestinal intricacies of the internal politics. All the academics &mdash; unless they are saints, in which case they would not even think of joining the governing body &mdash; are running their won agendas.  These may be worthy and wonderful but they are agendas nonetheless.  This may not be the most rousing support which county councillors or others have ever received, but we are all equally children of original sin or whatever today's theological equivalent may be and I am quite happy to work on that basis with all comers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (2), lines 5 to 9, to delete paragraph (c) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) The senior officer of the university having responsibility to the chief officer for academic affairs,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section has caused me a good deal of concern. I do not resist its basic thrust but I wonder what may happen in real life.  Section 15(2)(c) currently provides:</P>
      <P>The members of the governing authority shall include&mdash;</P>
      <P>...</P>
      <P>(c) at least one but not more that two senior officers of the university having responsibility to the chief officer for academic, financial or administrative affairs, appointed by the governing authority [.]</P>
      <P>A balance should be struck here between managerial efficiency on one level and university autonomy on another.  When it is decided to include this paragraph, one must ask what is the most effective way of ensuring the discharge of university business and how far that impacts on the relationship between the chief officer, who is <i>ex officio</i> a member of the governing body, and the senior officers on the academic and broadly non-academic sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In ensuring that at least one but not more than two senior officers on the academic and the financial or administrative side are appointed, we must ask, to the extent we think it important to specify this, whether we should do so rather more precisely in terms of good managerial practice in the circumstances.  Alternatively, should we allow it to become the potential plaything of internal politics, <Col N="132" /> because that could happen?  The moment a choice must be made and different personalities are involved, the danger arises that it can be politicised in terms of the internal affairs of the institution. Most of the time it probably will not be and one would hope it would never be but if it does happen it can have unfortunate consequences for the effective discharge of university business.</P>
    <P>We have spent much time discussing the objects and functions of a university.  When all is said and done, the core object of a university is academic, whatever we think of academics.  There is a range of other necessary, worthy, desirable objects but if the academic side is not working effectively these will not be discharged effectively. The effective functioning of the academic side is a prerequisite for the achievement of the other desirable objectives.</P>
    <P>The senior academic officer is responsible to the chief officer.  The latter may not be an academic officer &mdash; historically they have been but we are trying to broaden the range of selection of chief officers both from within the institutions and to decision makers in general, who may well have much to contribute to the office. On balance, it is desirable to specify that the senior officer having responsibility for academic affairs ought to be <i>ex officio</i> a member of the governing authority and ought not have to depend on the pleasure or the electoral consequences of governing body decisions.  I gladly accept it can be argued in a variety of directions. For what it is worth, my own conclusion &mdash; having seen a great deal of this in operation in a variety of circumstances &mdash; is that it is in the interests of the institution that the senior academic officer is a member.  There will be a variety of other expertise on the financial or administrative side so I have a more open mind on that point but, on balance, my view is that the senior financial officer should also be there.  The senior academic officer has a unique role which cannot be effectively discharged by anyone else in these circumstances.  I will not rage on interminably because I am interested in the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I see Senator Lee's point.  If there are to be not more than two senior officers on the body, one should be responsible for academic affairs and the other responsible perhaps for financial or administrative affairs.  It may be splitting hairs but it would be better to spell out the role of the senior officer and which one it would be.  There may be confusion on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments because they make a lot of sense.  People with financial responsibility should, as part of that responsibility, be directly accountable to the governing body of any institution.  It is unreal that people in charge of finances are not so accountable, although they may not be the final accounting officers.  There is a strong argument in support of that point and it is in everyone's interest.  It <Col N="133" /> would lead to a better flow of information, cleaner and easier access and transparent accountability. There would be no filtering of facts, figures or interpretations between the person dealing with the money and those who make the decisions.</P>
      <P>There tends to be difficulties with lack of information in organisations where people of such senior rank do not have access to the board or executive.  The culture or philosophy of the person in the job is not communicated to the board, which can be very important in terms of that person having its confidence.  The board does not learn the way in which the finance officer works and whether he or she is cautious or thrifty from documentation but from hearing the person's response and interpretation.</P>
      <P>This is very good protection which would be in everybody's interest.  It would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of universities.  I fully support this amendment.  I do not see how it changes matters; in fact, it is very much in line with the philosophy of what the Minister said about the section.  I do not see any difficulty with this amendment as it causes no offence to the general approach of the section.  It seems a very sensible way of doing business.</P>

It is essential to have some of the management responsible for running any organisation on the board of that organisation. Senator Lee has given a very clear and understandable explanation of why he tabled these amendments which move, in an almost undemocratic way, from electing someone to the board to appointing them.  The idea is that there will be someone on the board representing both the academic and financial or administrative sides.  It is possible that both may be appointed but it is not guaranteed.  I support Senator Lee's amendment because, although it sounds undemocratic not to have an election, the amendment is good management practice.</P>

The object of accepting the amendment would be to ensure that both the academic and financial or administrative side are represented on the board.  I do not want to be too prescriptive &mdash; we are going from one extreme to the other in this debate.  I had hoped we would allow the universities to decide which officers should be on the board.  However, it has been signalled to me that the wish of this House is that I would look at the amendment and return on Report Stage with the wording &ldquo;financial and/or administrative&rdquo;.  I ask Senators to accept I will <Col N="134" /> return on Report Stage with an amendment which meets their wishes in this regard.</P>

I wanted to make the point that, while I understand what is being said, I believe there would be some difficulties with what Senator Lee has proposed, in view of the express wish of the governing body of UCD. If the Minister accepts the principle of what Senator Lee is saying, I would like her to consult the authorities in the universities on whether they have reservations about this proposal for practical reasons and return on Report Stage.  I would like to have a fuller viewpoint at that stage.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister.  I also thank Senators O'Toole and Quinn for expressing, far better than I could have, the reasons for this amendment from the point of view of good managerial practice.  I know from where Senator Manning is coming and the issues which arise in particular institutions.  However, this is a potentially serious management issue for every institution over the long term.  The provisions made in a particular institution should not be allowed determine the overall conclusion.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a very valid point, which is the kernel of one of our problems.  One can lurch from being too prescriptive to being too open. We are trying to lay down a structure which is in accordance with best management understanding at this stage, reconciling it with the other <i>desiderata</i> of what we feel to be the essence of a university.</P>
      <P>One of my criterion of best management practice at the very top level is that it should reduce the scope for internal institutional politics and render decision making &mdash; as far as possible, which may not be very far but, at least, one can try &mdash; independent of personalities in particular posts and of personal relationships.  We know that is not fully possible in any circumstances. However, we must try to devise structures which minimise the potential for expending the energy of able people on futile negativity.  The moment a potential election emerges to affect the choice of very senior people with grave responsibility for the institution, we diminish &mdash; if not undermine &mdash; the potential effectiveness of the discharge of the rest of the responsibilities of that institution.</P>
      <P>This is a grave issue.  I understand Senator Manning's concerns, which he is obliged to raise. However, I would not want the short term problems of the administrative structure of one institution to determine our overall decision on this issue.  I will withdraw the amendment in light of the Minister's commitment to return on Report Stage, although she will have a great deal to return to on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (2) (d) (i), line 12, after &ldquo;are&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;full-time, permanent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have some questions about these amendments but I wanted to raise the issues concerned.  There is no qualification of the term &ldquo;professor&rdquo; as there is with the term &ldquo;lecturer&rdquo; and other academic staff in this regard.  There is also no definition of the term &ldquo;professor&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;professor&rdquo; is increasingly applied to a variety of people.  In some cases it is an inherited category and some part-time professors of medicine and law render extraordinarily fine service to their institutions.  I do not intend to exclude such people from consideration in this amendment.  However, there are now visiting and adjunct professors.  The little is increasingly used for people appointed in ways which do not bear a direct relationship to the way the term &ldquo;professor&rdquo; was conferred on most existing university professors.  The term is now used much more loosely than the term &ldquo;lecturer&rdquo;, which still remains, by and large, within the confines of its original definition.  For a variety of reasons, the term &ldquo;professor&rdquo; has acquired a wider range of reference.  I doubt if the Minister intended that the selection to the governing body would be made from those termed &ldquo;professors&rdquo; in an institution, however the term is defined, or even that, as electors, they would depend on their relationship to the institution.</P>
      <P>While the amendment is capable of improvement, there is an objective issue involved which will grow over time.  Who is to say what the designation will entail in ten or 20 years?  The amendment seeks to pin down the implications of a category whose overall role on the governing body is to be reduced.</P>
      <P>The matter is now in further doubt because we are apparently unable to define what is meant by &ldquo;professor&rdquo; in this context.  That is the source of my concern.  I have been told that use of the phrase &ldquo;appointed by academic merit&rdquo; is highly restrictive because it does not reflect the way in which universities may develop in the future. There is such a penumbra of uncertainty attaching to where we are going that it has become a serious issue, which my amendments seek to address however inadequately.</P>

      <P>In its correspondence with me, the academic staff of the University of Limerick state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the University of Limerick is concerned the proposal to allow for between two and six professors, elected by professors themselves, is extremely worrying.  Many of the professors have been appointed, not because of their academic reputations, but because they held or were about to be appointed to management positions.  There are no full professors <Col N="136" /> who are women and given the small number of professors in the University the provision could allow a situation where a small managerial group would have disproportionate influence on the working of a governing body.  This would result in a breach of the fundamental principle of democracy.  The situation in the University of Limerick is also different from other universities as the professors do not represent academic departments as in traditional universities.  As they are an unrepresentative group the legislation should provide that any reserved seats should be in proportion to their numbers on the academic staff and they should be elected by the broad academic community and not just a small and select group of professors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am conscious that there are concerns, especially from some of the more established professors, about the way in which new chairs are created and the disparity between faculties where, for example, chairs arise more easily in the business and marketing areas than in the more traditional disciplines, etc.  However, the amendments are perhaps unduly restrictive in that they would deprive a university from determining for itself a direction it may wish to take, which I may not approve and which Senator Lee would not approve.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 35 refers to &ldquo;...`procedures of appointment to full-time permanent professorships on the basis of academic merit' &rdquo;.  Senator Lee is a member of the senate of the NUI and the governing body of UCC.  What will happen when a board of assessors decides that, on academic merit, candidate A is the person most suitably qualified academically for a position while the faculty, academic council, governing body and the senate of the NUI decide otherwise? Who is the best candidate in terms of academic merit?  I am sure that somebody who has been approved by the assessors but overturned further along the line, perhaps and most specifically at the last hurdle, may find that he or she has a legal case to take on the basis of that specific description.  If the Senator presses the amendment, which includes the words &ldquo;appointed by the normal procedures&rdquo; then academic merit would almost be assumed to be part of them.</P>

      <P>I understand why universities would have a different profile in terms of professorships. This may make it more difficult to provide for permanent professors, especially in view of the wide spread of universities to be included under the legislation.  Amendment No. <Col N="137" /> 25 states: &ldquo;...'appointed by the normal procedures of appointment to full-time permanent professorships on the basis of academic merit' &rdquo;. What is meant by &ldquo;academic merit&rdquo;?  There could be variations of merit in so far as a candidate may have the necessary academic qualifications yet may not merit appointment to a given position.</P>

      <P>I have supported Senator Lee on almost every point he has made in this debate. However, I urge caution here.  Reference was made on Second Stage to the future of universities and university life.  While this legislation may not last as long as the previous underpinning legislation, which was enacted in the early part of this century, we cannot foresee how universities will operate in the future.  We should grant them as much freedom as possible to decide for themselves. The section deals with those who will be elected and we should not, therefore, be too restrictive.</P>
      <P>My vision for the universities entails them using their assets to a much greater extent.  At present their opening hours are restricted, for example, they close for a number of months every summer.  In the future it is likely they will use their assets in different ways.  While this does not mean that people will have to work longer hours, the universities will work all year and will not necessarily take breaks during the summer and at other traditional times.  Given this, there may be a need for a different kind of employment and we should not restrict them.  It would be better to leave them to elect those whom they see fit, without the imposition of conditions.</P>

It was represented to me by the universities that there are a number of professors and associate professors similar to those who work neither part-time nor full-time in medicine but are often university professors.  A part-time professor in law was elected by the academic council to the governing body of University College Cork in the 1970s.  To stipulate that professors must be full-time and permanent cuts across the rights of an electorate.  They can be full-time about their business, and permanent, but not within the universities sector.</P>

      <P>The issue I raised has not been adequately answered.  I readily accept phraseology can be changed and improved.  The original intent was to try to ensure the more recent type of person who has professor in their title did not become central to this.  There are four categories &mdash; academic, non-academic, student and postgraduate. If professors potentially become increasingly non-academic, then the balance begins to shift.  We do not have a definition of &ldquo;professor&rdquo;.  I am sympathetic with Senator Quinn's view that one should keep futures open as far as possible.  I do not want to tie things down but we have a list of objects for a university, one of which is to have an academic core.  The present type of professoriate is meant to be &mdash; however well they perform in it &mdash; the guardian of those values and of the most effective discharge of them.  I have no interest in being on governing bodies unless I have to.  If they are not best discharged to perform, there is something wrong about the way decision making has proceeded.</P>

      <P>The Centre for Independent Living mounted a protest outside and tried to enter this Chamber but were unable to do so because it is not wheelchair accessible.  Section 11 states that the Minister may, with agreement of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, make regulations.  That is too loose.  It also states that it may at some time happen.  &ldquo;Shall&rdquo; puts an emphasis and requirement on the Minister to do so while &ldquo;may&rdquo; leaves it at the discretion of the Minister of the day.  The current Minister, Deputy Taylor, announced that he is retiring.  Therefore, I wish to put the onus on whoever replaces him to do that.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment to ensure the next Minister requires transport authorities to replace their fleets with wheelchair accessible vehicles.</P>

      <P>Sections 19 and 20 enable the Minister, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, to make regulations. Replacing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would make it compulsory and change the intention of the proposal.  It would make it virtually impossible to operate.

      <P>I agree &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means it is compulsory, which is the intention of my amendment. I do not accept that enabling the Minister to do so is strong enough.  Those who have lobbied and tried hard to ensure public transport fleets are replaced with vehicles that are acceptable to the disabled have listened for years to promises that they would be replaced.  I want this to be compulsory, not discretionary.  I am not looking for the entire public transport fleet to be replaced immediately.  As a once-off measure, when the public transport fleet needs to be changed, the Minister must ensure that the new vehicles are accessible to the disabled.</P>

      <P>The powers being given to the Minister make it possible for him or her to make it compulsory for vehicles and railway stations to be accessible to disabled people.  The effect of the amendment proposed would be that the Minister would immediately have to declare this a reality. It would be nonsense to suggest that this would be a reality if &ldquo;may&rdquo; was replaced by &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is now being given the power to make it compulsory, in agreement with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, to ensure that both vehicles and stations are user-friendly for disabled persons.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to amendment No. 12, which I am prepared to discuss. I do not accept the Minister's statement that this would be nonsense.  The section states: &ldquo;... <Col N="140" /> The Minister may, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, make regulations...&rdquo; and the amendment proposes to change that to: &ldquo;...The Minister shall...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That does not suggest this has become a reality but it compels the Minister to do what he should be doing.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is much weaker, as I learnt in my first day on the Government side when Senator Neville tried to introduce the same wording into legislation he believed was weak.</P>

It is nonsense to talk of equal status if disabled people do not have access to public transport or train stations.  I do not know if the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is directing this legislation, but I am very disappointed that the Minister of State does not see the necessity for or merit in this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to disagree with Senator McGennis.  However, I cannot support this because it would put every bus operator in the country out of business.  That will happen if regulations are introduced which &ldquo;shall&rdquo; require bus operators to make their vehicles readily accessible.  It cannot be introduced in this way as businesses would go to the wall.</P>
      <P>The section states that: &ldquo;...The Minister may, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, make regulations requiring...vehicles...be equipped so as to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.&rdquo;  I would support an amendment suggesting that, after a certain date, all new buses would have to have this facility.  I know three or four operators in my area running family businesses with a couple of buses and providing a good social service.  Their buses are insured and they pay their taxes, but it would be very costly to update those old buses.  It might be impossible to do so in some cases as a special design would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am uncomfortable opposing Senator McGennis on this matter but this would be inoperable. <Col N="141" />&ldquo;May&rdquo; should be left in the section so that a Minister can make a start on a process that will take some time to implement fully.  However, the Senator is right to raise the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at risk of being supported by Senator O'Toole, so I will put his mind at rest. The section specifies &ldquo;...road or rail passenger vehicles that are likely to be put into use for the first time...&rdquo; so there is no question of requiring current operators to upgrade fleets that are 30 or 40 years ago.  Some buses might be worth less than what it would cost to adapt them and I acknowledge Senator O'Toole's point that adaptation would not be viable in those cases.  Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of a vehicle that is designed for private use or for use as a taxi, limousine or hackney.&rdquo; The legislation is framed to accommodate the difficulties suggested by Senator O'Toole.  The intent in the section is good but there is not, nor has there ever been, compulsion with regards to public service vehicles.</P>
      <P>We have been renewing our public service transport fleet with EU money and Members were lobbied strongly on the upgrading of vehicles.  There is a vehicle to take disabled people around the city but people cannot get into the city from Blanchardstown or Ballymun to use that adapted vehicle.  Members have said that this must be done and the Minister agreed, but he has now watered this section down.</P>
      <P>If Senator O'Toole wishes to support my amendment, that should put his mind at rest.  I do not suggest that, overnight, any number of public service vehicles should or could be adapted and the legislation is conscious of that, as it refers to vehicles being used &ldquo;...for the first time.&rdquo;  If someone is changing a vehicle, they should be compelled to ensure that it is accessible for disabled people.</P>
      <P>Recently a woman complained bitterly to me that her husband, who wanted a taxi licence, was told his car would have to be adapted for wheelchair use.  She felt it was reasonable to say the provision was nonsense as disabled people could drive Mini Micras.  This is the mindset with which we are dealing.  We must realise the difficulties that disabled people face daily.  I saw a video made by disabled people made about a DART journey.  It showed a person crawling up the steps to a DART station and dragging a wheelchair behind him.  That is not good enough.  If this legislation means what it says, it should state that it &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be done and not that it &ldquo;may&rdquo; be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should be aware that, until now, Ministers had no power to order transport operators or owners of railway stations to make any changes.  These sections give the Minister the power to enforce what both the Senator and the Minister seek to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to vehicles in operation for the first time.  That specifically does not refer to new vehicles because most of the private bus <Col N="142" /> operators import second hand vehicles.  If &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was inserted, they would have to import special vehicles which would probably not be available to them, and this would put them at serious risk. The Senator should rely on the good sense and prudence of Ministers, with their new power, to work on this issue after the section comes into force.</P>
    <P>The Senator should read the section which would have &ldquo;shall&rdquo; followed immediately by &ldquo;with the agreement of&rdquo; another Minister.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform could say &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but he would still have to get the agreement of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and there could be a contradiction in both sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to remove the need for agreement and resubmit the amendment on Report Stage.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, will not be aware that this exact wording was provided for in the Employment Equality Bill, 1996.  When I attempted to remove the need for agreement the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, explained why that provision was necessary.  If the Minister of State wants me to remove the need for the agreement of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, I am quite willing to do so.</P>
      <P>This section is too soft and it sells out the disabled. We are talking about the public transport system and I do not accept what the Minister said about the requirement of those who are operating private transport systems.  If they are bringing in secondhand buses, they are not caught by this because there is the first-time loophole through which they can escape.  There is an obligation on the public transport system to allow people with disabilities to use it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the idea that this section is soft or a sell out of disabled people.  This is a very strong section giving new powers to Ministers to insist that disabled persons' transport needs will be met.  That was never done by any previous Administration.  It is unfair to say it is soft and a sell out is unfair.</P>
      <P>The Senator's amendment would make this section unworkable and whoever is Minister in the near future would not make the necessary commencement order which is required to bring these sections into effect, because he would not be in a position to do so.  Therefore, the effect of her amendment would be that there would be no section on this matter.  I strongly advise the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 12, to delete from and including &ldquo;or it refuses&rdquo; in line 33 down to and including &ldquo;of the school&rdquo; in line 37.</P>
      <P>The Bill, apart from this section, is positive and progressive and I regret that most of my contribution has been negative.  However, I feel strongly about this issue and I believe the Government is making a serious error.  I appeal to the Minister to listen carefully to the arguments and to be flexible in his approach.</P>
      <P>This issue is related to the Employment Equality Bill.  Last week the Minister said it was not his intention to set a commencement date for this Bill until the Supreme Court made a decision on the Employment Equality Bill.  What did the Minister mean when he said he would revisit both Bills if this Bill is passed and the Employment Equality Bill is found to be unconstitutional?  This issue was left unresolved the last day.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about section 8 which states that an &ldquo;educational establishment does not discriminate...where... it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination...provided that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school&rdquo;.  Any attempt to prevent a child having access to a primary school recognised by the State is wrong, offensive and unconstitutional.  Even if it was not unconstitutional, public representatives would not support anything which prevented a child enrolling in a school.  We are talking about a four year child being told by the school authorities that he will not be allowed into the school because he is of the wrong religion.  Last week we celebrated the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the State. One wonders what type of State we set up if we present four year old children as a threat to the ethos and character of a school.</P>

    <P>It is impossible to believe that the constitutional lawyers advising the Government allowed this to be included in the Bill.  There is no <Col N="148" /> doubt the Constitution supports denominational education.  My amendment does not challenge, undermine or restrict the nature of denominational education if that is what parents decide they want for their children, rather it seeks to protect the right of access to denominational schools.</P>
    <P>Article 42.1 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>Use of the term &ldquo;inalienable right&rdquo; means that no one can remove such a right from parents to do so.  &ldquo;Ceart dochánta&rdquo; atá sa leagan Ghaelige. It is absolutely clear that parents make decisions about the education of their children.  No one will argue with that point.  Article 42.2 states &ldquo;Parents shall be free [&ldquo;Tig leo&rdquo;, mar a deir sé as Gaelige] to provide this education in their homes or in private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State.&rdquo;.  They can choose to have their children educated in a school established or recognised by the State.  There are two steps under the Constitution, namely, parents are enabled to make decisions about their children's education and that they can choose to send their children to a school recognised by the State.</P>
    <P>Article 42.3.1º states:</P>
    <P>The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State.</P>
    <P>Equally, there is no way the State can declare that parents may not send their children to schools because they are of the wrong religion.  That cannot be right.  In the past we have discussed issues of this nature.  Why is the Government restricting the choice of parents in this matter?  Why are children being separated on the basis of the denomination of their parents?  There are words to describe this and we would use them if discussing similar situations in other countries.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week a senior figure at one of Northern Ireland's universities described this type of education as &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo;.  A major row ensued and the university in question tried to distance itself from her remarks.  Today, however, the Alliance Party has defended her right to make such statements.  Last November I used the same word to describe education of that nature which caused an outcry from some of the Churches.  I recognise that my use of the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; was somewhat insensitive but I did so to shock people into seeing that the Bill proposes a system of apartheid.  It was not my intention to cause offence.  The nature of pluralism is not about allowing every group to flourish within the Republic, it is partly that but it is mainly to do <Col N="149" /> with the relationships between people of different beliefs and backgrounds.</P>
    <P>Article 42.1, 2 and 3 gives parents the rights to which I referred.  I would like to ask the Minister of State his view on Article 44.2.3º which states &ldquo;The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status&rdquo;.  We are about to pass legislation which states that an educational establishment will not be guilty of discrimination if it refuses a child entrance to a school on the basis of his or her religion.  That is unacceptable.  I raised a similar issue about which I was concerned on the employment equality legislation.  I am very concerned about the matter under discussion.</P>
    <P>I know better than anyone in public life the consequences of refusing children entry to a school.  I will advise every teacher throughout the country that, under no circumstances, should they refuse a child entrance to a school on the basis of his or her religious beliefs or background.  That is unacceptable and it is a denial of a constitutional right.  The parents of a Catholic child may decide that even though they were both raised as Catholics and educated in Catholic schools they do not want their child to have a Catholic education. They may decide that their child should be educated at a school run by the Society of Friends or at a Jewish or Muslim school.  It is their constitutional right to make such a decision and it seems that there is a constitutional imperative on parents to follow through and implement whatever action they believe is in the best interests of their children.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I stated that if the Bill is accepted in its current form and is not found to be unconstitutional, it will remain in place until a parent is faced with a situation where his or her child is refused admission to a school on the grounds of religion.  The Articles of the Constitution I read into the record will be repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> in the Supreme Court in a case against the State or the authority of the school concerned in respect of a denial of constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>In 1977, the union I represent made a mistake by depriving children of the right of admission to primary school, not on religious grounds but as part of an industrial action.  We were wrong to do so and paid for our decision for many years.  It cost my union almost £3 million to discover that it is unconstitutional to deny a child access to primary education.  I believe the provision under discussion represents the most serious and fundamental error.  Will the Minister of State reconsider the position?</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister stated that the character of any particular school is determined in different ways.  He did not describe what might be those ways.  However, I have never held the opinion that a school's character or ethos is determined by the religion or beliefs of its pupils. The character, denomination and ethos of a Catholic school is determined by the actions of the school authority, by the hymn sung at assembly <Col N="150" /> each morning and by the fact that the pupils construct a May altar, attend church for confession on a monthly basis, say the Angelus at 12 noon each day or that their holidays coincide with the feast days of particular religions.  These are the things which determine the denominational ethos of a school and that is the case regardless of the religion of its pupils.</P>
    <P>Proof of my case is offered by multi-denominational schools which have a clear and absolute ethos that is well recognised.  They achieve this by encompassing the different beliefs of all their pupils.  The ethos of such schools is in no way compromised, undermined or threatened by the fact that their pupils come from different denominational backgrounds or have different beliefs, religious cultures or faiths.  To insist that a child's religion has something to do with determining a school's ethos is not an option.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister stated that this provision was put in place on the advice of the Attorney General.  The Minister's words came from the Attorney General's advice on a document entitled <i>The Governance of Schools</i> which formed part of an agreement between the Churches, management authorities and teacher unions about the governance of primary schools. Under that agreement school authorities were given absolute discretion regarding the admission of pupils.  The INTO refused to accept that on the grounds that it is probably unconstitutional.  We were informed that the wording had been approved by the Attorney General and legal advice insisted it was required.  We now know that is not the case.  This form of words is a weak attempt by the office of the Attorney General to put a constitutional safety net under the refusal. He was asked to find a form of words to give schools a right to refuse in a way that might satisfy the Constitution and the wording used is &ldquo;provided that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school&rdquo;, whatever that means.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has not explained how the admission of a child could undermine the ethos of a school.  He asked if I wanted Protestant schools swamped by Catholics or vice versa.  If he had thought more about it he might not have used those words.  I do not think he meant them to be offensive but they sound offensive in that they suggest that one religion might swallow up another.  However, that is the difficulty with this issue &mdash; these provisions imply that different religions cannot live side by side and that people cannot respect each other's beliefs.  These provisions design a society which is anything but pluralist, a society whose &ldquo;pluralism&rdquo; is defined by its differences.  That is not what pluralism and inclusiveness are about.  We say people should learn to live with each other.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I said that the best way for people to appreciate, value and understand the richness of their culture, faith or ethos is to see it in comparison with others.  For example, it is often the case that people do not understand their Irishness until they go abroad; people do not <Col N="151" /> understand the beauty of the Irish language until they are overseas and use cúpla focal.</P>
    <P>It is when people learn about each other's beliefs and religions that they can best appreciate them.  If children of different religions sit beside one another they may talk about their different religions.  An event such as a First Communion can become a talking point among the children of the other faiths who may learn about it and become part of the celebration.  Pluralism will find its home when people of different religions can share, celebrate and perhaps participate in the feasts and event of other religions.  When a Catholic child can tell his Jewish classmates about Confirmation and the Jewish child can explain the bar mitzvah to his Catholic classmates, they can celebrate each other's events and respect them.  Thus they will not become a basis for fear or ridicule.</P>
    <P>I believe we are making a serious error here.  I have argued that it is unconstitutional.  However, I appeal to the Minister of State as a public representative, on the basis of what the Government stands for, what the Constitution is about and what freedom of citizenship in a republican, pluralist and inclusive state is about.  That freedom must begin with children.  We must not use four year old children as pawns in this game.  We cannot be comfortable with a provision which considers a four year old child a threat to the ethos of a school or institution.  There is something intrinsically wrong with such a proposition.</P>
    <P>This provision is unconstitutional, unacceptable, offensive and morally questionable. It must be unacceptable to public representatives in a pluralist, inclusive and republican State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an excellent Bill but I have reservations about this section.  Since the foundation of the State education has been organised on a denominational basis in primary and post-primary schools, with the exception of the vocational level.  Like Senator O'Toole I was shocked by the reaction to the words of my friend Rabbi Julia Neuberger when she spoke about denominational education in Northern Ireland. Such a reaction would not occur in the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Protestant schools have never operated on an exclusively Protestant admissions only basis. They were the original multi-denominational schools because they admitted all children whose parents did not want them to attend Catholic schools.  The Protestant schools, most of which were run by the Church of Ireland, catered for Muslim, Jewish, Baptist and Presbyterian children and the Protestant schools want this state of affairs to continue.  They do not want to become exclusively Protestant.  I am sure the demand for places in such schools will increase.  The Department of Education has not challenged this arrangement.  It has always been able to depend on these schools to provide places for those who <Col N="152" /> did not want to attend the schools run by the majority religion.</P>
    <P>This section proposes to protect minority schools in the main by allowing for refusal of admission.  It is the Church of Ireland schools, the primary schools mainly, which will be affected. Three quarters of Church of Ireland primary schools have three or fewer teachers.  They are small schools.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole was right to ask how one could refuse a four year old child admission because the child is of a certain religion.  That will prove extremely difficult for the small Church of Ireland primary schools.  The parents of the children who are non-Church of Ireland would not send them to the Church of Ireland schools if they felt they would be proselytised.  Religious education in such primary schools is based on Bible studies and all preparations for the sacraments take place outside school hours.  There is no question of catechism or other elements of dogma singular to one denomination which might be unacceptable to other Christian denominations being taught.  However, values are transmitted within these schools and the small schools are anxious that they would remain in a position to continue to do so.  The values involved are much cherished by Irish society and it does not want them diluted.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael recently celebrated its part in the foundation of the State 75 years ago.  When the State was founded Archbishop Gregg asked Michael Collins if he wanted the archbishop's flock to leave the island.  Collins replied that, on the contrary, he wanted them to play an important part within the State.  The Church of Ireland and the other smaller Protestant churches have played an important role, particularly in the education system.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Bill is designed to protect minority schools so that they can refuse to accept children.  However, I do not know how these small schools will manage to refuse to take in children because they are of a different religion. How can it be said they will affect the ethos of the school?  The State is devolving its responsibility for pluralist schools to the schools themselves. What will happen to these children if schools refuse to admit them?  Parents, who are obviously the prime educators of children, do not want them to go to another school in the area. Whoever refuses to admit them should be conscious they are doing something terrible.</P>
    <P>Looking at the legislation, it appears that parents, if their child refused admission, would be in a position to sue the school and not the State. This is an important Bill which contains vital social legislation.  However, often within a broad sweep of policy we introduce small areas where we think we are protecting minorities but the effect may be unforeseen consequences.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole asked if the Employment <Col N="153" /> Equality Bill would fail its constitutional test. That Bill provides for the Director of Equality Investigations.  If the Bill was to fail a constitutional test, this Bill could not be enacted without this provision.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole stated that a denominational school can still maintain its ethos even when children of another denomination make up the majority of the pupils.  During the earlier part of the debate, Senator Norris mentioned a Quaker school in the United States where only two students were of that religion.  However, not all denominations would be happy with such a situation. For example, the Church of Ireland Board of Education has argued for its right to have a denominational balance in the pupil intake to Protestant schools.  The board says it has been happy to accommodate the parental choice of Catholic parents who wish to send their children to Protestant schools, provided a mechanism exists whereby the school management could give a preference to the enrolment of Protestant children and could have means to determine the desired size of the school.</P>
      <P>Section 8(3)(b)(i) protects the interests of Church of Ireland and other denominational schools in this respect.  Senator O'Toole has made much of the right of parents to have their children educated in a Protestant school.  Nobody questions that right.  However, all this exception permits is the preferment of a child of a particular denomination to one of another denomination or the refusal to admit a child who is not of a particular denomination where the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</P>
      <P>The Minister is advised that the provision of Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution, taken together with the decisions of the courts, means there is an entitlement under the Constitution to schools which are run in accordance with a religious ethos and the preservation of that ethos will otherwise be seen as discrimination.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has said it is unacceptable that legislation should constrain a person's right to participate in religion or that the State should demand children be sent to schools of a particular denomination.  This provision does nothing of this kind but merely gives discretion to schools in certain defined circumstances to prefer children of one denomination over those of another or to exclude children who are not of a particular denomination.  Senator O'Toole argued that as a pluralist State we should ensure children learn and grow together.  He cogently argued for multi-denominational education.  However, this should not imply we force people into multi &mdash; or nondenominational education or that we effectively outlaw denominational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole did not acknowledge that at present schools have a right to refuse people on the grounds of religion.  I am advised that such a right exists constitutionally.  It is the view of the Church of Ireland Board of Education, based on their representations to the Minister, that it has such a right.  There is one Protestant secondary <Col N="154" /> school which imposes a 15 per cent quota for the admission of Catholics because of the level of demand for places from Protestants.  Other such schools may have higher proportions of non &mdash; co-religionists.  Since schools have the right to refuse on the grounds of religion, the exception we are discussing confers no new rights on schools in this respect.  In fact, the second part of section 8(3)(b)(i) will place limits on the right to refuse.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the threat of a four year old to the ethos of a school.  This is simplistic and he knows it.  In Celbridge in my constituency there are not enough places provided by the State or any church for the numbers of children there.  There is over application for all primary school places.  The vast majority of these children are Roman Catholic and large numbers are being taken into one relatively small Church of Ireland school in the town.  The four year olds will not affect the ethos of that school &mdash; the parents will.  They have an absolute right to determine policy under the Education Bill.  Senator O'Toole knows that better than probably anyone else in this or the other House.</P>
    <P>The Senator also effectively praised the merits of the multi-denominational system.  However, we have to make up our minds whether we will tell the public it cannot have denominational schools and that multi-denominational schools are more desirable.  This is what Senator O'Toole is saying.</P>

      <P>We have to make up our minds whether we will allow denominational schools.  If we allow them to exist and flourish, we cannot include a provision which allows other denominations to take over the places in that school.  It will be the right of the school, not the Minister, to determine that and the level of input of other denominations.  I suggest that Senator O'Toole withdraws his amendment.  He knows we are not talking about four year olds diluting the ethos of a school.  We are talking about a majority of parents determining the ethos.  If we are talking about discrimination it would be bad to send out a message to minority religious groups in our community that the majority group will have a right to send their children to a minority school, take over and put parents on the board.  That would be the effect of the Senator's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That puts everything in context for me.  I respectfully advise the Minister's advisers to read the Constitution.  All my comments related to primary level.  The Constitution is only concerned with primary education as regards parental choice.  Everybody knows that. The Minister should not give an example of a 15 per cent quota in a secondary school.  Secondary schools have always been entitled to refuse children because there was no constitutional basis for them not to.</P>
      <P>I have read in the newspapers and heard Ministers and commentators say that schools have a right to refuse children and have done so on the grounds of their religion.  Every time I have heard that or read it, I have checked every available source.  I have more information on the primary education sector than anyone in this country and I have never found a situation where a child was refused entry on the grounds of religion alone.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had been in the House on Committee Stage he would be aware that I made it absolutely clear that where there is a question of space limitations, school authorities must make certain choices.  In Celbridge, they may have made a choice on the basis that children had siblings who were enrolled in the school or that children lived within a certain distance from the school.  My argument is that children should not be refused admission solely on the grounds of religion; it does not apply to situations where there are space limitations or problems of overcrowding. The Minister's response was partly specious and largely spurious.  No two paragraphs of his response were directed at the points I made.</P>
      <P>I did not propose that there should be multi-denominational education for all children.  I would be utterly opposed to that.  The case I am making concerns choice for parents.  Parents should be able to choose a school with a multi-denominational, denominational or non-denomiational ethos.  The latter is not available in Ireland at the moment.  Ethos is determined not by the religion of the children in the school but by the way in which religious authorities run a school and allow an ethos to permeate its activities and organisation.</P>
      <P>The Church of Ireland Board of Education referred to the question of preference which arose on Committee Stage.  I wrote to them last October in relation to that.  When I raised the issue of preference with the Minister he asked whether that would also be denial of a constitutional right and I acknowledged that he may have been correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be one place remaining in a school by virtue of regulations which stipulate that there should be x square feet per child in a classroom, <Col N="156" /> school yard and so on.  If two children applied &mdash; one of a denomination which was in line with the ethos of the school and the other of a different one &mdash; for admission to the school, the school authorities might decide that it might be desirable to give preference to the child of the same ethos. That decision would respect parental choice and would be a pragmatic and valid one in line with the Constitution.  I believe the question of preference should be provided for and I made a similar statement in relation to the appointment of teachers in such schools.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to consider a situation where there are, for example, two schools in a town, one a Church of Ireland school and the other a Catholic.  There might be two &ldquo;practising&rdquo; atheist or agnostic families living in that town who do not accept the religion of either school.  However, if these are the only schools available the families may wish to enrol their children in one.  Both schools might refuse admission to the children on the grounds that they would undermine the ethos of the school.  What would happen then?  Where would those children's right to a free primary education, provided for under the Constitution, be delivered?</P>
    <P>I did not suggest that all children should attend multi-denominational schools; I simply used that as an example of the way in which children can learn from the interaction of different religions.  I would be totally opposed to any kind of totalitarian prescription in education where people's choices would be restricted.</P>
    <P>The basis for this amendment is to allow for parental choice.  Education can be enriched by providing choice and by having denominational, non-denominational and multi-denominational education.  That is the route we should take.  Education in this country has been enriched in practical and philosophical ways by its denominational complexion.  We could have a multifaceted, pluralist society in education which would respect, support, encourage and propagate children's cultures.  What we are doing in this Bill is fundamentally wrong.  It is prescriptive, it isolates children and it does not provide for dissenters.  I do not know where a dissenter would go in this situation.  If dissenters are refused everywhere, as this legislation allows them to be, the State must provide for their children in some way.</P>
    <P>This issue may be put to the test in court and the situation will be no different to that which prevailed for years in relation to special education.  In the past I heard Ministers say that children with special education needs did not have the same constitutional right to education as other children. They would not dare say it today.  The judgment in the Cork case ensured that the State is now obliged to provide access to education for children with special needs which it should always have provided.  In this Bill we are ensuring that children can be refused admission to a school on the grounds of religion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> I believe I have lost this argument but I do not intend to withdraw the amendment.  The Minister is being completely inflexible.  However, I remind him that when a similar issue was raised in relation to the Employment Equality Bill only four Members of this House voted against it and the President found it necessary to refer that Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.</P>

    <P>The subsection contains a list of groups or persons against whom it would be an offence to sexually harass.  When we made a request under the employment equality legislation the Minister said he would add additional categories of people. <Col N="158" /> There is a fear that one might omit a category of person against whom it may be an offence to harass.

      <P>The sexual and other harassment provisions of this Bill apply to areas generally corresponding to those in which discrimination is prohibited.  The prohibition on sexual and other harassment in the Employment Equality Bill is similarly confined to the context of employment. The Senator's amendment would have the effect of bringing all sexual and other harassment, irrespective of the area in which it takes place, within the scope of the Bill.  This would be outside the scope of the Bill as provided for in the Long Title. It would duplicate the provisions in the Employment Equality Bill and would be very difficult to enforce as it would cover sexual and other harassment in all spheres of public and private life.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 18, lines 39 and 40, to delete &ldquo;may, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I redrafted the amendment on the Minister's advice.  As I stated on Committee Stage, the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; is too weak.  I fear that the regulations specified in sections 19 and 20 may never come into force.  The Minister said that if I pressed the amendment as drafted on Committee Stage it would be inoperable because the Minister could not force the hand of another Minister.  He said agreement could not be reached by force.  The amendment suggests that the Minister should make the regulations and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications should then take them on board and enforce them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reread the section which is good and I am satisfied that the onus on those who provide public transport would not be too great.  Section 19(3)(a) deals with the number or proportion of an operator's vehicles or any class thereof to which the regulations apply, while paragraphs (b) and (c) relate to the time or times when the regulations come into effect and the terms and conditions. <Col N="159" /> The Minister has huge scope in the drafting of the regulations.  I am not telling him what they should include but he must make the regulations. The only way that can be done is by deleting the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; and replacing it with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

My amendment relating to access to public transport for the disabled and other amendments were as important as any of the amendments to section 8.  The fact that few Members supported calls for divisions on the Employment Equality Bill and this Bill does not mean we were wrong and the Independent Senators were right.

It is a pity this weakness is included in a Bill which is so good otherwise.  I compliment the Minister on the 98 per cent of the Bill which is good.  The House did a good job in examining the legislation minutely and subjecting it to critical scrutiny. That is the purpose of the Seanad and although the debate may have appeared tedious at times, it was honestly intended and should have strengthened the Bill.  I wish it had strengthened it more.</P>

      <P>In page 13, subsection (3)(a), line 36, after &ldquo;organisations&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Irish language and Gaeltacht organisations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments concern the Irish language. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh seans an Gaelige a chuthú sa mhéad a bheadh idir láimh le húdaráis na hollscoileanna.  Níl anseo ach iarracht chun iad a tharaingt isteach agus seans a thabhairt dóibh chun pháirt a ghlacadh.  There is nothing overwhelming about this nor will it cause a huge problem for the Minister.  If amendment No. 38a were accepted, the Bill would read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> (a)  at least one but not more than four persons, chosen by a committee of the governing authority comprising the chief officer and two other members, from among nominations made by such organisations as are representative of employers, trade unions, agriculture, fisheries, community organisations, Irish language and Gaeltacht organisations, the professions, business and industry as the governing authority considers appropriate, of whom at least one shall be chosen from those nominated by organisations representative of business or industry [.]</P>
    <P>There are issues connected with study of the Irish language.  As someone who learned Latin through Irish from an English textbook I appreciate the difficulties which can arise.  The first part of my third level studies in a college of education was conducted from English textbooks through the medium of Irish.  Many support structures need to be put in place to allow third level institutions to give sustenance to Irish.</P>
    <P>I am not looking for anything special, only that the position of college students from the Gaeltacht should be ameliorated and that there should be an ethos of understanding their viewpoint. This does not change anything radically, it is merely a recognition.  I am careful not to look for additional special arrangements.  I often argue with Irish language organisations but in this case it is reasonable to grant them recognition.  I am particularly supportive of people from the Gaeltacht. Sílim ar na deacrachtaí ag muintir na Gaeltachtaí atá ag freastal ar gcoláistí tríú leibhéal Ó thaobh théacsanna agus modhanna na múinteoireachta. Their views should be reflected as appropriate.  UCG has made a huge effort in terms of Irish &mdash; that may be unfair on other colleges but UCG has always been a Gaeltacht-oriented third level institution.  If the amendment was accepted, at least it would have to be considered in the course of implementing the other parts of the Bill.  The same argument applies to the other amendments.  Does the Minister feel open to them or what is her view?</P>

I see no difficulty with this.  I am not speaking in Irish but I understood his remarks. He may correct me if I am wrong, but I take it he does not want anything particularly ambitious. He is looking for an opportunity for the Irish language to be provided &mdash; there is no element of compunction in the amendment.  If we are serious about Irish we should facilitate its growth and development.  My colleague wants to facilitate those institutions who wish to pick members of Irish language organisations; it is one among a number of options.  It is reasonable to make a nod in this direction so I am happy to support the Senator.</P>

      <P>In page 14, subsection (3) (c), line 6, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the crux of the Bill and is particularly difficult to accept.  If this provision is enacted, it will be the first time Dublin University will have accepted political nominees on its board.  Apart from it being something of a culture shock, it is also totally unjustifiable in terms of logic.  If the universities want to welcome people from outside onto their boards, as is the case in subsection (3)(a), that is fair enough.  However, it is totally unjustifiable to write into legislation that Ministers should have political patronage which would allow them to place their own nominees on the boards of universities.</P>
      <P>I understand the point of view that people from outside should be on university boards, in that it is arguable that non-executives are a protection in certain situations for shareholders.  Therefore, independent people on university boards may be seen and interpreted &mdash; although I do not share this view &mdash; as being there as impartial observers to watch the managers and those who have real and particular interests within the university. However, the idea that members should be directly appointed by a Minister is thoroughly objectionable.</P>
      <P>The record of political parties of appointments to semi-State boards is nothing short of disgraceful. I find it very difficult to discover any appointments to semi-State boards which do not have political dimensions.  They come across my desk on a daily basis in another capacity.  The only puzzle I have to solve when appointments to a semi-State board are announced is to which party they have an allegiance.  That puzzle can be resolved extremely quickly.  It is very sad that the semi-State bodies have been treated in such a way.  People are appointed to such boards because of their political leanings and their ability is a secondary consideration.  That is not the way I want to see our universities go.</P>
      <P>I do not accept assurances from Ministers who say this is not their intention.  I have been in this House for longer than most Members and I have heard such assurances from Ministers before, especially when semi-State bodies are being set up.  Those assurances undoubtedly ring hollow when the appointments are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have very little doubt that, because of the fuss which has been made about this Bill, when the first ministerial appointments are made that political aspect will not be as prominent as it normally would be on semi-State or other such bodies. However, we are legislating for eternity rather than for a year.  We are introducing something which is not justifiable in the context of the history of this State.  The political parties have disgraced themselves with their patronage.  When they come to power they ruthlessly appoint their <Col N="166" /> own to such boards.  I do not accept any assurances that the universities will be treated any differently.  Such appointments may be made to reward constituents or for reasons of political patronage.  However, there will be a political aspect to these appointments, whether they be one or four; and the fewer the better.  No member of the Government could tell the House with a clear conscience that people have been appointed totally on merit, because if true, it would be the greatest coincidence in the history of the world that so many of them have allegiances to political parties.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to change the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  It is not extreme, nor doctrinaire. It gives the Minister the power to nominate, but it also gives the boards of the universities the right to reject a nominee.  The present wording forces the board to accept a nominee. No amount of argument will convince me that, at some stage, somebody will not be appointed for political purposes.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 45 in the name of Senator Norris states that the provisions of section 15(3)(c) shall not apply in the case of Trinity College. I would prefer that it should not apply in any case and that boards should be free of political influence.  If section 15(3)(c) is necessary for the sake of transparency and to ensure that somebody, on behalf of the Minister, can see what is going on, is it not true that transparency will also be satisfied by the fact that the books will be opened and that the provost of Trinity College and the executives in other universities will be subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General?  There is no resistance to full accountability and transparency, but there is resistance throughout my constituency to political patronage entering the universities.</P>
    <P>There has been extensive argument about the role of county councillors.  I accept there is a point of view here, although I disagree with it. However, given the history of the State, there is no justification for political patronage on the boards of universities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In one sense I prefer amendment No. 43 in the name Senator Ross because it is simpler and clearer and it extends to all the universities. However, Trinity College is in an unusual situation.  The constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland have traditionally had outside intervention of this kind.  They may be pleased with the provision because it either stabilises or, in some cases, reduces the number of nominees.  However, it would be reasonable for Trinity College to be unhappy because it is being introduced there for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that she will not introduce an amendment on Report Stage.  The element of coercion is regrettable.  Section 15(3)(c) provides that people &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be appointed on the nomination of the Minister.  It would be much better to replace the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; because it would be in <Col N="167" /> accordance with the principle of academic freedom, about which we have heard so much.  It would also grant to the universities the dignity to decide whether they wanted a particular person foisted on them.  If a particularly noxious appointment of a political character were made it would cause dissension and create tension on the board which would not foster good relations nor the efficient functioning of the university; it would inevitably waste time.</P>
    <P>I am not flattered when I am occasionally asked to serve on committees because of the need to have a Member of the Oireachtas or whatever &mdash; I know I am being added to give extra weight. However, if I am asked because I know something about the subject I am far more inclined to become fully involved.  I favour the 0 &mdash; 4 principle, in other words there could be none or up to a maximum of four, and treating universities in an adult like manner by giving them the final say.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross has indicated that he wishes to extend this new liberation to the other universities, but I am not sure I wish to interfere where they have become used to this and are prepared to live with it.  If it were such a good idea presumably they would have petitioned to increase the number of nominees.  However, they are happy with a reduction.</P>
    <P>Section 15(3)(c) represents an unnecessary interference.  It also contains an element of coercion and a danger that it will not increase the efficiency of the universities, indeed, the reverse is possible.  The same situation can be arrived at if the Minister is prepared to change the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  It would be unusual for a university board or authority to dismiss in a cavalier manner the Minister's wish.  However, it should be left to them to decide on the suitability or otherwise of nominees.  People who have been involved in an institution for 30 or 40 years and have worked their way up through it are more likely to know who is the best nominee.</P>
    <P>While I do not envisage a large number of cases of conflict, I can envisage some.  Perhaps the two amendments could be combined on Report Stage and that the substitution of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would apply in the case of Trinity College. However, the Minister has indicated that she will not accept that proposal either.</P>
    <P>If Senator Ross presses his amendment I will support him, although I would prefer to confine my intentions to Trinity College because the other universities may, perhaps, have a different view.  That is why I suggest that the provisions of section 15(3)(c) shall not apply to Trinity College.</P>
    <P>I had considerable assistance in the drafting of some of these amendments from members of the staff of the House.  I express my gratitude to them because they often assist us with amendments, suggesting how they may framed in the absence of the kind of professional draftsperson's assistance one would expect in a modern Parliament.  I <Col N="168" /> am grateful for their good advice and their willingness to help, sometimes at short notice.</P>

      <P>For example, the implication is that the Minister will try and find total misfits and appoint them to the board, having consulted the chief officer.  Politics has taken a thrashing for the past number of years and we are making no attempt to redress that.  I know members of boards who were appointed by Governments of which they were not supporters.  They were appointed because of their ability.  The fact that people are members of a political party should not mean that they should be looked on as substandard <Col N="169" /> beings.  Many important and good people are members of political parties at some stage.  It has been said here that because they are members they cannot show their faces; they have to hide.  They cannot be seen in certain places or appointed to certain positions by Ministers.  We have to catch onto ourselves because that is an insult to many people, especially to Ministers. Section 15(3) states there will be consultation.  In this sophisticated age we are listening to some very unsophisticated comments from the other side of the House.  We have a sophisticated people who make their own judgements on the actions of Ministers.  The contributions of speakers on the other side of the House should be examined in context.</P>

They should examine their consciences and withdraw the amendments. We should work together to make the political system more acceptable and should not undermine ourselves from the inside.  We have enough to do to try and convince people that politics is a good healthy game.

    <P>Last night I attended a public meeting on adoption in Dublin.  Politicians from all parties were present to defend vigorously the honourable profession of politics against onslaughts from a section of society which was looking for changes. <Col N="170" /> The people involved had very strong feelings, but when one person made a glancing attack on politicians, the entire hall erupted in applause.  I told them they were foolish to take this easy, cheap shot at politicians.  I have witnessed from the inside how honourable and decent the vast majority of people are.</P>
    <P>My colleagues are being morbidly oversensitive and have misinterpreted my position.  Senator Cotter gave the impression that everybody believed that Ministers and other politicians were the most saintly people on earth.  Most of them are decent, good people who work for little in adverse circumstances but if he believes his view is generally held by the people he has a rude shock awaiting him on the doorsteps in the forthcoming election. They certainly do not.  The shenanigans that have gone on in all political parties over the past few years would not lead anybody to the conclusion that this was the case.</P>

      <P>I am a politician.  I know of and have seen the power and temptation of patronage.  When politicians are allowed the power of patronage, they abuse it.  The Labour Party has abused patronage in this Government to a savage and unforgivable extent.  That is the problem.</P>

      <P>The appointments on the formation of the Government in 1992 were disgraceful and well documented.</P>
      <P>Two Ministerial appointments were recently made in Senator Sherlock's constituency to the board of Bord Gáis.  I will not name them, but one is the Lord Mayor of Cork, an ex-Fine Gael Deputy, and the other was a financial secretary of the Labour Party.  I am sure that a detailed study was done of these people's interest in and knowledge of gas and business and that interviews were held by Bord Gáis and the Minister. Let us not be ridiculous about this; these were blatant political appointments.  That is what happens in Ireland and it is why I want to keep patronage out of as many places as possible.  I do not welcome Ministerial power of appointment because it is abused.</P>
      <P>I heard Senator Cassidy's point.  The only time parties close ranks is on the issue of patronage as all their nest eggs are threatened.  They all want the power to put people on the board of a university.</P>

      <P>Today, universities play a very central role in the economic and intellectual development of the country.  It is therefore quite reasonable that a Minister would appoint at least one person to the institutions we are now discussing. Those institutions appear to have an erroneous impression that what the State gives in the back door is not to be recognised in the front parlour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is not for me to enter the debate on attacks on people with party political affiliations. I have appointed people to boards, some because they share my philosophy on the future development of education, and I am more than satisfied that those people have contributed and will continue <Col N="174" /> to contribute to their boards because they are qualified to do so.</P>
    <P>Universities are no longer just for the elite.  I have opened the gates of university for undergraduates by abolishing the tax relief for covenants. A small sector of society had been able to rip-off that relief to such an extent that, through its abolition, we were able to open the gates for students with ability.  Given the importance of that and the intention, aspiration and ambition of people to enjoy university education which was the privilege of an elite, it is reasonable that the centre stage role of universities would be recognised and that the Minister can appoint at least one nominee to represent that public interest on their board.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister raised the issue of free education because if she looks at it, she will find that she will have great difficulty demonstrating that it has widened the social range of people entering university.  That has simply not happened.  I will not let the Minister away with that because it is not true.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (3)(c), line 8, after &ldquo;officer&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the governing authority to be informed of all proposed names&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I cannot match the high drama of the recent past on this amendment.  I will be brief because we obviously want to progress.  It struck me, however, given the anxieties that surrounded this issue in general that if the names of proposed members of the governing authority in the consultation between presidents and Minister were to come up, it would give an opportunity of reassuring the sceptics about the quality of the candidate to be considered and the quality of the appointment.  That is inserted with a view to assisting public education in these matters.</P>

      <P>Senator Lee's proposal would require the chief officer to inform the governing authority of all proposed names.  I cannot agree with it because there is an implication in the amendment that in some way the chief officer would be concealing information from the governing authority.  If the Senator considers that the governing authority should have an input in this regard, I would point out that the chief officer must always act subject to the policies of the governing authority and is answerable to the authority. I refer the Senator to paragraph 4 of the Fourth Schedule.  I do not consider this amendment to be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (4), line 11, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The governing authorities of universities ought to have members elected by graduates, as is the case in a number of instances at present.  There ought to be specific provision for people having particular regard to artistic and cultural interests.  The governing authority of any university would definitely be strengthened by the inclusion of those categories.  That is why I would prefer to have &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  If it is deemed that there is not sufficient cultural calibre on a governing authority as it stands, one may have up to four members, but by what criteria does one decide there is not sufficient cultural calibre starting off?  If one believes that close relations with <Col N="176" /> graduates is a good thing for universities &mdash; and we discussed that briefly under functions &mdash; that should be encouraged rather than being left to the different views which various universities might come to.  In general terms that is something we should strive to encourage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect would be that not more than four co-optees and not more than four graduates would be on the governing authority.  I am not quite clear whether the effect of the amendment would be that there would be at least one of each or, indeed, if this is what the Senator is seeking.  I would prefer to leave this section as an option to the universities themselves.</P>

      <P>I come in stoutly behind the Minister on this amendment.  It is a refreshing experience for me and it may convince the Minister she is wrong.  It is probably Senator Lee's best chance of his amendment being accepted.  I see no reason for making this compulsory; it is better to leave it to the governing authority.  I agree with the Minister and I congratulate her for being so liberal and understanding of the governing authority on this issue.  It is a pity she did not extend it to other areas but perhaps she will do so later tonight.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (4)(b), line 21, after &ldquo;Recognised College&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or graduates of any university who are employees of the constituent university&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The principle that employees of the institution who are not graduates of the institution should be excluded from membership of the governing authority has a diminishing effect on the potential of representation.  We are trying to increase mobility between institutions to get away from the idea that everyone is rooted in the same institution for life.  Large numbers of staff of the new universities will not be graduates of those universities and their potential for participating on the governing authority will be restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give an example of the type of thing I have in mind.  The professor of music at the University of Limerick is one of the most creative people in Irish culture.  The university is developing music as a major area of activity and it has a magnificent concert hall and an orchestra. If one wanted someone on the governing body &mdash; I do not want to mention individuals because they may have no interest in participating in the electoral process &mdash; who was the most appropriate person to advise in that area, it would seem to be <Col N="177" /> looking a gift horse in the mouth to insist that it could not be that person and that only someone else who qualified on the grounds of having graduated from that particular institution could fulfil the role.  Institutions should be allowed use the talent in them, irrespective of where it has come from, to optimise the potential performance of the institution.  These restrictions are increasingly out of date in terms of mobility inside and outside Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Lee's amendment. Things will change in the long-term, so this section is quite restrictive.  I wonder if the Minister has fully considered this matter.  Electors should have the freedom to elect who they wish in the interests of democracy, even if they are graduates of a different university or college.  The wording of the amendment may need to be changed, but it was tabled in the interests of democracy so that no one would interfere in the affairs of an individual university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Lee's amendment.  I assume the Minister will sympathise with it because she suggested that an infusion of blood on to the board from outside would be useful.  It seems odd to narrow that representation. A large number of appointments may be from outside the university, which can be good, because otherwise it would become a hothouse atmosphere which can be unhelpful and almost incestuous.  Disbarring someone because they are graduates of another university, although they are members of staff, creates a second class citizenship among distinguished people.  I support Senator Lee in the interests of democracy and of broadening the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the need to have a broadly based representation on the board, but this section seems to narrow it to people who have grown up through the system within the college. I am sure some people who come from that background will be elected, but to automatically disbar people because they have not graduated from that university is a mistake, particularly since it is now regarded as good academic practice to try to ensure that people travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not now regarded as good practice to employ young academics, for example, in their own university.  Sometimes this acts as a disadvantage. I have known some extremely brilliant and gifted students who should have got jobs in Trinity College because they were unquestionably the most outstanding people in the field. Yet they did not, because Trinity College was nervous about having a reputation for academic nepotism.  I can think of at least two of them who went to UCD and did brilliantly there.  I would like to think they would have the opportunity to serve their university.  It could also be the case that a brilliant student would not be promoted in one of the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland because it was sensitive to <Col N="178" /> this accusation of a hothouse atmosphere and an intellectual xenophobia.  I would like to think they would be entitled to serve on the board and that they would not be disbarred merely because they got their qualification from a sister college.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain if this applies to Trinity College.  I know they are on a level playing field if they have a corresponding degree from a previously existing constituent college of the National University of Ireland.  If someone, who got their degree from one of the previously existing colleges of the NUI is on the staff of Trinity College, would that be regarded as legitimising their position to be elected to the board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>This amendment would have the effect of allowing graduate employees of any university to vote in the election of graduates on the governing authority of the university in which they are employed.  They have a vote in the universities in which they are employed.  They would have a right to vote for their own representatives under section 2 (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>They could be a candidate. Senator Lee mentioned a professor of music in a certain university who I presume is a graduate of another university.  There are two ways in which that person, who might be eminently suitable to serve on the governing authority of that university, could be appointed to it.  One would be as a representative of the staff on the governing body and the other would be under the co-option clause which allows governing bodies to appoint people.  That person would then have a graduate vote for the graduate representations in his own university.  I have been told that if he has a couple of degrees from different universities he could vote as a graduate for both qualifications.</P>
      <P>A particular person who is not a graduate of the University of Limerick could serve on its board as a staff representative having been co-opted by the board under the relevant headings. He or she would retain a voice as a graduate of the university from which he or she graduated. Therefore, people would have more than one vote but they would not have two votes for the same occasion.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee was correct to raise the issue of an optional person.  The situation I outlined highlights how a person could serve in the university in which they are employed while retaining a graduate voice in the university from which they graduated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really concerned with people having a graduate voice in the university from which they graduated.  As graduates, they retain their right to vote at that institution.  I am more concerned with their role in the university from which they did not graduate.  The amendment <Col N="179" /> seeks to ensure that they have the same avenues of access to membership of the authority of the university at which they are employed as do graduates of that institution.  I am becoming confused about this issue.  However, if the Minister is satisfied that her response covers that situation, I accept her judgment.  This issue involves a substantive point about the direction institutions should take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee's amendment suggests that a graduate of the NUI should be allowed to be a candidate under this section.  The amendment is not concerned with the electorate but with the candidacy.  It appears that the Senator has illustrated a valuable point.  If a person is a member of staff of a university, they should be allowed to stand for election.  If the graduates do not desire this they will put forward sufficient candidates to ensure it does not happen. However, a possible case exists, at least in hypothetical terms, that a distinguished graduate of the NUI who is a member of staff at Trinity College could be disbarred from standing for election.</P>

      <P>We are discussing the graduate panel with which Members would be more familiar than those outside.  There is an option for a graduate from another institution to serve on a governing body under section 15 (2) (d), which covers staff representation.  A person of such eminence could be co-opted on to the board.  This section provides a voice for the graduates of a particular institution in one of the categories that reflect the community of a university.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 50 and 51 propose that the governing authority of Dublin City University should include a member of the academic staff of St. Patrick's College.  Similarly, amendment No. 63 proposes that the governing authority of the University of Limerick include a member of the academic staff of Mary Immaculate College.  I support the general thrust of the amendments' objectives but I consider that section 15 (6), as amended by Dáil Éireann, addresses the Senator's concerns.  There was a lengthy debate on this issue on Committee Stage in the Dáil and the wording &ldquo;Where an educational institution is associated with a university&rdquo; is used in section 15 (6) to cover all eventualities. By employing that wording we are not limiting the options in respect of other institutions. The Senator's amendments, which refer to Mary Immaculate College and St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, will be covered by section 15 (6), which states &ldquo;Where an educational institution is associated with a university in accordance with an agreement between that institution and the university and that agreement provides that the governing authority of the university shall have as members employees or students of the institution...&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I am in breach of the rules of the House.  Amendment No. 52 returns to our old friend, the Lord Mayor of Cork, to whom we referred a short time ago.  The Lord Mayor of Cork was recently appointed to the board of An Bord Gáis and if the section is passed as it stands he will not only be an expert in gas but also in third level education.  Coincidentally, every Lord Mayor of Cork will be an expert in those areas.  This illustrates to some extent the anomaly and absurdity of appointing a person by virtue of the office they hold, which has nothing to do with the two appointments they automatically received by courtesy of the Government.  I will not harp on the Lord Mayor of Cork, who, I am informed, is extraordinarily decent and nice and is well loved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than one could say about the Lord Mayor of Waterford, with whom I am not familiar.  It is absurd that people are being appointed to the boards of universities by virtue of the fact that they are lords mayor of various towns.  There is no guarantee that these people have the necessary, if any, expertise to serve on such boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to say anything which might be provocative or lengthen the debate.  Therefore, I will not mention county councillors except in passing.  This section deals with county councils. It is extraordinary that they have provoked a reaction on sections in respect of which they should not have been discussed.  I do not wish to give Members an excuse make speeches to their electorates once again.  However, I do not believe <Col N="182" /> that these provisions, to which I have proposed amendments, should be in the Bill.  There are plenty of suitable places for county councillors but they should not automatically be on the boards of universities.</P>
    <P>I notice that many Senators wish to speak on this matter &mdash; they are as predictable as ever.  I know the counter argument is that county councillors should not be excluded by virtue of their being county councillors, but that is not a valid argument.  I can think of many others who would have a greater claim to be on the boards of universities than those who hold the office of lord mayor of various towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry my colleague Senator Ross personalised the issue in terms of the Lord Mayor of Cork.  He is an extraordinarily nice and decent fellow who will not combine An Bord Gáis with the university governing body because lords mayor change on an annual basis.  It can be useful to have alternative viewpoints coming on board, so to speak.  The present Lord Mayor of Cork is a respected teacher in Cork education circles and would have a perspective to bring to bear on education in general which may be extremely valuable.</P>
      <P>I take the point Senator Ross makes that there is no guarantee that the qualities of an office holder at a particular time will be ideally suited to the membership of a governing authority. However, the personalities of many other members may not be ideally suited, whether they are from inside or outside the institution.  It is unbalanced to single out lords mayor in this way for special opprobrium.  My experience of the lords mayor who have served on the governing body of my college is that they have made a valuable contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge one of Senator Ross's basic assumptions on subsection (5) (b) (i) and (ii) which refers to the Lord Mayor of Cork and the Mayor of Waterford.  He said he would object to their presence on the board because they might not have administrative ability and would not be able to operate in an effective manner.  I question that assumption because he is implying that academics, because they are academics, have the qualities necessary to be members of the board. That does not follow.  To follow Senator Ross's logic there would have to be a testing procedure to find out if the academics have the qualities he feels members of the board should have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge Senator Ross's assertion that a lord mayor would not have the expertise to qualify as a member of a governing body.  Who is to say that is the case?  We cannot question their ability.  The fact that they are elected representatives is a clear indication that they are capable people.  It is presumptuous of Senator Ross to say that those public representatives do not have the necessary expertise.  They <Col N="183" /> are elected representatives and that is good enough.</P>
      <P>We have tabled amendment No. 57 to increase from five to eight the number of elected members of a local authority elected by the members of the General Council of County Councils who will be on the governing body of UCD and I am glad the Minister has indicated that she agrees with the amendment.  I am a member of the General Council of County Councils and we have had fine discussions on this issue.  UCD should have a wide representation because of the number of students there and the number of courses it provides. The communities and the universities must interact.  We can only achieve that through the elected representatives who know their communities and can bring that knowledge to the governing body.</P>
      <P>The Minister should agree to our amendment to reflect a greater membership from the General Council of County Councils.</P>

      <P>I remind Senator Ross that our civilisation is based on the fact that people chose to live in cities.  Limerick city has had mayors for an unbroken period of 800 years.  That represents 800 years of civilised living.  To say that the Mayor of Limerick is not fit to represent the people of the city on the board of the University of Limerick or that the chairman of Limerick County Council is not fit to represent the people of the county on the board of the university is an insult to a bastion of our civilisation.  Next year we will celebrate 100 years of unbroken, democratic local government.</P>
      <P>As in other aspects of his contributions, I find Senator Ross's remarks on this section undemocratic. He is trying to undermine the basis of democracy.  We must reject his argument that there should be no elected representatives on the boards of universities.  We represent the ordinary people against the elite who Senator Ross seems to represent.</P>

      <P>There is some confusion.  No one is saying that the present Lord Mayor of Cork is unfit.  However, to make a person a member of a board automatically by virtue of their office is outrageous.  One may not be able to say automatically that a lord mayor is unsuited but the system will inevitably throw up some lords mayor who are pig-ignorant and prejudiced.  Senators should be aware that this occurred in the past.  Senator Kelly referred to the 800 years of the distinguished city of Limerick&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is that it is mathematically unquestionable that somebody with the qualities I mentioned will be thrown up.  If we look back <Col N="184" /> over an 800 year period we should find royalists, Jacobins and people who were strongly against Catholic emancipation who were lords mayor.  I could name lords mayor from the 18th century who fought bitterly against Catholic emancipation. These are the people Senator Kelly thinks are so wonderfully enlightened because they were thrown up by our democracy.  Who is she fooling?</P>
      <P>Almost all Members have a vested interest being county councillors, Senator Ross included. However, I am not.  They are praising themselves and that is small praise indeed.  I am saying this simply by virtue of the office.  I am not personalising this or naming anyone, although I am tempted.  I have frequently referred to some of the elected Members in the past on the basis that I remember approaching the so-called cultural committee of Dublin Corporation 15 years ago. If there was ever an oxymoron it was that august body.  The office of Lord Mayor is often elected in the most shabby and venal manner, on the basis of party arrangements, tricks and chances and who arranged this, that and the other.  We should not elevate this to the level where no one will believe it.  If Senator Kelly believes that in the 800 years of the mayoralty of Limerick every single one of them was qualified to be on the board of a university, she should go back to her history books.  This is not an attack on the city of Limerick or its mayor.</P>
      <P>The principle is that someone should not be placed on a board just by virtue of their political office.  We spoke earlier about the penetration of boards by political interests.  It is not enough that the Minister has provided for between two to five members of local councils to be represented on a board but some Senators want eight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think some of the Senators making contributions are trying to rise me.  Some of the things they are saying are totally out of order.  They, especially Senator Ross, have contradicted themselves so many times.  He accused politicians and the Minister of jobbery, he said her people would be appointed and that they in turn would appoint their own hacks to positions on boards.  We should be fair.  The position of the Lord Mayor of Cork and the Mayor of Waterford rotates between different political parties every year.  I cannot see how any Minister for Education could appoint her own people to governing bodies all the time.  Senator Norris said a moron could be appointed Lord Mayor.</P>

      <P>That would be only one person out of 38 on the governing body.  Surely the other 37 could control that one person, if there is such a moron?  If they cannot they should not be on the governing body either.</P>
      <P>In the amendment proposed by Senator Ormonde and me, the eight members will not be appointed, as Senator Ross said.  The General Council of County Councils consists of three representatives from every county council in Ireland. I do not have to tell some Senators this as they know it already but perhaps Senator Ross and Senator Norris do not.  The general council nominates and elects eight people to the governing body of UCD every year.  These are not eight Labour, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael people chosen by the Minister.  They are selected by members of county councils.  Many members of county councils are teachers and academics.  There are quite a number of doctors and solicitors on the governing body of UCD.  If they are not fit company for Senator Ross, I do not know what to say.</P>
      <P>I never objected to Senator Ross complaining about members of a local authority.  I complained about the language he used, the manner in which he insulted members of county councils and the derogatory remarks he passed about them.  I never objected to him putting up an argument to keep members of county councils out.  I object to his sneering and the manner in which he put his remarks.  No member of any county council, of any party, should be besmirched by anybody in this way.  Senator Ross has downgraded members of local authorities, who are good people looking after the problems of rural Ireland.  I am proud and glad to be associated with Senator Ormonde's amendment.</P>
      <P>Section 15 (5) (b) (iv) states &ldquo;not less than two or more than five persons elected by the councils of the administrative Counties of Cork, Waterford, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary (North Riding) and Tipperary (South Riding).&rdquo;  This means six counties are allowed five members so one county will lose out.  I may be wrong about this, but it is puzzling.</P>
      <P>We are elected by members of county councils, outgoing Senators and Dáil Deputies.  We are proud to get their vote.  If Senator Ross thinks I am patronising him, he is right.  They are my electorate and he would do the same for his, if he was a man.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have 22 years' experience on the governing body of University College, Dublin, and I have been a member of the NUI Senate for the past 12 or 15 years.  I think I know a great deal about the NUI and UCD.  Senator Ross is telling me the people I can have on my governing body.  What <Col N="186" /> right does he have to do that?  How many people has he consulted in the NUI or UCD?  The Minister has consulted all the governing bodies and the wider faculties.  She is coming to the House following democratic consultation to give us the distilled views of the universities as to who they want on their boards.  What right does Senator Ross have to tell me who I can have as my colleagues on the governing body of UCD?</P>
    <P>It has been my privilege to serve with the elected members of the General Council of County Councils.  I found them splendid colleagues who never divided on party lines and always had the best interests of the university and the wider community at heart.  I make no excuse for saying that and I am proud to do so.  I am not saying it for electoral reasons but because I know it to be true and I believe it.  I ask Senator Ross to allow us the sincerity of our motives without saying &ldquo;he would do that, wouldn't he?&rdquo;  I am saying it because I believe and know it to be true.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of Senator Norris's contributions. However, he stated that there could be a Lord Mayor of Cork or Limerick who was pig ignorant and prejudiced.  I know many academics, professors of English, History and Economics, who are narrow, ignorant and bigoted bullies. These people are half daft and so narrow and driven in their own particular discipline, they have no view of the wider world, except their own selfish interest.  We all know them.  A professor of English could be a fellow of Trinity &mdash; I am sure it has happened in the past &mdash; and fit some or all of these characteristics.  The matter should be looked at in totality.</P>
    <P>By and large I have found that the Lords Mayor of Dublin have not made a very large contribution. As they only hold the office for a year, they do not have very much to say and do not get to know the situation very well.  The same may be true of Cork.  However, this tradition has been in operation for a long time and it has certainly done no harm.  A lord mayor may do a great deal of good on occasion.  There is no body of views in UCD or in UCC which is arguing that lords mayor should not be represented.  Most lords mayor are reasonable and decent people who do not try to impose obnoxious views on others. Those views usually come from within the universities themselves.  Senator Fitzgerald and I speak from many years of elected service on the governing body and we are happy with what is being proposed.</P>

Senator Manning said that a certain number of academics are decidedly off; some are seated not too far from here.</P>

      <P>It is an insulting to councillors to make such comments.  The Government has introduced much legislation the aim of which is to have good local government.  On occasions, attempts have been made to remove councillors from boards and diminish their participation.  I am glad to note that the Minister has indicated that she will look favourably on this amendment.</P>
      <P>What kind of qualifications do councillors need to be members of governing authorities?  I know some councillors who are poor and others who live in mansions.  I know of one councillor who drives a Rolls Royce.  I know councillors who are barristers, doctors, fishermen and farmers.  What disqualifies these people, particularly as they have as many votes behind them in local elections as my colleague has in the university ones?  Councillors are just as qualified as anybody else and perhaps have a great deal more savvy than some of the academics sitting round the table with them.  Men such as Senators McGowan and Fitzgerald have great nous and knowledge of the affairs of the real world as opposed to the abstruse affairs of academia.  Councillors on governing authorities would bring the other lofty people down to earth and would formulate regulations for universities.  I support this amendment and I hope the Minister will look favourably on it.</P>

      <P>I support my colleagues and I compliment Senators Ormonde and Fitzgerald on tabling a specific amendment in relation to councillors. I support the consensus view on councillors which prevails among those of us who live in the real world.  Since entering this House, I and a number of the other Senators have attempted to <Col N="188" /> defend what we perceive to be an erosion of the position of councillors.  I do not know where this started; it seems to go back through several Administrations into the 1980s and it has continued since then.  When parliamentary draftsmen discuss Bills requiring a representative grouping of people to be appointed to boards, the legislation includes a section which disbars councillors from taking their place on these.  County councillors are a representative group who have traditionally served on boards of one type or another.  This trend was allowed to develop unfettered until last year when the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, introduced a Bill to set up the new science and technology board.  He conceded that he saw no merit &mdash; I recall that the Leader of the House was of the same view &mdash; in having legislation which disbarred elected representatives from various boards.  I hope that precedent will be followed.  This amendment has been tabled in that spirit.</P>
      <P>I am saddened by Senator Ross's comments, though they do not make me angry any more.  I am surprised, however, at the comments made by Senator Norris, a person who has suffered a great deal of discrimination and who should be the last person to discriminate against others.  His comments are discriminatory and they set aside a group of people in society who voluntarily give of their time and expertise, such as it is, for the greater good and nothing else.  Yet, the Senator comes into the House and uses what I consider to be unacceptable language.  The Leader of the House has acknowledged that.  I object to that kind of elitism and bigoted racism against elected representatives who have been pilloried on more than one occasion in this House by people who should know better.  It is in that context that I register my support for the amendment.  I am pleased that the Minister seems to have indicated her approval, hopefully her response will indicate that she sees merit in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I know a number of people who currently serve and have served on the governing bodies of universities and I have been struck by the fact that, in the main, they do not necessarily come from an academic background.  A fellow county man of mine, who is the vice-principal of a 600 pupil school in Carrick-on-Shannon, serves on the governing body of UCG and enjoys his tenure there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel strongly about this issue which transcends the entire issue of the allegations that councillors are merely looking after their electorate, something they are entitled to do.  I do not believe that it is right and proper in an elected democracy that there should be such a negative strain of thinking, at the highest <Col N="189" /> academic level, among people who are training a new generation to go out into the world.  It is not acceptable that these people adopt and convey an ingrained attitude to their students that a section of our society, which is democratically elected, is somehow flawed and should be corralled somewhere in order to prevent them becoming involved in something which is of vital importance to them, their families and the wider society.</P>
      <P>Those who participate on governing bodies are proud of their involvement and take their responsibilities seriously.  I am saddened rather than angry particularly by the language adopted by Senator Norris because I have great admiration for him and usually agree with his comments.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to accept the amendment proposed by Senators Ormonde and Fitzgerald.  I was disappointed by Senator Ross's contribution regarding councillors on the governing body of UCD.  I have been a member of Mayo County Council for many years, a position I shared with Commissioner Pádraig Flynn, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the former Minister, Mr. Paddy O'Toole.  Senator Ross is saying that such people are not fit to be on the governing body of UCD. His logic is that he himself is not fit to be a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he is fit to be a member. Councillors give freely of their time; they have been serving the needs of people since the foundation to the State.  They bring much advice and experience to various boards.  Mayo County Council, for example, administers hundreds of thousands of pounds in grants annually to various universities.  Councillors are familiar with the points system, grants, fees and the administrative structures of universities.  Councillors make up a cross section of people, with qualifications ranging from general knowledge to the highest levels of education.  They bring vast experience to their work.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment and ask the Minister to accept it.  I congratulate the Senators who tabled it.  I wish to reiterate my disappointment with Senator Ross's contribution.  He is fit to be a member of the governing body of any university.</P>

On another occasion the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment agreed that public representatives should play a role in administering and advising at board level. I congratulate Senators Ormonde, Fitzgerald, Dardis and O'Toole for tabling this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to recognise the Members who were councillors before being elected to the Oireachtas.  Their vast experience is obvious.  We are enriched by our experience as councillors.  We are the honoured public representatives, with the <Col N="190" /> exception of our colleagues who are elected from the University Panel.  County councillors work between 30 and 50 hours per week on a voluntary basis administering local authority decisions.  In County Westmeath, for example, there is an annual budget of £22 million to be administered.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment.  Politics will be the poorer when we fail to acknowledge and recognise the great work done by local representatives through local authorities and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The public purse will no longer be administered in a way that recognises the demands and needs of the people.  I support a mix at board level and involving public representatives is one way of achieving this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes I wonder whether ordinary people should be allowed into this House and sometimes I get the impression that certain people should be in certain places.  That was the impression I got when I was in the Chair this evening.  During discussion of an earlier amendment I wondered whether only certain people should attend Trinity College.  I am a former Lord Mayor of Cork and, to my misfortune, was on the governing body of UCC for 12 months.  I was amazed at the level of internal conflict.  As an urban councillor if I was seen to be doing, some of the things faculties in UCC were doing I would not last a week.  I certainly would not be reelected.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross's argument is totally inconsistent. Earlier he was looking for certain rights for everybody.  Now he only wants rights for certain people.  He did not say whom he thinks should be on the boards, he only said who should be excluded.  I ask him to name who can best represent the people on the boards.</P>
      <P>As a former Lord Mayor of Cork I was embarrassed to be on the governing body of UCC.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this amendment which provides for the ordinary person to be represented on these boards.  All public bodies which do not include public representatives should be examined.  I sat on the board of UCC on behalf of the people of Cork and I was glad to leave it. UCC is over 150 years old and I am very proud of it.  The first job I got was in 1954 at the age of 13 years and nine months in UCC under Professor O'Reilly.  The subsequent presidents were Mr. Hurley and Mr. Carey.  The current president, Mr. Mortell, has his hands full dealing with the governing body because there are people on it who are not realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can say I am not realistic.  I believe in basics more than anybody else.  Saying that the former Lord Mayor of Cork should not serve on the governing body does not go down well with people.  It is a massive mistake for any Government to decide that public representatives should not serve on such boards.  We must demand recognition for the role public representatives play on behalf of ordinary people.  The previous amendment said that snobs should be looking after the snobs in Trinity College, that only snobs <Col N="191" /> should go to Trinity College because the snobs said so.  I defy anybody to offer an alternative interpretation of that amendment.  Five Independent Senators were in favour of a division but only two voted for the amendment.  If that is democracy, perhaps the Senators could explain it to me.  Perhaps I should ask UCC to explain it.</P>

      <P>This is an emotive subject and the Minister will be tired before the debate is over. Senator Norris referred to the possibility of an appointee being pig ignorant and prejudiced. Some good may yet come of this discussion because people occasionally recognise when they are prejudiced.  We have listened to enough prejudice in the last few hours.</P>
      <P>Section 15 (5) (b) (ii) and (ii) is being treated differently from section 15 (2) (a) and other subsections relating to staff.  The terrible prejudice and arrogance running through the contributions must be confronted but that can only be done by the academics involved.  They are not even listening to the debate which is probably another display of arrogance and disrespect for people generally. The Senators should consider what they are saying.  They believe there is a subspecies of people who are not fit to serve on boards but that others, just because they are academics, are automatically capable of sitting on boards and handling administration rather than teaching.  that assumption is running through the debate.  some academics have the ability to sit on boards but others, just because they are politicians or ministerial appointees, are under question.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris mentioned the possibility of somebody being pig ignorant and prejudiced.  The Senator should examine his conscience and ask himself from where that comment came.  It is based on incredible prejudice and arrogance because the Lords Mayor of Cork and Waterford are elected by bodies.  The presumption in the debate on previous provisions was that certain people would be fine.  However, the presumption with regard to this amendment is that pig ignorance and prejudice will appear.  I hope Members confront their own pig ignorance, prejudice and arrogance because that is the only way to dissipate it.</P>

The proposals relate to the NUI and I ask the two Independent Senators who contributed to this lengthy debate to note that, under section 15 (5) (f), the fellows of Trinity College, Dublin, reflect tradition on the board.</P>
      <P>I considered amendment No. 57 and I indicated previously that I support the valuable and important role played by county councillors.  I want the position whereby councillors are already represented on governing authorities to continue. I have a particular interest in the education of young people.

      <P>One of the amendments addresses the position of lords mayor.  I am a county councillor and it is fair to say that I have been involved in certain deals and agreements of which I am not proud.  One of those transactions involves the election of the chairman of the county council. <Col N="193" /> Chairmen of county councils are great people in many ways but they are selected through deals between political parties which specifically exclude other people.  I understand lords mayor are also selected in that manner.</P>
      <P>I am a member of Wicklow County Council and a deal was done in 1991 which ensured that Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil held the chair for eight years to the exclusion of everybody else.  The chairmanship rotates between those parties, regardless of merit, as a result of a political deal.  Nobody considers anything about the election of a chairman other than that deal.  It is a division of the spoils.  I am fed up with the bogus, pious and sanctimonious nonsense in the debate about lords mayor.  They are wonderful people but every committee and post to which they are elected is the result of wheeling and dealing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us hear the reasons that councillors should be on these bodies.  Senators Manning and Lydon <Col N="194" /> were the two stars of the debate.  Senator Manning said &ldquo;it has done no harm&rdquo;.  What an appalling reason for putting something into legislation. That is extraordinary.  It is not the reason he wants it to be included but it is the reason he gives.  He says they are reasonable, decent people &mdash; that is another great qualification for being on the boards.  Any reasonable, decent person can apply.  We have not heard a justification except that they are political cronies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a political crony and I should not be on the board of a university by virtue of that.  Senator Lydon took great advantage of this debate to name two of his constituents and say they were wonderful people who would be great on the board of a university.  He may or may not believe that but it is not the purpose of this amendment to give Senators the opportunity to address their electorate by name.</P>
      <P>This is a serious point which has not been seriously debated and has been misrepresented. People have seized on expressions such as Senator Norris's remark about people being pig ignorant, There are pig ignorant people in every walk of life &mdash; academia, journalism, everywhere. There is no doubt about that.  People are only prickly about that remark when the people constitute their electorate.</P>
      <P>This amendment has provoked an extraordinary attendance in the House which would not happen if world war was declared or if we decided to invade the North tomorrow.  It is not a coincidence that they are here for the debate.  I congratulate everyone for staying up so late and being so passionate on an issue about which they feel extraordinarily strongly.  If the debate had been held three or four years ago we might not have quite such a good attendance.</P>
      <P>Let us not have such a bogus argument.  There are two sides to this matter but we have not heard the argument in favour of putting lords mayor and councillors on the boards of universities &mdash; we have heard people preaching to their electorate.</P>

      <P>I am tempted to reply to some of what was said but I am sure there will be another occasion.  It would be a great pity if the debate were sidetracked into the merits and demerits of councillors, lords mayor, etc.  Senator Manning scored a point in saying that some members of universities were pig ignorant and perverse &mdash; that is perfectly fair.  My argument is that people should not be placed on boards simply by virtue of an accident of political office.  I am happy to leave it there because there is a danger that this important Bill may be diverted on this point until we all get so tired that later matters are not given sufficient debate.  I reserve my fire but if anyone wants my views on the historic, apostolic succession of lords mayor &mdash; especially in Dublin, of which I have personal experience &mdash; I am happy <Col N="195" /> to make this information available in private.  The Lords Mayor of Dublin have been a mixed bunch &mdash; some excellent but others pig ignorant and prejudiced, and I have the documentary evidence to demonstrate it.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  There is a distinction between the university and the college, as is understood by the Minister and her advisers. Trinity College does the teaching but the University of Dublin awards the degrees.

However, I ask them to consider the issue further so that we can consider whether the amendment should be made on Report Stage.

    <P>I have deleted the wrong line in this amendment. I had intended to delete the following line which reads &ldquo;or who, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of business or industry&rdquo;.  What is the distinction between those who are nominated <Col N="197" /> by organisations representative of business and those who, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of business?  Is it intended that if the organisations fail to make a nomination the Minister shall then make a nomination?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 68 is to give the governing authority a power which the Minister seems to have taken upon herself.  It addresses the subject of those who are nominated by organisations representative of business or industry.  I do not understand the point of the last part of subsection (9) which states &ldquo;or who, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of business or industry&rdquo;.  There does not seem to be an alternative &mdash; they are either organisations which are representative of industry or business or they are not.  I have puzzled over this subsection several times and I would like it explained to me.</P>
      <P>The amendment I have tabled seeks to substitute the &ldquo;governing authority&rdquo; for the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; because I do not see why the interpretation should be up to the Minister.  The interpretation of who represents business or industry can be extremely wide.  Business and industry is a very broad ship, whether large or small.  There is an obligation on the Minister to define what she means by business.  Wearing another hat, I often have a problem with how far the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; can be extended.  There seems to be a very wide definition of those who are involved in business.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister intend this to mean and how broad does she intend the parameters to be? If she is going to interpret this very widely, we ought to know that.  I would prefer to leave it up to the governing body to decide who is representative of business or industry rather than the Minister, which is consistent with what I have said about the rest of the Bill.  Will she give us a definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15(3)(a) already requires that one such person be representative of business.  If a university decides it will only have one such person, subsection (9) requires that one of the Minister's nominees will have to be representative of business.  Therefore, where a governing authority has one ministerial nominee and one wider community representative, both must be representative of business or industry.  It means there must be two of these representatives, and there are a number of ways in which this can come about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that representation from business on university governing authorities is desirable.  The present provision is in keeping with the recommendation of the Moriarty task force on the implementation of the Culliton report.  It gives practical recognition to interaction between universities and the business sector by ensuring the business sector has an input into the decision <Col N="198" /> making processes in the universities.  This subsection ensures that will be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying that.  However, why should it be in the opinion of the Minister that they are representative of business or industry rather than that of the governing authority?  That is what the amendment is about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because it is on the nomination of the Minister.  We do not agree on this but I believe, given the fact that the nomination comes from the Minister, that the governing authority having one ministerial nominee and one wider community representative will ensure business or industry is represented on the board.  This definition of the nominations is cognisant of the recommendations of the Moriarty task force and the Culliton report in its practical recognition of the interaction between the universities and the business sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be awkward but I have a difficulty every day with how wide that sphere extends.  That is very important because this clause will include or exclude certain types of people.  What exactly does the Minister mean by &ldquo;business&rdquo; in this context? How wide does it go?  Does it include professionals?  Would it include, for instance, teachers, people on school boards, barristers, architects and those in small and part-time business?  It is important that we know the meaning of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;.</P>

As an elected public representative I do not engage in business and do not, therefore, work with profit and loss accounts and financial matters.  I do not employ people; I represent them.  People would have no difficulty in excluding me from a definition of business activities, which involve commercial transactions.  If we accept the Moriarty task force report and note the partnerships with the business community that Trinity College has already established without statute provision, it is clear that the university, other Members of the House and I have no difficulty in reaching a common understanding of what is meant by those engaged in business.</P>

It is important that such a person would have the strong support of the governing authority and therefore I would not favour its deletion.</P>

I consider that the power of the governing authority to remove the chairperson should apply where it has appointed a chairperson other than the chief officer.  It is only fair that the governing authority can remove from office somebody it appointed.</P>
      <P>In excluding the chief officer from the removal power, my aim is to ensure that the Bill does not undermine the position of the chief officer in a university.  Removal from the office of chairperson would be such a serious step that it is unlikely that any governing authority could contemplate it unless it also proposed to remove the chief officer from office.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Minister feels strongly about this but I still fail to understand why a majority of two-thirds is necessary.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that this is done by a majority by removing the proviso of a two-thirds majority.  The purpose is to make it simpler and easier and not to lock the governing authority by a two-thirds provision.  It is dangerous to include it in legislation.  It is most unusual for such a clause to be included in legislation of this kind.  The Minister has not provided me with a satisfactory explanation for its inclusion.</P>

      <P>One would hope this would not be the case, but if the appointment as chairperson of somebody other than the chief officer arises it may be very divisive.  It is important that whoever takes the chair does so with a clear majority of the board.  Otherwise there would be a factionalised governing authority, which would be a potential poison within the institution of the university.</P>

      <P>The Minister appears to be giving preference under section 16 to the appointment of the chief officer as the chairperson of the board.  In any co-operative or business, the chief executive is answerable to the board.  That does not apply here.  It is vitally important the chief officer should be answerable where board membership is being extended.  In my county, there was a great deal of difference between the president and registrar.  If the registrar has a point to make and the president is chairman, would it be difficult for him or her to make a case in an impartial way and for the president to operate fairly in these matters?</P>

      <P>In page 17, subsection (2), line 42, after &ldquo;and &rdquo; to insert &ldquo;such other advertising, search and consultative procedures&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The appointment of a president or a chief officer is the single most important decision that at governing authority can take and it is desirable that the mechanisms be defined and developed as effectively as possible for that.  If a governing authority gets the decision right, a large part of the Bill will fall into place effectively as will university performance.  If it does not get this right, it will be an uphill battle in terms of getting the best possible candidate.  In the tradition of appointments we have not developed the most searching exploratory techniques for recruiting the widest range of candidates.  We have sometimes been fortunate with our presidents, but the procedures have partly meant that no college &mdash; National University or Trinity College &mdash; has ever appointed a president from outside.  In one case a former member of staff returned and proved a fine president.  In an era of growing internationalisation, where there are many talented Irish people abroad who might wish to return home, it is essential that the recruitment procedure be carefully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to ensure as far as possible that the legislation assists the governing authority in thinking along those lines.  For instance, the governing authority shall develop such interview and other procedures as in its opinion will best ensure participation.  The phrase &ldquo;in its opinion&rdquo; is loose. There should be a minimum requirement which the governing authority can then elaborate on and develop.  That is why I include search techniques, advertising and consultative procedures &mdash; for example, when to set the process the motion and how much should be allocated in advertisements.  There have been cases where potentially talented candidates abroad did not apply in time because the length of time for application in the advertisement was extremely short. That may change in the world of the Internet and so on, but I am trying to ensure the Bill gives as much guidance as possible while leaving details to local circumstances.  The intention behind this subsection is admirable, but it does not go far enough.  The public has a legitimate interest in <Col N="203" /> ensuring the mechanisms are as developed as possible.  I have no doubt the amendment can be improved, but this is its purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Lee's point.  There is no doubt that the spirit of what Professor Lee wants and the objective he seeks should be supported but this is too prescriptive and intrusive.  The experience of University College, Dublin, over the last number of presidencies is that there has been an evolution from when it was regarded as a closed competition for which only insiders needed to apply.  The NUI process was such that an outsider would not have been made feel very welcome, if not made to feel they were not entitled to apply.</P>
      <P>That has evolved considerably.  In the last presidential election in UCD, as I am sure is the case elsewhere, candidates addressed all sections of the university population and were invited to address the governing body before the position was taken; it was also very widely advertised.  This issue should be addressed by each university in light of the philosophy which now prevails on such matters.  That philosophy holds it axiomatic that every academic and senior administrative position is widely advertised and all procedures are open, structured and accountable.  Professor Lee would agree that this was not the case when he and I began our academic careers in what were rather closed and insulated institutions.  We are better off leaving this to the universities and their governing bodies.  They would now be sure that the proper procedures are adhered to in order that the best candidates are attracted.  It is a matter of judgment.  I do not disagree with what Professor Lee is trying to do, but this may be too prescriptive.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning must have stolen my speaking notes.  Flexible arrangements are provided in sections 24(4) and (5), which will allow universities and the Higher Education Authority to develop a framework.  We should not be too prescriptive as we will have governing bodies that will be different in composition and more outward looking than previously.  Given those circumstances, it is impossible for me to recommend acceptance of amendment Nos. 109 and 110, which relate to amendment No. 74.  The application is too wide and the matters the Senator wishes to raise are well provided for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of amendments No. 73 and 76 would be to affect the process of appointment of any member of staff from a gardener to a senior professor. That the whole employment spectrum would be affected was not grasped by the Senator and the proposal might be seen as an attack on institutional autonomy.  The procedures referred <Col N="204" /> to in subsection (2) could include advertising, search and consultative processes if the governing authorities so desired.  It was not suitable to put this in as a requirement.  If I had included this in the original Bill in the level of detail the Senator wanted, I would have been accused of being prescriptive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>That accusation would have been made but I would have been on the Minister's side.  I thank the Minister for answering on amendments Nos. 74, 109 and 110 and now I know what is ahead.</P>
      <P>There is agreement on the direction one wants to go, although I would not be quite as optimistic as Senator Manning.  It will probably work itself out, as the impulse is as widely and firmly based as one would want it to be.  Some of the responses I have had to this general principle suggest that there is still some resistance, which made me feel that there was more necessity for this than I had thought.</P>
      <P>When the Minister spoke of framework, that was a legitimate dimension to consider. Remuneration is one of the key factors in attracting high quality outside candidates.  I have no more idea how one determines what a first class university president is worth than how one determines how much a first class Secretary of a Government Department is worth.  If they do their jobs well, they will be worth more than we are likely to pay them, but what we offer must be given a lot of thought.  The development of that framework should not be left to the last minute. I cannot stress enough that the quality of people in that position is perhaps the single most significant variable in determining the overall performance of the university sector.  I may return on Report Stage with a refined version of these amendments.</P>

      <P>This may seem a pedantic change but there is a subtle distinction between &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and &ldquo;member&rdquo;.  The outside members of a governing authority are deemed to be members of the university but not employees.  Therefore, when one wants those in a university to think of outsiders as possible candidates, they should not be confined to those they happen to know, even if they are very good candidates.  I am prepared to withdraw this amendment, but it was an amendment to provoke people to look outwards rather than to settle for candidates they knew.</P>

In fact, a number are doing good work and I am happy to say that my university, University College Cork, is doing very good work.  Where the Bill refers in section 17(6) to &ldquo;economically or socially disadvantaged people and ... people from sections of society significantly under-represented&rdquo;, we should make provision for the physically disadvantaged specifically and the generationally disadvantaged &mdash; I am not sure if I coined that phrase.  I am thinking of adult education and of those who did not have a chance to attend university who might be in a position to benefit from it.

      <P>In page 18, subsection (6), between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) to promote good relations between people of all religions on the island of Ireland.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am puzzled by subsection (6) and I do not know from where these three aspirations came.  While I have no rooted objection to the principles involved in them, I can think of other ones which are equally worthy.  The Minister obviously has a great attachment to the use of the Irish language, the attainment of gender balance and the promotion of the economic, cultural and social development of the State, whatever that means. While I think it is possible to support the insertion of these type of aspirations in a Bill of this sort, I do not see why it has been so selective. This addition would be a very important one.  If we accept the aspirational nature of this Bill concerning the performance and functions of a university, it would be appropriate if we accepted that one of the most important objectives of all institutions &mdash; but especially educational ones &mdash; on this island is to tackle a problem which is far greater than those identified by subsections (a), (b) and (c).  That is the sectarianism in the people of this island and the promotion of non-sectarianism, pluralism and means whereby different denominations can live together.</P>
      <P>One of the great attractions some years ago of Trinity College &mdash; I do not say this in an exclusive way, but because it is something I experienced myself &mdash; was the absolutely free exchange of ideas between Nationalists and Unionists.  I regret that has died to a large extent.  About 25 to 30 years ago a large number of Unionists and Nationalists was represented in Dublin University &mdash; probably more Protestants than Catholics, but I do not know.  There were healthy debates at the time in which a fair balance of Nationalist and Unionist opinion was exchanged.  That was very healthy and it was one of the few places in Ireland where that happened.  There was a great deal of banter and fierce debate, but it was an exchange of views in a friendly non-combative and non-hostile atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the university gave places to people from all over Ireland it provided at the time an almost unique forum for the promotion of good relations between people of all religions.  That is <Col N="209" /> now lost &mdash; the Unionists no longer come down here, although some Nationalists do &mdash; for reasons which I will not go into because they are complicated and there are several of them.  It is not the fault of any particular section of the community or of any Government or party.</P>
    <P>If we put in these type of functions &mdash; and the Minister will be aware of my reservations about putting anything like this in the legislation, but I accept the inevitability of them being there now &mdash; they are more important than the promotion of the Irish language, gender balance or the third one, which is fairly meaningless.  In the very difficult situation of the last 25 years, universities have been among the few institutions that could provide a forum for good relations between people of different religions.</P>

      <P>I am slightly concerned by the appointment of a judge as a visitor and I would not like this to go by without comment.  We tend to assume that judges are people who, for some reason, are a cut above the rest of us and that automatically, therefore, they should be accepted as visitors to universities &ldquo;after consultation with the President of the High Court&rdquo;.  I do not necessarily believe judges are the most suitable people to be visitors to universities.  Judges are no better, worse or any different from anyone else.</P>
      <P>Judges of the High Court are political appointees.  They have been appointed by Governments or by Ministers and many of them have declared political allegiances.  We tend to accept that judges are people of some sort of impeccable integrity, which may be true, but they all have opinions, including political opinions, and many have been appointed by Ministers in the past.  I have never understood why judges are not subject to the disclosure of interests.  I would have thought that they, before politicians, should be subject to the Declaration of Interests Bill because they are making judgments on things which affect people's lives.  They have far more power than politicians but they have never been subject to that Bill.  There is an absolute assumption that a judge of the High Court will be appointed and will automatically be the right type of person.  I am not so sure about that.  I remain to be convinced that it is better for a judge of the High Court to be appointed by the Government than it is for the university to appoint someone themselves.  I do not see anything wrong with the university making the appointment of a High Court judge as a visitor rather than the Government, which may have appointed the High Court judge to the Bench as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The experience in the University of Dublin, which has the power to appoint its own visitors, is that on a number of occasions judges have been used and they have been found to be very good.  There is an argument that there should be a degree of prejudice in the direction of the Judiciary in relation to the number of points they must preside over or the examination of issues with a strong legal flavour and context. I would not rule out judges in the same way that I did not seek to rule out mayors of Cork or Limerick or members of county councils, but they should not be appointed automatically.</P>
      <P>I do not have as much difficulty as my colleague, Senator Ross, with the appointment of judges because a certain degree of judgment and legal knowledge can help.  However, I am not sure it should automatically be a judge, which is certainly not the case in Trinity College.  On the other hand, this Bill deals with the other universities. It is not my patch to direct other universities on how to manage their affairs.  If they are happy with this arrangement, I do not have any committed objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what Senator Ross said, that judges are sometimes political appointments and that <Col N="211" /> judgments are made in a political context. Although it is unlikely to have a drastic effect on the situation, I am glad the situation in Trinity College has been left intact.  It has been seen to work well and it is interesting to note that the university appointed judges.  I cite Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore, who is a most distinguished and learned judge and who operated so efficiently there was never a scandal.  He was brought in on a number of occasions and he adjudicated and resolved problems.  That is the type of function one wants a visitor to carry out.  A former Member of the other House, Mr. Justice Henry Barron, is one of the present visitors, while the other is the Chancellor, Mr. Frank O'Reilly.  He has no judicial training, as far as I know, but he is also equally valuable.</P>

      <P>The role of visitor is one with a long tradition in our university institutions. The status of the visitor was considered in detail by the select committee and I consulted with the President of the High Court. The NUI colleges want the visitor to be a judge of the High Court or a retired judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court.  They probably decided on this as a result of the experience of Trinity College and the nature of the appointments made by the Government.  One visitor is the Chancellor and the other is appointed by the Government from senate nominees.  Having consulted widely and agreed that the status of the visitor is important, I did not have any difficulty acceding to the request from the other universities that the visitor should be a judge of the High Court or a retired judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment NO. 84:</P>
      <P>In page 18, lines 32 to 40, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Where the Board of Visitors is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for contending that the functions of a university are being performed in a manner which <i>prima facie</i> constitute a breach of the laws, statutes or ordinances applicable to the university, it shall so advise the Minister, and the Minister may, after first advising the governing <Col N="212" /> authority of his/her opinion and considering any explanation given in response, and with the concurrence of the Government, request the Board of Visitors to the university to enquire into the matter giving rise to its opinion.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section is one of the most contentious in the Bill.  I want to make the visitor the buffer between the Minister and the various powers the Minister could activate by a complex process of activation. Instead of stating that &ldquo;the Minister is of the opinion&rdquo;, the subsection should state that &ldquo;the Board of Visitors is of the opinion&rdquo;.  It was intended to buffer the Minister against the university, to buffer the university against the Minister and to ensure there was a degree of acceptance in the institution of an unprecedented power and what was seen as an intrusion by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who oppose the section, because the Minister must have certain rights, but the mechanism by which they are controlled is important.  A worst case scenario under section 19 would be a mutiny in a university against the appointment of an outside governing authority for one year.  If such a situation arose it would be important that the basic opinion in the university would appreciate the reasons for what had happened, however much it might dislike what had happened, and would continue to give good and loyal service and to carry on the work of the university. Otherwise, the work of a university could ground to a halt if someone was sent in, which would be the direct opposite of what was intended.  I am not sure we have taken on board the reaction of the teaching body and the university community in general to such decisions.  We seem to have assumed they will be mutely accepted.  A potentially dangerous situation could arise if the full thrust of section 19 is implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 90:</P>
      <P>In page 19, lines 6 to 12, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Where the Board of Visitors reports that the functions of a university or its governing authority are being performed in a manner which constitutes a breach of the laws, statutes or ordinances of or applicable to the university, the Minister shall so inform the chief officer and ensure that the chief officer receives in person a copy of the report of the Board of Visitors.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe I anticipated myself before the sos when referring to this section.  The Minister will be more than familiar with its intricacies.</P>
      <P>The impetus behind amendment No. 90 is based on the existence of the standing buffer &mdash; be it a board of visitors or some other body &mdash; which would perform the functions required to implement a decision, if one were taken, to suspend a governing authority.  The Minister will be aware of a view abroad, with which I concur, that the eventuality of something of this nature happening appears so remote that the inclusion of one and a half pages of text in the Bill to deal with it seems unnecessary.  If anything of this type occurs it should be dealt with by means of extraordinary parliamentary response.  By virtue of the section's inclusion in the Bill there are those who believe a certain type of Minister might be tempted to consider the potential of implementing it or tightening its provisions to conduct inquiries of various sorts.  I accept it is tightly drafted in terms of obliging a Minister to follow closely a particular procedure.</P>
      <P>That said, under section 20, as matters stand a governing authority may be suspended and the members may have their membership terminated. While I do not share Senator Ross's full suspicion of the likely behaviour patterns of judges or visitors, I find it difficult if we project forward and consider the situation envisaged in the Bill whereby the Minister would take the initiative, call in a visitor to see if his or her suspicions are justified and, if they are, a procedure would follow. It is difficult to envisage in terms of political realities that a Minister is likely to appoint a visitor who will come up with the wrong answer.  It would be extraordinary if a visitor reported back to a Minister, in the public arena, that he or she was wrong, that is to say, that the problems which the Minister thought existed did not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the fact that a visitor is appointed &mdash; on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as I understand it &mdash; appears to provide safeguards, it can leave the anxieties of those who are fearful of an extreme use of ministerial power unassuaged.  It is undesirable for unnecessary tensions to arise if they are avoidable. An initiative which comes from a standing body, which I call a board of visitors in my <Col N="214" /> amendment, would make the process more acceptable to the public and to the institution.</P>
    <P>If the visitor found that a governing authority was in dereliction of its duty yet a group on the governing body strongly opposed the behaviour that was found to be unacceptable, it would also be suspended.  As it stands, the whole governing body would be suspended and the membership of its members terminated.  The governing body may be suspended for up to a year and the visitor can, after consulting the Minister, appoint such a person or body of persons to perform its functions. This process is to take place apparently while the remainder of the university continues its usual activities as if in a vacuum or as if nothing had changed.  Events such as these would throw an institution into turmoil.  Even if the Minister's suspicions were justified, the operational efficiency of an exercise of this sort seems difficult to assume.</P>
    <P>My amendments propose that the nominees of the board of visitors shall try to reinstitute the governing authority as rapidly as possible, certainly not taking longer than a year to do so, and that whatever measures it takes in the meantime shall be taken in consultation with the academic council.  Thus, the people who are active in the university will feel they have a stake in the process and that events are not taking place over their heads, which is how I understand the mechanism as it is outlined in the section.</P>
    <P>I also propose that instead of a new commission being established at the end of the year to appoint a new governing authority, on a different composition perhaps, the board of visitors should perform the function of getting the governing authority re-elected, rather than assuming that one had to compose it differently as if it was the composition of the governing body which was responsible for the dereliction of responsibilities. As the commission stands it would include the president and the registrar who may well be discredited by the suspension of the governing body. I find it difficult to see how that could happen, but as I understand the section that could arise.</P>
    <P>The assumptions about what would happen if one got to the stage of having to appoint somebody in these circumstances are a dog's dinner, so to speak.  One could end up in a worse situation.  I do not think the process in the section would proceed along the smooth administrative lines envisaged. As the events are unlikely to happen, why do sections 19 and 20 go into such elaborate detail on the steps to be taken?  However improbable we think it might be, we would be remiss in our responsibility if we did not try to discuss what might happen.</P>

      <P>I understand Senator Lee's arguments but I am happy with the checks and balances in the section.  For example, the Minister would not act on his or her own but with the concurrence of and through the Government.  If a Minister attempted to act in a manner which was considered suspicious the Government would <Col N="215" /> have to examine the situation and make a decision.  That decision would be governmental, not ministerial.  Given the provisions of sections 19 and 20, a Minister would not be able to act without good reason.  The circumstances which the Senator imagines might arise cannot arise given the terms of the sections.</P>

      <P>I agree with some of the points raised by Senator Lee.  I am concerned that the dismissal would be dealt with in depth.  The chief officer should deal with it in such as way that everyone would be aware of the reasons for the suspension of the governing body.  It would be a very serious step to take and perhaps the Minister would explain exactly what would be involved.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2)(b) of Senator Lee's amendment No. 91 states that &ldquo;... the governing authority as a whole, or certain members, should be dismissed&rdquo;.  Last year the House dealt with legislation concerning a fisheries board which made similar provisions.  A manager was appointed in that case but it only involved the dismissal of a member rather than the whole board.  I support Senator Lee's amendment that perhaps a provision should be included for certain members.  The whole board would not always be involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 20 provides for the suspension of the governing authority in an extraordinary situation.  It is necessary that the Government and the Oireachtas have the power to ensure in cases of serious breakdown in the operation of a university that direct action can be taken in the interests of the students, staff and wider community.  The safeguards in the legislation as regards the Minister, Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas are significant.  The Minister must be of the view, after receiving the report of the visitor, that the functions of the university are performed in a manner which constitute a breach of the laws, statutes or ordinance applicable to the university and must consider any views of the governing authority and the chief officer on this opinion.</P>
      <P>We have already had a robust discussion about the need to have someone from the Judiciary represented and Senator Lee drifted into section 20 on this.  The visitor would come to the Minister with a certain status.  The visitor must agree with the Minister that the governing authority should be suspended.  The Minister would then make a recommendation to the Government.  If the Government agrees, it may, by order and with the consent of both Houses, suspend the membership. There is great protection here.  Following consultation with the Minister, the visitor will appoint a person or body of persons to perform the functions of a governing authority in the period before a new authority is appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are safeguards which address reasonable concerns and provide a balanced set of provisions <Col N="216" /> which will enable a Government to take a step it may have to.  Given the three stages I outlined, I cannot support the deletion of the provision as proposed by Senators Ormonde, Norris and Ross. However, I believe their concerns are met in the buffers which exist.</P>
    <P>I have examined the set of amendments proposed by Senator Lee.  The revised subsections (1) and (2) which the Senator drafted do not differ from the subsection in the Bill.  We are meeting the concerns his amendments set out to address in the Bill.  Senator Dardis's amendment No. 92 which specifies that suspensions should only apply to individual members is related to Senator Lee's amendment No. 93.  I do not support this proposal.  That function should be exercised by the governing authority, which returns to a question raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  This is provided for and I refer the Senator to section 3(1) of the Third Schedule which allows the governing authority to suspend a member.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 94, 95 and 96, proposed by Senator Lee would result in a number of changes to the Bill.  He proposes that the visitor must consult the academic council.  This is worthwhile but I also favour the provision that the visitor would consult the Minister.  I agree that a new governing authority should be put in place as soon as practicable. A cooling off period would be required so it is important to include a time limit.  Otherwise a Minister could suspend <i>ad infinitum</i> for their own reasons.  Senator Lee proposes that the visitor will have the functions of the commission in arranging for setting up the next governing authority. I do not think this is a sufficient buffer.  The visitor will have a major role in the initial visitation and in supporting the suspension of the governing authority.</P>
    <P>I would prefer the commission mechanism to be used in setting up a new governing authority in the same manner as the first one appointed under the Bill.  I will put down some amendments on Report Stage for the reconstitution of the governing authority as soon as practicable and for consultation with the academic council.  I accept there is a need to consult it on the composition of the interim authority.  There will be a limit of a year but there is no reason it could not happen before that is reached.  I am satisfied that in an extraordinary situation, which is difficult to envisage, the Government or the Minister would not be heavy-handed.  We have respect for the experience of the Judiciary and the visitor must concur with the Minister.  There are three stages before anything happens.  I will return to certain matters on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be reasonably brief and I hope not tedious.  It is ludicrous to envisage this situation occuring.  It has never arisen in the past. If we are discussing hypothetical situations we should also consider reconstituting a university after it is hit by an asteroid, which is on the same level of probability.  With the improvements which will possibly result from this Bill &mdash; the <Col N="217" /> democratisation of the university structures, the degree of additional accountability and monitoring, it is absurd to contemplate a situation where the board will act so far outside their own statutes and in defiance of the law that the Minister will have the power to abolish it.</P>
      <P>I oppose this section but recognise that at this stage of the night and the number of amendments involved I will got get anywhere.  I will not waste the time of the House.  I would like to get Committee Stage finished.  I am prepared to stay here until four, five, six or seven o'clock in the morning. I do not care because it is important we live up to our responsibilities.  It would be an awful pity if this Bill lapsed because we were not prepared to stick it out.  There is a particular responsibility on people like myself who have spoken at length to stay here until the job is completed. I am prepared to do that.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to ask the Minister about the question of visitors in Trinity.  I asked whether it was &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; or &ldquo;visitors&rdquo; and the Minister said the existing situation remained intact.  Should I assume that the method of appointment of the visitors by Trinity remains as it was previously?</P>

These provisions should apply to every educational institution from the most humble primary school to the most senior third level institution.  It is crucial that there are constraints on the Minister's power although she does retain power.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 106:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (1), line 21 to delete paragraph (c).</P>
      <P>I wondered about the point of putting guidelines in this section if they do not have to be observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> What is the purpose of retaining this paragraph? In relation to amendment No. 156.  I do not clearly understand the phrase &ldquo;An tÚaras may, following consultation with all or any of the chief officers&rdquo; as used in section 48(1).  Does this refer to examining a particular institution with other chief officers being asked for their opinions?  I presume this is not the case.  However, the construction makes it unclear.</P>
    <P>I tabled amendment No. 158 because it would be a useful pedagogic exercise for An tÚdaras to publicly explain why it reaches a particular decision and the response of the university.  There is too little open and frank debate between institutions with different ideas on how universities ought to be run.  My amendment urges the desirability of open debate on principles of university management and perceptions of their role in society.  This type of debate is infrequent.</P>
    <P>The formulation used in the Minister's introductory speech on Second Stage was that An tÚdaras would be an omniscient umbrella over the universities which would alert them to best practice at home and abroad.  This role seems unlikely to coincide with reality.  I expect universities will undertake much of this work themselves to stand their ground and debate their position not simply on the basis of provincialism but participate in an enlightening debate on wider issues.  This is the principle behind the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 48(1) speaks of universities departing from guidelines.  This is deviant but it is not in contravention of any regulation &mdash; it is merely a deviation.  Therefore, it is deviant behaviour but not sinful.  Maybe this is an old fashioned formulation.  I do not know if sin exists today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of amendment No. 158 because of the elegance of its phrasing.  The nice distinction, in the 18th century sense, observed by the learned profesor between deviant and peccant is one that recommends itself to me as somebody who is deviant but rejects the notion of being peccant.  This amendment must be accepted for the sake of the Bill's eloquence and style.  I have no doubt that the attractive language will overwhelm the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>Section 48 covers guidelines which may be issued in relation to the numbers or grades of employees of a university or the proportion of a universities budget to be applied to <Col N="222" /> different activities.  The guidelines come within the support and developmental role of the Higher Education Authority which is also provided for in section 47 and outlined in more detail in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>While the guidelines are non-binding, they will provide the Higher Education Authority and the universities with a formal opportunity for dialogue on important issues relating to management. They will also allow, in a formal and statutory manner, the dissemination of best practice nationally and internationally.  While they are not mandatory, universities will have to have regard to such guidelines when deciding appointments by statute and may be challenged if it is felt they did not pay regard to them.  The dissemination of good practice should not be limited and guidelines should be universal.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 158 was seen as intriguing. The Bill as published contained a number of provisions regarding the publication of views should a dispute arise.  I agree that the provisions were not drafted with the eloquence of Senator Lee's amendment, but the Dáil considered it inappropriate to set out such a process and I consider the decision of that House most appropriate.  I do not recommend acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sceptical at the ability of any institution to determine with certainty what constitutes best practice nationally and internationally. There is great diversity among universities and it is extremely difficult to point to one institution of comparable type and prescribe that model for another institution.  Acquiring the necessary degree of knowledge regarding the functioning of potentially model institutions and understanding their use of resources is challenging. It would require a detailed study of best practice, not simply anecdotal evidence.  I do not know if we have the necessary research expertise. The model used by the Minister is one which might give a spurious impression of providing a marker against which the performance of Trinity College, UCD or DCU &mdash; very different institutions &mdash; can be measured.  I hope there is no self-delusion about the possibility of conducting this type of exercise in an infallible manner.  If we are to do this properly we need to invest significantly more resources.  Identifying the best model for a particular institution, if not done properly, could be a dangerous exercise.</P>
      <P>There is need for an informed debate to which AntÚdaras and individual institutions could contribute. We would all gain from this. Leaving aside the gracious tributes to the language of the amendments, they raise serious, substantive points regarding the manner in which the performance of individual universities and the university system can be improved, namely, how and what we can learn and how we can most effectively apply what is learned.</P>

      <P>The position under the Bill is that the rights and entitlements of current employees are retained.  If the governing bodies of Dublin City University or the University of Limerick wish to dismiss a member of staff, they require the consent of the Minister.  Employees will continue to have that protection.  Following the passage of the Bill, universities, as part of the autonomy conferred on them by the legislation, will have full control over their staff, subject to the position in the University of Limerick and Dublin City University.</P>
      <P>A Minister should not have any role in the appointment or dismissal of members of staff of a university.  It is important that universities are autonomous.  Older universities have enjoyed autonomy since their foundation and the newest university, the NUI in Maynooth, will now also enjoy that position.  It would not be in the interest of the universities concerned or their staffs if they were singled out in this manner.  Staff, through their unions and associations, will have a central role in the procedures for removal from office, and the fears which may have prompted the amendment will prove to be groundless.  The rights and entitlements of current employees of Dublin City University and the University of Limerick are protected.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 131:</P>
      <P>In page 27, subsection (1), line 4, after &ldquo;university&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;having regard to the resources available to the university,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with planning and evaluation.  Section 32(1) states: &ldquo;A governing authority shall, as soon as practicable... require the chief officer to prepare a plan&rdquo;.  I am puzzled that the requirement imposed on the chief officer is to prepare a plan setting out aims, etc., but when the governing authority assesses the plan it must have &ldquo;regard to the resources available to the university&rdquo;.  This implies that the planning could be done in an abstract way without regard to resources, but the evaluation of the plan will take the resources into account.  I may be told that the plan must by definition have regard to resources, but as the provision stands the explicit injunction to have regard to the resources available to the university only applies at the evaluation stage.  How does the Minister envisage the planning process if the resources constraint is not incorporated in the plan from the outset?</P>

      <P>The chief officer must always act subject to the policy of the governing authority and shall be answerable to the authority. When he starts to draw up the plan he is doing so on behalf of the authority &mdash; paragraph 2 of the Fourth Schedule provides for this.  Section 17(1) provides that the functions of the governing authority shall be within the constraints of the overall budget of the university.  I bow to the Senator's experience, because I have not been on a governing authority, but I have been on boards which have drawn up a wish list but found that what was recommended was impossible to do within the constraints of the budget.  I do not think we need this amendment.  It is clear that a university must act within its budget.  Section 32(2) merely requires that a strategic development plan must have regard to the resources available to the university.  It is not necessary to repeat that in the provision concerning the chief officer.  We must accept and not even question that the chief officer would look at all the potential resources of the university in drawing up a plan and would do so on behalf of the governing authority.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 133:</P>
      <P>In page 27, subsection (1), line 17, after &ldquo;procedures&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;having regard to the resources available&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 33 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>A governing authority ... shall... require the chief officer to establish procedures for quality assurance aimed at improving the quality of education...</P>
      <P>The biggest, although not the only constraint, on universities doing these things is resources, as it is with most other institutions.  Resources can be misused, but if one does not have them in the first place one cannot misuse them.  Particularly where assessment, publication of assessment, etc., are involved, there is potential for misleading impressions to be conveyed to the public if evaluations are carried out without explicit reference to the resources available.  If the resources available had been taken into account, one might see that a good job was being done.  This is different to my earlier amendments concerning the chief officer.</P>
      <P>The Education Bill contains a similar provision. It mentions that inspectors will carry out reviews of schools and individual teachers, and there is a later reference to the resources available.  No evaluation ought to take place without explicit reference to the resources available to those being evaluated to discharge their responsibilities. Every evaluation should be made in the context of the available resources.  That is why I am puzzled by the disjunction between evaluation on one hand and the later evaluation of the evaluations on the other, taking resources into account only at that stage.</P>

      <P>I do not see why the Bill should state that the procedures the chief officer would draw up for quality assurance would have to have regard to resources.  The procedures themselves would, <i>inter alia,</i> relate to the manner of evaluations and the assessment by students.  I do not think it is necessary to include that here.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 134 would result in the evaluation of faculties only as appropriate, to which I would not object.  Therefore, I will look further at that to find the correct language to use.  I do not consider amendment No. 135 necessary.  Those who would have to evaluate quality would have to be able to evaluate quality having regard to resources.</P>
      <P>I do not think amendment No. 136 is necessary as it could not be expected that those availing of the services would be given information in advance of the exact resources.  We could put in place here a recipe for extremely useless management of the time of university staff who would then have to provide the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 137 is very interesting. However, I remind the Senator that under the Bill universities now have a free hand in the internal allocation of resources.  Therefore, in the <Col N="230" /> identification of further resources which might be needed for the implementation of findings it would be appropriate that the governing authority would seek to find the resources, in addition to further resources from the HEA, if appropriate.</P>
    <P>There may be cost factors associated with implementing the procedures.  I consider the section deals with this.  The governing authority is required to implement the findings of the procedures only when they are reasonable and practical, and to have regard to available resources in so doing.  I have already signalled that I intend to table an amendment to subsection (2) on Report Stage to replace the plural word &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; in line 29 with &ldquo;provision&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This issue may seem remote but it is in the Bill. What happens if a university goes in a primarily private direction?  As the section stands, it seems to suggest a fairly abrupt and not very cordial divorce. I am trying to suggest a mechanism for a more cordial or orderly disengagement or continuing the relationship in a more distant way.  I do not know if it is worthwhile pursuing this but the question may arise if a university ceases to be funded substantially &mdash; which, I presume, means more than half &mdash; from public moneys.  That could happen, so I need clarification on it.</P>

      <P>Where the land and buildings, or their development or refurbishment, have been funded from public moneys it is appropriate that any such moneys would be refunded in the event of a sale or transfer to a private body.  The section ensures this will be the case, subject to agreement between the Minister and the governing authority, where the moneys were provided after the date of the passing of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a provision for arbitration where disengagement may occur too abruptly and where agreement cannot be reached.  This will allow time for both sides to be heard.  If the university were to decide to seek funds otherwise, there would be a large number of issues involved, not least the protection of the interest of the students and the public interest generally.  The section should not attempt to set out how universities should relate to the State if they cease to receive State funding, rather it enshrines the right of the State to have some of its investment returned.</P>
      <P>The detailed issues of the protection of the interest of the students and the public interest generally may well be a matter for future legislation, should the need arise.

      <P>I move amendment No. 147:</P>
      <P>In page 32, line 38, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>This section amends sections of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, for obvious reasons.  However, section 44, paragraph (b) proposes to delete section 3(2) and (3), while paragraph (d) proposes to delete part of section 7(4) of the 1908 Act.</P>
      <P>Section 3(1) of the 1908 Act, which is to be retained, states:</P>
      <P>No test whatever of religious belief shall be imposed on any person as a condition of his becoming or continuing to be a professor, lecturer, fellow,... in, either of the two universities, or any constituent college;...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> Section 3(2), which it is proposed to delete, states:</P>
    <P>Every professor upon entering into office shall sign a declaration in a form approved by the Commissioners jointly under this Act, securing the respectful treatment of the religious opinions of any of his class.</P>
    <P>I discussed the issue of religious opinion and ethos in this House over the past two to three months.  While I do not accord a great value to consistency, in everything I have attempted in this area I have attempted to value and respect the ethos of beliefs.  It may be argued that this provision has fallen into misuse; nobody wants to compel people to sign forms.  It should be the professional responsibility of any teacher at any level to respect ethos, which I argued when we debated section 37 of the Employment Equality Bill.</P>
    <P>However, in this instance it is proposed to delete a subsection and not replace it with anything. There can be no justification for that.  The House would accept that teachers should be respectful of the religious opinions of members of their class.  It may not be necessary to say it, but it has been provided for by this subsection and it should have been retained.</P>
    <P>Section 3(3) of the 1908 Act states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall apply to any professor of or lecturer in theology or divinity; provided that no test of religious belief shall be imposed by the governing body of either of the two universities... on any such professor or lecturer as a condition of his appointment or recognition by the governing body...</P>
    <P>I recognise that this is a different aspect but the fact that there was not a religious test since 1908, while now allowing for the inclusion of such a test, raises issues which the Minister must explain.</P>
    <P>Section 44(d) provides for a change to section 7(4) of the 1908 Act, which states:</P>
    <P>Any sums paid under this section shall be applied by the governing body of the university or college, as the case may be, in accordance with their charter or statutes, but no such sum shall be applied for the provision or maintenance of any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance,...</P>
    <P>This is being retained because the Constitution prohibits the State from endowing any religion. However, it is proposed to delete that part of the subsection which provides that money could not be allowed&ldquo;... for the provision or maintenance of any... theological or religious teaching or study&rdquo;.  This will allow for the use of taxpayer's money in this area.</P>
    <P>The subsequent paragraph to the subsection states:</P>
    <P>Provided that nothing in this provision shall prevent the recognition by the governing body of the university of any professor of or lecturer in theology or divinity as a professor of the university so long as the professorship is founded and maintained entirely by means of private <Col N="235" /> benefaction, [hitherto, the State could not support the establishment of professorships of theology or divinity; it had to be supported by private benefaction] or the use of any building belonging to the university or college for any teaching given by such professor, or for any other religious teaching no part of the cost of which is defrayed out of public funds.  But no student shall be compelled to attend any such theological teaching, or religious instruction,...</P>
    <P>Why is it proposed to delete this?  It is a very complicated section and I do not know the reasoning behind it.  Why was it considered necessary to proceed in this way?  Does it now mean that the State is signalling that professors do not need to be respectful of the religious opinions of their students?  Does it mean that taxpayers' money can now be used for matters to do with religion, which are specifically excluded under the 1908 Act?  Is this the proper way to proceed?</P>

      <P>I am concerned if Senator O'Toole is correct.  I am sure that it is the intention of the Minister and her advisers that religious difference will be respected.  Trinity College used to inquire about the religious denomination of undergraduates on registration.  I am glad that, as far as I am aware, the practice has ceased.  Although I believe in the complete separation of Church and State and so on, I would be sorry if a difficulty was caused, for example, in architectural terms with the preservation of the chapel in Trinity College, particularly since it is now fully denominational and ecumencial and is available for use to different Christian denominations.  It would be a pity if there was an alteration which prevented Trinity using its resources to maintain the fabric of that building appropriately and properly.  I assume some of the difficulty comes about because there are differences between the ways in which the Royal University and Trinity were established.</P>
      <P>There is a faculty of theology in Trinity but it is not denominational.  It is no longer a school of divinity and there is no longer a Regius professor of divinity.  There is a distinguished professor of theology who is a former Roman Catholic priest, which is to be welcomed.  I would like to think it were possible to have a properly constituted faculty of theology, although it would be inappropriate in modern university terms to have a department funded by the State simply being used for the preparations of ordinants for one particular sect.</P>

      <P>The NUI accepted this amendment.  There will not be any difference in the conditions applying to the employment of staff between the constituent colleges and the other universities.  The Employment Equality <Col N="236" /> Bill, 1996, and the Equal Status Bill, 1997, will ensure respectful treatment of staff and students in equality of employment.  It could be argued that the reference to religious opinions reflected a certain preoccupation at the time with the passage of this Bill.  A modern statement of these issues would involve a much wider equality policy, as is covered in section 34 of the Bill and in the other Bills.  With the passage of the Bill, professors will no longer be centrally appointed by the senate of the NUI, but by individual colleges. Therefore, a central role for the NUI would be inconsistent.  One of the core principles underlying the introduction of the legislation was to update it according to the wishes of the NUI, which I took on board.  I will consult further on that section.</P>
      <P>I prefer to pursue the rationale with regard to the second section.  The NUI also requested this amendment.  This is not being included without its knowledge.  There will be no difference in the conditions applying to the teaching of religion and theology between the constituent universities and other universities.  In Trinity, theology and religion can be taught, but they cannot under the NUI proposals.  The Constitution provides that the State cannot endow religion, but this does not mean that religion cannot be taught in universities. Even if it were unconstitutional for the State to fund the teaching of religion, the removal of a legislative bar from such funding would not be unconstitutional; the funding would be.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, will provide comprehensive and modern anti-discrimination provisions.  The amendments were proposed by the NUI to level the playing pitch so that there would be no difference in the conditions applying to the employment of staff and the teaching of religion and theology between the constituent universities and other universities.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the question of constitutionality in terms of the funding of professorships of divinity and so forth.  Does the faculty of theology in Trinity come under that heading and cannot be funded by moneys which are at least derived in part from the State and have to be taken from the college's endowments? I am happy with the principle of separation of Church and State as it is not appropriate that the State should be expected to fund the teaching and promotion of one sectarian point of view, but at the same time it would be regrettable if the practice of the teaching of theology in a university such as Trinity were adversely affected by a lack of funds.</P>

      <P>That is a reasonable explanation of the first two sections of the Equal Status Bill, 1997.  If I were a professor I would find it offensive to be asked to sign a document to say I would respect the ethos and beliefs of the people attending lectures.  If we are removing a section from the 1908 Act and if that issue will be dealt <Col N="237" /> with in the Equal Status Bill, I will be much happier. Teachers at any level have a professional responsibility to be respectful of religious beliefs. I was worried that this was being taken out, and it seemed to be sending out the wrong signal.</P>
      <P>I am not clear on amendment No. 148.  There are complications involved.  A private subvention was required for the establishment of the chair for Professor O'Doherty in UCD.  My union was involved.  I do not understand what is the impact of removing that section.  Nobody will argue against providing a level playing pitch.  Is there a danger that colleges will be required to spend money they do not have to match Trinity?  What are the consequences of this proposal?  No student should be compelled to attend any such theological teaching.  I presume the reason that is being removed is that it would not arise.  Some professorships of the type referred to, which until now had to be maintained by private benefaction, will be paid out of public moneys.  That is a significant change.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 148 is easy to understand.  The 1908 legislation prohibits the teaching of religion and it applies to the NUI.  The prohibition on the teaching of religion will be gone.  We have long looked to Trinity College for the teaching of theology at university level and now it will be available in the constituent colleges of the NUI.  I will have to come back and clarify the matter of funding, but this section relates to the teaching of theology.  The example given was of Trinity College.</P>

They research everything else but do remarkably little research on the university in society or the economy.  We have fine Departments of Education but they are concerned with earlier stages of the educational stage.  A role for the senate in fostering research would be useful, but if it does not see itself in that role, perhaps that should not be wished upon it.

The way universities have neglected research into universities verges on the scandalous. Universities are major institutions in society which, were they anything other than universities, we would expect universities to be researching and they do not research themselves.

      <P>Having formally moved the amendment on behalf of Senator Henry, I join with other Members in the general feeling of support from both the Government and Opposition sides of the House.  The principle is a question of freedom of expression.  I can envisage a number of instances, although nobody could quarrel with the phrase &ldquo;in the best interests of the university&rdquo;. That is fair enough, but why should there be a complete chorus of unanimity?  Why should a dissenting voice not be raised?  Why should special interests of some kind not be expressed which are valid, worthy, and although a special interest, may be in the long-term in the best interests of the university?</P>
      <P>The general ethos of the Bill will be strengthened by accepting the principle of the right to freedom of expression even of a minority or dissenting viewpoint.  Everyone would accept that the best interests of the university should be served but it may be acting in the best interests of the university to express a dissenting voice.

      <P>This issue was first raised by Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Kelly.  Senator Lee proposed the amendment which addressed the same concerns.  It was never the intention of the Bill to muzzle anybody.  The idea of democratising the governing authorities was to draw in people with a variety of experience and backgrounds, be they lords mayor or whatever.  The Bill seeks to avoid the position that any member, having expressed his or her views, might then act on behalf of special interests at the expense of the vested interests of the university.</P>
      <P>I have served on a limited number of boards where normal procedures provide for confidentiality concerning discussions.  However, there is no muzzle on people expressing views.  The normal representation role exists.  I want to strike a balance and I have said I will look at the issue on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The second part of Senator Lee's amendment No. 166 states that &ldquo;all members of the governing authority shall have equal rights of participation on all issues at all meetings of the governing authority&rdquo;. I would have thought that this would necessarily be the case but if there is a genuine concern that it is not the case we will come back to it also.  Freedom of expression is provided for and normal procedures of confidentiality apply to all members, not just students.  They would have to be reasonable and would have to be adopted.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a point concerning capitation and the dispersment of moneys by the central college authorities, involving the recognition of a student society.  It may be that a student society would be unpopular with either the conservative or liberal wings of a university.  It might be outside the scope of the broad middle ground but at the same time it may well be in the best interests of fostering diversity in the university that the viewpoint be strongly represented at the board.  As presently formulated that would be improper because the section states: &ldquo;no special interests shall be represented&rdquo;.  In a healthy debate there are occasions on which a special interest may properly be represented in circumstances where, for example, a club or an association within the university, which is not popular with some members of the administration, comes up for recognition.  Subsection (3) could be construed as muzzling anybody who wanted to speak on behalf of that society or group and that would be a pity.  At the same time, of course, nobody would challenge the proper nature of the requirement to act in the best interests of the university. However, as presently constituted, it is too restricted and would not allow for the kind of situation I envisage.  I could give some examples but it might be rather boring and dull.  The Minister probably accepts the principle and will look into that.</P>

The standing orders are there. In saying that, the governing authority rather than the chairperson would decide when the governing authority meetings are to be held.  We have already had a suggestion from Senator Lee that people might only meet every six months. There could be a major problem if some issue arose three weeks before the next meeting the governing authority had decided upon.  We were not giving a mechanism for arranging a meeting at short notice.  This is to allow such meetings. The power of the chairperson would give that flexibility because there may be a gap between scheduled meetings of the governing body.

I am not opposing that, but the amendment suggests that the meeting should decide on a voting basis whether there should be an agreement and then it should proceed by decision of the meeting rather than &ldquo;in the opinion of the chairperson&rdquo; which, in contentious situations, could be contrary to the views of a majority of those present.</P>

      <P>In page 39, paragraph (7), line 2, after &ldquo;officer&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;currently in office&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we should introduce a degree of flexibility into the length of time a chief officer can hold office.  Ten years is mentioned in the Schedule but perhaps the office might be more attractive to candidates if there was an option of resigning after seven years on appropriate terms so they were not faced with a ten year stint with no possibility of change.  I remember the ten year period being discussed in my college when it was introduced and there was much support for seven rather than ten years.  No one raised the possibility of ten years with an option of leaving after seven years or between the seventh and the tenth year.  The question of recruitment to and exit or resignation from a position is important in terms of quality of university performance.</P>

      <P>I would prefer not to accept the amendment.  The conditions of service of existing staff cannot be worsened by the legislation. The insertion of a particular term of office for existing chief officer, where it differs from their present term, cannot be accepted because we have already moved forward by not disturbing the conditions of those <i>in situ.</i>  The Bill provides that future chief officers serve for ten years.  The Senator mentioned seven years, but more than ten years would kill anyone.  The universities sought a ten year period and I have no reason to recommend otherwise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 171:</P>
      <P>In page 39, line 31, after &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;except in the case of a university or universities which have a funded pension with appointed trustees, in accordance with existing pension legislation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with the question of superannuation, pensions, gratuities, etc.  The Schedule states that if there is a dispute between the recipient and the source of the pension about the amount, it should be referred to An tÚdarás.  My amendment states that there should be an exception where there is an existing &ldquo;funded pension with appointed trustees, in accordance with existing pension legislation&rdquo;. The existing arrangement, which is legal, should not be disturbed.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a pension fund in Trinity College which is part of a commercial deal with an insurance company.  I am on semi-permanent disability benefit, but I have been hounded by these people.  They have written to me stating that I am still involved in public life.  I have replied by stating that one of my colleagues was in a wheelchair, so would they suggest he jump out and conduct physical education classes?  I have also suggested that the disabled, in whose glorious ranks I am prepared to admit myself, should be entitled to parliamentary representation.</P>
      <P>They have snooped around in an extraordinary manner.  I have received a number of letters to which I replied so vigorously that I was asked not to do so again as they caused nervous disturbance to those who read them.  However, I am unrepentant. I received one recently from the head office in Edinburgh which stated that they had arranged a visit at the &ldquo;above address&rdquo;.  I responded by thanking them for their letter and telling them that they had greatly exceeded the scope of their powers because what they referred to as the &ldquo;above address&rdquo; was my home and it was beyond their capacity to invite a third party, whose qualifications, age, sex, height and weight were not specified, to invade it.  I am already having difficulties with these persons, so I do not want to get entangled with An tÚdarás as well.</P>
      <P>It would be a good idea to leave the existing pension schemes, which are awkward, and not involve An tÚdarás; in other words, the existing pension arrangements should be permitted.  I look forward to returning to this theme when the insurance industry is investigated in this House.  I may be light-hearted about this matter but these letters have been sent to various people without consultation with the university.  One such letter was sent to an employee who had taken retirement on health grounds because of a nervous breakdown.  This person was catapulted into a second one as a result of receiving such letters. This exception is reasonable.</P>

      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to provide that where a university has a funded pension scheme with appointed trustees the provisions of subsection (5) relating to the resolution of disputes would not apply.  The Fifth Schedule will apply to the superannuation of arrangements of people who are employed by universities after the passing of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is normal practice for schemes which are funded largely by public funds that the determination of disputes would be submitted to the Department of Finance.  It is hoped that there will be very few such disputes, given the duty of trustees to comply with the relevant pensions legislation. I would not favour an option whereby the resolution of disputes for all such schemes would be subject to the agreement of the Ministers for Finance and Education.  The involvement of the Minister for Finance ensures a co-ordinated approach to the resolution of disputes for all pension schemes that are funded largely from the public purse.  It is of note that over £20 million per annum is provided by the State for superannuation payments in the case of the universities. The total of accumulated funds is in excess of £400 million.</P>

      <P>This seems to envisage the imposition of a new funding arrangement on the universities. Some of them may welcome such a development but I am not sure that Trinity College will do so.  The existing scheme appears to be satisfactory and it might be better to continue that and leave it <Col N="249" /> to be determined by the normal forces that operate in respect of insurance and pension schemes.  Will the Minister provide information regarding whether there is substantial State investment in the Trinity pension fund?  I understand that this is not the case. Is she suggesting that the State will subsequently contribute?</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am misinformed, but my recollection is that the Trinity scheme is independent and is funded by a combination of contributions from the employees and the university.  I am not aware of any massive State investment.  I presume this situation will continue.  If that is the case, it is not adequate to state that this will not affect people employed before the passage of the Bill.  It should be stated that the provision will involve everyone in the universities after the passage of the Bill.  It may well be that Trinity will wish to continue with the existing arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to try to convince the Minister of the need to confer disadvantaged status on the St. Louis junior school, Clones, County Monaghan. My reason for doing so is that the senior and post primary schools in Clones have already been conferred with that status.  I am sure the Minister will agree that Clones has been a disadvantaged area for many years because of its geographic location on the Border.  Approximately 66 per cent of the town's catchment area is situated on the northern side of the Border and its past importance is signified by its three hotels. Clones has suffered incredibly from economic woes, which began in the 1960s.</P>
      <P>Following the long debate on the Universities Bill, during which she did not once slur her words, I ask the Minister to tear up her prepared script.  In light of the circumstances of this particular school, and given certain other information about Clones of which the Minister is aware but which I will not put on record.  I ask her to respond positively to this motion.</P>

      <P>Would that it were so easy.  The disadvantaged areas scheme was last expanded in 1994 when an additional 54 primary schools were newly included in it.  The case put forward by the school in question was considered at that time.  Unfortunately, when regard was had to the relative levels of need among competing schools, the needs of the school in question were not considered to be of such priority as to warrant its inclusion on that occasion.  Traditionally, schools have been selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of socio-economic indicators. The indicators took account of levels of unemployment, medical card holding and local <Col N="251" /> authority housing occupancy.  However, in 1995 I commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre to conduct a detailed review of current approaches to addressing the problem.  My decision to commission the study arose from a concern to ensure that supports were properly targeted and that children with real need were in a position to benefit from the scheme.</P>
      <P>The criteria used in selecting the schools was addressed in the study.  There was concern that the scheme did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage.  It was recommended that the criteria used be amended to better reflect disadvantage. It was also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted and it was considered that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school going population.  In this regard, it was noted that the present scheme extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.  In response to these findings, I launched a new targeted intervention aimed at breaking the cycle of disadvantage in urban and rural areas.  The urban phase of the initiative is in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. The rural phase of the initiative focused on schools with fewer than five teachers.</P>
      <P>All eligible schools were invited by the Education Research Centre to apply for inclusion and it selected the schools.  A total of 33 urban and 123 rural schools were selected and the schools were required to prepare a five year plan.  The operation of the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative is being closely monitored by the Department's inspectorate and the project will be evaluated by the Education Research Centre.  The outcome of this evaluation will provide a basis for considering future developments in supports for disadvantaged areas.  In the event of such developments being undertaken, the needs of the school to which the Senator refers will be fully considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Education for her presence on behalf of the Minister for the Environment to take this motion to extend the urban renewal scheme to Rathkeale, County Limerick.  It is a unique case because of the special circumstances which prevail there.  Almost 45 per cent of the town's population are travellers and two cultures live in relative harmony in the town, although there are some tensions.  The special circumstances make it important that the town would be considered for the urban renewal scheme.  Many of the commercial premises and some of the residential premises in the centre of <Col N="252" /> the town have been withdrawn from commercial or residential use.  This is because the traders in the travelling community have purchased these premises and turned them into stores for furniture. Most of the traders are in the furniture business. It is important to restore the centre of the town to commercial activity.  The extension of the urban renewal scheme would provide an incentive to do this and would attract business back to the town.</P>
      <P>The decline in the physical fabric of the main street of Rathkeale is a serious problem.  The inner core of the town is decaying with many of the buildings being derelict, dilapidated, unoccupied and disused.  The blight of decay which has strangled the physical, social and economic life of the town must be stopped.  People need to be enticed to live in the town.  The potential of the town to attract private investment and development is depressed because of the physical environment of decay.  There is little interest on the part of many owners of properties to undertake development of the buildings.</P>
      <P>The designation of the main street in Rathkeale for the purposes of urban renewal would lead to a significant private sector investment in such properties and significantly contribute to the improvement of the town.  The Rathkeale Enterprise Committee is unable to address the problem of dereliction alone.  The increasing problem of dereliction and dilapidation on Rathkeale's main street is highlighted by the survey undertaken by the committee.  Of every ten buildings on the main street four are derelict, dilapidated, unoccupied or disused.  Such buildings are often boarded up.</P>
      <P>The population of Rathkeale has declined in recent years, contributing to the spread of dereliction and decline.  In 1991 there were 1,803 people living in Rathkeale and in 1996 the population was 1,546.  Yet, the population of neighbouring towns has increased dramatically.  Two thirds of the people living on the main street are elderly and they do not have children who are likely to continue living there.</P>
      <P>The main street is an area that needs to be designated. The widespread dereliction, decline and disuse of the buildings must be addressed by tax designation.  For many years a market for second hand property has not existed because of the number of neighbouring derelict buildings.  No new residential development has taken place there.  An alarming number of businesses in the town have closed and such a loss of economic activity is directly related to the decline in the population.  In compiling a strategic plan for the main street, the development committee consulted Limerick County Council for its ideas on tackling the decline.  The county council wholly endorsed the promotion of an urban renewal scheme in Rathkeale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enactment of the Derelict Sites Act, 1990, to prevent property being or becoming derelict and which would then detract from the amenity, character or appearance of areas has proved difficult <Col N="253" /> for Limerick County Council to implement. In the case of Rathkeale's main street, buildings continue to become neglected and unsightly. Urban improvement measures, whether promoted by the county council, initiated by the community organisations or provided by private enterprise, have taken place during recent years which have improved the physical appearance of the town.  Such improvements are overshadowed by the number of derelict properties which, until removed, will make it impossible to achieve the objective of improving the physical environment of the town, to attract people to live in it and sustain new enterprise.</P>
    <P>Experience of other designated areas underlines the interest of many people, especially young people, in buying town houses or apartments in urban areas bringing life back into such centres.  Elderly people also prefer to live in towns given the proximity to services.  The activity which would be generated by an urban renewal scheme would halt the worsening process of decay and dereliction.  It would change the face of the town.  The result of such development would be to improve the amenities for the existing population and attract significant numbers of young people to live in the town.</P>
    <P>The enterprise committee recognises the strong focus of the urban renewal scheme on residential development, relying on measures to conserve and use existing infrastructure.  Rathkeale needs social and economic rejuvenation.  Tax designation would encourage people to move back to the town and re-establish and revitalise the community. A successful town is associated with a growing population.  Many people are ready and willing to make the necessary investments if tax designation is granted.  Many locals have invested money elsewhere in recent years.  The risk in investing in property elsewhere is significantly lower and the likelihood of appreciation in the value of properties is higher in other towns.</P>
    <P>The designation of the main street, and in particular residential allowances, would bring new life to the town.  Derelict and dilapidated buildings would be replaced by new and refurbished residential buildings with an increased population. Such enhancement would contribute to growth in economic and tourist activity and, importantly, to the atmosphere and confidence in the town.  It would change the perception of people living there.</P>
    <P>The survey indicated that there were 56 derelict, dilapidated, unoccupied or disused houses on the main street, that is, over 39 per cent of the total.  Only 27 houses are residential.  Residential and business accounts for 13 houses and business alone only 16.  Twenty of the houses have one occupant, 22 have two, and three have two or more occupants.  Occupants of 38 of the 42 residences consisted of people living alone, or two people living together, who were more than 50 years old.</P>
    <P>We want to bring down the barriers to development. Fifty six properties on Main Street are derelict, <Col N="254" /> dilapidated or misused.  Property values in the town are plummeting and there is genuine economic decline.  In the last 20 years 64 businesses have disappeared from the Main Street and have not been replaced.  There is a decreasing population and increasing unemployment.  We must break the vicious circle of decline.  I ask the Minister for Education to convey to the Minister for the Environment the urgency in designating this area for urban renewal.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy McManus, regrets that she is unable to be in the Seanad this morning to reply to Senator Neville's motion.  I am glad to stand in for her and to report to the House on the current position in relation to urban renewal.</P>
      <P>I think it would probably help to put the issue in context if I was first of all to look very briefly at the history of urban renewal.  The tax incentive approach to urban renewal schemes was first introduced more than a decade ago in 1986.  It provides for a range of special incentives as well as relief from rates for new construction and refurbishment works in designated areas.  When first introduced, the scheme was confined to the five main cities.  However, it was such a success it was extended.  At present, areas in 35 cities and towns are designated.  The current scheme will expire at the end of July this year except for certain projects then in progress which will have a further one year period in which to be completed.</P>
      <P>In 1995, after almost ten years' experience of urban renewal schemes, it was considered timely to carry out a detailed review.  As part of that, a team of consultants was appointed.  In preparing the study, the consultants were asked to consider the impact of the schemes in fiscal, economic, social and architectural and urban design terms. They were also asked to make recommendations. The study was completed and published last December.  It concluded that the schemes have been highly successful as a mechanism for leveraging private sector investment into areas of dereliction and decline.</P>
      <P>For the future, the study suggested the need for a more strategic approach.  In particular, the consultants recommended that designation should not take place in isolation but should emerge from an integrated action plan for the area.  The plan would not only deal with issues of physical renewal but would also address issues central to the wider social and economic regeneration of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After its publication, submissions were invited in relation to the study's conclusions and recommendations, <Col N="255" /> and the consultative process culminated in a conference in Dublin Castle on 25 March last.  Minister McManus chaired that conference, which proved to be a very useful exercise in bringing together the various strands of opinion.  Now that all stages of the process have been completed, the Minister is working on the development of a framework for urban renewal policy.</P>
    <P>While it is obvious that a strong case can be made for the inclusion of many areas such as Rathkeale in the urban renewal scheme, the Minister has indicated on a number of occasions previously that the issue of designating additional areas would not be considered until such time as <Col N="256" /> the review of the urban renewal schemes has been completed and future policy proposals have been finalised.  Policy proposals in this respect will be submitted to Government as soon as possible, so the designation of further areas under the current scheme does not arise at this stage.</P>
    <P>However, I will ensure that Senator Neville's contribution to this debate will be brought to the Minister's attention when the issue of urban renewal designation arises again.</P>
