      <P>On behalf of Members of the Seanad, I wish to extend our sympathy to the relatives of the Countess of Wicklow who died last week.  As Eleanor Butler, she was nominated to this House by the Taoiseach in 1948.  She served in the Seanad from 1948 to 1951.  She was a member of the Labour Party and a distinguished architect who, in her later years, campaigned worldwide for moral rearmament.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Dan Kiely that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to ensure that the mid-term evaluation of the operational programme for transport funding will not be transferred from the projects proposed for the Shannon Estuary at Moneypoint.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the extension to Ballingarry boys' national school, County Limerick, is completed in 1997.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction and provide the necessary funds for the construction of a new national school at Cloontuskert, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to report on the discussions of the interdepartmental <Col N="346" /> committee established by her to address the special needs of children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelleher of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint the necessary technical staff to ensure that Gaelscoil Peig Saor, Cork, proceeds.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Kiely's and Senator Neville's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 28, motion 24.  Item 1 will be taken from now until 6 p.m. and I suggest 20 minutes per speaker.  Item 28, motion 24 will be taken in Private Members' time.</P>

      <P>I take it there is no amendment from the Government side to item 24?  The Leader of the House will be aware that for the last few days fishermen have been lobbying the Minister for the Marine with regard to the disastrous weather conditions the industry has been trying to deal with over the last few weeks.  The fishermen feel they are the bridesmaids to the farming lobby.  If the Minister is coming into the House tomorrow perhaps he would take the opportunity to comment on the efforts he will make to help the industry.</P>

      <P>We read in the newspapers today of an effort by the British Government to have Northern Ireland excluded from the European beef ban.  The Leader should urge the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to support that move.  I raise the matter not just because the benefit would be to the island of Ireland but also to show solidarity with those in Northern Ireland who have urged this move.  I am concerned that it might be seen as a sop to the Unionists &mdash; perhaps it was &mdash; and as such we might not have seen fit to support it.  The Leader should urge the Minister to support it.</P>
      <P>I got to know Lady Wicklow in recent years and I was saddened to learn of her death.  She added great prestige to the House during her time as a Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised the problem Members of the House have getting the reports of various Government bodies and I referred to the report on sport in particular.  Perhaps the Cabinet did not see the report either so maybe there is a reason it was not circulated to Members of the House.  Will the Leader give me an assurance that the reports will be circulated to us and to make sure we get them?  At times it seems we debate matters having read a version of events in <Col N="347" /> the press rather than the reports themselves, and sometimes there is a difference.</P>
      <P>For several weeks we have been attempting to have a debate on agriculture.  This week's events involving the environmental consequences of disposing of dead animals suggest we should have the debate now.  Another reason for having such a debate relates to currency issues.  Motions concerning economic and monetary union and agriculture are on the Order Paper and the Leader said last week he would restart those debates rather then resume them.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of uncertainty over whether it is more desirable to reduce interest rates or raise them, and contradictory signals are coming from the financial world.  A revaluation of the green currency would have definite consequences for our export industry and for farming. For all those reasons we need to debate agriculture as well as examine fiscal policy including currency exchange rates.</P>
      <P>I also wish to comment on the unfortunate incident in Tralee where a young man was killed and his body was left exposed in a field.  On television last night I saw gardaí attempting to put a plastic sheet over him.  There seems to have been an inordinate delay in getting the State Pathologist to the scene of the crime.  That is totally unsatisfactory for two reasons.  Principally, it adds to the trauma suffered by the victim's family.  Second, one would have to question the value of forensic science when the examination of the site takes so long.  I suspect that if there was an emergency in Tralee it would be easy to transport the Tánaiste there by jet or helicopter.</P>

      <P>Newspaper reports suggest the Revenue Commissioners are targeting child care services for VAT at a rate of 21 per cent, yet I do not know of any Government decision to seek VAT from child care services.  According to the newspapers this goes back to an EU directive of 1977 and, if so, I cannot understand why the Revenue Commissioners have started to implement it now.  The whole child care area is obviously very important.  In fact, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has just issued a report entitled &ldquo;Developing Child Care Services in Disadvantaged Areas&rdquo;.  These aspects of the Child Care Act have also been implemented recently.  In that context, it is disturbing to see child care being targeted for VAT.  The Leader, on behalf of the House, should ask the Revenue Commissioners not to pursue this until the issue has been clarified. There is a question concerning what aspects of child care are educational and which are not. <Col N="348" /> It may be that most child care activities should not be subject to VAT because of their educational element.  It is a grey area and I am disappointed that this has occurred.  It should cease until the matter has been examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, two of the three points I wished to raise have already been mentioned. They concern the State Pathologist and VAT on créches and playschools.  There is a need for the State to employ more than one State Pathologist, it is nonsense to expect one man to cover the whole country.  Irrespective of the number of cases involved, one person cannot deal with them adequately.  There was an assistant State Pathologist in Cork, but there was a dispute because she wanted to work out of Cork rather than Dublin. I am not sure what the dispute was about. However, there is a need for more than one State Pathologist.</P>
      <P>As regards the Kerry case, the name of the victim appeared in newspapers before either his parents or relatives had been notified.  It is disgraceful that the name of a dead person should be in the public arena before the relatives have been told by the Garda.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Sullivan's view regarding VAT on créches.  There are people paying £50 per week for créche and play school facilities.  The introduction of 21 per cent VAT would mean a rise to £61.50 per week.  Fifty pounds can be a lot&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have sought derogations before.  In the case of the 48 hour working week the Minister was able to get a three year derogation. Will the Leader ensure that if 21 per cent VAT is imposed a derogation will be sought?  If it is imposed it is up to the State to provide facilities. We have been asking women to return to work and trying to ensure that single parents play a normal part in society.  If there are extra charges for play schools and créches, which are very important in the education system and not simply child minding services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>One can see the difference in children who have been to a play school or créche when they attend regular school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of an EU-Israeli agreement in the near future, will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government to put pressure on the Israeli Government to ensure that they stop their current settlement policy immediately?  The Israeli Government is to make a decision today on a huge settlement in east Jerusalem which goes against every aspect of international law.  They are illegal settlers who <Col N="349" /> took over the area by force.  Under UN and international agreements these settlements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be seen as reacting to what Senator Dardis and Senator Lanigan have said.  I am gravely concerned that at 10.40 a.m. yesterday the body of a young man was found in a field outside Tralee.  It took until this morning, 24 hours later, for the State Pathologist to arrive.  This is the third time this has happened. Once in my locality the body of a young person was left in a similar manner.  Recently, the same happened in the west Cork area.  Now we have this case in Tralee.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Justice and to ask her to sort out whatever wrangling is going on in the Department's forensic laboratory system. That is where the problem lies.  The boy in Tralee was identified and his parents were aware yesterday morning that it was their son.  He was lying in that field all day and all night until the State Pathologist arrived very belatedly this morning.  This is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my sympathy to the relatives of the late Countess of Wicklow.  I recall her as a writer of very fine school books for young people.  I was not aware that she was a former Member of this House.  I regret her passing.</P>
      <P>I am interested to hear that there has been this difficulty about the tragic circumstances in which the body of a young man was found.  I raised this matter a number of weeks ago.  I am sure that nobody who spoke here today intended any criticism whatsoever of the State Pathologist.  I ask the Leader if we could have a brief discussion on the matter or perhaps it could be considered as a motion on the Adjournment.  We need to urge the authorities to provide proper facilities to the State Pathologist who currently has to use his own transport.  Back-up personnel should be appointed in the southern area; it is ridiculous to have an official like the State Pathologist travelling the length and breadth of a country in these circumstances.  The kind of pressure he is under will eventually lead to a serious accident.  To have to deal with that degree of pressure is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader if he can ascertain and inform the House whether the forthcoming visit of a certain Robert Mugabe has any official context.  I understand that he will be addressing a meeting <Col N="350" /> in University College Dublin and I hope that if this visit has an official context it will be used to give some instruction in the nature of democracy. Mr. Mugabe is a well known dictator who presides over a tyranny, who has stirred up vicious hatred against sections of his own community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and has presided over all the elements one expects of a nasty dictatorship. My question to the Leader is whether he can give the House some information about the proposed visit of this highly unsavoury and undemocratic character to this country.</P>

      <P>Over the weekend news broke that scientists in Great Britain cloned a sheep.  This raises huge ethical problems for many scientists. I ask the Leader if, in one of the short debates which he envisages will take place in the coming weeks, we could have a debate on ethics in science and medicine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the lack of any action or progress towards the establishment of a permanent basis for peace in Northern Ireland, I would like to draw the House's attention to the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party Leader has recently made it very clear to Sinn Féin that the only way it could be involved in, and be part of, the process towards the establishment of a permanent peace is by a declaration of an unqualified ceasefire on the part of the IRA.  If Sinn Féin is to play that role, I ask the House to take note that at this moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs inquire of the British Government whether they or their agents, MI5, are involved in any way in promoting the American tour of Seán O'Callaghan.  Whichever view one takes of what Mr. O'Callaghan is saying and acknowledging how heinous some things may have been, it is clear that the tour is calculated to denigrate the Sinn Féin political representatives and would be calculated to ensure that they could not play a part in a meaningful peace process in the event of a permanent ceasefire being established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>We waxed effusive in this House recently over the importance of a cultural institutions Bill, the importance of the National Museum and the National Library and their respective roles in our heritage industry, etc. and <Col N="351" /> we devolved a lot of extra responsibilities on them.  The directorship of the national library was advertised during the past week and I was appalled to see the salary advertised was £10,000 to £15,000 below what university and chief librarians earn.  I ask the Leader to ask the relevant Minister &mdash; I do not know whether it is the Minister for Education or the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht &mdash; if something could be done about this because that would be a more relevant indicator of the value we lay on the National Library and our cultural institutions than the legislation we are enacting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with everything Senator Lee said.  This advertisement was placed because a vacancy occurred due to the premature retirement of Dr. Patricia Donlon who was an outstanding public servant.  The State received much more from her than she was paid.  The salary offered is an appalling reflection on the people who framed the advert.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It reminds me of what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, said last week to some businessmen.  He said he welcomed their input because there were no businessmen in Upper Merrion Street.  It would seem he was correct if the librarian's salary is being pitched at that level.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader give time over the next few weeks for a debate on rural development?  I and a number of my colleagues on both sides of the House who are members of the National Economic and Social Forum are currently finalising a report on rural development.  The Leader may wish to wait until that report is in the public domain; it will not be delayed much longer.</P>
      <P>It is in that context that I wish to raise an appalling situation which has developed in the small village of Geevagh on the Sligo-Leitrim border where the local post office is threatened with closure. This is in a community which has taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have been informed that this is not possible but I gather that, since it is Fianna Fáil policy, it will be possible when it is in Government.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to ensure that, in his next budget on 29 October, child care costs are made allowable against tax?</P>

The Leader may not be aware that there was a dispute in the Ennis gaelscoil during the week because the teachers are very dissatisfied with conditions in the school.  There are also a number of other primary schools in County Clare in a similar position.  There must be a list of schools which are in urgent need of remedial repairs or new buildings.  There is dissatisfaction in the community at the lack of funding.</P>

      <P>We have had a number of debates on the broadcasting laws and authorities. Over the past three mornings, I have been entertained and regaled by unfettered and untrammelled broadcasting on 105.3 FM, Virgin Radio, the largest commercial station in the UK.  It seems ironic that, at a time when we wonder about getting a second Irish commercial station on the airwaves and the years of discussion about deregulation and access to the airwaves, the largest commercial station in the UK seems to be able to broadcast to the entire city of Dublin and perhaps beyond.  I presume it is being rebroadcast by one of the local pirate stations because I do not think the FM broadcasting facility of Virgin could stretch to Dublin.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to investigate the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past two weeks I have raised Partnership 2000 which requires a full response from the Leader.  It is a month since it was agreed to and it has not been discussed by the House.  It is essential it should be discussed in the light of economic and monetary union, monetary policy and other aspects of taxation.

      <P>Senator Quinn raised BSE in Northern Ireland. The Senator will be aware that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, has been consistently supportive of the Northern Irish farmers.  He made a stronger case for them than their own Government, which got a certain amount of appreciation in Northern Ireland.  I am sure that policy will continue.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised the circulation of official reports.  I have investigated that matter and the position is not satisfactory.  We do not have an automatic right to have all official reports circulated to us.

All official reports should be sent directly to all Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas. We are obliged to keep ourselves informed and the Department is obliged to prepare these reports to ensure we are.  I am putting the matter down as one of urgency for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  There will be a strong recommendation that the matter be reviewed and the regulation which governs the circulation of reports repealed.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and others raised the issue of the State Pathologist.  I understand he visited Tralee last night in connection with the murder of a young man but it was too late to begin work. I also understand that a vacancy for a second State Pathologist was advertised six weeks ago.  I believe Members would want to place on record their appreciation of the work carried out for many years by Dr. John Harbison, often in very difficult circumstances.  No one is satisfied with the conditions under which he is obliged to operate or the level of resources at his disposal.  I will convey the unease of the House in respect of this matter to the relevant Minister.</P>

    <P>I would like to make time available for a debate on agriculture and I will deal with that matter later.  Senator O'Sullivan raised the issue of child care services.  There is need for clarification and a restoration of the <i>status quo</i> in this regard.  If the matter is not clarified in the near <Col N="355" /> future I will take steps to make time available for a debate.  Senator Lanigan raised the issue of current events in Israel and I will convey his concerns to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of President Mugabe.  I understand he is visiting Ireland at the invitation of <i>The Irish Times</i> to participate in <i>The Irish Times/</i>Harvard symposium on the future of Africa.

      <P>Yes.  I would welcome a debate on this matter which involves important ethical questions and implications but I am not sure the House is an appropriate place for such a debate. I believe the matter would be better dealt with by a committee of the Houses where experts could be invited to contribute.  With a number of exceptions, I do not believe Members are in a position to expound a great deal of expert knowledge on this subject.  I would prefer that it be dealt with by one of the committees.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee referred to the salary of the librarian in the National Library.  The salary on offer is a disgrace.  The Library was fortunate to have the services of Dr. Pat Donlon and it is a great shame she is leaving.  However, had Members been aware of her remuneration package they would have been horrified.  The salary on offer would not be adequate to employ a middle to lower level executive in any major organisation.  This reflects extraordinarily badly on our attitude to the National Library and the matter should be urgently reviewed.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of rural development but we must await the publication of the relevant report.  Senator Henry looked forward to the introduction of the budget in late October.  I am sure the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, will take account of her concerns.</P>
      <P>Senators Daly and O'Toole raised the question of schools.  I communicated with the Department of Education on this matter and I am awaiting a reply.  Senator O'Toole also referred to broadcasting and he can raise that matter with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht during this evening's Private Members' debate.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a debate on Partnership 2000 but, as Members are aware, the House must deal with a heavy programme of legislation in the coming weeks.  However, I would be happy to arrange for the House to sit an additional day to deal with a debate on the programme.  I will discuss the matter with the Whips and, if agreement is reached, I will make time available for such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours in our criminal law.  That distinction marked the original approach to the classification of offences; felonies being the graver class and misdemeanours the less grave class of offences.  The distinction has been eroded over many years and in today's conditions has no real relevance.  Today, for example, serious offences such as fraudulent conversion and obtaining property by false pretences are classified as misdemeanours whereas a relatively trivial offence such as stealing a bar of chocolate is a felony.</P>
      <P>The distinction between felonies and misdemeanours also gives rise to a number of unnecessary complications and anomalies in the law.  Certain statutory provisions and common law rules depend on the continuing distinction between those two classes of offences.  The Bill for the most part comprises provisions that are consequential on the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and related matters.  It provides that, in general, the law and practice for misdemeanours before the commencement of this legislation will apply to all offences.  The abolition of the distinction is also a progressive step as it provides the opportunity to amend and restate the law in a modern form and, in so doing, a considerable number of older enactments can be repealed, or in some cases, simplified.</P>
      <P>The criminal law needs to be relevant and responsive to modern day conditions.  This Bill, by modernising and clarifying the law in key respects, such as in regard to powers of arrest, is a very significant advance in that regard.  I remind Senators that earlier this month the House passed the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, which contains provisions for a more effective and efficient use of Garda time and resources and other proposals for reform of procedure in criminal cases.  The Minister has introduced the Children Bill, 1996, which is before the Dáil and provides the basis for a new juvenile justice system.  In addition, the Minister today published the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997, which is designed to restate in modern statutory form the law relating to the main non-fatal offences against the person most of which are currently provided for in 1861 legislation. These Bills are key elements in the comprehensive programme of legislative reform the Minister has undertaken to modernise and improve important areas of criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other legislative measures in the criminal law area which are at an advanced stage of preparation include a bail Bill which will provide for <Col N="357" /> changes in our bail laws as a consequence of the recent amendment to the Constitution; a Licensing (Drugs) Bill which will deal with the problems of drugs sold in dance halls, public houses and at unlicensed dances and a fraud offences Bill which will simplify and update our complex dishonesty laws.  These steps to reform criminal law are a significant part of the Government's law and order response to today's crime situation and are a clear indication of the seriousness with which this Government is responding to the developments and trends in modern day crime.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is the pivotal provision of the Bill. It abolishes all distinctions between felonies and misdemeanours.  It provides that the law and practice in regard to offences will be that applicable to misdemeanours.  In my opening remarks I explained how the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours, which was originally a distinction between serious and minor offences, has become blurred over the years.  As a consequence of abolishing the distinction, the law needs to be updated and, in some cases, restated.</P>
    <P>At present there is a power of arrest without warrant at common law in respect of felonies; no such power exists in respect of misdemeanours. As a result, it is necessary to obtain an arrest warrant in respect of a number of serious offences which are classified at present as misdemeanours, such as fraudulent conversion and obtaining property by false pretences.  As it is proposed to abolish all distinctions between felonies and misdemeanours, section 2 of the Bill will put in place a new category of &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo; which will comprehend most felonies and the more serious misdemeanours.  An offence that is punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty, including an attempt to commit such an offence, will be an arrestable offence for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill restates and clarifies the existing law relating to arrest.  The fact is that practically all the present felonies come within the new arrestable offence category as nearly all of them are punishable with maximum sentences of at least five years imprisonment.  The only substantive change is that the new category of &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo; extends the power of arrest without warrant to include some of the more serious misdemeanours.  These are misdemeanours which at present carry a penalty of at least five years imprisonment.  This change will undoubtedly make the law relating to arrest much more relevant and effective as the new powers will be related to the seriousness of the offence in question as determined by the penalty that may be imposed for the commission of that offence.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for an effective power of arrest without warrant where serious crimes are involved.  Today it is hard to justify the retention, as part of our criminal law, of a requirement that arrest for the commission of some serious offences can be effected only on foot of a warrant while other equally serious offences do not necessitate a warrant.  The Minister is satisfied <Col N="358" /> that the criterion of a penalty of at least five years imprisonment is an appropriate and proportionate indication of what constitutes a serious offence.</P>
    <P>The definition of arrestable offence is the same category of offence referred to in section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, in respect of which the provisions of that Act, relating to periods of detention in Garda custody, apply.  The arrest provisions before the House and the provisions of the 1984 Act have a common reference point in terms of the seriousness of the offences to which both provisions relate.  This represents an important step in the development of our criminal law.  It is desirable that the law in relation to arrest and the law relating to Garda procedure after arrest are underpinned by a common reference point in respect of offences committed.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is concerned with the powers of arrest which are exercisable by private citizens and gardaí.  At present the powers of arrest without warrant are either contained in specific statutes, of which there are many, or conferred by the common law in respect of felonies.  Statutory powers of arrest will be unaffected by the provisions of this Bill.  The section contains powers that correspond to the present common law rules in respect of felonies.  They are exactly the same as the powers of arrest conferred by section 19 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, in relation to offences in Northern Ireland and associated offences in the State and by section 12 of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, in relation to offences of causing criminal damage.</P>
    <P>There is a very important distinction in law between the relative positions of private citizens and gardaí in the matter of arrest.  When a private citizen exercise a power of arrest it is essential that a felony can actually be proved to have occured.  If no felony has in fact occurred, the private person who made the arrest will be liable to a civil action.  Therefore, a private person must exercise caution when he or she decides to exercise a power of arrest.  However, a garda may arrest any person whom he or she reasonably suspects of committing a felony whether or not any offence has actually taken place.  The garda is immune under the law from a civil action for damages should the offence not actually have been committed.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that it is appropriate to maintain the distinction in law between the powers of arrest of gardaí and the powers of arrest of private persons.  Therefore, under the Bill, a private person who gets it wrong will quickly find himself or herself facing an action in the civil courts for defamation, wrongful imprisonment or trespass to the person.  While it is appropriate that private persons should have a power of arrest, and indeed the courts have commended such persons for exercising that power in particular cases, there is a question of balance here which must be settled in the context of the constitutional right to personal liberty.  It is worth emphasising that the only substantive change proposed <Col N="359" /> in the Bill is that such powers of arrest without warrant will now extend to a number of serious offences previously classified as misdemeanours. The powers of arrest of private persons are, in practice, of most relevance to store detectives or security personnel who do not, and will not have under this Bill, any additional powers at their disposal in the matter of arrest than any other private person.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that a member of the Garda Síochána may execute a warrant for the arrest of a person or an order of committal without the need to have the actual warrant or order in his or her physical possession which is what the common law appears to require.  There are precedents for this approach in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, as regards arrest on a warrant for failure to surrender to bail, and in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, as regards arrest on extradition warrants, and it is now being extended to cover all arrests with warrants.  It is unsatisfactory that a garda is not generally empowered to arrest a person when he or she knows that a warrant for the arrest of that person has been issued.  An important safeguard is being provided in that the warrant or committal order must be shown to the arrested person as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is concerned with Garda powers to enter and search premises to effect an arrest for an arrestable offence or on foot of an order for committal.  Senators will be aware that this provision received a lot of attention during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  In particular, a number of Deputies expressed concern that a general power to enter a dwelling, such as that provided for in the section, for the purpose of effecting an arrest for an arrestable offence without a warrant would be found to be inconsistent with Article 40.5 of the Constitution which provides special protection against the forcible entry of dwellings.  The Minister has considered section 6 further, in consultation with the Attorney General, and she has decided that it should be amended so that the conditions under which the gardaí can enter a dwelling to make an arrest for an arrestable offence without a warrant should be spelled out.  I understand that an amendment to that effect will be tabled on Committee Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>The current law varies as to how persons involved in a crime who do not actually carry out the deed are treated depending on whether the offence in question is a felony or a misdemeanour. As regards felonies, distinctions are made between a principal in the first degree, that is the person who does the act in question, a principal in the second degree, that is a person who aids or abets the commission of the offence by the principal in the first degree and an accessory before the fact, that is a person who counsels or procures the principal in the first degree to commit the offence.  For misdemeanours there are no such distinctions and all persons involved are <Col N="360" /> treated alike as the principal offender.  There are no good reasons for maintaining the distinctions in regard to felonies and, accordingly, section 7 provides that the misdemeanour rule will now apply to all indictable offences so that all those who aid or abet, counsel or procure the commission of such an offence will be treated as principal offenders.</P>
    <P>The section also creates a new offence of impeding the apprehension or prosecution of a person who has committed an arrestable offence. This replaces the common law offence of being an accessory after the fact to a felony.  A scale of penalties for this new offence, which is graduated according to the seriousness of the principal offence, is set out in the section.  For example, where person A has committed the arrestable offence of murder, person B who commits the offence of impeding the apprehension or prosecution of person A, will be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.</P>
    <P>Section 8 creates a new offence of concealing an arrestable offence.  This also arises from the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.  As a result of abolishing felonies, the old offence of misprision of felony will disappear.  The new offence will, in effect, be one of accepting a bribe not to disclose relevant information to assist the prosecution or conviction of an offender.  The new offence of concealing is similar to the existing offence of compounding a felony with one important difference.  The old offence of compounding a felony also covered any consideration accepted for not disclosing information, including consideration consisting of the restitution of or compensation for stolen goods.  Under the section, it will no longer be an offence not to disclose information about an arrestable offence where the loss is made good or compensation is made for it.</P>
    <P>The current rules about alternative verdicts, that is where a person may be found guilty of a less serious offence than that on which he or she has been arraigned, differ as between felonies and misdemeanours.  At present, on a charge of felony the accused may be convicted of a less serious felony of which the ingredients are included in the felony charged.  While the same rule applies to misdemeanours, a person charged with a felony cannot be convicted of a misdemeanour except under statute.  As a consequence, therefore, of the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours, section 9 provides for a general rule on alternative verdicts in relation to all indictable offences.  In addition, the Minister decided that it was prudent to provide for the alternative verdicts which should be open to a jury on a charge of murder lest there be any doubt arising from the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.</P>
    <P>The section provides for a limitation on the extent to which a person found not guilty of murder, which is of course currently a felony, may be found guilty of a lesser charge.  There is a clear <Col N="361" /> need for certainty as to the verdicts open to the jury in murder cases.  The section also makes similar special provision for alternative pleas in respect of an indictment for murder to which section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, relates, which was formerly referred to as capital murder or an attempt to commit such murder.  In addition, the section provides a general rule for alternative verdicts in relation to all other indictable offences.</P>
    <P>Section 9 restates the law that a person charged with an indictable offence may be convicted of attempting to commit that offence.  In addition, it provides that a person charged with an attempt may be convicted of the attempt even where the person is proven to be guilty of the completed indictable offence.  Although this is a restatement of the law where the completed offence is a felony, the section clears up uncertainty on the same legal point in respect of misdemeanours by applying the rule to any offence which is indictable.</P>
    <P>Section 10 limits to two years the maximum term of imprisonment to apply in respect of indictable offences where no maximum penalty is provided.  A number of obscure and minor statutory misdemeanours prescribe no maximum penalty and, in theory, there is no limit to the term of imprisonment that may be imposed.  These offences mostly relate to the making of false statements for the purpose of the particular statute. The section gives statutory effect to the existing rule of practice whereby the maximum fine or term of imprisonment for an attempt to commit an indictable offence should not exceed the corresponding punishment for the completed offence.</P>
    <P>Under common law there is no general power to fine in the case of felonies; that power exists only in relation to misdemeanours.  Section 10 of the Bill confers a general power on a court to fine an offender convicted on indictment, except in the case of treason and murder where the sentence is fixed by law as defined in section 2.  The power to fine a person convicted on indictment will be unlimited, except where there is a statutory limit on the amount of a fine.  That power is also subject to any statutory requirement that the offender be dealt with in a particular way, for example, by disqualification.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 of the Bill do not relate to the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours but to an area of the law which needs to be updated.  Penal servitude, which was a sentence of imprisonment with compulsory labour, was substituted for transportation in the middle of the last century.  For many years there has been no distinction in the treatment of prisoners sentenced to penal servitude or imprisonment. Imprisonment with hard labour as a form of punishment has also fallen into disuse. Prison divisions &mdash; the placing of prisoners into divisions of varying severity &mdash; no longer apply either.  It is time the law was cleared of these outmoded categories of imprisonment and that is the main purpose of section 11.</P>
    <P>The sentence of whipping is available to the <Col N="362" /> courts under certain statutes in respect of males but is never used.  Whipping of females is prohibited by statute.  The European Court of Human Rights has adjudged the practice of birching to be degrading and contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Accordingly, section 12 abolishes whipping.</P>
    <P>Section 15 enables prosecutions commenced before the coming into effect of the Bill to be dealt with on the basis of the existing law. However, the procedural provisions of the Bill will apply where a person is arraigned after the Bill comes into effect.  This will mean, for example, that where an accused is arraigned after the Bill is in force in respect of a felony committed before the Bill commences, all the procedural provisions of the Bill relating to trials for a misdemeanour will apply.  Where an indictment has been framed and signed in accordance with the law before the coming into force of the Bill, the accused can only be found guilty of an offence under the previous law.  The particular purpose of this provision is to clarify the position in relation to alternative verdicts.  Section 15 (4) takes into account the reference in Article 15.13 of the Constitution to the term &ldquo;felony&rdquo; in respect of the provision for immunity from arrest of Members of the Oireachtas.  In effect, this is a saving provision which saves felonies for the purposes of Article 15.13 of the Constitution, and for that purpose only.  Originally, this provision was not in the Bill and it has been included by way of an amendment made in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 13, 14 and 16 introduce the Schedules to the Bill which provide for necessary amendments, modifications and repeals which are, in the main, consequential on the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.</P>
    <P>Central to the Bill are the powers of arrest which it provides.  These provisions restate and clarify the existing law in those areas.  The main change is that these powers will relate to a wider range of offences than heretofore by virtue of the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and by the creation of a new category of arrestable offences.  We are satisfied that where the Legislature has decided that an offence can be punished by five years imprisonment or by a more serious penalty, then that is an appropriate test to put in place now as the basis for a modern and effective power of arrest.  It is essential that we put in place a clear and comprehensive legislative framework to provide the Garda Síochána with the necessary powers of arrest.  In relation to these and other matters, I have no doubt that the Bill, when enacted, will provide the Garda with effective and up to date tools in the fight against serious crime while, at the same time, striking a proper balance between the individual citizen's rights and the protection of society from crime.</P>

      <P>This Government has copied two to four key proposals on criminal reform from the Opposition.  In fairness to the Minister of State, she did not make any political points when introducing this Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the abolition of the distinction between a felony and a misdemeanour which harks back to Victorian times.  The difference between a felony and a misdemeanour has been a source of confusion to law students down the years.  The answer given was that a felony was a more serious crime than a misdemeanour, but a crime is a crime.  Sometimes a minor crime may have more serious consequences for the victim than a major crime would have for somebody else.  It is time we abolished this Victorian distinction between a felony and a misdemeanour because they are both crimes.  I strongly welcome section 3.</P>
      <P>I also welcome section 7 which relates to penalties for assisting offenders.  It abolishes the distinction between a felony in the first degree and a felony in the second degree.  Returning to the dictum that a crime is a crime, part of the tragedy of the drugs crisis is that many of those who commit these crimes never put their hands on the dirty goods.  These people behind the scenes are the manipulators and, in many cases, on conviction they would be considered as having committed a felony in the second degree.  I welcome the abolition of this distinction.  Section 9 relating to the trial of offences is a necessary tidying up measure which should be supported.</P>
      <P>There are, however, sections of the Bill which are not particularly appropriate.  Section 4 relates to arrest without warrant and the concept of an arrestable offence.  Is there a non-arrestable offence?  Why are we drawing a distinction between arrestable and non-arrestable offences? Surely all offences should be arrestable.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that.</P>

      <Col N="364" /> Section 6 concerns the entry and search of a premises to effect an arrest.  Reading the Dáil debate on the Bill, I was staggered that the Minister for Justice did not immediately agree with what Deputy O'Donoghue said.  He rightly highlighted some of the most important judgements on personal liberty and the inviolability of a person's dwelling.  He quoted from the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh in the case of the People <i>v.</i> O'Brien [1965] Irish Reports 142 which stated:</P>
    <P>In Article 40 of the Constitution, the State has undertaken to defend and vindicate the inviolability of constitutional rights of the citizen. The defence and vindication of constitutional rights of the citizen is a duty superior to that of trying such citizen for a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>While I would like to accept a drafting error was made, it is not good enough that a provision, which is clearly unconstitutional, should have made its way from the drafting section of the Attorney General's Office through other Government offices into this Bill.  Was this Bill rushed or was an attempt made to throw together a Bill for the sake of appearances?  If not, somebody has made a mistake.  It is not good enough that such wording should be included in a Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to voice a query about the abolition of the distinction between penal servitude and hard labour, a point on which I have not made up my mind.  My understanding of the distinction is that penal servitude does not permit remission of sentences. Are we saying in this Bill that all sentences are capable of remission?  Are we saying that somebody convicted of certain offences may only have to serve a small proportion of their sentence? That would be the wrong signal to give to the public.  I hope it is not part of the Labour Party's soft approach to prisons and sentencing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to early releases, last week a female prisoner who was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment was released from Mountjoy Prison after serving only 48 hours of her sentence.  The excuse for her release was shortage of prison space.  That is a scandal which causes great concern to the public.  It brings the administration of justice into disrepute because the public loses confidence in the system.  Judges and prosecutors also become disheartened.  It is unacceptable.  I hope the Minister of State will make a clear statement that the abolition of the <Col N="365" /> distinction between penal servitude and hard labour will not make it easier to release convicted prisoners early.  I would appreciate such clarification.</P>
      <P>I oppose violence and corporal punishment. However, I wish to pose a philosophical question about the possible administration of some form of physical punishment by the State for criminal offences.  Last night I watched the &ldquo;ABC News&rdquo; from the United States.  Over a period of ten years in the state of Ohio, the education budget has decreased while the prison budget has increased.  There is a direct correlation between the decrease in one budget and the increase in the other.  If we are to imprison everybody who commits an offence for a considerable period of time, will that put a huge economic burden on the State?  The prison population in the United States and in Britain is extremely high and growing, and prisons are a booming industry.</P>
      <P>Everybody would like to eradicate the causes of crime and criminality by better employment, education, social services and so forth.  However, there appears to be an inevitable increase in the level of crime.  Nobody likes violence, but can a case be made for it?  Has the fact that a great deal of money could be saved by the State administering some form of moderate corporal punishment been adequately explored?  If members of the public are asked if they are in favour of some form of corporal punishment, many say yes.  I am not saying I am in favour of it and I hope I do not say that through cowardice.  However, from the economic point of view, if corporal punishment is not the answer we need to look at another form of punishment to ensure the prison population does not continue to increase.  We might not be able to afford the large prison population to which the increase in criminality in western democracies gives rise.</P>
      <P>It is politically correct to say one wishes to abolish crime.  I am not suggesting that people should be whipped but, if we are to be serious in addressing the problem of criminality, we should look at other punishment options.  Did the Department carry out studies on whether corporal punishment has worked in other jurisdictions?</P>

      <P>Many people are concerned about their safety on the streets.  They are concerned about burglaries, syringe attacks and petty crime.  Is prison the answer for every one of these crimes?  I hope the Minister of State will answer that question in a mature fashion.  If she offers the glib answer that prison is the answer for every such crime, it will be a mistake.  Other solutions must be found.  I do not suggest that corporal punishment is necessarily another solution, but other methods of punishment must be found because the prisons simply cannot accommodate all the prisoners.</P>
      <P>From the public's point of view, the key issue in the criminal justice debate is the effect the crime wave has on their personal lives.  Violence against people on streets, burglaries, syringe attacks, tourist crime &mdash; about 3,500 attacks were carried out on tourists last year &mdash; and the revolving door syndrome in prisons are issues that concern the public.  This Bill will only have a marginal influence on the level of crime and the administration of justice.  It is not the answer to problems in that area.  Some of its provisions are welcome.  However, has the Bill been properly thought out and researched?  If it has, why were the apparent drafting errors not corrected earlier?</P>
      <P>We will seek to amend the Bill on Committee Stage.  In principle, however, and in so far as it helps, to a small extent, to reform the administration of justice, we will support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It provides for the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.  The distinction is out of date and does not conform with developments in criminal offences.  The classification of offences makes felonies a graver class and misdemeanours a lesser class of offence.  Such distinctions have no relevance in the 1990s because of changes which have occurred since these two terms were coined. It creates unnecessary complications and anomalies in the law as it applies to modern circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that, in general, the law and practice with regard to misdemeanours before the commencement of the Bill will apply to all offences.  The effect of the Bill will be to facilitate the modernisation of many Acts and the simplification of the law.  The original distinction dates from pre-Independence times.  England and Wales abolished the distinction about 30 years ago and it has taken us that time to realise that the distinction should be abolished.  The application of the criminal law must be relevant and must deal with modern crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is a power of arrest without warrant in common law in respect of felonies. This does not apply to misdemeanours, even though there has been a blurring of the distinction and interpretation in the area.  As a result it is necessary to obtain an arrest warrant in respect <Col N="367" /> of a number of serious offences which are classified as misdemeanours, such as fraudulent conversion, obtaining property by false pretences and some sexual offences.  The Minister of State outlined the stupidity of the current situation with the examples she gave.</P>
    <P>This Bill will abolish all distinctions between felonies and misdemeanours and introduce a new category of arrestable offences which will cater for most felonies and the more serious misdemeanours. Offences that are punishable by imprisonment of terms of five years or more will be arrestable offences for the purposes of the Bill before the House.  Since most felonies are punishable for a minimum of five years, there will effectively be no change in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill will extend the power of arrest without warrant to some of the more serious misdemeanours interpreted under existing law.  It is important that when a serious offence is suspected the powers of arrest would be without warrant.  This is outlined in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  We must bring the law up to date because the law must be relevant to the times in which we live and be responsive to changes in the nature of crime.  Criminal activity has changed dramatically over the past ten years, never mind the 30 years since the law was changed in Britain. White collar fraud has come into its own, so to speak, and we have dealt with several items of legislation to tackle it.</P>
    <P>However, some basic legal provisions, such as the powers of arrest, have not been updated. Therefore, we welcome this clarification and modernisation of the law.  As the Minister of State indicated, this Bill is a significant advance in the law.  I welcome the introduction of the category of arrestable offences which will include most felonies and the more serious misdemeanours. It will make the law more relevant.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the powers of arrest exercisable by private citizens and the Garda.  At present, when a private citizen exercises a power of arrest it is essential that a felony can be proved to have occurred, otherwise the private citizen is liable for civil action.  I welcome the retention of this provision.  Difficulties have arisen in this regard with security personnel who may be over-zealous. It is important that they have a power of arrest when they know that an arrestable offence has occurred.  However, there must also be an inbuilt safeguard for the citizen to ensure this power is not abused.  Substantive changes in the Bill, such as the power of arrest without warrant, will now extend to a number of serious offences classified as misdemeanours and bring them into the category open to a citizen's arrest.  It is important that store detectives and security personnel should have such a power but it is also important that the power is curbed and they adopt a responsible approach to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> Section 6 concerns Garda powers to enter and search premises, to effect an arrest for an arrestable offence or on foot of an order for committal. The general power to enter a dwelling such as that provided for the purpose of affecting an arrest for an arrestable offence without a warrant may be found inconsistent with Article 40.5 of the Constitution which provides special protection against forcible entry into dwellings.  I welcome the Minister's re-examination of the matter.</P>
    <P>I vehemently disagree with Senator Mulcahy who considers it is wrong or shoddy for Members of the Oireachtas to question the constitutionality or effectiveness of a Government proposal.  It is our role to examine proposals and to question the Minister.  It is a responsible Minister who listens to the Members of the Oireachtas, reconsiders the matter in question and responds.  Rather than criticise a Minister for doing so we should welcome it.  Too often in the past Ministers have had closed minds on legislation brought before the House and it was put through regardless of the views of Members.  The Minister's response on this matter is to her credit rather than, as Senator Mulcahy would have it, a shoddy approach to the development of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in sections 11 and 12, where penal servitude, which was a sentence of imprisonment without compulsory labour, has been abolished.  For decades there has been no distinction, in effect, in the treatment of prisoners sentenced to penal servitude or imprisonment. Imprisonment with hard labour as a form of punishment has long since fallen into disuse.  The Minister is dealing with reality and responding in accordance with the views of the European Court of Human Rights with regard to flogging and its abolition.  This is a response to present day attitudes towards corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>I question Senator Mulcahy's proposal that the level of time off for good behaviour for prisoners should be reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent.  There was a debate in the House on this matter and it was proposed that it should be increased to 33.3 per cent, which is the level in many European countries. When a prisoner decides to reform and behaves, complies with prison regulations and is seen to be involved in prison activities which would lead to them becoming positive members of society when released, the legal system should respond accordingly.  At present it responds by giving a 25 per cent reduction in sentence to such prisoners.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy's view that it should be reduced to 15 per cent should be clearly examined before being adopted.  I fully agree that someone who has committed a serious offence, is not prepared to reform, does not comply with prison rules, does not get involved in prison activities and is generally unco-operative, should not receive a remission of their sentence.  However, we should have a mechanism to respond to prisoners who are prepared to behave themselves, mend their ways and move towards becoming <Col N="369" /> positive citizens who will, on release, contribute to the good of society.  That must be everyone's objective.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's commitment and her statement that legislative measures in the criminal law area are at an advanced stage of preparation.  They include the bail Bill which deals with an issue on which the citizens have spoken.  The people have comprehensively stated they want a change in these laws so the onus is on the Government to put that into effect.  I welcome the fact that this Bill is now at an advanced stage as is the Licensing (Drugs) Bill which will deal with the problems of drugs sold in dance halls and public houses.  This Bill was hailed as an important measure when the Minister announced it almost 18 months ago.  People are anxious that it should be put in place as quickly as possible to allow the Garda to act against peddlers of drugs, especially Ecstasy, in such establishments.</P>
    <P>The Fraud Offences Bill, which will simplify and update our complex laws against fraud, is also at an advanced stage and we look forward to its publication.  Advances have been made in this area and the Minister of State has mentioned the Bills she expects to come on stream shortly.  We welcome the Bill published yesterday as a progressive one and we should recognise what the Minister has done in the area of tackling crime. We must ensure the work that has already been commenced will continue and for this we need an increase in the number of measures to reduce crime.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to see that crime outside Dublin has been reduced, but we should examine why it has not also diminished in our capital city.  It is generally accepted that one of the main reasons is the need of addicts to steal money to feed their habit.  Much work has been done to counter that, not alone in the legal area but also in education and health.  Many would say that not enough has been done and while we would all subscribe to that view, a start has been made.  The Drug Trafficking Act, 1996, made a substantial impact on trafficking by permitting suspects to be detained for up to seven days as well as placing limits on their right to silence.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, which permits the seizure and disposal of property suspected to be the proceeds of crime, has devastated the role of the drug baron.  At one stage, many of us felt these people were almost untouchable but we now see that if there is a will to beat them, there is a way.</P>
    <P>While the drug barons are being dealt with it is also important to tackle drug peddling at a lower level.  This matter must be clearly examined, especially in the capital where crime levels as a result of drug abuse have not been reduced as they have outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy dealt at length with the issue of prisons.  It is about time it was recognised that one of the biggest prison building programmes in the State is now under way and an additional 800 <Col N="370" /> spaces will come on stream before the end of next year.  In 1996, up to 180 extra prison spaces were provided, which was more than had been created in the previous ten years.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the Prisons Board which is soon to be established to oversee the country's prisons and examine their management structures. Prison reform, including the availability of education, must also be looked at.  Some prisons, including Limerick, have a high level of educational activity and a high participation rate therein.  That is not so in all prisons, however, and we must question that.  The opportunity for and encouragement and motivation of prisoners to reform is of paramount importance in our prison system.</P>
    <P>We must find out why there is such an escalating level of crime.  The situation is a difficult one and we have debated it at length in this House. We must not only dwell on how to control crime or how to respond to the criminal; we must also ensure that crime does not occur.  If one examines criminal activity and the sections of society from which criminals mostly come, one can see that certain types of crime emanate in deprived areas. If we are to tackle that we must eliminate deprivation. It is a social necessity to do so.</P>
    <P>We must treat all our citizens equally but we are not doing so in deprived areas where residents suffer alienation.  This results in criminal activity and the State and legislations must accept some of the blame for that.  We cannot run away from our responsibilities in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a small but important step on the road to criminal law reform.  I am impressed by the Minister's handling of the Bill in the Lower House and her words, particularly regarding the amendments that she intends to take.  It is in that spirit that I wish to concentrate on one aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>While this is an important though small step, putting the right laws in place is only part of what needs to be done with the justice system.  Some say it is not even the most important part.  Properly administering the law is at least as important. Many believe that the administration of justice is chronically deficient.</P>
      <P>I have always been impressed by how the average citizen in the United States seems to be more law abiding, have more respect for the law and have more recognition for misdemeanours than we have.  I was in Columbus, Ohio, and we took a wrong turn.  I was the navigator, not the driver, and I pointed out the road to Cleveland.  It turned out to be wrong road and when I realised this I suggested we do a U-turn.  There was plenty of room for a U-turn but the driver went 22 miles out of his way rather than make a U-turn because he said it was against the law.  I cannot picture that happening in Ireland.  I cannot picture myself sticking as rigidly to that law.  I was demoted from navigator to the back seat immediately afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> Is there anything in the administration of law which plays a part in our lack of respect for it? Many believe we are not administration such as this very well.  When discussing legislation such as this we would be failing in our duty if we did not pay attention to what will actually happen to the legislation after it is passed.  How will this Bill be managed? I have tried to look at many of the Bills which pass through this House from a management point of view to see what is best practice. No matter what good laws the Minister proposes or we pass, if they are not administered well, we are failing in the major part of the task that faces us.  If any part of our public service demands to be well managed it is the justice system.  The civil rights of many people depend on it as does the safety and well being of citizens.</P>
    <P>However, over the past few years we have seen shocking cases of mismanagement in key areas of the justice system.  Last week we saw the consultant's report into the Chief State Solicitor's Office. Earlier we heard of problems with the Office of Public Prosecutions.  We all know of the difficulties that arose in the Attorney General's Office two years ago, problems to which this Government owes its existence.  Last autumn we had the incredible incident of a judge not being properly informed that he had been taken off the Special Criminal Court.  This is not just an absence of best practice but bad management.  Good laws and bad management result in bad justice.  Our justice system needs a complete management shake up.</P>
    <P>There is hardly any point in us crossing the ts and dotting the is as we have been doing with this legislation if the management of justice is not up to the job.  It is focusing the energy on the wrong place.  I am not suggesting that we do not put energy into that, but we must not focus entirely on that issue and relieve ourselves from focusing on the management of justice.</P>
    <P>The four problems I have mentioned are not isolated.  They are not exceptions that can be swept under the carpet and forgotten.  They are a symptom of a system that has failed to keep step with the times and demands that are placed on it.</P>
    <P>Why has this happened?  Whenever a problem has arisen it has always been blamed on a lack of resources.  We are told that all these organs of State are hopelessly over-burdened and they have been starved of the resources necessary to modernise and to do the job properly.  I am sure there is some truth in this because change does cost money.  It seems finding money to administer justice is a very low priority in the national pecking order.</P>
    <P>I visited Wheatfield prison last year.  I was very impressed at how the system works.  I had never been to a prison before.  It is an example of how money has been invested and the system works. This is a contrast to what happens in Mountjoy. When we spoke in the House last year about the conditions in Mountjoy it was clear that spending money on prisons is not a priority.  The same seems to apply to the entire justice system.  Why <Col N="372" /> is this so?  Crime is a very hot issue in every part of the country as every politician knows.  It has been very high on most people's agenda for a number of years but despite that, we have systematically under-resourced the whole system of justice. The time has come to make the connection between the two.  If we are serious about justice we have to grasp the nettle and resource it properly and that calls for some hard decisions.  From what would we take the money?  Until now we have been passing over the justice system in the queue for spending.  We cannot continue to do that.</P>
    <P>The system has become so under-resourced because people did not know what was going on. We all assumed that our justice system was up to the job.  We concentrated on things like putting more gardaí on the streets and equipping them properly.  There have been steps taken in that direction.  We all assumed it was a question of modernising and adding to our laws.  Hence the Bill now under discussion.  What we did not recognise was the problem with the system itself. Now we know.  We have had enough straws in the wind to thatch a big house.</P>
    <P>As we talk about legislation we must ask ourselves if we are creating an illusion of progress by passing such legislation.  I welcome the Bill and the Minister's preparedness to accept amendments. I look forward to a healthy debate.  Of course we need better law but we also need to manage that law much better than we are doing now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, to the House.  While I apreciate the concerns raised by Senator Quinn regarding the administration of justice, we have to remember that the primary responsibility of Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann is legislation.  As legislators we are bound to introduce laws and it is a matter for Government to deal with administration of those laws.</P>
      <P>I share the Senator's concerns about where priorities should lie.  The administration of justice was neglected in the past.  The courts were bogged down to a great extent.  However, legislation was needed to allow the Government appoint 23 new judges.  We have appointed civilians to assist gardaí and legislation has released more gardaí onto the streets rather than sitting in courtrooms all day.  These are means by which the system and administration of justice have been made more effective and efficient.  That has been achieved through a combination of factors in terms of legislation passed in both Houses in recent years and the Government's commitment to tackling crime.  I think we are going in the right direction though there is still much to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Bill, I have raised a personal concern in this House on a previous occasion.  As the Labour Party spokesperson on Justice, I can only say that we have been bombarded with legislation in the areas of crime and justice.  I am concerned that, with hindsight, we may come across <Col N="373" /> some anomalies in this new legislation and see some gaps in it.  Where it may have been more appropriate to deal with certain areas in a previous BIll, these areas are now being stuck at the end of the subsequent Bill which deals with justice generally.  I am concerned that the Department of Justice would exercise some role in reviewing all that has been done in recent years in this area.  I think it is important that we do not adopt a piecemeal approach to what is an important area of law.</P>
    <P>We are under pressure in as much as the legislation is certainly needed.  Dealing with crime and drugs, as this Government has done, required huge changes in our legal system and in our criminal law and I welcome the implementation of these changes.  It is also important that the Department of Justice assures us that legislation is being monitored in terms of knowing what has already been dealt with and provided for and also what remains to be done.  That is an important role which must be taken on board.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Bill is essentially a legal Bill and therefore for some speakers to talk generally about crime and the administration of justice in our society is to wander from the point.  This Bill deals with legal terms and legal aspects of the current criminal justice system in Ireland.  While the Bill may not be a priority in terms of law, it is nonetheless important.  Ireland does not seem to have considered it to be a priority when it has taken so long to bring this legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas; I was not even born when the legislation was changed in England and now some 30 years later, we are getting around to dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Our laws should not be archaic; we should not simply update our laws for the sake of being seen to be a modern society but we should be improving our laws.  Our laws should be recognisable and understandable to the society for which they are provided.  If one was to ask somebody on the street what is the difference between a felony and a misdemeanour, I suspect they would not know. It is important to abolish these old Victorian distinctions.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Bill, by nature, is messy in some ways.  When distinctions, such as that between a felony and a misdemeanour, are abolished the fallout must be dealt with and the fallout is that crimes, such as the commission of a felony, become obsolete and are tackled in another way through this legislation.  In that sense we have achieved an improvement of our laws, not a mere updating of them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of corporal punishment and penal servitude; the days of the chain gang are over, and rightly so.  I do not think slave labour, under any guise, should be condoned. However, the notion of community service is a valuable one.  Senator Mulcahy seemed to be on the brink of going for the &ldquo;hang 'em and flog 'em&rdquo; approach, though he seemed afraid to say exactly that; at the same time he tried to raise the point that there should be other ways of punishing <Col N="374" /> our criminals.  There are two aspects to that: first, the law should, where possible, seek to compensate the victim of crime to a greater extent and, second, it would be useful in terms of benefit to society and in terms of rehabilitating the prisoner to use community service more.  I think community service is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Mulcahy who said that remission should be reduced to a blanket 15 per cent of a sentence.  I do not agree with that; I believe one has to provide incentives for rehabilitation. The option should always be there.  Where it is not covered by this Bill, the issue could be dealt with on another occasion.</P>
    <P>In relation to the rescission of the Whipping Act of 1812 and the Garrotting Act of 1863, it is time they were taken off our Statute Book.  No such legislation has a place in modern society and, in any event, they have not been used.  We should recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides the power of arrest to a garda where he or she may not actually hold the warrant or the order for committal at a particular time even though they may know that such a warrant or order exists.  It is pointless that our gardaí would be hampered in carrying out their duties because of that technicality.  Section 5 is very practical and allows a necessary job to be done. This is in line with previous provisions in similar legislation.  It is important that the legislation provides a specific requirement, relating to the production of a warrant as soon as possible in the interests of justice and fairness.</P>
    <P>Section 6 purports to clarify existing common law rules in relation to the right of entry in order to effect an arrest.  I noted that this point caused furore in the Dáil debate in terms of whether it was constitutional.  It seems that if the Labour Party were to raise such an argument we would be accused of being soft on crime whereas it was acceptable and legitimate for Fianna Fáil to make the same argument.  I think the provision is balanced and while I wonder whether a citizen would bother to effect a right of arrest, I accept that the right is available to security guards and such people whose job it is to do so.  In practical terms, while a citizen has a right to arrest, it does not necessarily follow that there is a right to detain or question somebody.  I assume that in those circumstances, the gardaí must be called in and, in turn, effect an arrest under which detention and questioning can take place.  I would welcome clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>Under the present law, the right to arrest depended on whether the suspect could be classified as a principal in the first degree, a principal in the second degree, an accessory before the fact or an accessory after the fact.  These are confusing terms and I think they are obsolete.  I welcome the abolition of those distinctions in section 7 of the Bill.  The abolition of those distinctions allows the law to treat all the accused persons involved in a crime on an equal footing and subsequently let the justice system and the evidence before the <Col N="375" /> court decide on their crime, that is, whether they are guilty of aiding, abetting or carrying out the offence.</P>
    <P>One of the main provisions of the Bill is in section 2 which provides for power of arrest without a warrant.  This existed under common law in respect of felonies but did not exist in respect of misdemeanours.  I welcome the new category of arrestable offences.  It had been criticised in the Dáil debate in so far as it would be difficult to define what constituted an arrestable offence.  At least the section does away with the nonsense of a felony being something like stealing a few pence &mdash; which as a felony was deemed serious &mdash; while a sexual crime might be classified as a misdemeanour. It is more sensible that, whatever term be given to it, it classifies serious offences, which involve a term of more than five years or more severe penalties, previously known as felonies or serious misdemeanours, as arrestable offences.  That is a practical change.</P>
    <P>The new offence created in section 7 is that of impending the apprehension or prosecution of a person who has committed an arrestable offence. It replaces the common law offence of being an accessory after the fact.  This is not just disposing of obsolete terms but is dealing with the repercussions of that disposal.  It is a novel and good idea to introduce a graduated scale of penalties depending on the seriousness of the principal offence.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the misprision of a felony, which is another aspect of the fallout from abolishing the old distinction and is replaced by the new offence of concealing an arrestable offence. If nothing else, it is clearer in meaning.  It makes it a crime to accept a bribe not to disclose relevant information which would assist in the prosecution or conviction of an offender; I welcome that as a good move.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the general rule on alternative verdicts relating to all indictable offences. That is again consequential on the abolition of the old distinction and makes certain the choices of verdicts available and applicable in a case of murder and capital murder.  I am not sure if the legislation is as clear as it could be in this area, but it is welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 10 limits to two years the maximum term of imprisonment applicable in respect of indictable offences.  For some reason, these were not given a maximum penalty before, so it is sensible to introduce this change rather than allowing the possibility of someone being arrested for a relatively minor offence with no maximum penalty.</P>
    <P>The power to impose fines as part of a conviction is a good idea.  It raises the point of a recent case the facts of which I am not quite sure.  A huge fine or debt was due and the defendant seems to have been given the option to serve one month in prison or repay the fine or debt.  Being the sensible man he was, he naturally opted to spend a lovely month in the new prison in <Col N="376" /> Castlerea and I am sure he enjoyed himself.  He thus managed to write off a debt or fine of £20,000 to £30,000.  If I were given the same choice, I would gladly take a holiday in Castlerea Prison rather than pay that amount of money.</P>
    <P>That is a serious aspect of justice doing wrong because the person to whom the money was owed was not recompensed by someone spending one month in Castlerea Prison.  Furthermore, the wrongdoer was not punished.  Until that balance is achieved, we must question the administration of justice.  It is crucial that victims be recompensed as far as possible and the perpetrator or wrongdoer punished.  I do not agree that incarceration is the only way someone can be punished. The aspect of community service to which I referred earlier is much more useful.  We must examine in the long-term whether prisons are rehabilitating anyone and serving society well.  Be that as it may, the wrongdoer should be punished.</P>
    <P>There seems to have been a miscarriage of justice in this case and I would rather that type of anomaly was dealt with than other more minor aspects of the law.  However, whether that could have been dealt with in this Bill is another matter. It often puzzles me why certain matters are covered under a criminal law Bill and others under a criminal justice Bill.  We must assess what we are doing with legislation in this area.  It is complicated, of necessity, but it is worth doing right.</P>
    <P>This is essentially a legal Bill which deals with clarification and updating of the law in a sensible manner and I welcome it for those reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had huge volumes of legislation recently, yet the criminals take holidays abroad and live in the lap of luxury; there are more criminals and problems on our streets and we are doing nothing about them. Despite all the brains in Government, criminals with plenty of money seem to find loopholes in the law.  The best known criminal in the country, who once lived in luxury, is challenging the constitutionality of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, and may possibly find loopholes in it.  Why do we not send such Bills to the Supreme Court to ensure their constitutionality?  A loophole may <Col N="377" /> be found in the Criminal Assets Bureau Act which could result in the decision being appealed to the European Court of Human Rights thus delaying the work of the bureau for two to three years.  We were assured that every loophole in the Act had been covered but I am afraid the bureau will now achieve very little.</P>
      <P>The volume of legislation we are passing is just a smokescreen.  It does not solve problems or jail criminals.  I could not agree more with Senator Gallagher when she said that someone can opt for a few weeks in a palatial residence &mdash; a jail in modern terminology &mdash; rather than pay their fine or debt to compensate their victims.</P>
      <P>A poor woman was recently prosecuted for non-payment of either a telephone bill or a television licence, but she was sentenced to either two weeks in jail or to pay a certain amount of money.  She opted for jail because she could not pay the fine.  She was released within two hours. It was a waste of Garda time to bring that woman from her home to Mountjoy Prison.  A taxi also had to be paid to bring her home.  This happens all the time.  When will it stop?  That woman was no threat to society, but what crimes may have been committed while three or four gardaí in a squad car brought her to Mountjoy?  How much time was wasted in attempting to collect the money due?</P>
      <P>The management of the system is deplorable. Anyone in business who gives credit and realises there is not a hope of getting it back writes it off as a bad debt.  They do not waste time and money going after it.  Everyone in this country receives a pay packet whether it is social welfare or wages. There should be a system whereby fines could be stopped from a person's pay.  Even if that would take two years, it should be done.  Valuable Garda time should not be wasted.  The amount of time spent on the paperwork and documentation involved is ridiculous.  We should be serious about passing laws and ensure they are constitution proof.</P>
      <P>There is a question about the constitutionality of this Bill which Senator Gallagher said Fianna Fáil fumed about in the other House.  If Senator Gallagher read all of Deputy O'Donoghue's contribution, she would have seen he went on to state on 16 May 1996 as reported at Col.1283, vol. 465:</P>
      <P>The Constitution is clear: &ldquo;The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered, save in accordance with law&rdquo;.  The manner in which the courts have interpreted that article of the Constitution is also clear.  Mr. Justice Walsh in The People v. O'Brien [1965] Irish Reports 142 at page 170 stated:</P>
      <P>In article 40 of the Constitution, the State has undertaken to defend and vindicate the inviolability of the constitutional rights of the citizen.  The defence and vindication of the constitutional rights of the citizen is a duty superior to that of trying such a citizen for a criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> That is clear yet the Minister seems to be going ahead with legislation which is obviously unconstitutional. When will this be sorted out?  It is dangerous to say that any house can be raided without a warrant if a garda says so.  A warrant will be issued.  It is surely a simple job to put a house under surveillance.  It does not take long to bring a warrant from a Superintendent's office in any district to where it is needed.  With modern technology, someone can make a telephone call to say they suspect something is happening in a house wherever it may be.  When the warrant is delivered, the house can be kept under surveillance. People's rights cannot be violated.  We have seen many miscarriages of justice in Britain. Do we want to be in a similar position here?  We have a Constitution and either we uphold it or we do not.</P>
    <P>Criminals are riding on the crest of a wave.  The Minister mentioned the different bills which are being formulated, the Bail Bill, the Licensing (Drugs) Bill, the Fraud Offences Bill, etc.  We have listened to this for the last few years but what are we doing about it?  Bail legislation is a joke.  Everybody knows people on bail are committing offences.  Why was the Bail Bill not a priority?  Why was it not introduced a long time ago?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil introduced a Bill which was not accepted by the Government.  That is its prerogative. Why not amend the Bill where it thinks it is weak or dilute it where it thinks it may be too strong?  I cannot see why the Government cannot introduce it.  Many people are committing crime while on bail and in many cases they are minor crimes.  My business was broken into.  It is a shock to see everything scattered all over the place and windows smashed.  Yet when those who commit these crimes are caught, they are released on bail. They then commit more crime because they know that when they come before the court their sentences will run concurrently, not consecutively. They know they can do as much damage as they like because they will be penalised only for the first crime.  We are not doing anything about this.</P>
    <P>Many people are in jail because they committed minor offences.  Such people should not be in jail.  We waste time dragging them to Mountjoy Prison, giving them a taxi fare to the railway station and a train ticket back home.  They are at home by the time the taximan employed to drive them is at home.</P>

      <P>Is anything being done to extradite drug barons who are now living abroad?  Are they being brought back to face the law?  It took the British justice system and the British Government to bring one of our prime suspects before the courts and put him behind bars.  The Irish justice system did not imprison him.  He was released.  However, the British justice system did not release him and he is now where he should be.  If our laws are being implemented, why are things of this nature allowed to happen?  Why are the Irish authorities not seeking extradition warrants to bring such people back to face trial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently read an article about a criminal in Mountjoy Prison who was supplied with a computer. He was running his business from within the prison.  Drugs are freely available in Mountjoy Prison.  Some people have stated that if that were not the case the prison system would become a time-bomb waiting to explode.  In other words, criminals are being kept quiet and a blind eye is being turned to the availability of drugs in our prisons.  Is that the way it should be?  On previous <Col N="381" /> occasions I stated that young offenders who are drug addicts should be placed in special units to receive treatment rather than being treated as criminals.  Drug barons and criminals should be put behind bars.  However, we are imprisoning drug addicts who know no better and are trying to feed their habits.  It appears to be easier for them to obtain drugs while in prison than it is when they are at liberty.</P>
    <P>Young criminals have stated that they were drug free on entering Mountjoy Prison but by the time they were released they had become addicts. Is this the correct way to operate the justice system or rid the country of crime?  If it is, God help Ireland.  That is not the way the system should operate.  We will only come to grips with the crime problem when laws that are 100 per cent constitutional are introduced, criminals are imprisoned and people are held answerable before the courts for each crime they commit rather than taking five or six of them together.</P>

      <P>The most positive statement made during the debate is that criminals in Mountjoy Prison are using computers and running businesses.  That is the most encouraging remark about the prison system I have heard for many years because such action represents true rehabilitation.  We can look forward to those involved in these activities becoming useful members of society when they are released from prison.  The chances of their becoming recidivists or habitual offenders will be substantially reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many ways to approach this issue.  I could refer to the fact that my house has been burgled between 11 and 13 times and respond on an emotional level.  It would be easy to do so and <Col N="382" /> perhaps it is important to have such an experience, although I do not know whether it has made me any wiser in terms of how to deal with law and order but it has made me wiser about dealing with insurance companies.  I no longer search for stolen property at the local market because the last thing I want to do is to get back some soiled, used property and explain that to an insurance company.</P>
    <P>The problems experienced by victims of crime can be dealt with in many ways.  However, I will concentrate on two issues concerning the general philosophical basis behind our approach to law and order and crime.  Law and order is an election issue and is targeted by political parties as an area where they can buy, sell or gain votes.  That is a tragedy because it plays on and exploits people's inner fears.  There is no doubt that some people lock themselves into their homes at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. and are afraid to leave the following day.  As public representatives, we have a duty to rectify that.</P>
    <P>Any discussion of this issue which states that these problems began when the Government of the day came to power and will be rectified when a new Government assumes office, is similar to a debate on unemployment &mdash; if it improves we take the credit and if it becomes worse we blame outside forces.  The reality is that crime is on the increase.  Additional constraints are being put in place but, nonetheless, crime is becoming a way of life.  There is a huge underclass in Irish society which occupies the twilight world of criminality and these people live on the wrong side of the law.  Ten years ago such people could be seen drinking a pint at the end of the day but now they holiday abroad on five or six occasions during the year.  The people at the top, the crime bosses, tend to make a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>Tighter, stricter and more focused legislation is required.  In that context, I welcome the Bill because it recognises the loopholes that drive people to distraction and which need to be closed.  Rightly or wrongly, the Bill attempts to do that.  However, despite my being a victim of crime and the fact that people are afraid to walk down O'Connell Street during the day, where is the balance between law and order on one hand, and freedom on the other?  Everyone responds to a situation where a person sentenced to a prison term in Mountjoy Prison is released and sent home in a taxi having been given a meal.  Such stories make great headlines for the tabloids and people are rightly outraged.  It must have a devastating effect on the victims of crime to see such people being released.  This is similar to people who are victims of crimes against the person seeing the perpetrator walk free.  This problem must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the law is for society to respond in a processed and organised way to crimes or actions against the common good.  These are dealt with in various ways, including imprisonment. The main aspect of imprisonment is that it is a <Col N="383" /> deprivation of liberty.  Prisoners can have multi-channel television, computers and a library in their cell and the best of food but every evening the cell doors bang shut and they do not get out until the following morning.  That is what imprisonment is about and it is not discussed when dealing with the prison system.  I take as much responsibility as others on this.  What should happen in prison?  The question of rehabilitation is crucially important to try and prepare people to go back into society and be of use there.</P>
    <P>People who talk about prisoner's rights forget one element.  A prisoner does not have and cannot have the same rights as an ordinary citizen. That must be part of imprisonment.  It is punishment, not revenge, where society metes out punishment in a disciplined and ordered way.  All discussions on imprisonment should include that element.  There are others also such as the constraints of living in prison.  Prisoner's rights are not the same as those of a normal individual.  The Constitution allows a person to be deprived of liberty, notwithstanding <i>habeus corpus.</i>  Nonetheless, incarcerating somebody through the due process of law is a deprivation of rights.  Other rights are impinged upon while that person is imprisoned and punished.</P>
    <P>What bothers me about the system of law and imprisonment is that too much of our prison population comes from well known city areas in particular.  We must ask ourselves a question, even after everything that Senator Farrell has said about the prison system &mdash; and he is right &mdash; and everything that has been said in the House about weaknesses in the law.  Is there something wrong with society when, having seen a person's address and because they come from the middle of a sprawling housing estate on the edge of a large conurbation, we can say there is a 50 per cent chance that person will finish up unemployed, a 30 per cent chance he will become involved in drugs and a 20 per cent chance that he will end up in prison?  There is something wrong when we can make such accurate predictions, or we can carry out a survey among the prison population on where they come from.  It has been done and a preponderance of them come from certain areas and housing estates and from a certain class.</P>
    <P>Why is that?  It is because we have failed them. I speak as an educationalist.  They come through schools where I and the people I represent have taught, but we have failed them because they do not continue from education to qualification to employment and thus to being useful members of society.  They are born in disadvantaged areas, attend under resourced schools and are disadvantaged because of that.  They do not make it at post primary level and finally become more of a cost on the State by being held in prison or addiction clinics.  There must be a better way of spending our money.</P>
    <P>There is no excuse for public representatives looking for media attention justifying vicious <Col N="384" /> crimes on the basis that the person has a disadvantaged background.  They are not two sides of the same coin.  We can ask why is it happening in disadvantaged areas and try to do something about it.  We cannot let that argument go to the point of saying that all they did was knock down three people on a road after stealing a BMW, robbing a house, getting high on drugs, driving at 150 miles per hour.  They killed two people but they had nothing else to do on their housing estate; they were disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>There is no place in society for that type of soft centred liberalism without direction.  That is not the society we want.  We need to look at it from both points of view.  People who break the law have to be punished by the law.  On the other hand we have to look at cause and effect and results and examine where we can break this vicious circle of disadvantage, poverty, drug addiction, imprisonment, reconviction followed by imprisonment etc. There are a number of ways to break it &mdash; the education system, the prison system and the legal system, which includes this Bill.</P>
    <P>Eighteen months ago in this House, I made an impassioned appeal on the Bill dealing with the 1909 incest law where I pointed out the problems being created by the distinction between felony and misdemeanour.  I put down an amendment to have them regarded as one rather than the other and it was accepted by the Minister.  It is an important distinction which allows the more efficient implementation of the law.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand section 6.  It states:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of arresting a person for an arrestable offence or on foot of an order of committal a member of the Garda Síochána may enter (if need be, by use of reasonable force) and search any place (including a dwelling) where that person is or where the member, with reasonable cause, suspects that person to be.</P>
    <P>Reasonable force means reasonable to get in.  If it takes a JCB to knock the door in, that is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Section 5 states:</P>
    <P>A warrant for the arrest of a person or an order of committal may be executed by a member of the Garda Síochána notwithstanding that it is not in the member's possession at the time; but the warrant or order shall be shown to him or her as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>Does the warrant have to be available for execution?  The fact that it is not in the garda's possession does not worry us, but is this <i>ex post facto</i>?  Can the garda execute an arrest without the warrant being in existence? Where is the warrant? That is crucial.  Under section 6 the garda can use reasonable force with reasonable cause. How stringent a test is that?  It may be correct.  I have never understood, not being a legal person, the meaning of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; as it is applied in legislation &mdash; the concepts of a reasonable person and reasonable force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> I very much welcome section 7 of the Bill under which aiding and abetting will become the equivalent of committing the offence.  The person can be charged with the same offence.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 8, which makes it an offence for witnesses to accept bribes or payments not to give evidence.  It will be impossible to implement that.  It would be more difficult to prove that somebody had received money not to give evidence than it would be to prove conspiracy. It is a brown paper bag scenario, and it would not take much to work out where that came from.  I welcome it as a noble aspiration, but it will not work.  It is also an offence &mdash; I do not know if it is a felony or a misdemeanour in past legislation &mdash; not to report a crime.  How does that relate to section 8?  I do not object to this section because people who keep a crime under wraps should be charged with an offence.  Is it not already an offence if someone who is aware of a crime does not report it?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that issue.</P>
    <P>I do not understand many technical parts of this Bill.  However, I welcome it because it will tighten up this area and increase the confidence of people who feel the law is becoming too weak. I hope it works and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about the degree to which I welcome this legislation.  As I heard Senator O'Toole speak, my concerns grew considerably.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a number of Bills have been tided up in this area.  This afternoon I glanced through the Third Schedule &mdash;&ldquo;Enactments Repealed&rdquo;.  It lists the Sunday Observance Act, 1695, which is over 300 years ago.  Perhaps I agree with that Act because I enjoy the Jewish Sabbath when I am in Israel.  There is a great deal to be said for limiting commercial operations on at least one day a week, not necessarily for religious reasons but for spiritual and practical reasons of people's health.  The Criminal Evidence Act, 1710, is also listed, as is the Riot Act, 1787.  It would be a pity if the Riot Act was not read again.  The Vagrancy Act, 1824, the Infant Felons Act, 1840, and the South Australia Act, 1842, which appears to suggest the days when the Micawbers were transported to Australia, are also listed.  This may be a good housekeeping exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having just escaped from the groves of academia, to the great relief of both it and myself, I wonder if it would be a good idea to suggest that the law departments of our universities attempt to examine all our statute law with a view to codifying it.  Napoleon did this with great effect in France under the <i>Le Code Napoleon.</i>  Would it not be refreshing to give the law departments of universities this task for their students?  It would be exciting for students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels to feel they had a real input into making recommendations and getting <Col N="386" /> rid of all this dross and dry and dead wood.  It would also represent a useful and practical interface &mdash; to use an ugly Americanism&mdash; between the world of academia, scholarship, study, practical politics and law.  I do not know if that suggestion could be taken on board, but it is time we attempted to codify the law.</P>
    <P>I take up the gauntlet flung down by Senator O'Toole when he requested information about other legislation in which it is a crime not to report knowledge of a criminal offence.  I am sure the Minister and her adviser will correct me if I am wrong, but Senator O'Toole was probably referring to misprision of felony.  I have always taken an interest in this because it operated, for example, with particular relevance to the 1861 and 1885 Acts.  When speaking out against the operation of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and the Labouchére Amendment, I made the argument that the Labouchére Amendment, which had already been characterised as a blackmailer's charter to criminalise the knowledge of the commission in private of certain specified sexual acts, put all types of categories of people in peril, although they were rarely attacked under the provisions of this law.  For example, I do not know of any situation where a priest who came into possession of information about the criminal activities of a penitent was prosecuted, but I believe that possibility technically existed.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of medical confidentiality. Supposing someone visited a psychiatrist and in the course of therapy confessed to a crime which constituted a felony, would it present a moral dilemma for the psychiatrist?  It would be his responsibility to report it under misprision of felony.  Before the 1861 and 1885 Acts were repealed, there would have been a considerable moral dilemma for someone in the caring profession who came into possession of information about a victimless crime.  Yet they would have been liable for a severe penalty for not referring knowledge of that crime to the prosecuting authorities.</P>
    <P>It is wise that misprision of felony has gone. However, I am not sure that what replaces it is entirely satisfactory.  Section 8 states: &ldquo;Where a person has committed an arrestable offence, any other person who, knowing or believing that the offence of some other arrestable offence has been committed and that he or she has information which might be of material assistance in securing the prosecution or conviction of an offender for it, accepts or agrees to accept ...... shall be guilty of an offence.....&rdquo;.  I wonder if that could be construed as a professional person who received a fee for professional advice.</P>
    <P>I also wonder about other sections of this Bill. Section 7 deals with penalties for assisting offenders.  Senator O'Toole thought this was a good idea.  I am usually persuaded by his argument and rhetoric, but I am not so sure on this occasion.  I recall a situation in the inner city some years ago where a disturbed and possibly vicious criminal took refuge in his mother's apartment. <Col N="387" /> This woman was of a certain age and she was not in good health.  Was that woman guilty of an offence?  Should she have been sent to prison?  It could be construed that she was aiding and abetting by concealing the presence of her relative.  I am sure this could also be extended to spouses. There are unusual psychological pressures on a husband or wife not to disclose the presence or the acts of the other spouse.  That may be regrettable but it is sometimes psychologically understandable. I am unsure about this and it needs to be scrutinised.  For that reason I cannot accord it the wholehearted welcome given by Senator O'Toole.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about sections 5 and 6.  Senator O'Toole was correct in questioning the existence of a warrant and whether a warrant could be described as <i>ex post facto.</i>  However, if one suspects the police or the Judiciary of a conspiracy and being capable of colluding in the production of a warrant, this legislation will not prevent that happening.</P>
    <P>Section 6 invites the Garda to go down a dangerous road.  We have not had much of this type of behaviour by the Garda but we have seen it in the UK and the US.  Many Senators have seen television programmes in which front doors were smashed in, property was damaged beyond repair, children were terrorised and elderly people were pulled from their beds on suspicion of possession of drugs.  At the end of the day nothing was found; the complaint turned out to be mistaken or malicious.  What provision is there for compensation in the Bill?  I do not see any.  I think the Minister is shaking her head.  Would she not agree that there should be a provision for compensation where false information is laid by a spiteful neighbour and this kind of damage is done to property?  I know of situations not far from O'Connell Street where this has happened. I have been recognised as a <i>amicus curiae</i> in a court in Dublin, cross-examined by the Garda and succeeded in getting charges dismissed.  This behaviour can and does exist and I have witnessed it.</P>
    <P>One only has to consider instances in Belfast where British soldiers, looking for guns, burst into peoples' houses, ripped up kitchen floors, smashed cement, pulled out wardrobes and terrorised people.  This had a very negative impact in the area.  Much of the crime addressed by this Bill is concentrated in certain areas and there is a possibility of the alienation of the Garda if a similar practice becomes commonplace.  It must be exercised with caution, otherwise we will further the ghettoisation of this city.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled by the phrase &ldquo;arrestable offences&rdquo;.  I taught English in Trinity College but when I see &ldquo;arrestable offences&rdquo; I wonder what is on the other side?  Are there non-arrestable offences which are not covered by this legislation but for which there remains a power of arrest? We are in cloud cuckoo land in which we have arrestable offences and non-arrestable offences <Col N="388" /> for which one can be arrested.  Is this the case?  I feel as if I have been eating magic mushrooms.  I hasten to add that I have never done so because it is an indictable offence and I could have my front door smashed in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving into a police state. I get a hallucinatory feeling when I discover that there are arrestable offences and non-arrestable offences for which one can be arrested.  Perhaps this is a question of language but I would be miffed if I was arrested for a non-arrestable offence.  It would be more than a linguistic discomfort.</P>
      <P>It would be useful if we knew what these offences were.  The old felony offence was any offence which carried a penalty of more than three years.  This Bill will mean any offence with a penalty of up to five years.  Despite the tidying up, these offences could include trivialities such as allowing one's dog to foul the path.  There are anomalies, and once one introduces this concept into law there is a moral responsibility to scrutinise the offences which are covered so that trivial cases can be excluded.</P>
      <P>I applaud any legislation which reduces crime. However, crime statistics are reducing.  Senator O'Toole is incorrect when he expresses horror at the increase in crime.  This has been repeatedly stated by that well known authority.  Mr. Vincent Browne, on the electric wireless, so it must be true.  He has given facts and figures to support this.  However, there is a popular misconception that crime rates are rising.  This is partly due to the sensational reporting of certain crimes.  It is also because the category of crime which appears to be on the increase is very unpleasant.</P>
      <P>I remember when it was sensational if there was a murder in Dublin.  Now such cases are on the back page along with the latest football results.  A murder has to be spectacularly grisly if it is to make the front page.  We are right to be worried about this and it relates to two elements which were not in evidence when I was younger. First, the advent of hard drugs in the inner city and the creation of enormous wealth and a sense of territory on the part of criminals which they defend in a manner which would make Chicago gangsters pale.  Second, the conditioning of people to accept violence by the maligned presence of people committed to groups such as the Provisional IRA.</P>
      <P>I would welcome this Bill if it seriously addressed crime.  However, I am not convinced it has or will greatly reduce the incidence of crime by its operation and I am concerned at how some sections will operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. The question of arrestable offences was raised.  It is defined so as to cover serious offences, that is, those for which a person is liable <Col N="389" /> to at least five years imprisonment.  This will cover most existing felonies and more serious misdemeanours.  The need for a category of arrestable offences is that the abolition of the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours makes redundant the common law power of arrest without warrant in respect of felonies.  To replace this, section 4 will allow arrest without warrant in respect of arrestable offences.  The selection of five years imprisonment is an appropriate benchmark for identifying offences which are sufficiently serious to justify a power of arrest without warrant.  In effect, after the enactment of the Bill these will be the categories of offences, arrestable and other offences, which attract a maximum prison sentence of less than five years. We are distinguishing between two different categories, that is, those which attract penalties over five years and those which attract penalties less than five years.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators referred to section 6. While it could be argued that on balance the existing section 6 strikes the right balance between the protection of society from crime and individual rights under the Constitution, as I said before, the Minister for Justice has decided to amend the section to take account of the concerns raised today and during the debate in the Dáil. Section 11 relates to the abolition of penal servitude. Senator Mulcahy was perhaps engaging in what happens close to an election, political coat trailing and weasel words, in that he was concerned about the abolition of whipping but he did not have the courage to say if he was in favour of it.  I listened to one of his colleagues in the Dáil last week list the publications available in Mountjoy.  The Deputy was very exercised that <i>Beano</i> and <i>The Dandy</i> were on the list and wanted to deprive prisoners, most of whom we would hope would learn to read and write during their time in prison.  He was not so down on <i>Gardener's World</i> or <i>Carpentry Today</i>, but <i>Beano</i> and <i>The Dandy</i> offended him.</P>
      <P>As regards queries on whipping and the elimination of categories of physical punishment, it is a mark of progress in our society that we should consign such penalties to the dustbin.  We may look at countries such as Iran, and Senator Mulcahy mentioned Singapore as being a particularly admirable place.  While I admire Singapore's economic performance as a little island like Ireland, such punishment does not have a place in Irish penal reform.  I was the victim of a burglary last week.  After being the victim of a crime, we all give vent to feelings of rage and anger, which is understandable, but in the cold light of day most would be glad whipping has been abolished and would agree it had little to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy suggested the Labour Party was soft on crime.  However, we sought a particular mechanism to which the Minister for Justice agreed and which was introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn. While prison offers a severe punishment &mdash;<Col N="390" /> Senator O'Toole spoke about the loss of liberty &mdash; it is my view, and I come from the centre of Dublin, that the loss of money, involving as it does the loss of status to criminals, is probably as severe a penalty as imprisonment.  The introduction of the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill therefore was one of the most fundamental reforms introduced to the Dáil or Seanad in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>Members will have read about those alleged to be connected to the dreadful murder of Veronica Guerin boasting of their crimes and taking exotic holidays.  Law abiding people who live close to them, perhaps in disadvantaged parts of Dublin, must tolerate the offence of seeing these people, their associates, girlfriends and wives flaunt their wealth.  The introduction of the Criminal Assets Bureau will do more to strike fear into the hearts of criminals and potential criminals than any amount of whipping by Senator Mulcahy or the physical punishment wing of Fianna Fáil.  The IRA has tried that in the North and we have rightly condemned it.  Senator Mulcahy should not be too tempted by seemingly quick fix solutions from other societies.</P>
    <P>On the administration of justice and points made by Senator Quinn, I agree with what he said.  We inherited a justice system on Independence which we have used since then without making too many dramatic changes.  While many elements of our society have changed, the cirminal justice system has not changed to take account of organised crime and drug crimes, particularly the fabulous amounts of money which may be made from such crime.  There is a recognition by all parties and a determination by this Government to overhaul the justice system and to bring it up to date to reflect the difficulties we face.  Senator Neville was right when he said crime is decreasing, particularly rural crime. Crime in the west decreased by about 11 per cent last year.  However, the level of crime in Dublin remains high.  Nonetheless, the viciousness of some crimes committed and the degree of insecurity felt by people, particularly the old and women, must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Quinn's convictions that the criminal justice system should be reformed.  The process of reform is underway and we are currently working on proposals on the court service. Recently, a strategic management initiative was undertaken in the Department of Justice.  A fundamental review of the Garda Síochána is taking place on how it allocates its time, how its members are trained and on the funding it receives.  An expert group is working on the prisons.</P>
    <P>I would point out to Senator Quinn that while Wheatfield Prison is the most state of the art prison in the service, serious questions must be asked.  Although it does not suffer from the disadvantages faced by Mountjoy or overcrowding, it also has drugs.  It has modern facilities to prevent the entry of drugs and considerable educational <Col N="391" /> facilities and resources for inmates, but it is also developing a drug problem.  We must ask serious questions about the rehabilitative structures in place in prison and the offer made to prisoners in relation to rehabilitation from drugs.  That is not amenable to a legislative solution.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville spoke about the work of the Minister for Justice and it must be acknowledged that she has attempted to cover a comprehensive range of reforms within her Department.  I share his views about rehabilitation.  It is good to see the distinction between hard labour, penal servitude and imprisonment coming to an end. However, a legitimate query can be raised in this regard.  If prisoners can be given encouragement and inducements to work, some of the fruits of that work or the money made from it should go to the victims of crime for the sake of the well-being of society.</P>
    <P>In looking at the circle of reforms that have been introduced, one area remains to be dealt with, and that is how the system deals with victims. Many victims are left bereft and feeling that the justice system has not addressed their needs. This is particularly true in the case of crimes against women.  Although a woman who has been assaulted or is the victim of rape might bravely go to court, she often feels afterwards that the court ordeal was equivalent to the ordeal of the crime itself.  No recompense is ever made by sexual offenders, except on an indivual basis, to those against whom they have offended.  That issue must also be examined.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Norris asked about a warrant under section 5.  The warrant for the arrest must be in force.  They also asked about the phrase &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; in section 6.  That term is well defined in case law relating to various powers, including the power of arrest.  Section 8 abolishes the offence of not reporting a felony.  It is replaced by the more narrow offence of accepting a bribe to conceal an offence.  Time will tell whether it will be possible to prosecute that offence and how many such offences will come to light.  Senator O'Toole and Senator Norris expressed concern about that section.  Prosecutions under that section must be referred first to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That is a good safeguard against the over-zealous use of the new offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to ensure the maximum equality of access to viewers throughout Ireland for television programming.  In pursuance of this, Seanad Éireann also requests the Government to take appropriate action to ensure that exclusive rights to major Irish sporting events are not exercised by broadcasters in such a way as to deprive any sizeable proportion of the Irish public of the possibility of viewing such events live on television; and also that the Government develop a just and coherent response to the situation currently obtaining regarding MMDS relay television transmission.</P>
      <P>When I realised that the Independent Group's Private Members' time had come up once more I was undecided between a number of different areas of interest.  I have already on several occasions raised the question of the Luas and the need to ensure that provision is made for the central section of this system to be placed underground in the city of Dublin.  There was also the question of the licensing laws and their application, especially in this city.  However, the Leader of the House, Senator Manning, has graciously indicated that it is his intention to take these two items in the form of a special debate.</P>
      <P>This leaves me free to select another subject which I consider of equal importance, although on first glance it may appear that I am uncharacteristically paying court to the popular imagination. This is the question of the need for the Government to guarantee access to television entertainment, especially sports broadcasts, to all citizens on an equal basis.  A subsidiary but related matter is the question of the conflict between local communities, especially in the west, who have employed deflectors to relay the signals of British state and commercial television stations in areas where these signals are not normally received on the one hand and the commercial owners of MMDS licences on the other. Underlying these propositions is a very important principle&mdash;that of the right of access to information, including information of a recreational nature, of all citizens and the fact that this right is increasingly coming under pressure, especially from multinational media groups such as the Sky empire of Mr. Rupert Murdoch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significance of this can be illustrated by simple reference to the growth of television set ownership in the State.  By 1995 a comparative survey of household facilities showed that 88 per cent of households had a vacuum cleaner, 85.6 per cent had a dishwasher, 99 per cent had piped could water, 96 per cent had a bath or shower, 97.2 per cent had an internal toilet and 99.8 per cent had electricity.  These may all be seen as household necessities.  However, with regard to television sets which were once regarded as luxuries, 88.2 per cent owned a colour television set, 6.7 <Col N="393" /> per cent rented a colour television set, 3.8 per cent owned a monochrome set and 0.2 per cent rented a monochrome set.  Adding these figures together, 98.9 per cent of Irish households possessed television receiving apparatus.  This compares with a mere 51.1 per cent in possession of motorcars.  In other words, television has become virtually a universal medium of communication in the country over a comparatively short period of time.  Whoever controls that medium is in an exceedingly powerful position, for he or she controls the context within which ideas are formed and values created which colours our every decision.</P>
    <P>Sport may appear to be at the lighter end of this spectrum but it is a very significant element for a number of reasons.  The first, of course, is the immense popularity of sport&mdash;a phenomenon which is of universal and not of particularly Irish significance.  Sport has always been popular, both for participants and spectators.  However, although the capacity for participation in team events has some natural limitations, there seems to be no limit to the capacity for expansion in terms of a national and international viewing audience due to the rapid development of technology. As a document issued this month by the European Commission indicates:</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Sector has undergone profound changes over the last decade, due in large part to technology driven development. Cable and satellite channels have multiplied. The advent of digital transmission technology and, in particular, the emergence of multi channel digital packages transmitted by satellite is producing a dramatic increase in the number of channels available.  These developments have brought a new transnational dimension to the practice of buying and selling sports rights.</P>
    <P>This clearly has a significant commercial aspect and the undisciplined and unmonitored operation of market forces in this area should give rise to grave concern.</P>
    <P>We have already begun to see the malignant impact of the intervention of groups such as Mr. Murdoch's BSkyB television on European and Irish sport.  Just as the Murdoch group acquired and corrupted a great deal of the British print media by appealing to the lowest instincts of the reader and applying the lowest journalistic standards and has spread its tentacles into this country, undercutting Irish newspapers and winning a sizeable market share on the back of the popularity and economic pay off of its sports pages, we are now feeling the thin end of Mr. Murdoch's televisual wedge through the attempts of his empire to gain exclusive rights over major sporting events in Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>In this context I found it astonishing to hear the President of the GAA, Mr. Boothman, having claimed for his organisation the status of a religion, demand also absolute freedom to deal with the reality of market forces in the best financial <Col N="394" /> interests of the GAA.  This was in the context of being asked about possible negotiations with Murdoch's Sky Television.  Having heard this my last illusion of Irish innocence is gone.  For the organisation that once penalised its members not merely for playing but for attending &ldquo;foreign games&rdquo; to contemplate selling exclusive rights to its major sporting events to an Australian-British-American baron of the gutter press beggars belief.  It is as if the self-styled keeper of the national ethos had decided to feed the noble hound of Banba to a mongrel fox.</P>
    <P>We are already receiving the incidental backwash of these developments.  For example, &ldquo;Live Line&rdquo; on RTÉ Radio has been full of vociferous complaints against the growing commercialisation of sport, the appropriation of sizeable blocks of tickets to corporate sponsors and the adverse impact of monopoly tactics in broadcasting in general on the recreational outlets available to ordinary citizens.  Recent debates have included a very lively session in which the overwhelming majority of callers objected vehemently to any suggestion of a monopoly sale to Murdoch of any of the GAA's sporting events.  Listeners also heard some representative stories of the impact on an individual basis of the commercial policies of these communications empires.  For example, one man telephoned to say that he had bought a ticket for his 14 year old son to see his favourite league side play a soccer match in England.  The ticket and airline tickets were purchased six months in advance and hotel accommodation was arranged.  Come the day of the match, however, they discovered that they were to be disappointed as there had been an unannounced rescheduling of the match in order to fit in with the programming requirements of commercial television. Such inconvenience to the public is but the tip of the iceberg.  Indeed my response to these events makes me feel somewhat reactionary.  I remember reading with scorn many years ago the words of a contemporary of James Joyce, one Arthur Clery, a fellow student of the writer's at UCD.  In an essay, Clery wrote that &ldquo;a nation that takes a British newspaper for its Sunday breakfast may one day wake to find a change in its Friday menu&rdquo;.  I remember at the time superciliously dismissing such provincial chauvinism.  Now, however, in middle age I am inclined to say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have never been especially adept at decoding acronyms and I am not even sure what BSkyB stands for, although I suspect that it may be Big Sky Brother.  In any case, I have no doubt whatever that the ultimate goal of Mr. Murdoch is to create a Big Brother in the sky.  Of late we have seen an enormous concentration of resources in the world of media into the hands of a dangerously small number of people of whom the most prominent have been Mr. Rupert Murdoch and Mr. Robert Maxwell, who played Tweedledum to Mr. Murdoch's Tweedledee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Murdoch's empire includes an enormous number of newspapers, television stations and satellite broadcast facilities.  Individual stations have in the past shown themselves weak in the face of multinational industrial conglomerates.  It is time that a warning signal was needed in this country about the impact of similar enterprises in the information field.</P>
    <P>Europe has already awoken to the danger, as indicated by a resolution on the role of public service television in a multi-media society which was passed by the European Parliament on 19 September 1995.  Having recited various high sounding formulae concerning the right of access to information, this resolution continues by making the important point that the citizen has a right to be regarded not just as a passive financial target.</P>
    <P>Paragraph I of the resolution says:</P>
    <P>Whereas a genuine quality public-service channel must aim to put the viewer in the position of a citizen and actor in relation to modern information and not simply in the position of a viewer or consumer.</P>
    <P>It warns against precisely the kind of monopoly process I have already described in paragraph K, which states:</P>
    <P>Whereas the rapid processes of concentration under way are leading to the emergence of highly powerful private transnational groups, with the result that public service broadcasting may be reduced to a marginal role, especially in the smaller countries.</P>
    <P>With regard to sport it says:</P>
    <P>Whereas EU competition rules should not produce a harmful fragmentation of European public service television when it is facing global competition, particularly where the acquisition of sport rights is concerned.</P>
    <P>The resolution at paragraph 21 calls on the Commission to encourage the granting of transmission rights for major sports events to free-to-air television channels.  Paragraph 22 considers inadmissible&mdash;including from the point of view of the correct application of the rules on competition&mdash; the improper granting of exclusive rights to broadcast sporting events and scientific and technical shows or events, which should be broadcast by all information media for the widest audience.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 46 the resolution calls &ldquo;on member states to regulate for the free-to-air transmission of major sporting events and entetainment or scientific events of particular value or interest&rdquo;.  Paragraph 47 &ldquo;calls on member states to regulate so that when other sporting events and entertainment or scientific events of particular value or interest are shown exclusively on paid television, comprehensive highlights must be available on free-to-air television&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have edited severely the contents of this important document, but I think I have cut to the heart of the matter.  It remains to ask what has <Col N="396" /> Ireland done in response to this?  The answer seems to be, sadly, little to date, although I see the Minister shaking his head.  Therefore, I call this evening on the Government to act energetically in the manner already undertaken by other European Governments.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your flexibility in allowing me to finish my comments.  I have some more points to add, but I believe I will have time to do so at the end of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Norris on raising such a topical subject which will deservedly attract attention.  I put my name down to second the motion only because it does not call for legislation to control the televising of national sports events.  We have had such calls in the past and, as Senator Norris described, there are moves afoot to take that approach in other European countries.  In this country market forces combined with common sense will work hand in hand to get the correct result in most cases.</P>
      <P>Suppose, for instance, that Sky Television offered the GAA a king's ransom for the exclusive rights to show the All-Ireland football and hurling finals on pay TV.  The GAA would undoubtedly be tempted by the money, but I am quite convinced it would not yield to that temptation. The GAA knows that if it did so, it would be cutting its audience to a fraction of what it would otherwise be.  It would at one stroke lose a large part of its stature as a national sporting body.</P>
      <P>The same is true of rugby.  If next Saturday's international could only be seen by a small number of people, rugby would have taken a giant step towards marginalising itself.  I cannot see any sport, particularly rugby football, wanting to do that.  Nor can I see it happening here with any sport that is big enough to create a truly national occasion.  Few sports would be willing to risk losing that status but it is happening in other countries. For instance, the recent soccer international between England and Italy was seen live on satellite television only, which greatly reduced its potential audience.  It remains to be seen whether those who run football in England will continue to think such a situation is good for the future of the game they love so much.</P>
      <P>No sporting organisation in Ireland would cut its own throat in that way.  I am talking only about national sporting occasions.  It is inevitable that the rest of sport will increasingly go onto pay TV because much of sport is now either convertly or overtly professional.  It is part of the entertainment business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the opportunity of visiting the Olympic Games in Atlanta last year, as I did in Barcelona four years earlier, and it was interesting to see the impact of commercialisation on the games.  There was absolutely no sign of commercial sponsorship inside the arena because it was not permitted by the organisers.  Going back 100 years to 1896, the founder of the modern Olympics.  Baron Pierre de <Col N="397" /> Coubertin, spoke about his aims and objectives, which included amateurism.  He did not perceive, however, the sort of commercialisation that would come about in the games.  In 1976 Montreal hosted the Olympics and that city is still paying for them. It was not until the Los Angeles games in 1984 that they discovered the formula of making the Olympics pay for themselves.  That formula, which has been used very worthily and competently since then, involved charging television stations around the world for the right to televise such a popular international sporting event.</P>
    <P>Most importantly of all, sport is expensive today and performers are increasingly highly paid.  The venues they perform in represent massive investments.  Big money needs to be spent on them to ensure the safety and comfort of spectators. The money must come from somewhere and it cannot all come from gate receipts.</P>
    <P>That is the thrust behind the trend towards pay TV.  We might not like it, but it is unrealistic to seek to have it both ways.  Someone must pay for sport and it seems only fair that it should be those who enjoy watching it.  Sports would not attract necessary investment without having the opportunity to gain income from television.  It is an open market situation that we should be very slow to interfere with, just because it might be popular to do so.</P>
    <P>In the particular circumstances of this country common sense combined with market forces usually tend to work together.  Too often we tend to suffer from the malady of thinking that Government should do everything for us and as a result the energy of Government is spread too thinly. There is plenty of work for the Government to do in the area of sport without getting distracted by this issue.</P>
    <P>When I played rugby at school I remember the trainer, Fr. Hegarty, talking about the attacking team and the defending team.  I asked him which one was the attacking team and if that depended on where the ball was on the field?  He thought for a moment and replied: &ldquo;No, Quinn, it doesn't. The attacking team is the one in possession of the ball, even if it is on their own line&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Large Irish sporting organisations now have the ball in their hands.  Even if they are on their own line I do not believe they will lose the opportunity to make what they can of that ball, which is the power to retain their standing and stature. I am delighted Senator Norris raised this topic, but it is one that should be used to convince our major sporting organisations to recognise their importance and make sure they do not lose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has had a long and proud sporting tradition which is deeply rooted in the richness of our culture.  The national games have played a major role in building local community structures for sport and in fostering a sense of pride and spirited rivalry on a parish, county and provincial basis.  National games and international sport provide great occasions for <Col N="398" /> celebrating excellence and achievement.  They promote a sense of pride in being Irish.  Successful sports people provide excellent role models and sport creates a spirit of respectful co-operation between the people of this island.  It would be a great tragedy if our major national sporting events were not televised on terrestrial television.</P>
      <P>BSkyB is on the verge of achieving a near monopoly of major sporting events in western Europe, especially in these islands.  This poses a serious challenge to terrestrial broadcasting both here and in Britain.  Last year the five nations rugby championship, in existence for over 100 years, nearly ceased to exist due to rivalry between BSkyB and terrestrial channels for viewing rights.</P>
      <P>The problem which faces RTÉ and other terrestrial channels is how to compete in the market with Sky television and the massive resources available to it.  Due to the dominant position of RTÉ and the British channels &mdash; BBC and ITV &mdash; up to now, they have been getting sporting events cheaply.  A number of years ago this prompted the FA to negotiate substantial financial contracts with Sky television.  BSkyB finances allow it go with an open cheque book to any sporting organisation and hammer out an exclusive rights deal to broadcast major sporting events. One can hardly blame sporting organisations for not refusing such large financial offers which allow them to further develop.  However, these contracts can be a double-edged sword.  The contract between BSkyB and the rugby unions of the southern hemisphere led to the professionalisation of the game.</P>
      <P>The Olympic movement was aware of this development when it refused to give Sky television exclusive rights to the Atlanta Olympic Games last summer.  It decided to give the contract to the European Broadcasting Union on a matter of policy rather than financial consideration. It believed that the greatest possible number of people should be provided with an opportunity of viewing the centennial games and be encouraged to become involved in sport and the Olympic movement.</P>
      <P>Next Wednesday the House will debate the strategic plan for sport which plans the development of sport between 1997 and 2006.  This will be a futile exercise if we have pay-per-view television. The purpose of the sports strategy is to provide a clear blueprint for the development of Irish sport.  The strategy seeks to bring all elements of sport together in a cohesive manner for the benefit of participants, coaches, leaders and administrators.  One of the main goals of the plan is to involve more young people in all levels of sport and encourage them to develop a life long interest in playing and enjoying sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw the effect of Ireland's participation and performance in the soccer world cup.  This encouraged young people to take up the game.  It is vital to the development of sport that terrestrial <Col N="399" /> television covers all major sporting events in order to get young people involved.</P>
    <P>Sport provides great satisfaction and enjoyment for people of all ages and from backgrounds. Sporting talent is an important part of the human potential and everyone should have the opportunity to make the most of their talents. These benefits combine to form a potent and positive force in society.</P>
    <P>The strategic plan also envisages promotion campaigns aimed at increasing participation in recreational sport.  This will be linked to promoting the health aspects of becoming involved in sport.  However, what is the point of this campaign if live sport is not available on television?</P>
    <P>Sports related activity generates more than 11,000 full-time and part-time jobs, representing more than 8,000 equivalent full-time jobs.  When sports spending on media, travel and tourism is included, the figure increases to 18,200 equivalent full-time jobs.  It is estimated that sport contributes over £66 million to the Exchequer through PAYE and PRSI levies.  Therefore, the development of sport is of major economic interest to the country.</P>
    <P>In rural areas there are major problems with the MMDS system.  Transmission of these signals is limited by geography with hills and trees capable of blocking the transmission signal.  Most rural areas have a successful deflector system in place but these have now been deemed illegal by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  Many rural areas have only the three Irish channels.  The new MMDS system is also more expensive and they now have a monopoly in the market.  Where does this leave the European ideal of competition?</P>
    <P>The old deflector system from the transmitter in Enniskillen cost approximately £25 per household. The MMDS system costs £90 for the first television and £50 for every subsequent television. It is more expensive for public houses. Under the old system the price was £25 regardaless of where the television was located.</P>
    <P>The MMDS system is unsatisfactory due to the cost and its poor coverage area.  The marketplace should be opened to allow deflector systems transmit to local communities.  I ask the Minister to introduce legislation to protect specific sporting events and to open the transmission market to further competition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be churlish of me not to recognise Senator Norris who first brought this initiative before the House over 12 months ago when I and my colleagues initiated this debate.  I welcome the fact that this composite motion is being discussed at a time when there is controversy over the <Col N="400" /> MMDS deflector system as opposed to other deflector systems in rural areas and because of the encroaching power of the Murdoch organisation in the media.  Where does the Government stand on these matters?</P>
    <P>It is too late for this debate; the game is over in terms of putting in place controls to stop this onward rush.  My opinions diverge from those of Senator Quinn with whom I nearly always agree when he speaks of market forces.  In a media context it is a monster gobbling up a national and transnational radio, television and newspaper environment.  It is answerable to only one god, namely, the mighty dollar.  Senator Naughten is correct in referring to moves taken by international organisations to stem the flow, the IOC being one such movement.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to the fact that there were no commercials in the Olympic stadium. However, there was such a proliferation of commercial activity outside the stadium that the IOC has rewritten its rules to ensure that there will not be such a glaring exhibition of commercialism at the next Olympic Games.  We are aware of the split that has happened in the five nations championship due to television rights and filthy lucre.</P>
    <P>British MPs now acknowledge that the 1990 broadcasting legislation failed to take account of the massive expansion in satellite television when it created the listed events category.  Many of us have been pressing the Minister to introduce a similar list here to protect games such as all-Ireland finals, soccer internationals and other sporting events of a national and international nature.  The Minister has indicated that he is planning to do this but I am beginning to wonder if he is too late.  Perhaps the horse has bolted.  The GAA has come out publicly, although ambiguously, with its response to whether it would seek to grant television rights to BSkyB or any other satellite provider.  I do not blame it; it is national sporting organisation and it is in the business of trying to promote its games in a competitive environment.  If it is offered several million pounds for the international transmission of Gaelic games, money which can be ploughed into the development of the games at local, regional and national level in Ireland, who would blame it for considering it?  Who is to blame any sporting organisation which finds itself unable to fund its activities from its own resources, who are forced to rely on the vagaries of the Government of the day and whether the Minister of the day happens to be in sympathy with them.  He or she, depending on which gender is in charge of sport and the allocation of money, may not sympathise. Why should sporting organisations not chase after this pot of gold that has been dangled in front of their eyes?</P>
    <P>The British MPs who said they failed to acknowledge the expansion of satellite television because the Broadcasting Bill at that time was specific to pay-per-view might have been more farsighted than they have been given credit for. <Col N="401" /> Pay-per-view is now with us and I believe and suggest to this House that it will become the norm in terms of sporting events in the coming years.  The limited exercise that has been indulged in over the past couple of years, with the transmission of boxing matches from America, has proven to be a great financial success.  Transmitted at 4 a.m., people are prepared to pay £10 over and above what they are already paying for the Sky subscription to see these events.  Why should Sky not opt for the pay-per-view system? This is going to happen when the 200 digital channels come on stream over the next 18 months because these channels have to be filled.  It is already happening in Italy and it is undoubtedly going to happen with English premier football matches when digital television is instituted.  The more wealthy individual football clubs are already beginning to look at cable television as a means of transmitting their games.  Manchester United is a case in point.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I would like to ask the Minister how State broadcasting providers such as RTÉ will survive in this new environment? What proposals does the Minister have to blunt the sharp edge of this international invasion?  Where does the European Union stand on the development of the black box decoder by the Murdoch empire, which, I understand, is now in alliance with the BBC?  If the pay-per-view system is allowed to proceed unhindered, I suggest that the future of State public service broadcasting will effectively be over.  The era will have finished. I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in all of this.  He is standing four-square as the only bulwark against the mighty rise of commercial television. If State broadcasting is to survive in this country and if RTÉ is to survive as the provider of that public service, the only recourse the Minister has is to legislation.  How will the Minister frame such legislation in order that it will have effect?  Will the legislation be sufficient to prevent the dictatorship of market forces to which Senator Quinn referred?  Will it prevent national sporting organisations such as the GAA, FAI and others from going out and doing their own deals unilaterally?  What effect will it have if all the major sporting events of this country are removed literally overnight from the screens of RTÉ or TV3, if it is introduced?  The only way people will have access to televised major sporting events will be if they pay through the nose for them.  That is the dilemma which faces the Minister.  The debate has not really begun in this country, this issue has not really been discussed in public and perhaps this is as good a time as any to discuss it.  Perhaps Senator Norris, in his wisdom, has seen something which the rest of us have not.  The Minister now has the opportunity to put on public record his current thinking on what is a fast moving environment.  We are not talking about years here, we are talking about months.  In that context I welcome the opportunity this debate has provided <Col N="402" /> but I believe it raises many more questions than it provides answers.  My sympathies lie with the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am encouraged by what has been said so far in this debate.  I want to address some of the issues which have been raised by Senators Norris, Naughten and Mooney and I congratulate Senator Naughten on his speech.  It is very interesting to hear what is provoked by this question here today.  I addressed some of these issues in the eighth Raymond Williams memorial lecture which I gave in Wales a few months go. Those who read that lecture will see that I offered a somewhat pessimistic view, rather like Senator Mooney's, because so much had already been lost.  I will make a few remarks by way of preface to my speech.</P>
      <P>These are the neglected debates.  In the academy, as well as among the public, the neglected debate has been about the relationship between science, technology and society.  In this respect, the major changes which have taken place in the last 20 years have been because of the convergence of technologies&mdash;telephonic, televisual, cable, fiber optic or whatever.  There has been concentration of ownership because of this, including cross ownership, and now there is a multiplicity of forms of delivery of new services. The issue that was provoked by those developments is a very stark one.  It is whether what takes place in the media is the commercially driven delivery of what is technologically possible. Another option is that citizens would take their moral right to communicate and find it facilitated by the means of communication, including recent developments in technology. Without being crude about it, one is quickly led to a choice between a model of being a consumer of entertainment services facilitated by the visual media or of being a citizen using the new technology to communicate with one's fellow citizens in a way never envisaged before.  This is the same debate as might be derived from Williams's discussion, in <i>The Long Revolution</i>, of the impact of the printing press.  If we find a different argument in relation to television than the print media it is precisely because of the changed nature of the technology and the changed nature of ownerships. It will not be possible to unscramble concentrations of ownership.  I am deliberately listing these issues, even if they are not raised, as issues which can no longer be neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> Senator Mooney is very close to the truth when he says people are waking up too late to the nightmarish prospects of what is now likely to happen.  It may well be, if one takes the example of Great Britain, that independent television channels, instead of combining to secure an alternative presence on satellite to Mr. Murdoch's presence, have decided to individually seek to occupy the back end of Mr. Murdoch's system. The gate is therefore already stacked with a large &ldquo;M&rdquo; on it.  Is there an individual gatekeeper and is it possible, if the technological access is so dominated, to ever again open the gate?  With respect to Senator Quinn, we will have a choice but it will be a choice between &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;M&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is another issue, not just confined to sport, about what happens to the viewer.  If one pays for televised sport, one will in time inevitably pay for one's history in the form of archival material.  This completely changes the nature of the viewer.  The Reithian tradition of whether one was on the right, in the middle or on the left as regards the purpose and functions of broadcasting was one kind of philosophy.  It stated that there was a requirement on those who were the national broadcaster to have balanced programming, be it in terms of music or current affairs. Intrinsic to such a philosophy was that one must not only entertain but educate and illuminate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the viewer's possibilities are changed to a series of pay-per-view options, that philosophy is eliminated.  Many who worry about this are people who, as far back as 1934 in the United States, deregulated television and then, nearly 60 years later, unsuccessfully sought to claw back from that to protect children.</P>
      <P>I was certainly not in a majority in Europe in the beginning and, although I have more support now, I doubt if I am yet in a majority when I said that I saw the televisual product, no more than the film product, as more than a simple commodity which could not be totally regulated by competition or market thinking.  It is a cultural expression and, therefore, if it is limited in supply, cultural diversity shrinks.  It is interesting to note that all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas see this issue as important.  However, one has a sense at the same time of people feeling a sense of powerlessness at the inexorable drift towards greater concentrations of ownership.</P>
      <P>The history of accountability of the print media, for example, was always about State and society being to some extent coterminous with nation.  Many broadcasters are now international and, in exactly the same way as capital knows no home, these people operate outside the sovereignty of any one state.  As one cannot issue millions of blindfolds and tell people to protest by not watching nor knock satellites out of the sky, how is one to deal with this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> This motion does not fall neatly into the statutory remit of one particular Minister but it raises issues of broadcasting policy which I will address as I have statutory responsibility for them.  Radio frequency management policy is the statutory responsibility of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have operated an open skies policy with regard to the reception of television broadcasts.  The Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, established RTÉ to operate a national service in the public service broadcasting mould to be funded from the licence fee and a mix of other incomes.  For many years these policies resulted in Irish viewers having the benefits of a national public service television station and, to some extent, reception of UK broadcasters with the same public service tradition offering what were and are still regarded by many as the best television programmes in the world.  For many years reception of UK transmissions was relatively limited and was available through a fortuitous overspill from transmitters not designed to serve this part of Ireland or through cable television systems.  However, advance in cable television technology and the introduction of MMDS have meant fairly widespread availability of UK services.</P>
    <P>There is another issue involved there.  What is the relationship between broadcaster and viewer? Is it one of passivity?  What informs this relationship? Is it one of activity or interactivity?  What assumptions are made about both sides, the broadcaster and the viewer?  If those who receive the image are potential consumers, the question is answered.  If it is a citizen to whom the service is delivered, that is another answer.  Whatever we do, we end up with a mixed model.</P>
    <P>The method of delivery of services is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  However, viewers throughout Ireland have had access to programming provided by a range of broadcasters operating in the public service mould.  I described that tradition as bringing a diversity of quality programming catering for both minority and mainstream tastes, seeking to inform and educate as well as entertain, and having roots in the community and a sense of history.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s there emerged the possibility of broadcasting facilities by satellites, initially for delivery to cable systems, and, quickly afterwards, broadcasting directly to homes <i>via</i> satellite dishes. Countries moved to deregulate broadcasting as the capacity provided by satellites lifted the constraints on the radio frequency spectrum in relation to the establishment of terrestrial broadcasting. It is unfortunate that most satellite broadcasting services are now purely commercial with no other motive than to maximise returns to investors.  We are now faced with a potential explosion of services through the application of digital compression techniques.</P>
    <P>Here again, I return to the question I posed about the connection between science, technology <Col N="405" /> and society.  It is as if we, as broadcasters and viewers, are determined by an increasingly rapid technical evolution.  There is a debate about the speed of programming, technological introduction and regulation.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore technological progress, but we should bear in mind when we read reports of the imminent introduction of 200 to 500 channel services that the channel in this context does not mean the availability of 200 RTÉ 1s or BBCs.  We are talking about 200 opportunities to invite the general public to pay more.  We are talking about five or six so-called channels being devoted to a single football match depending on how much one decides to pay, or a host of niche channels offering little in terms of diversity of services, such as shopping channels, which hardly fit into the concept of a television programme as understood by most people.  Those who are very interested in sport could pay for several different channels and recompose their own soccer match by selecting different views.</P>

      <P>It is hard to say that this is a television programme in the sense we know; it is more like a service.  I have yet to be convinced that the increased capacity brought about by satellites or by the promised explosion of channels through digital compression will improve access to or increase the quality or diversity of programmes available to Irish viewers.  On the contrary, there will be more choice to see more of the same.  <i>The Independent on Sunday</i> recently stated:</P>
      <P>There is another point which emerges when you talk to the people who will be running the channel explosion of the next few years.  Without exception all of them are obsessed with the technology, with buying rights and cutting the costs of programmes.  None of them talk about their passion for making great television.  It is all about market share, not the product, and that is an ethic which is likely to become more and more common.</P>
      <P>If we are to ensure maximum equality of access to viewers to quality television programming, we shall have to find, and support, those with a passion for making great television.  It is my great conviction that this passion and the creativity and dynamism that goes with it can only be supported and nurtured if public service broadcasters continue to play an important role in the future.  I instance the debate that led to, and forwarded, the contribution of the late Dennis Potter as regards the future of television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commercial services are here to stay.  Their task is to deliver the highest audience for the lowest price.  They have no concerns about equality of access.  That is a democratic issue and not necessarily a market one.  They offer one choice, &mdash;to pay or not to pay.  One of the fundamental principles of the public service broadcasting ethos <Col N="406" /> is universal access to transmissions.  It is through the retaining of this and other values that we can ensure equality of access to quality and diversity of programming.</P>
    <P>When I initiated the debate on the future of broadcasting through the publication of the Green Paper, I always made it clear that I see it as a fundamental principle that public service broadcasting must be supported and strengthened. I have recently brought my proposals for fresh broadcasting legislation to Government and I hope to be in a position to publish them shortly. When I first started to attend meetings of EU Council of Ministers with responsibility for broadcasting policy, I was virtually a lone voice in my support of the concept of public service broadcasting.  Literally everyone on the council had moved away from it.  Over the intervening years, many of my ministerial colleagues in other countries have expressed grave concern at the effect of the so called &ldquo;deregulation&rdquo; of broadcasting on their public service broadcasters and the quality and diversity of television programming. They have not changed ideologically and politically but they are witnessing the consequences of a bad policy and its effect on television. At a meeting of Ministers which I chaired in Galway last September, there was considerable and strong support for the maintenance of the concept of public service broadcasting.  There was also a clear message that public service broadcasters must continue to have access to major popular programmes comprising, in particular, sports events and that pure commercialism cannot be the criterion.</P>
    <P>The coverage of significant sporting events, while it has always been an important part of television schedules, is just one of a number of broadcasting policy concerns which face us as we move towards the next century.  The concern underlying this motion is, of course, not confined to sport. The reality is that the same thing is happening in other areas, with the exclusive acquisition of film libraries and programme archives by the operators of subscription and pay-per-view services. For example, the Asian Film Bank has been purchased so a film made in the last ten years cannot be shown without going through a monopolised company.  This makes its own statement.  Is that the marketplace?  We are talking about a monopolised means of abusing consumers internationally who were previously citizens.</P>
    <P>As I said, when I last had the opportunity to discuss this topic in this House, as the capacity for delivering different broadcasting services becomes almost infinite by today's terms and as the capital cost of providing that capacity is reduced, the competition for programme material of mass appeal is set to become more intense.  The technology in the trade is referred to in almost insulting terms of &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft&rdquo;.  It is as if one creates the capacity first and then sets about purchasing exclusive rights to fill all the slots that are available for an insatiable public.  I intend to address this in the legislation I will introduce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> Many of those competing for audience share are entirely commercial operations without any shred of public service ethos.  Popular programming is seen by such organisations as something to be bought, protected and sold at a premium. Sport always has been an integral part of public service broadcasting schedules.  It is a prime example of public service broadcasting.  The coverage of hurling and football matches is, for many, a part of our broadcasting heritage.  I want to add another provocative sentence to my massive run of indiscretion.</P>

      <P>There is also a question as to whether the person looking at a sporting event is watching as a passive viewer versus a commercialised activity or whether it is a form of interaction based on a knowledge or interest in the sport which is shared by the person on the sporting field and the person watching, be it in terms of memory, anticipation or education.  It is a very different thing as those who watch hurling and football matches will know.  They are not simply consumers of the national final or whatever.</P>
      <P>While one may argue that the concept of a right to sell is similar to private property rights, it is an abstraction in comparison with the power of the activity when it is looked at differently.  There are also important international competitions where the exploits of the national teams and individuals representing Ireland have been shared by the substantial numbers of those watching live coverage on national television.  For many it would be unthinkable if coverage of such events were not available freely, or, more accurately, for the price of a television licence on our national broadcasting services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last spoke on this issue in this House, Senators will recall that I made the point that it was futile to think in terms of preserving the access of individuals to live television coverage of important sporting events through national legislation alone.  Senator Mooney is <Col N="408" /> right about some of developments in Britain. Even the most conservative in Britain have raised the issues on which debate is about to begin here &mdash;issues of concentration, not only in ownership of one form of the media, but concentration of cross-ownership, which a backbench committee of the Tory Party has decided is not acceptable. We should debate those issues here and let it be said that it is irrelevant who owns the media, the distance between ownership and editing is so great that it need never be a matter of debate. What if a person owned a greater share of one medium, but then went on to concentrate that ownership through cross-ownership?  Perhaps behind the question which is excited by the absence of sport through a free-to-air channel, there are bigger issues to which we have unfortunately delayed giving our attention.</P>
      <P>In my proposals for fresh broadcasting legislation, I have proposed measures which will, hopefully, go some way to address this issue on a national basis.  In response to Senator Norris, separately through the amendment to the Television without Frontiers Directive agreed unanimously by the European Parliament on the question of the exercise by broadcasters of exclusive rights to broadcast coverage of major sporting events and through my introduction of this topic to the Council of Ministers with responsibility for broadcasting policy at our meeting in Galway last September, the issue is being addressed urgently and comprehensively at European level.  If, for example, particular events are designated at a national level as being of such importance that it must be possible for viewers to follow them via live coverage on unencrypted, universally available television services, such designations must be recognised and reciprocated by broadcasters and national authorities in other member states.</P>
      <P>Without international co-operation it would be possible, regardless of national regulations, for a broadcaster operating outside this jurisdiction to simply ignore such regulations.  The objective of the amendment agreed by the European Parliament was to ensure that the viewing public would continue to have access to major sporting events live on universally accessible television services. The Council of Ministers, which took place last December during Ireland's Presidency, endorsed the objectives of the amendment in principle. Work is now continuing at Council working group level to devise an acceptable wording which will effectively meet the objectives of the Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have instructed my officials to urge that the strongest line possible is taken at these discussions. The European Commission met on 5 February 1997 and adopted a position which focuses on the exercise rather than the acquisition of exclusive rights with a view to safeguarding the public's right of access to the transmission of events of major importance for society.  The Commission will promote this approach in negotiations with the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. <Col N="409" /> I make no excuses for the fact that this approach rests on the exercise rather than the acquisition of exclusive rights.  The major issues to which I earlier referred involve the acquisition principle.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive is subject to the co-decision procedure.  It will be necessary for both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to agree on the nature of any revision to the directive.  It seems at this stage that all parties are agreed on the objective and I hope the conciliation procedure will lead to a successful revision of the directive on this topic in particular.</P>
    <P>I apologise for taking so much time but I wanted to reply to some of the points raised because this is an important issue.</P>

      <P>Senators will, I hope, conclude from my contribution that I have considerable sympathy for the motion before the House. However, one should not pretend, as Senator Mooney incorrectly stated, that this is a simple matter.  There are complex issues involving ownership, rights of sporting organisations &mdash; which are not absolute&mdash;and competitors, competition, rights of broadcasters and the rights of the viewing public as citizens rather than consumers. I hope I have been able to reassure the House that the issue is being addressed in a practical and urgent manner and that I will be seeking to balance the rights of citizens with other rights in the outcome.</P>
      <P>With regard to the final part of the motion, Senators will appreciate that I have no statutory function for issues related to the provision of multi-channel television services by way of MMDS or otherwise.  That is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, and I have every confidence that he will deal with it properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an rún agus déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Seanadóir Norris as ucht é a chur ar an gclár.</P>
      <P>I too will begin by congratulating Senator Naughten.  I do not know whether it was his maiden contribution but we listened to it with great pleasure.  I thank the Minister for mentioning Raymond Williams because he promised me a copy of the Raymond Williams lecture he delivered and for which I am still waiting.  Having reminded him, however, I am sure I will have no further complaints on that score.  I congratulate him on being invited to deliver the Raymond Williams lecture which is a tribute to Irish culture generally and the Minister specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Senator Norris to membership of a circle from which he has been hitherto excluded &mdash; or excluded himself &mdash; namely, the committee of provincial chauvinists of which I have long <Col N="410" /> been a member.  This is an auspicious occasion in terms of matters of that nature.</P>
    <P>As the Minister emphasised, the speed of change in this area is so rapid that one must race madly to keep up.  This motion is timely because there is much catching up to do and we must do it quickly.  Approximately 18 months ago I spoke at another forum and I touched gingerly on these issues.  I remember thinking I was very <i>avant garde</i> but, in light of the speed with which change has occurred, what I stated at that time has been quickly overtaken by events.  People in Ireland are peculiarly exposed and vulnerable to these pressures for obvious linguistic and cultural reasons.  This is a timely debate and the issues should be grappled with as quickly as possible.  I support the general thrust of the Minister's response to the motion which deserves widespread public support.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with a number of points raised by the Minister.  I hope the fragmentation of responsibility between the two Departments will not inhibit effective policy making.  Fragmentation is the curse of decision makers in Government because serious problems do not fall neatly into departmental pigeon holes.  Therefore, the effectiveness of the co-operation between Departments is crucial in ensuring the optimum response to challenges of this type.  I am sure the Minister will take that point on board but there is no harm in stressing it.</P>
    <P>I will not linger on the wider issues raised by the Minister about the implications of technological change for Irish society.  However, I agree with his statement that &ldquo;One of the fundamental principles of the public service broadcasting ethos is universal access to transmissions.  It is through the retaining of this and other values that we can ensure equality of access to quality and diversity of programming.&rdquo;  That seems to be a central cultural value.  Diversity, and the degree to which we wish to tolerate or encourage it, glides into the concept of a pluralistic society and is essential toward indicating the type of people we will be in the future.  In that context, I plead with the Minister to try to elevate the importance of media education in the education system.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that, when young people or potential citizens are learning a wide range of thinking and other skills, we help them to develop the capacity, for critical detachment in evaluating the torrent of information and indoctrination issuing from the media.  To date, we have neglected to do this.  The media, particularly television, is the greatest single source of information and ideas to which most people are exposed on a daily basis. It is extraordinary that the education system does not address the issue of media education more explicitly and consistently or include it as an integral part of citizenship education.  We cannot assume that a capacity for critical thinking will emerge residually or evolve from the teaching of disparate subjects.  Officials in the relevant Department should take this on board because we must constructively consider how media education <Col N="411" /> can be integrated into the mainstream education system at all levels.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that many third level graduates have never received direction about how to step back from this inundation in televisual images and impressions in order to preserve some degree of critical detachment.  Despite the fact that I agree with the Minister in respect of consumerism <i>v</i> citizenship, etc., the future is on the side of the big battalions unless a conscious, deliberate, systematic and sustained attempt is made to ensure a capacity for critical detachment.  Even then the future may be on their side but without that capacity it certainly will be.</P>
    <P>I am delighted about the impact the Minister has made on European thinking on this matter. It seems that, in retrospect, when one comes to view Ireland's contribution to the European ideal and the EU, this will count as one of our most significant contributions.  The Minister is aware that I disagree with him on a number of matters but, were he not in office, this would not have happened.</P>
    <P>Sport, even though it is not the only issue, is becoming increasingly important.  In a leisure society, it will become more central to the lives of young people and adults.  Events in this regard will be very significant in determining public responses in various ways.  Senator Naughten's statement about the place of sport in society is valid and must be taken on board.  Ultimately, this debate involves those who have a country and a culture and those whose only culture is the market.  The market is global at one level while at another that means nothing.  It may be that the future belongs to those who have no country.  I hope if that day comes, it will be over our dead bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important motion.  I congratulate Senator Naughten on his maiden speech and was delighted to hear him refer to community television.  Senator Norris made a good speech which contained a power of information. He said that in a sense the question of deflector systems and MMDS is comparatively unimportant.  However, it does reach to the same underlying principle, that of the right of access for all citizens to information.  I accept it might appear unimportant in some respects but the motion states.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to ensure the maximum equality of access to viewers throughout Ireland for television programming.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will confine my remarks to South Coast Community Television, which is a community led company. There is some misconception about that fact.  It started in 1985 in the Fermoy area of north Cork.  It grew and extended into south and west Cork and provides a first class service to the people in that region.  At no time was there any evidence of interference by the South Coast <Col N="412" /> Community Television &ldquo;rebeaming&rdquo; system with any other system and no complaints were made. The people involved applied for a licence and were refused as an exclusive order was granted to Prince Holdings.  Later a judgment was handed down in the High Court which gave anyone the right to apply for the licence.  The licence application was already with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>The issue goes on and presently a report is being made available to South Coast Community Television.  It is a community led organisation carrying out business in a very professional way, has the tremendous backing of the community and gives a first class service.  From 1992 to 1994 I was very much involved.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications at the time, Deputy Cowen, wrote to me and the secretary of Cork County Council.  The council gave its wholehearted support to the motion before it at the time requesting that a licence be granted to South Coast Community Television.  The Minister's letter stated:</P>
    <P>In order to understand why the deflector system cannot be licensed, one must appreciate the limitations of Ireland's frequency spectrum allocation.  Under the terms of the Stockholm Treaty, 1961, Ireland was allocated sufficient ultra high frequency (UHF) spectrum for broadcasting to accommodate the equivalent of four national networks.  The illegal deflector system operates in part of this broadcasting band and the physical facts are that there are insufficient frequencies available within this band to facilitate the national television channels and a nationwide deflector system.  The present use of, and future plans for, Ireland's UHF spectrum allocations encompass the two national television channels, the proposed Teilfís na Gaeilge channel and the possibility of a third independent television channel.</P>
    <P>No progress has been made on the third independent channel and that is sufficient reason for consideration to be given to the licensing of South Coast Community Television.  I am delighted to have had the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important issue.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Naughten on his maiden speech as one who comes from a neighbouring county and who was a great friend of his father's down through the years.  It bodes well for the future of politics among up and coming generations that they have a representative of Senator Naughten's stature in the House.  I hope he goes on to greater things and wish him well.</P>
      <P>I support the motion.  I refer to Senator Sherlock's contribution.  His party has been in Government for two years and I am sure anything in which he wanted to have an input in that regard should have been done by now, but it was not.  Everyone is kicking to touch because there is a general election on the way.</P>

      <P>The power of communications is greater than anyone ever realised, particularly through the medium of television.  There is 70 per cent penetration on television, 20 per cent on radio and 10 per cent in newspapers.  This shows where money is spent and where the commercial world places its money.</P>
      <P>MMDS technology will be outdated within three to five years as new technology overtakes it.  I was in America last week and there are 82 channels in the Cleveland area.  What are we talking about?  There were two channels in some rural areas until they got community licences.  The fuss being made about this is not worth it.</P>
      <P>The Minister is 100 per cent behind the protection of our major national sporting events.  Sport plays an important part in modern day life as people have more leisure time, and it is healthy to be involved in sport.  As a result sport will be the single most attractive product on television for most people.</P>
      <P>The all-Ireland hurling final is the greatest spectator sport in the world.  Anyone who has seen this sport, whether in Japan, America or Australia, is enthusiastic about it.  I would not object if Sky or CBS paid the GAA a fee to broadcast this sporting event in countries where RTÉ does not show it.  That money could be used to build dressing rooms and to develop sports facilities in urban and rural areas.  Many professional sports, such as golf, boxing, rugby and soccer, are broadcast on television.</P>
      <P>I support Teilifís na Gaeilge and I am proud the Minister brought it to fruition.  As Senator Sherlock said, it was part of Fianna Fáil's manifesto for a number of years.  I would like Teilifís na Gaeilge to become more involved at community level.  County finals of Scór and hurling and football county finals could be broadcast on it.  It would then be as successful as local radio stations.  The young and enthusiastic staff of Teilifís na Gaeilge could look for local stories to broadcast.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is a blessing in disguise that many people are now receiving its signal.  The bad lightning in the midlands last Monday week blacked out all the television stations.  When they were retuned, people who could not get Teilifís na Gaeilge were able to receive it.  I would be delighted to discuss proposals with the executives of Teilifís na Gaeilge or with the Minister on how to make it more popular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Senators Naughten, Sherlock and Cassidy spoke about the television deflector issue, which is discussed regularly in my area.  From 1980 to 1993 a top quality and reliable deflector system serviced the town of Birr and the areas of Clara, Mountbolas, Tullamore, Moneygall, Shinrone and south Laoighis.  The small fee was paid on an annual basis.  This system ceased <Col N="414" /> to operate in 1993 due to threatened legal action by Horizon TV, now called Irish Multichannel.</P>
      <P>The service now provided by MMDS is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons.  A 41 per cent increase in charges since 1993 means it is too expensive.  Inflation rose by 7 per cent during that period, so such an increase is exorbitant.  The coverage is unpredictable and some people cannot receive the service.  It is user unfriendly because a second television requires a second decoder which costs an extra £40 per year.  The company charges a punitive late payment fee and a premium of £40 annually to people who cannot afford to pay the upfront annual fee of £176 and who opt instead to pay monthly.  The 12 monthly payments cost £216, which is £18 per month.  I hope the Minister understands the reasons that many of my constituents are unhappy with the quality and price of the service they now receive, although this matter is more appropriate to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>One of the most common queries I receive is the licensing of television deflectors.  Over the past few months the local deflector system restarted its operation in a confined area, but there is widespread demand for its coverage to be extended.  The satisfactory resolution of this issue is important for many people in my constituency and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The report by the three EBU experts is now available.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, mentioned it recently on television and I believe he is sending it to South Coast Community Television for its examination.  I hope this report, which is with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, will be published.  Perhaps a copy could be placed in the Library so that Members could read it.  If this report is favourable to the community deflector systems in Cork, I ask the Minister to give a commitment in principle to the licensing of all such operations, subject to the normal technical considerations.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to MMDS providing a service, but in the interests of fair play and equity the local community should be allowed to compete in this area.  Europe is all about competition. Semi-State bodies, with which I deal on a regular basis, face competition; so why should private enterprise, such as MMDS, not have to compete with other interests?  We are talking about community involvement.  People are prepared to comply with the law in every respect and they should be given the opportunity to provide a community television.</P>
      <P>Some areas of my constituency are unable to receive Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Some people have been critical of the provision of this innovative service.  If it is supported and encouraged it will enable us to have a better understanding of our language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of television is a serious matter.  Customers are being charged too much.  Ireland cannot tackle this problem alone.  The EU has a <Col N="415" /> major role to play in ensuring that customers are charged a reasonable fee.  At the moment they are being exploited by a few individuals and action should be taken to stop this.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Norris on this motion and I am heartened by the Minister's response.  It is interesting that Senators on both sides of the House have expressed concern on this subject.</P>
      <P>Ninety nine per cent of households have a television set.  Television is more than a consumer commodity, it is a cultural expression.  It is essential that as many people as possible have access to it and feel that they can contribute to the ownership of television stations.  The concentration of ownership of the media in a few hands has been regrettable and I am glad that Senator Norris spoke so strongly on this point.  This concentration takes place in all sectors of the media.</P>
      <P>We are in an invidious position if we speak about the rights of expression, liberty and freedom when fewer people have a choice about what they can view on an important cultural occasion without paying increasing amounts of money. This turns the event into something which is for an elite audience.</P>
      <P>I was in the US with my children about 15 years ago and one of them noted that there were 40 channels with nothing on any of them.  There is now a song called &ldquo;54 Channels and Nothing on Any of Them&rdquo;.  The Minister has rightly said that, unless we are careful, we could end up with 200 channels and nothing on any of them.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the EU is taking this problem seriously.  Italy is experiencing dreadful trouble as a result of television being in the hands of a single individual.  I agree with the Minister that Europe needs to take note of what has happened in the US and ensure that the same does not happen here.  Public service channels in the US now have to interrupt their programmes to appeal for money.</P>

    <P>Broadcasting requires regulation.  Market forces will not work in this sector and there is plenty of evidence of this.  There has to be regulation but this does not mean oppressive control.  Such <Col N="416" /> regulation is required for reasons which are embedded in personal liberty and intellectual property rights.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, television is at the heart of the home.  It has taken the place of the fireside, the seanchaí and the neighbour.  Television is central to our culture in a transmissive and transformative way.  Television directs and creates discussion and impacts on our thinking.</P>
    <P>The biggest mistake made in broadcasting in the last ten years was the introduction of the MMDS system.  A system which creates a less efficient service, in a less effective way at additional cost should have been doubted from the outset.  In addition, there are questions regarding MMDS's impact on people's health. There is no reason for its introduction.  I do not know the Minister's view on this but I recall that there was a campaign in Galway against the introduction of this system.  Some of that opposition was scaremongering but there are good reasons for us to look at this system again.</P>
    <P>It is not beyond human imagination to develop a system of regulation and licensing of deflector systems.  The intellectual rights of people whose work is broadcast must be regulated but we could still achieve this using the deflector system.  Both systems should work hand in hand.</P>
    <P>We will shortly see far more channels being broadcast by satellite and we must have policies in place before technology overtakes us.  For the last three mornings I have been entertained by Virgin Radio UK 105.3 FM.  This should not be allowed within one month of the launch of a national commercial radio station.  I have much sympathy for pirate stations and they should have a frequency, but the Virgin signal would not reach Dublin without being rebroadcast by one of the satellite stations here.  We need action on this.</P>
    <P>I support this motion.  The cultural centrality of the all-Ireland and other sporting events must be protected from the Rupert Murdochs of this world who would destroy anything cultural in order to gain an additional dollar, pound or yen.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion.  All Senators would agree that we should ensure the maximum quality of access to viewers throughout Ireland of television programming.  At present the maximum equality of access to viewers is being provided by RTÉ and Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Some people, for whatever reason, want multi-channel viewing and to watch Spanish basketball matches and skiing from obscure places.  We must, therefore, have satellites and Sky to provide this coverage. A number of programmes being broadcast via satellite are abominable and culturally neutral and few people wish to watch.  However, the only way people can avoid viewing these programme is if they turn off their televisions or switch channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion states: &ldquo;to ensure that exclusive rights to major Irish sporting events are not exercised by broadcasters in such a way as to deprive <Col N="417" /> any sizeable proportion of the Irish public of the possibility of viewing such events live&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, the Government will not be able to dictate that but rather those holding these sporting events.  If the IRFU, the FAI, the GAA or another body decides to sell or buy television coverage, they will go to Sky or Celtic.  I am delighted people in Britain and America, including my sons and daughters, whether in Edinburgh or New York, can watch football matches on Sunday. RTÉ should provide that service but it did not win the rights because the GAA sold them to another organisation.</P>
    <P>If the Government is to take appropriate action, it must make agreements with the relevant sporting bodies, this would ensure that exclusive rights to major Irish sporting events are not exercised by broadcasters in such a way as to deprive any sizeable proportion of the public of the possibility of viewing such events live on television. However, this is where the problem arises.  Will the Government be able to tell the sporting bodies to whom to sell the rights of their games or will the sporting bodies tell the Government they have the right to sell their games to the organisation which pays the most?</P>
    <P>A number of months ago the RFU decided to take as much money as was available from Sky, but the Scottish RU and Welsh RU did not do so.  The RFU was to receive £85 million for the rights to the English matches, which was to include the five nations championship.  Of the £85 million given to the RFU, £25 million was to be divided among the other three unions.  However, the BBC beat Sky and won the rights to the rugby internationals.  We would not have the resources to match those of the BBC or Sky.</P>
    <P>Small soccer clubs are benefiting from the money being provided by Sky.  Because of the lack of coverage of live matches, Sky is paying a certain amount to small clubs.  The only way to beat Sky is to remove its satellites but how can the EU or Ireland ban the setting up of communication satellites?  The only people who can stop this are sporting bodies selling their product, including those selling the all-Ireland and the rugby and soccer internationals.  While I do not believe we can stop this, we can request the Government to do something.  This is a wasted exercise unless legislation is introduced to stop satellites from beaming programmes into Ireland. I am not sure if we or the EU have the ability to do that.</P>
    <P>The motion also asks the Government to &ldquo;develop a just and coherent response to the situation currently obtaining regarding MMDS relay television transmission.&rdquo;  Companies providing MMDS have given a good service in certain areas.  However, those providing deflector systems are operating illegally.  If we allow them to operate illegally, we are saying it is right because it costs less than operating legally.  Poitín is cheaper than a bottle of whiskey, so why not allow people to sell poitín?</P>

      <P>We must legalise or eliminate deflector systems.  I presume before the election some deflector companies will pull the plug and when Members go out to canvass people will ask why.  The answer will be that the Government stopped the deflector systems.  The Minister has a choice; he must tell those operating deflectors systems they are operating illegally and face the problems we did when in Government or legalise them and ask them to pay a huge fee.  If we legalise deflector systems, the price to the consumer will increase.</P>
      <P>The only people making money from deflector systems are the providers of the service who are earning money illegally.  I am not sure if they are paying tax.  How does one tax an illegal operation? The Minister and the Minister for Finance must find a way to tax the providers of deflector systems.  The Minister is in a minefield and will be unable to resolve the problem, but I wish him well in trying to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a pertinent motion because much concern has been expressed about Sky and other large television corporations seeking exclusive rights to all-Ireland finals and rugby matches for commercial reasons.  However, Sky has offered a great service in terms of its coverage of soccer matches, etc., and there is no doubt interest in soccer has grown.  One only has to go into a pub on a Sunday when Manchester United is playing Chelsea or another large English club to see the hours of enjoyment it provides.  It is not necessarily true to say Sky is a huge problem.  The problem is how we ensure significant matches are protected and made accessible to everybody through our broadcasting system.  We should sit down and put a legislative proposal in place to ensure any match or home event is transmitted through the national broadcasting service free of charge.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to community television.  It is a minefield because, unfortunately, it has been made a political issue.  All parties can claim guilt for that.  However, during by-election campaigns in Cork the electorate was told that if the candidates were returned to the Dáil, certain community television providers would be granted a temporary licence.  What will happen to these providers?  There has been hedging and hiding behind court cases.  Politicians claimed they could not comment because the matter was <i>sub judice.</i> Now that the case has concluded, can the Government give a response to community television providers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position is grossly unfair on large numbers of people who avail of that service at present at a reasonable cost.  If the providers are illegal it is incumbent on a Government to enforce the law.  The Government has two choices. It can introduce legislation or arrive at a compromise with the companies which object to the current position.  The people who are suffering <Col N="419" /> are not the community television providers or the multichannel providers but the viewers.  They do not know where they stand or whether they will have a television service next week or next month.  They do not know whether to buy a satellite dish.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to make a swift decision.  I understand the sensitivities of the issue but it was made a political issue by the present Government parties when they were in opposition.  The problem must be resolved immediately.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, appeared on television a few days ago and again he hedged on the question by saying the matter had just been dealt with by the court and that proposals would be put forward. Everybody knew what the outcome of the court case would be.  The Government should have had legislation ready to ensure that these groups are established on a statutory basis or it should have made them illegal by enforcing the present legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Government decides to allow the community television providers to function on a long-term basis, will such providers be exempt from planning legislation, as some of them do not have such permission at present?  Can they be exempted from applying for planning permission if the Government deems their operations essential?</P>

      <P>Last night in Sweden I was offered, by telephone, a menu of Ministers whom I could choose to reply to this debate.  I chose the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and, having heard his contribution, I am exceedingly glad I did so.  The Minister was, as usual, magisterial.</P>
      <P>I am glad he referred to Dennis Potter as he was part of the inspiration for this motion.  I had a slight friendship with Mr. Potter as I was his host for a week during the 1982 celebrations of the centenary of James Joyce.  I remember the extraordinarily moving interview he gave when he said his pancreatic cancer was to be named Rupert after Mr. Murdoch, who was his <i>bete noir.</i> I am grateful to Senator Naughten for his contribution and to Senator Quinn who fulfilled the role of devil's advocate or Aunt Sally.  All his arguments were knocked for six but, if we had not given the opportunity for that view to be promoted, the debate might have seemed one sided. Senator Quinn ensured that this was not the case.</P>
      <P>The attempt by one of the media empires, presumably BSkyB, to acquire exclusive rights to the retransmission in Europe of the summer and winter Olympic Games from 2000 to 2008, by making what the European Commission coyly describes as &ldquo;an extremely high bid&rdquo;, led to another defensive move by the European Union when the European Parliament passed a resolution on the broadcasting of sports events on 22 May 1996. The preamble to this resolution notes that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the costs of the right to broadcast sports events are reaching levels that only make it possible <Col N="420" /> for the most capital rich broadcasters to bid for them successfully and that, as a result, there is a danger of the right of the public to information being undermined due to the exercise by a broadcaster of exclusive rights for the transmission or retransmission of an event of high public interest.  As a result this resolution welcomes the amendment of 6 February, 1996, to the UK Broadcasting Bill and suggests that other European states might follow suit.</P>
    <P>By 5 February this year the European Commission produced a document entitled &ldquo;Television Without Tears and Major Sports Events; Commission Communication&rdquo;.  In this the Commission indicates that the exercise of exclusive rights for the television broadcast, in a transfrontier context, of a major event may prove to be detrimental to the right of access of the public to information.  It recommends that each member state should take action within its own boundaries to ensure that the buccaneering tactics of international television moguls do not strip its citizens of access to their culture.  In particular, member states are held to &ldquo;retain competence to decide for themselves what events, be they sports or other events, they consider to be of major importance for their population&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the UK, for example, the Broadcasting Act, 1996, contains provisions to guarantee the availability of live coverage of listed events to the in-the-clear television system.  There are currently eight events listed by the Secretary of State for National Heritage.  They are: the FA cup final, the Scottish FA cup final, the FIFA World Cup final, the Derby, the Grand National, the Olympic Games, the Wimbledon tennis championships and cricket test matches involving England.</P>
    <P>The Independent Television Commission is currently drawing up a code for the implementation of these measures.  United Kingdom measures apply to broadcasts by domestic broadcasters &mdash; that is, those under UK jurisdiction &mdash; and for reception in the UK.  France has a roughly similar situation in which similar or identical sporting fixtures are protected.  In the Flemish community of Belgium a list is drawn up by the Minister responsible for culture and media before 1 July each year consisting of cultural and sports events of major interest to the Flemish public. The Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, Denmark and Italy have taken, with differing methodologies, similar steps to protect what they see as part of their national sporting and cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in common with Greece, Sweden, Finland, Spain and Luxembourg, has no system of protection yet.  A working group has been set up to examine the possibility of legal intervention to prevent broadcasters from outside Ireland acquiring exclusive rights to transmit major sporting events taking place in Ireland.  As of last Friday, I was unable to determine what, if any, conclusions had been reached or what recommendations might be made.  However, the Minister made his feelings clear.  It is urgent that this <Col N="421" /> House should make clear its unambiguous view of the matter.</P>
    <P>The question of deflector systems and MMDS is comparatively unimportant.  However, it applies to the same underlying principle, the right of access of all citizens to information.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20 February carried a report on a group involving 2,000 householders which erected a deflector mast that has been in operation for 15 years.  The mast captures and rebroadcasts from a position near Enniskillen the signals of BBC and ITV.  This type of community development roughly parallels the equally intriguing agitation currently surrounding local group water schemes who are aggrieved at being excluded from the benefits of the Government's water rate amnesty.</P>
    <P>The issue of the deflector systems could add an intriguing element to the coming election.  In 1990, an independent candidate in Cork South-Central polled 2,239 first preference votes according to an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Thursday, 20 February, by Unision McDubhghaill. This intervention article helped to unseat the sitting Fianna Fáil TD, John Dennehy.  The Taoiseach has apparently aggravated many of these groups by promising action on the deflector problem but failing to deliver.</P>
    <P>The situation is complicated by an important decision of Mr. Justice Keane in November 1995. He found that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications had failed to act fairly by adopting a policy of granting exclusive licences to MMDS operators only, thus effectively excluding all other applicants and refusing to examine the groups' case for a licence.  Deflector operators are popular because they provide a low cost signal to rural areas which previously did not have a service and do so without raising the spectre of health risk associated, fairly or unfairly, with microwave transmission.</P>
    <P>It is clear that on grounds of universal political and moral principles, as well as on grounds of media self-interest, the Government would be well advised to take serious note of the substance of this debate.  I thank the Minister for contributing and listening so graciously and I thank my colleague, Senator Henry, for her clear and incisive contribution.  I also thank the House for allowing me to impugn the reputation of Mr. Rupert Murdoch in a way I have long wished to do in a public arena.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the completion of an extension of the boys' school in <Col N="422" /> Ballingarry, County Limerick.  There are two schools in Ballingarry &mdash; a girls' schools and a boys' school.  The girls' school is based in the old convent school which was in operation until 1986 when the convent was sold.  The residence became a private house and the school was given to the parish.  The parish has the school building but does not have direct access to the outside walls at the back and at one side for repair and maintenance purposes because they are on private grounds.  The roof was in a very bad condition and it had to be stripped and repaired. However, it could not be done on the private property side.  Half of the roof and the floors have deteriorated beyond repair and it would be a waste to spend money on them.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the parish and the schools voted for an amalgamation with the boys' school, given the condition of the building and the difficulty of access to it.  Cars cannot get within 100 yards of the school and this causes problems in bad weather.</P>
      <P>The girls' school has four teachers.  Its enrolment is mixed, up to and including second class, and is girls only from second class. The boys' school is in good condition. It has two teachers and 30 pupils from third to sixth class.  It does not make sense to split up the pupils in this manner.  Some parents bring children to both schools which are at opposite ends of the village.  In the fourth class, for example, there are eight pupils in total, that is, three girls in the girls' school and five boys in the boy's school.</P>
      <P>There are 99 pupils in the girls' school and 30 pupils in the boys' school &mdash; 129 pupils in total, which is sufficient for one school.  The plans to extend the boys' school are at an advanced stage. The nature of the split of the two schools results in doubled expenses &mdash; double water rates, electricity and telephone connections, refuse collection, insurance and television licences.  The present arrangements do not make sense given the size of the schools and the condition of the girls' school.  There is an urgency about rationalising the schools.  This has been lobbied for by parents and teachers alike.  The Minister should ensure that this rediculous situation is rectified this year.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity to outline to the House, on behalf of the Minister for Education, the current position regarding the proposed extension to Ballingarry boys' national school, Ballingarry, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>The Ballingarry boys' school is due to amalgamate with Ballingarry girls' national school and, to facilitate this amalgamation, a building project was included in the Department's 1995 capital programme for planning.  The project comprises a three classroom extension, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation at the boys' school, together with alterations to the existing building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> At present the boys' school has a staffing level of a principal, one assistant teacher and an enrolment of 29.  The girls' school is currently staffed by a principal, three assistant teachers and has an enrolment of 99.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the school on the 1995 programme should be seen as the beginning of a process involving detailed examination of enrolment projections, the assessment of the two school buildings, the preparation of contract documentation for works to the chosen building, the invitation of tenders and the award and execution of a contract.  At present the project has reached the stage where the documentation required to invite tenders is prepared and the pre-qualification tender process has been completed.</P>
    <P>Due to budgetary constraints, the Minister is not in a position to authorise the release of this project to tender immediately.  Recently, the Minister approved 27 national school projects for <Col N="424" /> tender and contract stages.  However, it was not possible to include all deserving projects in the first round of projects which were allowed to proceed to tender stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister will keep expenditure on the primary school building programme under review this year and she expects to release a number of additional projects to tender and contract on a phased basis later this year.  The number of projects to be released will be contingent on the results of the tender process for the 27 projects already announced, the progress of those projects and the overall funding position at the time.  The school management will be kept informed of developments.  The Senator can be assured that the needs of the school will receive every consideration at the appropriate time and I thank him again for the opportunity to outline the current position.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 February 1997.</P>
