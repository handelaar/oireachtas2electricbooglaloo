      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 2.  With the co-operation of the House, we will take all Stages of item 1.  I suggest 20 minutes per speaker on Second Stage.  Item 2 will be taken immediately after the completion of item 1.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. The House will welcome yesterday's announcement of profits by Aer Rianta.  However, it will also be concerned by the chairman's forecast of a reduction in duty free sales and its effects on the company.  It is estimated that the reduction will be about £40 million but, more importantly, that it will lead to job losses.  Will the Leader use his good offices to ensure the Government makes every effort to have duty free sales extended? They cost the State nothing and there are only benefits to be gained from them.  Will the Leader use the last few days of this Administration to ensure every effort is made to extend duty free sales?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to note the atrocities over the past few days in the North &mdash; the murders of the chairman of a GAA club last night, a gay RUC man two days earlier and a youth coming home from a dance days before that.  There is an element of us walking on eggshells on this issue and I am glad Senator McAughtry raised these matters yesterday.  This is nothing more than rampant sectarianism and is happening in this the European year against racism.  Attitudes seem to be getting worse.  One problem is that we only tend to respond to killings and atrocities.  These are just the outward manifestations of attitudes that exist.  This goes back to educational values and tolerance towards people living and being educated together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have time to discuss racism in detail. The Government has set up a national committee to co-ordinate activities during the European year against racism.  Events in the North highlight the need for such a committee more than ever.  It <Col N="930" /> is happening at all levels of society and there is racism in the South also.  It is latent but has potential and must be addressed before it takes a grip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly endorse Senator O'Toole's comments.  In reference to remarks made yesterday, it has been my experience since I became a Member of the House that there has been cross party agreement on how to proceed in both Houses.  It is not the intention of any political party to politicise this matter for political gain because it is of such a serious nature.  There is no doubt we all supported the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document.  All of us participated in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and, with one exception, were able to agree on a report.  The exception was Sinn Féin who could not adopt the principle of consent which is central to a settlement.  There is very little difference between democratic parties.  We are committed to the democratic process and wish to see these atrocities stopped.  The best way to do so is through the IRA declaring a ceasefire and for sectarian bigots to desist from what they are doing.  It is appalling that an official in a sporting organisation should be singled out because he is a Catholic and a member of the GAA.  It is equally unacceptable that an off duty policeman should be singled out and shot in a bar or that a youth should be kicked senseless and die as a result.  That cannot be accepted in any civilised society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly concur with Senator O'Toole's remarks and as Senator Dardis said, there is a cross party view in the House.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I join in the condemnation of the recent killings.  There is a horrible sectarian element in these killings.  In the case of Seán Browne the killers picked someone coming from a GAA club on the understanding he would be of the opposite religion.  Until recently the most senior officer of the GAA in the Republic was Protestant.  This reflects the terrible sectarian division in Northern Ireland.  I hope people will respond to the new Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, and the opportunities to bring people together.  I hope there will be a new era in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Wright on duty free sales. It is an important economic element, particularly around Shannon, Dublin and Cork airports. People in these areas are concerned about the issue.  I know the Government will do what it can to ensure duty free sales continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has come to my notice that children as young as ten years old are still begging on the streets of Dublin and not attending school. Despite the passing of several Children's Bills and hours of debate on how the problem should be solved, nothing seems to have been done. Social workers say they are helpless and can do nothing.  I ask the Leader if, in the remaining days of this session, the Minister of State at the <Col N="931" /> Department of Health, Deputy Currie, can come to the House to tell us what he intends to do to curb this problem in the summer.</P>
      <P>We are trying to educate these children, yet they are not at school when they should be.  We are giving the &ldquo;Harvey Smith&rdquo; to the legislation and the work we have done in both Houses to introduce legislation to make a better way of life for those children.  Can we have a short debate to ask the Minister what he can do?  People who are trying to ease the problem seem to be unable to get answers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Following the Adjournment Debate on the matter a number of weeks ago, I ask the Leader to ask Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to introduce an information campaign on genetic engineering.  An injunction has been brought against Monsanto, who are conducting field trials on genetically engineered beets.  The organisation taking out this injunction are using scare tactics to get people to support them on this issue, without any evidence.  We need a full debate on this as the public must be informed.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment to look into the possibility of opening polling stations until 10 o'clock on election day, especially for young people going home to vote from Dublin or wherever?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the comments made on Northern Ireland.  Every time another tragedy occurs there, there is a temptation not to express our abhorrence.  It is necessary to do this continuously, no matter how often or how long it takes.</P>
      <P>I can understand why it was decided yesterday not to take the Adoption Bill.  However, particularly in relation to the Paraguayan adoption, it may be possible in the interim period of the election &mdash; because both sides have agreed the Bill will get priority in the next session &mdash; for the Minister to obtain a second legal opinion.  There is a grave doubt as to whether it is a simple and complete adoption.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, on the document published yesterday, <i>Quality Customer Service for Customers and Clients of the Civil Service.</i>  This is an important part of the strategic management initiative because it changes the attitude to customer service in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intended establishment of a food safety board last November has not taken place.  The priority given to it was not sufficient for it to be established in time.  For once the British are coming behind us as today's <i>Financial Times</i> stated that the British Food Safety Board is to be incorporated in its Department of Health.  It has provided <Col N="932" /> a six week consultation period.  This is the type of effort we need to make as regards priority, speed and urgency.  There has been a danger that in projects where we take the first step, we lose the force of energy when we try to get them off the ground.  I welcome the decision to establish a separate food safety council, although it disappoints me that we have not finalised legislation before the end of this session. I hope it will be given priority in the new session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Farrell raised the issue of children on the street, as I did six or seven months ago.  I have investigated the problem. While it is probably unrealistic to have a debate on the matter, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, to circulate information on the efforts he has made in trying to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>In my investigations I discovered there are about 12 families in Dublin who control the racket, which is very sophisticated, with networking involved among them.  It brings in an average of £150 per week per child, which is a minimum.  If this is multiplied by eight, it is a huge income.  Not giving the children money does not work, because they are beaten up by the parents, who say they are not handing over the cash.  Children were arrested on O'Connell Bridge and taken to the Garda station in the hope that the parents would show up.  The Garda could not hold them any longer.</P>
      <P>There is now a drop-in centre where children can go voluntarily to be fed and washed.  They are encouraged to come in so they can be introduced to another lifestyle.  It is a difficult problem and a disgrace to us that children of six and seven years of age are begging on the streets.  I asked children who had a placard saying &ldquo;Homeless and Hungry&rdquo; to spell the word &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;.  It was obvious they were given the cardboard to put in front of them.  I agree with Senator Farrell that the issue is worth debating.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, has done a great deal but it is not enough until we solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments on Northern Ireland by the leaders of the various parties.  I also welcome Senator McAughtry's comments yesterday.  I agree with Senator O'Sullivan that we should continue to unequivocally condemn sectarian murders.  I convey my sincere sympathy to the family of Seán Browne in Bellaghy.  I make a limited income from sports broadcasting and it comes home to one when one is partially involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a Unionist perception that the GAA is a sectarian organisation because of rule 21.  I refute this as the GAA is not sectarian in its outlook, attitude or ethos.  That rule applies because of historical reasons.  Hopefully, there will be no need for it in a new political settlement.  However, there is no doubt that even at the highest levels of unionism this perception ensues.  Consequently, the GAA and its members who go about <Col N="933" /> their business in an open manner are open targets.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader convey to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is indirectly involved, through his officials, in discussions with Sinn Féin, my views as expressed in the House? We frequently call on the Unionist leaders to lower tension in the run up to 12 July, specifically in relation to Drumcree.  I am aware from my discussions with senior Orange Order figures in the last few weeks that there is a genuine desire on the part of that organisation's leaders to defuse any potential conflict and to avoid a third standoff at Drumcree.</P>
    <P>It is also incumbent on Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness as newly elected MPs, if they are genuine about defusing the explosive atmosphere in Northern Ireland which is building up as a result of sectarian murders, to use whatever influence they have to do so.  They cannot stand at arm's length from the community groups representing residents in areas of Northern Ireland. There are Nationalists involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and, in turn, to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, the desire that they would be proactive in the coming weeks in trying to defuse the situation in the North, specifically in relation to Drumcree, where some Sinn Féin people are involved.  Hopefully, with goodwill on both sides a third standoff at Drumcree will be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Farrell and Senator Magner for a debate on children begging in the city.  If the Minister was to come to the House he might also address the preelection manifesto of the ISPCC which addresses many issues of child welfare.  That group would be anxious that we had an opportunity to discuss its document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Quinn's views on the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.  I requested that the Minister would not bring the legislation before the House until we had an indication of the Supreme Court decision on the right to confidentiality case.  The Minister indicated that it was unlikely there would be an early general election.  For that reason I requested that he would not bring the legislation before the House.  I think he referred to November as the likely election date.  It now appears that there will be a delay in dealing with the issue of foreign adoptions and the amendment which Senator O'Toole and I proposed.  I asked the Minister to have that amendment examined by the Attorney General to see if it would cover the requirements of the Paraguayan adoptees.  It now seems likely that the election will be in June.  Therefore, the Minister should seek the opinion of the Attorney General and <Col N="934" /> convey it to the parents involved who are very concerned that this legislation will not now be dealt with.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister implied that there was no question of an election in the foreseeable future.  On that basis I asked that my other amendments, which are separate from the issue of foreign adoptions, would be addressed in the context of the Supreme Court case.  There is nothing to prevent the Bill coming back before the House so that we might deal with my other amendments on contacts registers, birth certificates and databases.  I would be willing to withdraw those amendments if it would facilitate the legislation being dealt with to the satisfaction of the prospective parents of Paraguayan adoptees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Mooney referred to the Unionist perceptions of the GAA. I listened to the sympathy expressed to Mr. Seán Browne's family wondering how I could raise the Unionist perception of the GAA without appearing, at least in part, to defend the sectarian assassination of Mr. Seán Browne.  Unionists perceive the GAA as Senator Mooney outlined. Over the years I have tried to convey my views on this issue.  I am aware that the relevant articles of the GAA's constitution which appear to be sectarian do not carry as much weight in the South as in the North and I understand why they are important in the North.  I advise Unionists that the only way in which these articles will wither away is if they go to watch their counties play at GAA fixtures.  I have done so for years. They should go to Croke Park, Casement Park or wherever else the fixtures are being played to support their counties.  They may feel a little excluded when they do so; I feel oddly exposed when I go to fixtures, but I like the games.  Hurling is the finest game I have ever seen and I have tried to convey this point to my Unionist friends in the North.  Some of them agree with me and go to watch their counties games.  A winning GAA team has gone to Belfast City Hall with a Unionist mayor and I would like to see that become routine.</P>
      <P>I express my sincere sympathy to the family and friends of Mr. Seán Browne, to the club to which he belonged and to the GAA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Naughten that the polling stations should be open until 10 p.m.  Will the Leader convey my opinion to the Taoiseach that if he is to dissolve the Dáil he should call the election before 4 June?  Senator Naughten and others have expressed the desire that students and young people would be facilitated to vote.  However, my information is that 90 per cent of university students will have left the country by 5 June.  Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach to hold the election on 3 June?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We may not have time for a debate on house prices over the next few days but there is a growing emergency in the housing market, particularly for young people seeking subsidised housing.  The cost of sites and houses has grown out of all proportion and this has forced more people into the public housing sector. Not enough money is provided for that sector. There are self-supporting groups which provide houses and the State provides 90 per cent funding. If the price of land increases at a rapid rate, it becomes impossible for young people to obtain public housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the issue.  Rather than deprive single people of benefits because they are living with their parents, they should be given a benefit to stay in their parents' houses and this might address many of the problems associated with the health boards having to subsidise rented accommodation.  That drives up the cost of rented accommodation and forces many people into deprived areas.</P>
      <P>A task force should be set up to examine the phenomenon of young children being put out to beg on the streets by their parents. We had a particular problem in this regard in Kilkenny and through the efforts of the Department of Social Welfare, the health board, the Garda and the Department of the Environment we were able to ensure that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with other Members in sending our deepest sympathy to the family of Seán Browne who was murdered by a sectarian group.  It is right to have all-party support for solving the problems in the North. However, we in the Opposition have a right and duty to raise matters of concern in relation to the North.  As someone who is in the North ten times a week and who was a founder member of a north-west cross-Border group with which all sectarian and political groups are involved, I do not take too kindly to lectures from people who are seldom, if ever, in the North.  I must be mindful of what I say in this House when I meet people who differ religiously and politically from me. One must be honest, outspoken and frank.  One cannot speak with a forked tongue, making one statement in the Seanad and another when one meets one's colleagues in the North.  My party has an obligation to complain about the lack of progress. <Col N="936" /> It might hurt if I went into the details but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally in favour of an all-party approach to the very serious problems which are costing so many lives in the North.  That message must be clear.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of hype and publicity from the Minister for the Environment about the alternatives he would put in place to water charges and the funding he would provide. My council, Donegal County Council, issued a letter, dated 9 May 1997, in which it stated that the details are not available from the Department. I want to express my bitter disappointment, on the day before the Dáil is dissolved, that this House has not had an opportunity to tell the Minister about our concerns.  Up until now it has just been paper talk, with no plans for, or intention of, a delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senators Farrell, Magner and others about children begging on the streets.  As the chairman of the Eastern Health Board's community care programme, I have raised this issue on several occasions.  The statutory authorities are not using their full rights under the Child Care Act.  I raised with the chief executive of the ISPCC the matter of children begging on the ISPCC's doorstep.</P>
      <P>I believe that political correctness is preventing the statutory authorities, particularly the health boards, from intervening in this very serious issue of child abuse.  Previous speakers are correct that effective action should be taken against this abuse.  It is an extraordinary exploitation of children to put them begging on streets to finance the drinking binges of their parents or other adults.  It is an unacceptable abuse of children which the statutory authorities have perfect powers to prevent, but will not do so because they are terrified of political correctness.</P>
      <P>I have made complaints in this city about specific children on the street but the issue has been passed back and forth between the health board and the Garda Síochána.  There should be concerted action to end this.  Whatever hue the incoming Administration is, it should address this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader convey my concern, which I am sure is shared by others, about an issue which has arisen in recent days in regard to the calculation of pensions of health care workers? Retirees from the health boards, particularly the Eastern Health Board, have been circulated with letters this week indicating that under new arrangements the 50 per cent allowance for any additions, which were previously regarded as part of the calculation of pensions, will no longer be included in pensions.  I spoke to a trade union leader last night who suggested there is some confusion about the issue.  I have written to the Eastern <Col N="937" /> Health Board asking for this matter to be resolved.  A communication from the Minister for Health to the health boards clarifying the issue would be helpful.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment whether there has been a fundamental change in the past two days in social housing policy? As the Leader and other Members are aware, there has been a very controversial policy in parts of the country, particularly Dublin and Wicklow, of local authorities acquiring houses in private estates for use as part of the social housing mix.  Councillor McManus of Democratic Left announced yesterday that his party no longer supported this policy.  That surprised me because his wife is the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with responsibility for housing. That party criticised those of us who were critical of the policy.  Has there been a fundamental change in Government housing policy in this regard?  It would be very interesting for every councillor who opposed that policy to know there has been a Pauline conversion on the part of Democratic Left.  Is Democratic Left now reflecting a sensible policy which the Minister has imposed on it?  It would be in the public interest to know if the housing policy has been changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Senators Wright and O'Sullivan about the threat to duty free facilities in the major airports is an important matter with enormous economic implications. The Senators' concerns will be conveyed and strongly supported.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Dardis and many others raised the question of the current situation in Northern Ireland.  All the contributions this morning clearly conveyed the sense of shock and horror and feeling of sickness we all have once again.  On almost a daily basis in this last week of the Seanad, we are rising to condemn the ritual sectarian slaughter which has become such a terrible feature of life in the Northern part of this country in recent times.  Our sympathies go to the relatives of people who have so needlessly, senselessly and brutally lost their lives on all sides.</P>
      <P>All the contributions this morning also bear out very strongly the importance, and value in the past, of a bipartisan approach to the question of Northern Ireland.  Senator Magner put the point well yesterday that all Governments have made their contribution and there has been a continuity of policy, for the most part, since the beginning of the Northern troubles.  It would be a great disservice if any party sought to put differences on Northern policy as a major item on the domestic political agenda in the forthcoming election, or sought to accentuate differences which do not really exist between parties here on the question. I hope and believe that temptation will be resisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised the interesting question of children begging on the streets.  I thank Senator Magner, in particular, for bringing the attention of the House to the steps which are <Col N="938" /> being taken and the difficulties involved in commenting on this.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, to circulate to interested Senators the steps which have been and are being taken and the difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten raised the question of the closing time of the poll.  It is my understanding that polling stations will be open until 10 p.m. on whatever day is chosen for the election.</P>
    <P>Senators Quinn and McGennis raised the question of the Adoption Bill.  I am meeting with the Attorney General today to convey the concerns to him and to see if we can make further progress towards getting a resolution of the problem of the Paraguayan parents.  I will return to Senator Quinn with the result of that meeting.  While I know Senator McGennis has admired the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, for a long time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I explained to the House yesterday, the Senator's request to have the completion of the Bill deferred until the outcome of the court case was only one of the reasons for deferring it.  I am as concerned as anybody else to obtain the right answer to this problem.  There is a commitment on all sides of the House that the Bill will be reinstated on Report Stage as one of the first Acts of the new House, no matter who is back in Government.  The normal delay will not apply in this case.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn expressed his admiration for the new proposals under the name of the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, for a better quality service in the public service.  All of us welcome those innovations.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Bill is close to being finalised. This means that when the new Government takes over, or more likely when the new Government is continued in a new form, that Bill will be ready to be introduced almost immediately.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of house prices.  It is an important question and the Senator will be glad to know that the number of new local authority houses built this year is at an all time high.  The problem of house prices is a big one and the rezoning of more land may need to be looked at.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche raised a number of questions for which I do not have answers.  On the question of health care workers, as far as I am aware Councillor John McManus does not make Government policy on housing but I am sure the Senator could address the question directly to Councillor McManus.</P>

      <P>I would point out to Senators that due to a printing error in the printed copy of the Electoral Bill, 1994, as passed by Dáil Éireann, pages 49, 50, 60 and 61 are out of sequence.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to explain why a Bill which was introduced in the Dáil in June 1994 is only now coming before the Seanad. While the Second Stage was completed in the Dáil in October 1995, the delay in completing its passage through the Dáil was due mainly to allow time for consideration of the implications, especially for the proposed payments to political parties, of the Supreme Court judgments in the McKenna case and also the Hanafin appeal on the outcome of the divorce referendum.</P>
      <P>The Bill was debated extensively on Committee Stage by the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  More than 18 hours were spent debating the Bill, which resulted in the consideration of in excess of 230 amendments. Further amendments were made to the Bill yesterday on Report Stage in the Dáil, many of which were to meet concerns expressed during the Committee Stage debate.  Due to the extensive amendments to the Bill as originally published, I have circulated a memorandum on the Bill with the amendments agreed on Committee Stage for the information of Senators.  Due to time constraints, the memorandum does not include the amendments made yesterday on Report Stage.  I have had a list of the amendments stapled to the memorandum for the assistance of Senators.</P>
      <P>Concerning the Motion for Earlier Signature, the provision of the Bill dealing with the disclosure of donations and ancillary provisions will come into operation on the enactment of the Bill. Again, due to time constraints, it is not practicable to have the expenditure limits of the election in operation for the forthcoming election. However, the Government decided that the provisions relating to donations are to be applicable to donations received after enactment of the Bill in connection with the general election.  Early signature of the Bill is required to ensure that the provisions are operational in the case of an early dissolution of the Dáil and preparation of the necessary guidelines and forms by the Public Offices Commission can be commenced at the earliest date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is sevenfold.  It will establish on a statutory basis an independent electoral commission to prepare proposals for revision of Dáil and European Parliament constituencies. It will provide for limited State funding of political parties, part recoupment of certain candidates' election expenses, require the disclosure <Col N="940" /> of substantial political donations and impose limits on election expenditure by candidates and political parties at elections.  It also contains provisions to set up new voting arrangements for electors who are unable by reason of their occupation to vote at their polling station.  Other miscellaneous amendments to electoral law are also included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to constituency revision, the Bill provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of an independent constituency commission to prepare proposals for the revision of Dáil and European Parliament constituencies.  Under the Bill, the commission will be set up on the publication of the census report following each census of population.  It will be chaired by a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the commission set out in the Bill are essentially the same as those given to previous non-statutory commissions. They are identical to those given to the Dáil constituency commission which reported in April 1995 and whose recommendations are given effect in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>The commission must invite and consider submissions. An amendment agreed by the Dáil yesterday provides that the commission will provide a statement to people who wish to make a submission setting out the constitutional restraints and statistical details of the existing constituencies. This statement should be helpful to members of the public who wish to make a submission to the commission.  The Dáil also agreed that submissions made to the commission will be available for public inspection and copies can be obtained at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>By providing a statutory base, the Bill will enhance the standing and authority of the commission and will guarantee its independence.  The Dáil agreed an amendment inserting section 15 in the Bill, which provides that it will be unlawful and an offence to communicate with the commission, apart from making a submission under section 10, to seek to influence the commission in carrying out its functions.</P>
    <P>Following enactment of the Bill, the first statutory constituency commission will be set up later this year when the results of the 1996 census of population are published.  The commission will review both the Dáil and European Parliament constituencies.  There is general agreement that the practice of having constituencies drawn up by an independent electoral commission is an improvement on the former practice under which constituencies were revised by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for payments to each political party which is registered in the Register of Political Parties, is organised throughout the State to contest Dáil elections and whose candidates obtained not less than 2 per cent of the first preference votes at an election.  In accordance with an amendment agreed by the Dáil yesterday, this part of the Bill will not <Col N="941" /> become operative until 1 January 1998 and payments from that date will be based on the results in the forthcoming election.  Payments will continue from 1 January next to the day before polling day at the next election after January 1998. After that election, payments will be made from polling day to the eve of polling day at the subsequent general elections.</P>
    <P>The case for public funding rests on the essential role which political parties play in the democratic process.  It has become fashionable to denigrate politicians and political parties, even though most politicians are hard working individuals serving their constituents as best as possible.  Political parties are the work horses of democracy and the functioning of parliamentary democracy which does not involve political parties of one kind or another would be difficult to envisage. Political parties provide the essential underpinning for democratic structures and make it possible for people to exercise an effective electoral choice.</P>
    <P>Pressure on parties in a modern society demands increasing professionalism, access to an expanding range of expertise and more effective communication strategies.  Today's electorate demands comprehensive, coherent and costed policies, properly presented and explained.</P>
    <P>To function satisfactorily, parties require an adequate level of funding.  Specifically, they need a certain basic level of income which can be relied on and which can be supplemented, as required, by the party's own efforts.  Traditional sources of income, such as the subscriptions of members and voluntary fund raising, corporate or otherwise, are no longer adequate to meet the full cost of the operations of political parties.  To share in the limited funds available from these sources, parties must compete not only with one another but with a range of voluntary and charitable organisations at local and national level.  This intense competition for funds obliges party organisations to devote an undue proportion of their time and energy to fund raising.  Time and energy which should be devoted to the development of policies directed towards the real problems of our society are dissipated in this way.</P>
    <P>The difficulties associated with the financing of the political system are not exclusive to this country but are experienced in most parliamentary democracies.  Throughout the democratic world there is increasing acceptance of the concept of public funding of political parties to one degree or another, but this is not to imply that the argument is all one way.  While acknowledging that State funding is no panacea, the view has been taken that, in line with most of our partners in the EU, it is appropriate and in the wider public interest to propose the introduction of a modest measure of direct public funding.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill seek to approach the matter in a balanced way.  Care is taken to ensure that parties will not become unduly dependent on public funding.  The proposed funding is designed to supplement, not to replace, income from other <Col N="942" /> sources.  The £1 million per annum represents 37p for each elector on the register of electors.  This is a modest sum and will only be increased in line with general pay increases in the Civil Service. Parties will be required to account for the money provided by way of an audited statement and the funds cannot be used for direct electoral purposes.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to provide for the reimbursement of certain candidates' election expenses up to £5,000 or actual expenses, if less.  A candidate will have to obtain sufficient votes to save his or her deposit at an election.  This means a candidate's vote will have to exceed a quarter of the quota.  The proposal accords with the concepts of equality of treatment as enunciated in the Supreme Court judgments as far as candidates at an election are concerned.  In view of the short time between the enactment of the Bill and the June election, it is not proposed to bring this section into operation until 1 January 1998.  The recoupment is linked with the expenditure limits proposed in Part V of the Bill.  It is not feasible to have the expenditure limits implemented for the June election as the Bill's provisions are not retrospective in application.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that participation by women and young persons in political activity should be encouraged.  Parties will, therefore, be required to indicate the extent of their expenditure for these purposes.  The amount the parties devote to such expenditure will be left to their own judgment, but their decision in this regard will be open to scrutiny by interested groups and the public generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to public donations, the Bill requires the disclosure of political donations exceeding £4,000 in the case of a political party and £500 in the case of an individual.  This part of the Bill and the sections concerning donations at a presidential election will become operative on the enactment of the Bill.  Donations received for political purposes from the date of enactment of the Bill will be covered.</P>
    <P>Under Part IV, political parties and Members of each House of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament will be required to state each year whether a donation exceeding the relevant specified value was received during the year and giving particulars of any such donation.  Following an election, candidates not elected at the election must furnish a similar statement in relation to donations received by them at the election.</P>
    <P>Donations to branches, candidates, officers and members of a party will be deemed to be made to the party and, for the purpose of disclosure by the party, will be aggregated.  A donation will include the value of property, goods and services provided free of charge or at reduced cost, as well as monetary contributions.  The aggregate of all donations made by the same person or body in any year or at the same election will be treated as a single donation.  The disclosure obligation will apply to donations made directly or through any intermediary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> Acceptance of anonymous donations exceeding £100 is prohibited.  Where an anonymous donation above £100 is received, it must be remitted to the Public Offices Commission.  The disclosure requirement will apply to candidates at presidential elections under Part VI of the Bill and provision is made for extension to local authority members and candidates by regulations under section 72.</P>
    <P>Companies will be required to disclose particulars of any political donations exceeding £4,000 made by them, both in the directors' report and in the annual return furnished to the Registrar of Companies.  Trade unions and societies registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies will be required to furnish similar information in their annual returns and this obligation will also apply to building societies.</P>
    <P>In practice, political contributions have generally been treated as confidential up to now in accordance with the wishes of donors.  However, the practice of confidentiality has given rise to suspicion that substantial political contributions may be made with a view to influencing decision making.  Whether or not there is any basis in fact for the suspicion of undue influence, the existing situation is not conducive to the public trust which is an essential element in democracy.  To restore that trust it is necessary to deal with the appearance of and potential for improper influence or corruption.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of public funding for political parties, it is all the more important that the public should know whether parties are in receipt of substantial sums from other sources and, if so, the identity of these sources.  However, the Bill preserves the right to privacy of persons and bodies who may wish to make more modest contributions to the parties and candidates with whose policies they are in agreement.  The objective is to set the thresholds at levels which will represent a reasonable balance between these considerations.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses the suspicion that persons or organisations with substantial resources may seek to use these resources in an attempt to improperly influence official decisions.  Even if such suspicion has no basis, the suspicion itself must be dealt with, and the only effective weapon for combating suspicion is openness.</P>
    <P>With regard to election expenses, Part V, which provides for the limitation of expenditure at Dáil and European Parliament elections, will not be operative for the forthcoming election but will commence on 1 January 1998.  It will apply to any general election or by-election after 1 January next.  Expenditure limits will apply to individual candidates at constituency level and to political parties at national level with the agreement of candidates.</P>
    <P>At Dáil elections the spending limit applicable to candidates will be related to the number of seats allocated to the constituency concerned. The limit will be £14,000 in a three seat constituency, £17,000 in a four seat constituency and <Col N="944" /> £20,000 in a five seat constituency.  A political party, with the agreement of a candidate, can spend up to 50 per cent of the candidate's expenditure limit.  The limits at European elections will be specified by order of the Minister with the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Due to the unique circumstances obtaining in relation to Seanad elections, the question of expenditure control at these elections will be dealt with in separate legislation which is under consideration at present.  I am interested to hear Senators' views on expenditure limits which should be included in that forthcoming legislation.</P>
    <P>Control of expenditure at elections will operate through a system of agents.  Parties must appoint a national agent and each candidate must appoint an election agent.  Agents will be required to maintain appropriate records and furnish, after the election, a detailed expenditure statement with supporting vouchers and a statutory declaration. It will be the responsibility of the agent to control expenditure on behalf of the candidate and the political party.</P>
    <P>At recent elections certain individuals and organisations, having no apparent connection with a party or candidate contesting the election, have published advertisements advocating support for, or more usually opposition to, particular parties and candidates.  The Bill will not affect expenditure by such third parties or place any limit on it.  However, where such third parties propose to incur expenditure for the purpose of influencing the outcome of an election, they will be required to signify their intention to do so in advance and furnish a detailed account of the expenditure incurred by them after the election.</P>
    <P>Recent elections have also witnessed the publication of advertisements by the &ldquo;friends and supporters&rdquo; of particular candidates.  In future such expenditure must be accounted for by the election agent of the candidate concerned.  There will also be a prohibition on publishers of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals accepting such advertisements unless the third party produces evidence that they have notified the Public Offices Commission of their intention to incur expenditure as provided for in section 32(10) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In a democracy it is essential that parties and candidates should have an opportunity of presenting their policies and programmes to the electorate and, for this purpose, be free to incur an appropriate level of expenditure.  Looked at from another perspective, electors are entitled to know what each party and candidate stands for so that they can make an informed choice.  However, extravagant spending at elections is unseemly and inappropriate.  In the intensely competitive atmosphere of an election, parties and candidates can be drawn into a spiral of competitive spending which can serve no real purpose.  It is in everybody's interest that there should be clear and sensible limits.  In laying down expenditure limits, the Bill recognises that extravagant spending is <Col N="945" /> not appropriate, particularly where candidates and political parties will be financed, in part, from public funds.  It also acknowledges that excessive expenditure is ineffective in terms of influencing the outcome of the election and may well be counterproductive.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill relating to funding of political parties, disclosure of donations and control of election expenses will be monitored by the Public Offices Commission, established under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.  In addition to its functions under the 1995 Act, the commission will consider all statements and returns required to be made under this Bill and make these documents available for public inspection.  It will be empowered to demand additional information and documents, to report to the Dáil on any matters arising and to report any suspected contravention of the provisions of this Bill to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The commission will be empowered to allow persons who submit statements to amend any minor error or omission before laying the statements before the Oireachtas.  This is to avoid frivolous challenges to election results.</P>
    <P>The commission will also be empowered to allow an individual or party to make observations on any alleged contravention of the Act before the commission further considers such allegations and any report is sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It will be the function of the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute or authorise prosecution for alleged offences.  Offences under the Bill will include failure to furnish a donation statement or a statement of election expenditure, furnishing false or misleading statements or incurring election expenses above the permitted limit.</P>
    <P>There will be other sanctions also.  For example, payments due to a political party under the Bill will be withheld if the party fails to furnish an audited statement regarding the preceding year's funding or if it fails to furnish a donation statement.  Similarly, excess expenditure incurred by a party or a candidate at an election may be recovered from any payments due under the Bill.  Thus, there will be effective measures in place to ensure compliance.  However, the most significant enforcement mechanism will be the force of informed public opinion.  The thrust of the Bill is to make for greater openness in public life.  All relevant information will be published and will be readily available to the Oireachtas, the media and the public.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides facilities for voting by electors who because of their occupation are unable to vote at their polling station.  The facilities are intended to assist fishermen, transport workers, business persons and others, including students, whose occupations involve frequent absence from home.  This will meet a long felt need to which attention has been drawn by Members of both Houses over the years.  Such electors may in future apply for entry in the postal voters list.  At <Col N="946" /> an election or a referendum a ballot paper will be sent by post to each elector concerned.  The elector may vote at any Garda station, having produced satisfactory evidence of identity and on making a declaration of identity which will be witnessed by the garda on duty and stamped with the stamp of the Garda station.  The arrangements proposed will provide a reasonable opportunity for voting by the categories concerned while providing adequate safeguards for the secrecy and integrity of the ballot.  It is intended to have these provisions in operation for the Presidential Election in the autumn.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the Bill is contained in section 76, which provides for the amendment to the Electoral Act, 1992, to provide for the inclusion by way of the supplement to the register of persons who reach 18 years of age during the currency of the register; the inclusion in the supplement of persons such as those who move house or returned emigrants who were not ordinarily resident at an address on the qualifying date and took up residence at that address since the qualifying date, provided they are not already registered at any address; the provision of a supplement to the postal voters list and to the special voters list of persons who are not already on either such list, and the making available, on request and free of charge, of a copy of the register of electors to each Member of the Dáil for a constituency and each Member of the Seanad resident in a constituency at a referendum.  Other miscellaneous amendments to electoral law are detailed in the memorandum circulated.  I am aware of comments about the opening of polling stations and I will bring that matter to the attention of the Minister and officials in the Department.</P>
    <P>This Bill is of considerable significance, addressing complex questions in relation to the political process.  I believe Members will welcome its broad principles and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is more than pleased that this legislation is winding its way towards a conclusion.  It has been centre stage in this House and elsewhere and it continues to be a source of controversy, particularly among the public.  There has been a climate of cynicism, bordering on anger, among significant sections of the electorate since the initial announcement that political parties would be funded by taxpayers' money.  As someone who lived outside this country during my late teens and early twenties and who had the privilege of travelling extensively as a Member of this House and through my other profession, I would be naive not to concede that there is an urgent need to address the funding of political parties and individuals and the manner in which elections are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the Government's best efforts, I am concerned that we are creating a bureaucratic giant which will get out of hand.  While it is easy <Col N="947" /> to be critical, the most difficult part of any debate is to put forward constructive alternatives.  While I and my party strongly favour the concept of openness, accountability and transparency, there is a ground swell of opinion outside this House which is vociferously opposed to the concept of political parties being funded by taxpayers' money.  I could be devil's advocate and argue against this proposal.  I have always believed there is a price to be paid for democracy.  However, those who are critical of the political system cannot have it both ways.  On the one hand, they will justifiably raise concerns about the covert manner in which donations are made by corporate Ireland to political parties without disclosure, yet, on the other hand, when an attempt is made to bring this out into the open, which involves a charge on the public purse, they cry foul.</P>
    <P>Irish society has undergone phenomenal change over the past decade.  Old certainties have been cast aside and the Church, a pillar of society for generations, finds itself on the defensive.  Traditions and faith and trust in individuals and institutions are crumbling on a daily basis.  The political system and those pursuing the noble art of politics are in the firing line.  This legislation cannot win in such an environment.</P>
    <P>Politicians must be proactive outside this House.  They must inform the people about the work done here and about the burden placed on elected representatives in discharging their duties in return for poor pay and conditions relative to the corporate sector generally.  As Leader of Fianna Fáil since 1994, Deputy Bertie Ahern has adopted a hands-on approach to these issues.  He will not accept the public perception that politics is a questionable profession or that the party he leads, of which I am proud to be a member, must be questioned.  Political leaders should take it upon themselves, especially coming up to the general election, to press home the message that politics, serving the public and putting the interests of the community above personal interests is a noble art.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there will come a time when the electorate will accept that the price of democracy is the funding of political parties from the public purse.  Who better to guard against any future criticisms or failure by the establishment to account for public moneys than the people?  What influence, if any, does a voter have when a large corporation decides to make a substantial contribution to a political party, indulges in creative accounting in its annual report to hide that fact and, when the dirt eventually hits the fan, is discovered to have been giving large regular donations to political parties?  Even if that company and the recipient of the donation publicly state there is no undue influence being brought to bear as a result of that donation, a cynical public can be heard laughing all the way to the polling station.</P>
    <P>We, as legislators, should introduce regulations on political donations and the funding of political <Col N="948" /> parties and elections.  Implementing such regulations, however, is the nub of this debate.  The Government is putting forward these proposals, of which the public is not in favour.  Perhaps it will be in five years' time.  Government speakers will say we must be brave and take the initiative. However, if we do not have consensus in a democratic society, the law will not be implemented because it will be seen as an ass and people will laugh at it.  We have enough problems without increasing the cynicism which already exists about the political process by implementing some of the measures in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, our spokesperson on the environment, Deputy Dempsey, welcomed the broad thrust of the Bill.  We are opposed to the specific proposals on funding from the public purse.  We are strongly in favour of disclosure because there must be openness, accountability and transparency in any dealings between those who give money to a political party and politicians or the political system will descend further into the abyss of indifference and cynicism.  There is no greater threat to democracy.  There is an old saying: &ldquo;When good men do nothing, democracy and justice suffer&rdquo;.  Perhaps there was no gender balance at the time and it should say good men and women.</P>
    <P>Having set out my stall in relation to the Fianna Fáil Party's approach to the Bill, I want to address the specific issue of constituency revisions.  I welcome the establishment of an independent constituency commission.  The Minister and those who have contributed to this section are absolutely correct in their thinking on this. My family, specifically my late father, suffered grievously from the gerrymandering of County Leitrim during the 1960s.  There was a great deal of discussion in the other House about maintaining county boundaries.  It was also said that the tradition and history of individual counties should not be breached in any way.  Yet a political decision was taken by a previous Administration in the 1960s which breached the county boundary of Leitrim not once, not twice but three times. We ended up with a portion of Leitrim in Sligo/Leitrim, a portion in Roscommon/Leitrim and a portion in Donegal/Leitrim.  I am glad an independent constituency commission is to be established.  This confirms the development of a trend which occurred as a result of outrageous decisions such as the one I have outlined.  I have no doubt that had County Leitrim's territorial integrity been maintained, my father would not only have had the honour of serving in this House, which he did with distinction, but would certainly have had a better than average chance of serving in the other House.  I am sure there are many similar stories to be told in political families around the country as a result of political decisions which were taken behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms where lines were drawn on maps to allegedly maintain or pursue party political advantage.  We also know this works conversely, as has happened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> I ask the Minister, in his reply, to give some insight into what his thinking and that of the Government is about a more radical change in the political process in this country specifically in regard to changes in the three, four and five seat constituencies.  What is the Government's view on the proposal, floated by Deputy Dempsey on a non-partisan, cross-party basis over the last 12 months, to consider having single seat constituencies with a single transferable vote, or to have a continuation of multi-seat constituencies with a modified list system?  The demands placed on politicians and the political system as we enter the new millennium cannot be adequately catered for by an electoral system which was created for the last century.  There is a definite need for a debate in this area.  It seems to me that politicians are shying away from such a debate.  Whenever there is any public discussion on this issue, we are inevitably referred to de Valera's two failed attempts in the 1960s to change the electoral system. Fortune favours the brave, that was 30 or more years ago and time has moved on.</P>
    <P>The demands placed on politicians and on modern government are such that it is unacceptable that Government Ministers, with the myriad demands placed on their time not only within the legislative framework of Ireland but because of our continuing and increasing responsibilities as members of the EU, must leave Government business or important meetings in Brussels to fly half way across Europe to attend a meeting in their constituencies.  They must do this because the other three or four political representatives are at the meeting and woe betide them, come the next election, if they, too, are not present.  That is farcical and unacceptable and it is past time it was dead and buried.  This has nothing to do with participative democracy or representation, it is to do with practicality.  If less demands of this nature were placed on a Minister or Minister of State we would have a better and more efficient political establishment, better government and better laws as Ministers and Oireachtas Members would be able to devote more time to the legislative process.  I hasten to add that this is not a criticism of peoples' right to challenge their elected representatives on any issue.  This has nothing to do with depriving people of access to their representatives or with keeping a Minister away from his or her constituency. Such changes would have very practical effects for good government.  I would be interested to know the Minister's thinking in regard to the need to put a surgical knife to the electoral system in this country.</P>
    <P>On the issue of public funding of political parties, it is interesting to note that the proposals are that payments are to be made to those parties registered in the Register of Political Parties, organised throughout the State to contest Dáil elections whose candidates obtain not less than 2 per cent of the first preference votes in an election. We are all aware that one of the parties currently in Government is hovering in or around <Col N="950" /> that figure.  I wonder had that party not been in Government would the figure still be 2 per cent. This goes back to the earlier point I made about the need for a radical shake-up of the electoral process.  Many of our European partners operate a political system where unless a party receives 5 per cent of the national vote, it cannot sit in the national parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that we be equally radical but such a system operates in many European democracies.  I am curious to know how the 2 per cent figure was arrived at.  Is anything less than 2 per cent democratic?  One could go down this road and come up with the purest form of democracy, as obtains in Israel, and we all know the kind of Government that exists there.  I would like to see a debate on the percentage of national vote needed for participation in the national parliament in the overall context of electoral reform.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that for a considerable time there has been a campaign, initiated by a voter in County Mayo, seeking to have photographs placed on ballot papers.  I understand that there is a real possibility this will happen for the European elections.  Does the Government intend introducing this measure for all elections or is this merely a pilot scheme?</P>

      <P>I wanted to make a final point about people who are on holiday abroad at the time of an election. Are there any provisions made for people who will be outside the country on holiday or business on election day?

      <Col N="951" /> The issue of emigrant voting has been put on the back burner.  It is a hot potato which I hope we can return to.  Those living outside the country for economic reasons should not be disenfranchised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and am delighted with the Dáil amendments, amounting to over 230, discussed yesterday over the course of 18 hours and the fact that we have a memorandum on the Bill as amended in the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  I compliment the Minister on his presentation.  It is a solid Bill and I am delighted that at long last politicians are prepared to discuss legislation concerning themselves.  We are always discussing issues relevant to the proper running of the country and a Bill discussing our own position is long overdue.</P>
      <P>I am annoyed that despite all the amendments and discussion of them, one political party does not agree with the provision for Exchequer contributions to political parties.  I am unaware of any objections among the public to political parties receiving contributions from the public purse. There may be concerns but there is no general objection.  I disagree with the idea that there should be more openness about private contributions to political parties rather than contributions from the Exchequer.  I am in public life for a long time and if we are to achieve balance and have a better society we must allow people to pay for what they think is best.  Every section of this Bill is outlining a course for the future.</P>
      <P>We should be clear that the provisions of this Bill will not concern the coming election and will only come into operation on 1 January 1998.  If there is a change in Government I would like Fianna Fáil, which agrees with the general thrust of the Bill but not the provision for contributions from the public purse, to readily admit that any donation given by a company over £4,000 must be disclosed.  This provision is long overdue as is the provision under which an individual can make a maximum donation of £500.  In the context of what has been said about politicians in general over the last few months, it is better for me to say to people on the door step that they are sharing the expense of political parties.  This will make them more concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed commission is not simply concerned with money.  Tip O'Neill, a great Irish-American politician, was correct when he said that all politics is local.  Senator Mooney referred to 2 per cent as the level below which parties or persons should not receive money and the question of representation at national level in such cases was raised.  Will anybody say to the public that a party which gets six or seven seats cannot sit in the Parliament or that a person who receives up to 7,000 votes is not entitled to a seat? I do not think this would be a constructive <Col N="952" /> approach to democracy.  There is a party with perhaps 3 per cent or 4 per cent of the vote which has six seats in the Dáil.  Are they not entitled to representation?  Senator Mooney made the point that those receiving less than 2 per cent should not be considered.  That can be decided by the commission which will be established by a judge of the Supreme Court or High Court nominated by the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>Changing responsibility for constituency revision is also overdue.  A motion was put before the public in Ireland regarding single seat constituencies not based on a PR system.  One can only imagine how that would have worked for a particular party.  Senator Farrell is well aware of the huge rejection of that idea.  This underlines how astute the public is, something we should not forget.  Irish voters are among the most astute in the world, something that has been proven over the years in general elections.</P>
    <P>I am glad the provisions of the Bill are not coming into effect before the forthcoming election. It is very important that we make time to explain to the public what is involved in the Bill. Contributions to a political party in excess of £4,000 will have to be disclosed.  This is a long overdue provision with which I agree.  I am a Member for 14 years and this is the first time legislation concerning ourselves has been debated, with over 230 amendments put down to the Bill by late yesterday evening.  We should not be afraid to support this Bill because openness characterises what is being provided for.</P>
    <P>The current tribunal and the beef tribunal were the result of a lack of openness.  We should not say to the general public that on the one hand we do not want money from them but that we still think we can do our job.  I would prefer to say to them that it will cost £1 million per year, a total of 37p each.  This is very cheap in comparison to the amount of money spent on the beef tribunal and on the current tribunal where the issue of certain people coming before it is another question.</P>
    <P>In the absence of this Bill the need could arise for another tribunal in 12 months time.  I do not want that to happen and would prefer to explain in detail to the public why contributions from the Exchequer should be provided for.  In particular I ask that every section of the Bill be examined properly in order to explain to the public what it entails, because it is constructive.</P>
    <P>We can argue about whether those receiving less than 2 per cent of the vote should receive money, but let the commission decide upon such things.  Much debate has obviously taken place, a fact evidenced by the 230 amendments.  Under the British electoral system, 60,000 people may cast their ballot, but the candidate who receives 20,000 votes will represent that constituency in Parliament.  That is not a proper democratic system and one would not get away with it here.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney made a very constructive point.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, is at the beck and call of everyone, yet he must attend <Col N="953" /> constructively to his ministerial work.  He has done exceptional work for children.</P>

      <P>We should not be afraid to consider a single seat constituency PR system under which the person the public thinks is best suited to serve them would come to the front.  That cannot happen under the British electoral system.</P>
      <P>A long time ago a particular party leader proposed a single seat, first past the post system here, so that the person with the most votes would get the seat, but that is not democracy.  In some areas of the European Union people with less than 5 per cent of the vote cannot have representation in parliament.  That is not fair.  Anyone who is elected at constituency level by the general public should have the right to take a seat in parliament.</P>
      <P>We must take funding out of the hands of politicians and we should set up a commission under a High Court or Supreme Court judge to consider this.  The commission should be in a position to consider the matter and produce a review, having invited and considered submissions.  The commission would have the right to investigate any constituency and would have power to impose fines if audited reports to prove that no overspending has taken place are not produced by a constituency organisation, party or member.  That measure is long overdue.</P>
      <P>Some individual candidates are much better off than others because they receive more money. From a democratic point of view that is unfair to the other candidates.  In the forthcoming election some people will be better organised than others and in my constituency and others I drive through, there are posters on public roads.  One would question the cost involved and where the money came from.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the last European Parliament election.  I remember one candidate whose name was all over the Munster constituency for a full six months before the election.  I am nobody's fool as regards finance and there is enormous cost attached to such matters.  The candidate in question did exceptionally well and good luck to him. It is easy for me to say that because I am a politician and I am ruthless enough to know what politics is about, but the public is not.  The commission will protect the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most constructive Bill I have seen for a long time.  The legislation deals with politicians who, in turn, are prepared to talk about each other.  That is openness at long last.  We should not be afraid to tell the general public in a subtle and constructive way exactly what this Bill is doing.  I am delighted that it will not take effect until January 1998.  The impression has already been given by particular sections of the media that the Bill is being railroaded through the House, but that is wrong.  The amendment provides that, from January 1998, we can go to work on it.  If there is a change of Government I <Col N="954" /> hope there will not be major changes in the structure of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Having listened to Senator Mooney speaking on behalf of his party, it is clear it has concerns about funding coming from the public purse.  I disagree with that.  It is much better to be able to say to the public that we are taking funds from the public purse because then no one can think that companies, groups or individuals who make contributions to a party will be favoured over somebody else.  That should not be the case.  I cannot condone it because for far too long, as the Minister of State said in his speech, that general impression was created.  In other words, there was a doubt and one can imagine what a judge would say.  Is it rumour, doubt or an impression?  If even one ounce of an impression was given that a person or company was doing better than others because of contributions, it must be eliminated otherwise we cannot face up to the future.</P>
    <P>We cannot claim to be entitled to contributions while trying to emphasise our openness to young people.  I am involved in local government and in the Seanad.  I have been Lord Mayor of Cork and have been involved with many people in business, but I have not seen anything that I would question regarding contributions.  I do not want to see, hear or know about it, and if I do know about it somebody else will hear about it.  As a public representative it is my job to do that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is constructive and long overdue.  We should not railroad anything through the House.  The Bill is vital.  It does not just deal with money but with constituency reviews and disputes.  It is prepared to investigate individuals or parties if matters are wrong in a constituency or constituencies.</P>
    <P>A strong emphasis should be put on the Department to let the public know, through the media, what this Bill really means as it is much needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly welcome the Bill.  The days of church gate collections are coming to an end.  It was grand in years gone by because only political parties conducted church gate collections. In most rural areas there were only two main parties.  Fianna Fáil collected on one Sunday and Fine Gael collected on another Sunday.  Now, however, people are becoming very annoyed because somebody is collecting outside every chapel gate every Sunday.  Church gate collections have become a full time job with so many voluntary organisations looking for money.  The general public is getting tired of having to contribute every Sunday and the result is that collections are getting smaller.  Eventually they will kill off such collections.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with administrative costs of 37p per person but I believe we can add another 63p because the cost of every State scheme seems to be astronomical.  I do not know why these schemes cost so much but that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk of commissions.  We set up a commission to assess the salaries of <Col N="955" /> Deputies and Senators but politicians did not have the courage to implement its findings and put them on the back burner.  In that instance, money was spent on administration which was of no benefit to Deputies or Senators.  However, the perception in the media was that politicians would receive huge increases.  These were phantom increases because we never received them. The commission talked about increases but there is a great difference between talking about and receiving an increase.  If one appoints a commission and it produces a report, one should implement it.  If it does not suit, there is an <i>á la carte</i> approach which cuts out the unpalatable bits and implements the rest.  That is not the purpose of a commission.  We should either accept or reject all the proposals.</P>
    <P>Commissions need good guidelines.  Before the last local elections the boundary commission divided the counties into electoral areas, although the local authorities were given an opportunity to make representations to it.  The views of Sligo County Council, for instance, were accepted by all the political parties but the commission put the Strand Hill area north of Sligo town in with the Ballymoate area, which is 20 miles south of the town.  Therefore, a voter living in Sligo would have to go to Ballymoate to cast his or her vote. It was the most stupid division of a town and it suited nobody.</P>
    <P>Commissions often decide there will be one seat for a particular number of voters so they draw a line on the map.  Then it decides that the area does not include enough voters so it incorporates a portion from elsewhere to make up the numbers, regardless of the inconvenience to voters. According to Deputy Nealon, the last boundary commission even brought the constituency of Longford-Roscommon west and south of the River Shannon, which was stupid.  The River Shannon has always been a dividing line between constituencies but that was not even taken into consideration.  The commission broke all the previous boundaries.  If a commission is set up for a purpose, it should do it systematically with the least inconvenience to people.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the system of voting for travellers and people going on holidays, but we are shying away from a proper identity system.  Is it possible to identify people who live in big towns and cities?  I was monitoring the elections in Mozambique and every voter had a plastic card with a photograph and the person's particulars.  Why are we all so afraid of identity cards?  Everybody should have a proper identity card.  Driving licences include a photograph and that is as it should be.  Why not have an identity card for all services so we would know the exact identity of a voter because it is impossible for a presiding officer to be 100 per cent sure of the identity of a voter in any large populated areas?  If one questions a voter and there is a problem, one is the worst in the world.  People should have proper identification.  If a person goes into a Garda <Col N="956" /> station, he or she has a driver's licence but how would a garda know the identity of a passenger. If everybody had a proper identity card, every student and holidaymaker would have an opportunity to vote.</P>
    <P>There is a perception abroad that part of the Bill is being put into effect now and the remainder next year but we should put all or none of the Bill into effect now because we have ended up with the worse of the worlds.</P>
    <P>I do not believe anybody who gave money to political parties did so for personal gain because a business person cannot do anything, due to all the present rules and regulations, without receiving planning permission and having his or her tax affairs in order.  It is impossible to conduct underhand activities.  This is a perception which is fed by the media and cynics, but when one asks them to put up or shut up, they cannot produce one whit of evidence to show anything underhand occurred.</P>
    <P>I have been in the political arena for 30 years and in this House for 11 years.  A politician goes before the electorate every three or four years and if a person is elected, he or she must be doing something right.  Do any of the people who criticises us leave their jobs and undergo a fresh interview every four or five years?  It is easy to castigate, but this is a good democracy.  Any Deputy or Senator who is not doing his or her job properly and honestly will not be re-elected.  That is a fact.  There is that safeguard.  The people in the media and elsewhere who are casting aspersions on elected representatives should ask themselves whether they could pass the same test.</P>
    <P>We, as politicians, must do something about this perception.  I was delighted Deputy McCreevy and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, did something about it on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; the other night. It is time this matter was sorted out.  It is time journalists who indulge in snide innuendo were told to either put up or shut up.</P>
    <P>I blame much of the problem of perception on education.  How many schools teach civics, a subject which deals with democracy and the running of the country?  How many children know anything about it?  Why is it not part of the curriculum? Students graduate from university but they do not seem to know much about the working of the political system.</P>
    <P>Politicians have a part to play in changing this perception.  Unfortunately, they are not completely without blame because they do not seem to be able to debate the principles of an issue. They seem to enjoy attacking and making accusations against each other.  While this mentality remains in the political system, people will be blamed for acting in that way.  It must be remembered that we sowed the seed of that dissension. We cannot argue on principle, instead we attack personalities within the various parties.  Party political life should be above that.  We should argue on the Bills and other business before the House, not on personalities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> The Bill limits the amount of money candidates can spend on their campaigns, which is a good development.  I am not very well off and I live in the west.  I recall that in the past a number of millionaires representing all parties travelled around the country in an attempt to gain election to this House.  These individuals had access to the best PR, advertising, etc., but they did not gain election.  However, people such as myself and others who received an allowance for travelling expenses managed to do so.  This shows that the public judges people for what they are, not what they have, and it is a clear indication of the calibre of people involved in public life.  The greatest tribute that can be paid to the electorate is that they make their judgments on the calibre of candidates and not on the amount of wealth they possess.</P>
    <P>By and large, the Bill is a good measure.  I hope it will solve the problems it sets out to address. However, I do not believe any legislation will satisfy the sceptics and cynics who want to criticise the political system.  Such individuals will always find something about which to complain.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that candidates must declare donations of above £500 received from a single donor.  However, two members of a company could each donate £250 or £400.  It is impossible to make such provisions watertight.  The best container will lose from evaporation what it does not lose from leaks.  It is a pity the Government did not introduce this provision for the forthcoming election because, while the Bill will be enacted, we will not be allowed to receive donations.  We should not be obliged to wait until 1998 for the Bill to be implemented in its entirety. If it had been brought into force before the election, everyone would have received a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>With regard to the percentage of candidates who will be permitted to receive donations, the trouble is that in many cases democracy means the majority.  However, the current Administration is proof that minority groups can occupy a strong bargaining position.  To use an old cliché, this is a case of the tail wagging the dog.  I do not know how we can come to grips with this problem or how the correct threshold can be put in place. A great deal of consideration must be given to this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general thrust of the Bill which, by and large, will help to allay people's fears.  I do not believe that people who made donations in the past did so with the intention of gaining anything from the political system because the regulations governing business life are such that it is impossible to flout the law.  I do not believe that major business concerns gained anything from donations made to political parties. This matter has been taken out of all proportion and attempts have been made to turn it into a political football.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it will be successful. However, I would like a ceiling or cap to be placed on administration costs because I believe <Col N="958" /> politicians will get the crumbs while administrators receive the big bucks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but its introduction has come too late.  I believe that its various provisions should have been in operation for the forthcoming election.  However, there is no point in dwelling on that because we must look to the future.  I understand that Part 1V will come into operation this year while all other Parts will take effect from 1 January 1998.</P>
      <P>The first issue with which the Bill deals is the proposed constituency commission.  Discussion on the division of constituencies is always heated. The word &ldquo;hinterland&rdquo;, which is absent from the text of the Bill, should be included in the commission's terms of reference.  Lines are often drawn on maps of district electoral divisions and townlands which are completely unrelated to the hinterlands of villages and towns.  The constituency commission should take into consideration towns and villages and the lands which surround them; it should not divide hinterlands to fit in with arithmetic patterns.  In my constituency the villages of Inniskean and Ballineen are joined together due to expansion, but they were previously in different constituencies.  That is not fair because the villages in question cannot work together cohesively.  The commission should take such considerations into account.  I am also concerned about the division of county electoral areas.  I do not believe it is correct to remove districts from areas in which the people traditionally cast their votes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions relating to funding of political parties and payments to candidates.  The public will be able to clearly see how much money political parties receive for running their affairs.  The allocation of funding will be based on the number of first preference votes gained by each party, which is fair and representative.  If £1 million is allocated and a party gains 50 per cent of first preference votes, it will receive 50 per cent of the funding.  That is a good way to resolve the situation.  It must be clearly stated that payments to candidates means reimbursement of their expenses.  Candidates living in far flung constituencies such as the one I represent incur major expenses in respect of travel, etc., during election campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important issue concerning the funding of political parties and the reimbursement of candidates' expenses relates to accountability and information about the amount of money paid.  A cloud of suspicion hangs over every politician because it is believed they are involved in underhanded dealings.  There is no doubt that people believe that if they give money they will receive something in return later.  It is essential that a document should be placed in the public domain whereby people can see the origin of donations and the way they were spent.  This will end the awful suspicion that the more one gives, the more one will receive in return.  Some parties encouraged that practice and it is not right that all politicians <Col N="959" /> should be placed under suspicion as a result.  I am glad that donations of £4,000 to parties and £500 to candidates must be disclosed. That is not out of line.  I hope people do not fix the figures like Dunnes Stores fix prices &mdash; £499.99 instead of £500.</P>
    <P>I am also glad limits have been set on the amount which can be spent in constituencies &mdash; £14,000 for a three seat constituency, £17,000 for a four seater and £20,000 for a five seater.  If the maxima were higher, there might be huge advertising displays which would be demoralising for smaller parties and Independents.  Their efforts would be dwarfed and it would be ridiculous. Such big displays can be counter-productive, however, as voters may think the candidate is trying to bulldoze his way in.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the voting provisions will not be in place for the forthcoming election.  My constituency has a 120 mile long coastline with many ports.  Fishermen have to earn a living from the sea and may be away on election day.  We should also consider people who travel around the country and abroad on business, people who have to travel suddenly and students.  These groups should have the right to vote but we deprive them of it if they cannot have a postal vote.</P>
    <P>I welcome the supplementary voting register.  It has been in effect for a number of years and is helpful.  The local person compiling the register may not be aware that some people have reached the age of 18 &mdash; most of the compilers do a good job but some voters can slip through the net. Also, a student may have been away for a couple of years and move back home without the compiler knowing.  Consequently, the supplementary voting register is useful.  I am glad the Bill provides for a supplementary voting register for people with a postal vote and for those on the special voting list.  Sometimes people are called away on business at short notice so the supplementary register is most important.</P>
    <P>Due to physical or mental handicap many people cannot go to a polling station on election day.  If they are on the special voting list, an official accompanied by a Garda will call to their home and be told how they want to vote.  What about a person who takes ill after the compilation of the register?  He or she is unable to go out to vote and cannot avail of the special voting facility. I welcome the changes but I am sorry they cannot be implemented before the election.</P>
    <P>Advertising the register is crucial.  No matter how often they are told, people will forget to check the register, especially those about to join it and those who have moved house.  Those who move think they can register a month before the election &mdash; if they are registered somewhere else they cannot, but if they are not registered elsewhere they can use the supplementary voting register.  I welcome the principles of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and this timely Bill, which has been sought by the public. <Col N="960" /> We intend putting down a number of amendments. Legislation which is passed in a rush is not satisfactory to everyone, but this Bill is welcome. The public wants accountability and this will provide it.</P>
      <P>When canvassing in recent by-elections, I found that many people resented parties receiving money from the public purse &mdash; they wanted to know why they should have to contribute £1 per vote, which was the figure mentioned at the time.  However, we must realise that political parties are not run on hearsay.  Years ago many people gave their time and effort without remuneration to keep political parties going.  The parties grew and became more sophisticated over time, so they had to hire secretaries and assistants.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has set limits on the amount a party can spend in a three seat, four seat or five seat constituency, but how will he control it?  In the United States, for example, companies contribute millions of pounds to political parties for election campaigns.  I am glad this country will not turn into a banana republic where we are all up for auction to the biggest company.  At least we will have accountability.</P>
      <P>I have some questions for the Minister.  If a candidate or a party breaches the expenditure limit the matter could be referred to the DPP with the possibility of a prosecution.  The political game is winner takes all for whoever triumphs in the ballot box.  If a person exceeds the limits with a big poster and press campaign but gets elected and another candidate stays within the limits and is beaten, will the DPP be empowered to remove the winning candidate from the Oireachtas and allow the person who played by the rules take the seat?  I am concerned about this provision.</P>
      <P>I am glad politics and elections are to be made accountable and transparent.  Many people think politicians are wealthy and make a lot of money. I was proud to stand for my party in three general elections, but it broke me.  I jeopardised my business, neglected my family and did everything I should not have done.  Every penny came from my pocket.  I do not know what I would have done if I had to pay and buy meals and petrol for my canvassers.  As Senator Calnan said, we must consider the rural constituencies where people have to cover large areas.  If a person puts a car at a candidate's disposal and pays for the petrol, or if a candidate and his supporters are given a meal, is that taken into account in election expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people think that when companies contribute to political parties, fringe benefits and backhanders are given on a &ldquo;nod and a wink&rdquo; basis.  I was involved in numerous section 4 applications in Kerry &mdash; they were the norm at one point &mdash; but the person who benefited would hardly thank me.  I supported many such applications because there were certain restrictions under the county development plan.  If a person needed a few feet extra to build his or her house, I lobbied on their behalf because I believed it was <Col N="961" /> right to do so.  Many people thought that those involved in section 4 applications received backhanders. The people I dealt with hardly thanked me.</P>
    <P>People call to my home and tell me that I have a fine house and car.  They forget that one has a mortgage on the house, a loan for the car and is barely able to keep going.  One tries to keep the credit union at bay and the bank manager happy. They have a perception that politicians make money hand over fist and it is good that this Bill brings these issues out in the open.</P>
    <P>Traditional sources for funding are archaic.  It is difficult to collect money, particularly outside a church gate.  We have to run hops or whist drives, etc. to try to raise funds for a campaign.  A political party cannot survive without finance.  It must have manpower, offices and back up services and it must be efficient.  The public expect it and members of the organisation demand such facilities.</P>
    <P>I am glad limits will be introduced as this will benefit smaller parties.  They cannot be exceeded and one party cannot dominate.  Every candidate will be on an equal footing and will come before the electorate on an equal basis.  Money will not deter them from running and if they obtain more than 25 per cent of the quota, they will have £5,000 returned to them.  However, it is small money for any candidate today.  A person is joking if he or she thinks a campaign can be run for £5,000.  Friends, supporters, neighbours and family take time off work to help relatives during election campaigns.  If a person wishes to give up their time to canvass for a candidate, will that be taken into account in the overall expenditure?</P>
    <P>Some sections will not be enacted until 1 January 1998 and that is unfortunate.  The sooner they are introduced the better.  It is correct that donations to political parties exceeding £4,000 be registered.  I cannot see why any person should be ashamed to say he or she is making a donation to a political party or candidate.  I know many people who support two or three candidates from different parties and give a donation to each of them.  I am sceptical about the notion of revealing donations over £500 to candidates.  Senator Calnan was correct when he referred to the cut price rate of £499.99.  I have yet to meet anyone who will give me a donation for a campaign.  I am not as fortunate as others.  Perhaps I will have to do some back scratching.  It is good that where a private donation is given to a candidate, he or she can furnish receipts and be accountable.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that each candidate must have an agent to submit his or her accounts.  Will the agent be an accountant, an ordinary person or a family member?  How does the Minister intend to break down the accounts?  For example, are petrol, food, etc., to be listed?  Does the expenditure limit for each candidate apply to newspaper advertisements and publicity or to the nitty gritty of the campaign where, for example, petrol must be supplied for two or three cars in a rural area?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> Donations over £4,000 to political parties must be revealed.  This could result in a similar situation to that involving donations to candidates. For example, donations of £3,500 may not be revealed.  How often can such donations be made?  Are they only to be given when there is an election or can a person make donations of £2,500 or £3,000 to a party three or four times per year?  Is there a limit on the overall figure involved at the end of the election period?  That will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that a donation will include the value of property, goods and services provided free of charge or at reduced cost. Donations to branches, candidates, officers and members of a party will be deemed to be made to the party and, for the purpose of disclosure by the party, will be aggregated.  This is vague.  Will the Minister elaborate on that aspect?  The Director of Public Prosecutions may be brought in if an individual breaks the guidelines.  It will be the function of the DPP to prosecute or authorise prosecution for alleged offences.  Offences under the Bill include failure to furnish a donation statement or a statement of election expenditure, furnishing false or misleading statements or incurring election expenses above the permitted limit.</P>
    <P>A person could defeat another candidate by a few votes by exceeding the limits.  The defeated candidate could be an upright and honourable citizen.  The results in many constituencies are tight.  I was a candidate in the 1987 election and four votes separated the final two candidates, one of whom was the Tánaiste.  If candidates thought that they were that close to a seat, they could spend an extra few thousand pounds to get votes and defeat the opponents.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on this?  I was within 40 or 50 votes of winning a seat in one election and I often wondered if I had carried out a bigger newspaper campaign or gained more publicity would it have made a difference?</P>
    <P>I now to turn to the Seanad election.  The Minister of State said he wished to hear the views of Senators.</P>

      <P>This legislation does not go far enough.  It is good that the payments to politicians provision is being introduced immediately.  The provision where each candidate must get 25 per cent of the vote to retain his or her deposit of £5,000 should also be introduced immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the political system is brought into the public arena, Senators and county councillors should be included.  All politicians seem to be tarred with the same brush.  If one politician is reported to have received a donation from an entrepreneur to help run his or her campaign, every candidate is labelled with the same tag.  The Seanad elections are different as one does not have a campaign team.  However, there is expense involved in printing literature and travelling around the <Col N="963" /> country.  One is away from home for around six weeks and one incurs accommodation expenses.</P>
    <P>County councillors should also be included in the provisions.  Many councillors have been reported as carrying paper bags containing donations.  I have never seen that type of bag in Kerry.  If a politician does the best favour in the world for a neighbour, he or she is lucky to get a pint in the local pub.</P>

      <P>The system of disclosure and openness should include county councillors.  By 1999 a range of organisations, such as those associated with the Leader programme, will come under the aegis of local authorities and they will have more autonomy with regard to their finances.  County councillors and Senators should be covered by the provisions of the Bill to promote transparency and openness.  The accountability provisions allow people to examine the system.</P>
      <P>It is good that any drift in the system toward the American model has been stopped under which many good candidates cannot afford to run for election.  Under the system proposed in the Bill it remains open to anybody to run for election. I welcome the Bill.  We will propose some amendments on Committee Stage which we hope the Minister will take into account.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I share Senator Kiely's wish to see its provisions extended.  I am glad postal voting facilities for voters who cannot vote at polling stations are being extended.  How will this work?  One does not know in advance if one will not be able to vote at a particular polling station unless the date of polling is known well in advance.  It may lead to people registering for a postal vote, yet being able to vote at their polling stations.  For example, with regard to students, if the election took place during the vacation they would be where they habitually live.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether they must use a postal vote once they have got it?</P>
      <P>I am glad voting is to be extended to include those who have reached the age of 18 during the currency of the electoral register.  We want to encourage young people to vote and it was not an encouragement if they missed out by a few weeks.  This happened to one of my sons and it was a cause of some ire.  I am also glad provision is being made for those who move house.  It was unfortunate for people who moved and lost their vote because they could not have the register changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill should have addressed the problems which arise when mistakes are discovered when a person goes to vote.  A friend of mine who is in her seventies went to vote at the polling station <Col N="964" /> at which she had voted for almost 40 years.  At the polling station the register indicated that she was only entitled to vote in local elections because she had been born in Great Britain. While she had taken holidays there from time to time, she was born in Bray, County Wicklow.  She got her passport and showed it to the returning officer but nothing could be done.  It is unfortunate for the voter when such mistakes are discovered on polling day.  The Bill should have addressed the matter.  When people are excluded on polling day due to an error on the register, even though they may have voted in the past, great dismay can be caused.  The Bill should have addressed the matter so that such genuine mistakes could be rectified.  I do not know how it transpired that it was suddenly decided that a 74 year old woman was born in Great Britain.  She has tried to ensure that all will be well at this election but without much response from Wicklow County Council.  It will be interesting to see what happens at the forthcoming election.</P>
    <P>With regard to the universities electoral registers, the Minister will have the power to decide whether the old or new register will be used.  The old register closed at the end of February but the new register does not come into effect until 1 June.  This means that in the case of Trinity about 2,000 voters &mdash; who I am sure are only too anxious to vote for me &mdash; will be disenfranchised. I am sure the figure is higher for the NUI list. Leniency, so to speak, has been given to people to be included on the general electoral register and I hope the Minister will direct that the new universities registers will be used if the Dáil is dissolved and there is an election before the end of June.</P>
    <P>With regard to the payments to political parties, I think it is far better that we know who makes payments to political parties and that the State should make some payment.  However, I am not sure how it will encourage the election of women and young people to the Oireachtas.  It would be better if the political parties followed the example of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, who ensured that a sufficient complement of women and young people were put forward for election in seats that could be won.  It is often the case that women and young people are run in constituencies as a sweeper, so to speak, for one or two middle aged male politicians.  It may be pie in the sky to think that the payments will make a difference in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister sought advice on the level of payments and the limits for candidates' spending in Seanad elections.  It is a good idea to have such limits because we do not wish to see extravagant spending.  President Clinton's re-election campaign spent about $80 million, although election to the Seanad is not as expensive.  If the political parties receive £1 million for election expenses in the Dáil elections that only works out at 37p per elector, which is not very much.  Let me give the example of my constituency, Dublin University, where there are three seats.  If we were funded on <Col N="965" /> the same basis as a three seat constituency, that is at £14,000 per seat, given that we have about 30,000 on the register that would allow us just over 40p per elector.  That is not very much.  Mercifully, I have not had to spend that much on a campaign.</P>
    <P>The amounts in the Bill do not appear to be index linked.  Rather they appear to be linked in some way to Civil Service pay.  On reflection, perhaps that is a better way to link them.  We must be careful to ensure that the limits are realistic. The NUI Senators have a constituency of about 80,000 electors and on the basis of the funding outlined above would only have about 15p per elector.  We have a free postal entitlement for one mailshot, but the costs mount up when one takes into account printing and other postal costs.</P>
    <P>When decisions are being made on the levels of funds for Seanad elections, I hope it will be remembered that the university Senators rely on a postal vote and that while 60 to 70 per cent of our electorate is in Ireland the remainder is located abroad.  They are the only element of the diaspora who get a chance to vote for Members of the Oireachtas.  I believe the Government has a commitment to address the issue of voting for those emigrants who wish to have a stake in the affairs of the Oireachtas.  It is important to facilitate that.</P>
    <P>In our deliberations on the suggested changes in the composition of the Seanad, naturally I was not much in favour of Dublin University or the National University of Ireland losing their representation. However, the vocational interests of the country need to be served as well as possible in the Seanad.  That was why I suggested that some of the seats being allocated to other groups could be given to the regional technical colleges, the University of Limerick, Dublin City University and the Dublin Institute of Technology, for which university status is proposed.</P>
    <P>Those of us who must rely on a postal vote are in a separate situation from those who rely on the votes of previous Oireachtas Members and county councillors.  I hope that will be taken into account when the Bill for the Seanad is brought forward.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my appreciation of this very useful and constructive debate.  Many issues were touched on, either by way of suggestion or to seek clarification.  I hope to deal with the main issues as fully and helpfully as I can.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney referred to a number of matters concerning public funding for political parties. As I said at the outset, the amount to be provided is modest in the overall context.  When one regards the implications of the limitation of election expenditure and donations disclosure, the amount being provided for is reasonable.  If there is criticism, we should argue the case for public funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> There will be public accountability for the use of the funds, where everybody will see for what the money was used.  The extra paperwork involved is necessary if full accountability is to be achieved.  The Bill provides that the Public Offices Commission will issue guidelines on the various matters in the Bill.  Every effort will be made to provide the guidelines in simple and understandable language.  The Senator said he was in favour of openness and accountability; the Bill's provisions will help in both these matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked if there are any plans to change the PR system.  There are no plans to change the present system, but the recommendations of the All-Party Commission on the Constitution in its final report may assist in the debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney also raised the issue of candidates' photographs on ballot papers in Dáil elections. The European Parliament Elections Act, 1977, enables candidates' photographs to be included on ballot papers for European elections on a trial basis.  I had the pleasure of introducing that Bill.  This issue has been the subject of discussions and representations by public representatives for a number of years and was supported earlier this year by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.</P>
    <P>Subject to resolving any technical problems, the intention is that candidates' photographs will be included on the ballot papers for the 1999 European elections.  The question of including photographs on other election ballot papers will be considered in the light of experiences at those elections.  The technical problems being examined at present are twofold.  One relates to ensuring the printing process can generate photographs of sufficient quality on ballot papers.  The other is the time factor.  Ballot papers must be printed immediately after the close of nominations to maximise the time available for postal voting. Returning officers would have to check photographs to ensure they matched the names on the ballot paper, in addition to the wide range of other duties they must perform in the run up to an election.  As Members know, our election campaigns usually last three weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney also raised the matter of votes for emigrants.  When this matter was considered in this House very recently, widely differing views were expressed on the proposals.  The Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, while endorsing the principle of Seanad representation for emigrants, proposed that the six university seats in the Seanad should be abolished and the number of emigrant seats increased to at least five.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say I agree with it.  Five emigrant groups expressed varying degrees of opposition to Seanad representation for emigrants, even as a first step towards full voting rights.  Thirty nine other organisations and individuals <Col N="967" /> commented on the proposals, eight of which were fully supportive while the remainder were either opposed to the proposals or indicated reluctant acceptance of them.</P>
      <P>A full review of the proposals was carried out in the consultation paper by the Minister, taking into account the views of all respondents.  In the light of that review the Government decided, given the divergence of views, not to proceed with the proposal for the election of three Members of Seanad Éireann by Irish emigrants. I cannot say at this stage what action will be taken on this matter in the future, but I have no doubt it will be a matter of ongoing discussion.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell referred to the drawing of constituency boundaries by the commission.  The terms of reference are set out in section 6.  While the commission has to have regard to geographical considerations, the constitutional provision concerning population per Deputy takes precedence over other considerations.  Previous commissions have outlined in other reports the reasoning behind their decisions.  It is a difficult task, particularly when the constitutional provisions must be implemented.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell also raised the question of identity documentation and the desirability of a uniform identity card.  While we have not reached that point yet &mdash; it might be somewhat down the road, in fact &mdash; I would like to put on record that for the past ten years provision has existed in electoral law under which an elector may be asked to produce any one of a list of documents set out on the polling card before being given a ballot paper.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell also referred to the possibility of a person making more than one donation over £500 to a public representative to avoid having to disclose the contributions.  All donations made by a person to the same political party or public representative in the same year will have to be aggregated. If all such donations exceed the disclosure threshold they will have to be disclosed.</P>
      <P>Senator Calnan expressed his disappointment that the new postal voting arrangement for fishermen and others will not apply in the forthcoming election.  The reason for that is the time factor. Local authorities need a minimum period to arrange for public notice to be given and to allow applications to be made and considered.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely the necessary period will be available before this election.  However, as I indicated in my opening statement, all the new provisions relating to postal voting are supplements to the register proper for special voters and postal voters and will apply at any other poll taken before 15 February 1998, including the Presidential Election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely asked if the election of a person who was found to have exceeded the spending limits could be called into question.  The Bill envisages that the election of a person in that position could be questioned.  However, section 44 makes it clear that an election shall not be <Col N="968" /> invalidated if it appears to a court hearing on an election petition that the non-compliance with the spending limits did not materially affect the result of the election.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely also asked whether expenses incurred by election workers, such as petrol for cars used in the canvass, would have to be included in the candidate's expense sheet.  Such items will not be regarded as election expenses of the candidate unless the person involved is doing the work on a professional basis and is being paid for the service.  The cost of voluntary work or the use of one's car is not included in the definition of election expenses.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to the proposed funding of candidates' election expenses and limits on election expenditure for Dáil elections.  The Bill includes Senators for the purposes of furnishing donation statements annually.  It does not provide for comparable expenditure or recoupment of election cost proposals in relation to Seanad elections. It is intended to have separate legislation drafted to cover such elections.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the question of postal voting for students.  If a person is on the postal voters' list, the elector cannot vote at a polling station.  In the case of mistakes or omission from the register, they can apply for entry on the supplement to the register.  In the case of anyone taken off the register for some reason, registration authorities will be instructed for the next register that they be written to before their names are removed from a register.  Therefore, the likelihood of somebody turning up at a polling station and finding their name is not included on the list of electors is unlikely to occur again.</P>

      <P>Despite the fact that the lady was 74 years of age, she was listed on the register as &ldquo;L&rdquo; which means she could only vote in local elections.  She was told she must have been born in Great Britain.  She knew this was not the case because she had always known she was born in Bray.  She then brought them her Irish passport indicating where she was born, but she was still not allowed vote because there are no facilities for that.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because I do not believe that the publication of the census figures is, of itself, sufficient to trigger the establishment of the commission. The intervention of some establishing agency is necessary and this function is assigned by the Bill to the Minister.  An order by the Minister is needed to start the formal process of establishing the commission, for example, requesting the Chief Justice to nominate a chairman, arrange accommodation, etc., and somebody must initiate action involving different personnel from different offices, etc.  This section gives the Minister no function other than the making of an order bringing the commission into operation after the publication of each census report.</P>
      <P>If the amendment was accepted, the Chief Justice would have to watch for the publication of the census report and take the initiative to nominate the chairperson of the commission.  I do not believe that the Chief Justice should be expected to do that.  I must emphasise that the Minister has no discretion under section 5 not to make an order establishing the commission.  I would imagine that if the Minister fails to make an order within a reasonable period, legal action could be taken to force him or her to fulfil this statutory duty.

      <P>The amendment proposes to include as a further term of reference the avoidance of breaches of provincial boundaries.  The <Col N="970" /> terms of reference proposed in the Bill have been tried and tested by past commissions.  Given the constitutional requirements and court rulings, there is little scope for changing them.  The proposal is to revise the terms of reference set out in the Bill.  However, the Constitution sets out the parameters to be taken into account by constituency commissions.  The main point is that each Deputy must represent broadly the same number of people.  This cannot be changed except by referendum.</P>
      <P>The High Court decision made in the 1960s was clear.  Since there is nothing in the Constitution about constituencies being based on counties, and the same applies to provinces and regions, there is no point adding a further reference which the commission would then be forced to ignore. Reports of the commissions to date illustrate that, where possible, they have noted the regional dimension in their deliberations.  It is not necessary or practicable to formally require the commission to consider this additional aspect to its work.  The terms of reference proposed in the Bill have worked well in the past and they are as far as one can go in giving directions to the commission. I ask the House to reject the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the previous commissions, sucessive Ministers for the Environment directed that, in so far as it was possible, county boundaries should not be breached.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that provincial boundaries are not breached.  Irrespective of whether we like it, the tradition has developed that the county unit is sacrosanct.  In a sporting context, provincial loyalties are also strong, particularly in terms of adjacent counties, for example, those in Connacht and Leinster and Munster and south Leinster.</P>
      <P>The amendment covers the possibility of breaching provincial boundaries.  For example, an area outside Clonmel, which is part of the south Tipperary constituency, is part of the Waterford constituency.  Two provinces are involved there.  I tabled the amendment in the spirit of maintaining provincial solidarity.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach suffers from this problem because there is an unnatural constituency alliance between Longford and Roscommon.  These two counties traditionally have little in common in terms of administration, but they are now cheek to jowl in a political constituency.  It is a strange hybrid political animal as the Leas-Chathaoirleach and others who live there will testify.  In political terms, it is a case of never the twain shall meet. Each county does its own thing not just because they are two separate counties but because they are part of two separate provinces.  I am surprised the Minister of State's officials did not understand the ethos and tradition behind it and that it will be cast aside without further thought.</P>

      <P>I assure the Senator that we are not in the business of casting aside any ethos related to county or provincial boundaries. However, the reference to county boundaries will protect such boundaries in so far as that is practicable and consequently provincial boundaries.  I understand the notion of the province does not occur frequently in law.  The reference to respecting county boundaries as far as practicable will also deal with the provincial aspect.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, we are governed by the Constitution and it does not refer to counties let alone provinces.  Inevitably, some constituencies will breach county and provincial boundaries in the context of the Constitution.  In my constituency I represent part of County Carlow.  I do not know whether that is greatly appreciated &mdash; I doubt it &mdash; but that is the position because the Constitution determines the approach.</P>

      <P>As I said on Second Stage, perhaps there is a need for a radical reform of the entire process as it relates to the formation of constituencies.  Perhaps we should cut to the chase and abolish multi-seat constituencies in favour of single seat constituencies and geographic entities, county or otherwise.  If boundaries will be breached anyway and my arguments about maintaining traditions and ethos are ignored, why not go the whole way and initiate more radical electoral reform?  However, I do not anticipate a reply from the Minister of State on this point because it does not pertain to the amendment.</P>

    <P>The argument was made in the other House that the commission should not be politicised under any circumstances and the Government of the day should not be seen to be involved in any way. This applies by extension to Secretaries of Departments despite their tradition of impartiality and independence.  If this matter involves perception, the person involved should be somebody outside the machinery of Government.  The Secretary of the Department of the Environment is a fine individual as are his colleagues in the Civil Service.  The amendment is not a reflection on him, but the entire public reaction to the Bill <Col N="972" /> is based as much on perception as reality regarding the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The amendment is an attempt to put at arm's length even the merest hint of suspicion that the Government of the day would be able to influence the Secretary of a Department.  The replacement of the Secretary of a Department by the Director General of the Central Statistics Office is a fair compromise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>The amendments propose to replace as a member of the commission the Secretary of the Department of the Environment with the Director General of the CSO.  I understand the main reason behind the amendment is the argument that somehow the Secretary of the Department or the officials involved in the franchise section might come under political pressure or influence in performing their functions relating to the commission.  I do not accept that logic.  If that were the case, replacing the Secretary of the Department with the Director General of the CSO would not mean that the same objection could not be made.  As the House is aware, the Director General and his or her staff work under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach. Therefore, the same argument would apply.</P>
      <P>The general perception of the Civil Service is that it is a professional body of men and women who would not be used in that way.  However, even if there were fears in that regard, an amendment was accepted on Committee Stage in the other House that the members of the commission will be independent in the performance of their functions.  That should allay any unfounded fears about the Secretary of the Department being a member of the commission.  I ask the Senator not to press the amendments.</P>

      <P>The reports of the commissions have been thorough in explaining the reasoning behind recommendations and outlining the alternative arrangements considered.  This approach has worked well and I see no evidence of public demand for a more formal consultation process along the lines proposed.  If the proposals were accepted, it would be difficult to reach finality on a matter.  If a Deputy or Senator is dissatisfied with the recommendations of the commission's report, he or she can make a case in the Dáil or Seanad and put forward amendments.  The Oireachtas decides whether to accept, reject or amend the commission's recommendations.  The commission's report is not binding on the Oireachtas.

I accept the Minister's point that the final report must be ratified by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, the Executive will propose what is to be done and the Dáil will dispose of it.  While there will be an opportunity to debate the report, there will be little opportunity to change it unless the next Minister is as amenable as this one.

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary to provide in the Bill that legislation must be introduced to revise constituencies.  There is already a constitutional requirement for Dáil constituencies. Article 16.2.4º of the Constitution provides that the Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in 12 years while Article 16.2.2º provides that the number of people represented by each Deputy at any time must, as far as practicable, be the same throughout the country.  I am <Col N="974" /> advised that the latter provision means that Dáil constituencies must be revised whenever a population census shows this to be necessary.  As regular constituency revision by the Oireachtas is a constitutional requirement, it is neither necessary nor desirable to repeat it in legislation.</P>
      <P>If, for some reason, the Minister did not bring forward legislation to give effect to a commission's recommendations, it would be open to any Member of the House to initiate a Private Members' Bill to provide for a revision of constituencies. The Oireachtas has responsibility for revising constituencies.  If the situation envisaged in this amendment were to materialise, any Member of the House could bypass the Minister and go directly to the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas would then be the final arbiter in the matter.  I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>We are talking about possible obfuscation or delay caused by the Executive. The shifts in population over the past ten years have been significant, particularly along the east coast and in north Wicklow in the Minister's constituency. Delays in setting up commissions have caused public controversy in the past.  People are confused about whether changes will be discussed and proposals implemented after the next general election or during a by-election.  This amendment would prevent such delays.  Section 9(4) states: &ldquo;As soon as may be after the receipt of a report&rdquo;. I accept that the amendment might tie a future Government to a specific date.  However, there is nothing wrong with that.  If the Opposition of the day decides to create a fuss about it, the Government can decide in its own time when to implement the proposals.  This amendment does not go against the overall thrust of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 13, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) (a)  As soon as may be after its establishment, a Commission shall prepare&mdash;</P>

    <P>(I)  the number of members or representatives, as the case may be;</P>
    <P>(II)  the population of the constituency;</P>
    <P>(III)  the population per member or representative, as the case may be, of the constituency; and</P>

    <P>(b)  The Commission shall furnish, on request, to any person a copy of the statements referred to in paragraph (a).  Members of the Oireachtas shall be furnished with those statements automatically&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that the commission should make available statistical data relating to the constituencies then in force showing the latest population figures based on the most recent census and the variation from the national average for the population of each constituency. All submissions received by the commission shall be open to public inspection at such time and place as may be specified by the commission. It must permit a copy of or extracts from such submissions to be taken on payment of a fee not exceeding the reasonable cost of photocopying. A public notice will be published inviting submissions; it will include a reference to the availability of statements received by the commission relating to the constitutional provisions and statistical data prepared by it.  It must also include an indication that the submissions received by the commission may be inspected.</P>
      <P>This amendment requires that the statements should be automatically sent to each Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commissions established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in the past invited submissions by letter addressed to each Member of both Houses.  I envisage that procedure will continue so it will form an automatic line of communication. A statutory requirement is not necessary to give effect to this.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that Members of both Houses are kept fully up to date by automatically furnishing them with the statements.  The amendment states it should be done on request.  The amount of documentation the Minister receives, and even that which humble <Col N="976" /> Senators receive, is overwhelming.  If one must initiate a request for this kind of information then, given that there are other pressing needs, it may pass one by.  One may read something in the newspaper and wonder why one did not receive information on it.  I agree that this legislation will concentrate the minds of Deputies and those aspiring to the Dáil so perhaps I am looking at it solely from a Seanad perspective.  It seems not to be a major imposition on the machinery of State to ensure that Members of both Houses automatically receive statements without having to look for them.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Mooney on this amendment.  Over the past five or six months both sides of the House have experienced difficulties in obtaining certain reports.  While reports differ to what is in question here, the principle is the same.  Members should receive this kind of information as a matter of course.  We have, on a number of occasions, requested copies of reports which appear for the first time in the newspapers but are not circulated to Members.  I know the Bill clearly states that information can be obtained on request but, if the Minister were sitting on this side of the House, she would probably agree that it is our right as Members to automatically be furnished with information.</P>

      <P>I fully accept what the Senators are saying.  Perhaps I did not make myself clear on this point.  The commission automatically writes to Senators and Deputies.  That procedure is already in place and it is also an invitation to Members to make submissions.  Members do not necessarily have to seek information, they will be contacted by the commission as they have relevant views on this issue.  It is the current practice for the commission to automatically issue Deputies and Senators with information in written form.  We do not think it necessary to provide for this as it would only maintain the <i>status quo.</i></P>

      <P>We have reflected on this proposal since Report Stage and I am still not convinced that this amendment is necessary.  The staff involved in providing a back-up service to the commission do just that and nothing more.  I understand that, in the case of previous commissions, the individual members of staff involved in this process dealt directly with members of the commission in relation to this work.  The commission members indicate what they require and members of staff act on those directions.  It is straining credibility to suggest that any staff involved would be open to manipulation by the Minister of the day to point a commission in any particular direction.  The House can rest assured that individual members of the commission would not be so easily hoodwinked even if such a situation were to occur.  It would require a rare combination of political deviousness on the part of the Minister, susceptibility to manipulation on the part of the individual members of staff and indifference to their function on the part of the commission members for the Domesday scenario &mdash; feared by Deputy Dempsey &mdash; to come about. One must accept that the staff are there to do a job and that this is a practical way of ensuring the commission can carry out its work.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in stating that my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, was particularly concerned about this and sought the deletion of subsection (1).  We must tread a very careful line here.  Far be it from me to impugn the integrity of any public servant.  However, it is natural for human nature to take its course.  If I might outline a particular scenario &mdash; the results of the census might indicate that a seat will be lost in a particular constituency and a Deputy will stand to lose his or her seat.  The Deputy may have previously been a Minister and may have had a very close working relationship with some of the staff referred to here.  It would be human nature for them to seek to influence the outcome or direction of the commission.  This would never be proven and nobody would be charged with political favouritism.</P>
      <P>As far as the public is concerned, it is the whiff of gunpowder surrounding many of the sections of the Bill which is worrying.  I wish I did not have to come into the House and defend public perception. I hate doing that as public perception is usually very far removed from reality.  However, we are in the eye of the storm, we are in the firing line and we are constantly being brought to account in every conceivable way.  That is an unpalatable fact of political life and that is the thinking behind this amendment.  I would like to debate the issue further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not smelled much gunpowder since taking up office in the Department <Col N="978" /> of the Environment.  We must accept that these are public servants who do a day's work and who, at the end of the day, will simply carry out the duties for the commission.  The commission is very clearly governed by the Bill under section 5 (2) which states that:</P>
      <P>A constituency Commission and its members shall be independent in the performance of their duties under this Act.</P>
      <P>There is a very clear duty placed on the commission to carry out its functions in an independent fashion.  We must accept that somebody must carry out the instructions of the commission; public servants obviously fulfil that role.  The fact that the Bill places a very clear obligation on the commission addresses any fears the public may have.  People generally accept that public servants are professional people who are not manipulated in the way to which the Senator refers, in spite of the fact that he is not impugning any reputation. The answer to the point made in regard to the issue of public perception is clearly laid down in section 5.</P>

On Second Stage I stated that I believed there is genuine public hostility to the concept of the activities of political parties being paid out of the public purse.  This is a view held by my colleagues and I.  If the truth were told, colleagues on the other side of the House would probably also testify to this in the light of their hands on dealing with the electorate since this concept was first floated.  It is because there is so much public hostility to this &mdash; I wish it were otherwise but there is a price to be paid for democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I referred to the fact that this section applied to political parties registered in accordance with section 25 of the 1992 legislation and which were qualified by virtue of obtaining not less than 2 per cent of the vote.  I raised the question of how the figure of 2 per cent was decided upon.  It is coincidental that the Minister belongs to a party which received 3 per cent of the national vote with opinion polls giving it between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of the vote.  If one takes into account the 3 per cent margin of error in opinion polls then that party will either get 6 per cent or 0 per cent of the vote in the next election.  Was the figure of 2 per cent arrived at because Democratic Left is in Government and it would ensure it qualified as a party under this section or was it for some other altruistic, noble and honourable reason?  Of course, the Minister's activities and that of her party are noble.</P>

      <P>Regarding the 2 per cent, Senator Mooney is arguing along the same lines as Deputy Dempsey, namely, what consideration constituency reviews should give to the single seat PR system.  It is possible to get 2 per cent of the vote and have a very high representation at national level.  The Oireachtas has created a situation where some parts of the country are gaining much more in terms of representation than others.  I fail to understand why people who get a certain percentage of the vote should not receive financial contributions from the taxpayer while being allowed become Members of the Oireachtas and Ministers.  There is no logic in this.  It would be entirely different if one was referring to Britain.  However, here it would be unfair not to give recognition to a party that had three or four members elected with between 12,000 and 14,000 votes each where the quota is between 7,500 and 8,000 votes.  I understand the theory of what Senator Mooney is saying but in practice the Bill is fair.  The Bill provides for an independent constituency commission, the first time such a commission will be established.  We <Col N="980" /> hope it is independent.  This Bill gives authority to the commission under sections 5, 11 and others.  I would understand what Senator Mooney is saying if the staff of the commission came from other Departments or could be influenced, but this is an independent commission.</P>

      <P>The Senator has made our case. Perhaps I am wrong but my understanding of the Bill is that in order to become a qualified party in accordance with this section it is necessary to obtain 2 per cent of the vote in an election.  What about new parties?  Small parties represented in the House have less than 2 per cent of the national vote but they still have elected Members. I am unsure of the percentages but the Green Party had a candidate elected on the last occasion with less than 2 per cent of the national vote.  I am unsure as to whether this is Senator Mooney's view, but this section restricts new parties because party strength is based on votes received in the previous election.  This means a party cannot qualify until it has participated in a general election and obtained more than 2 per cent of the vote.  Perhaps my interpretation is wrong, but this is how I read the section and I see Senator Mooney nodding in agreement.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify if what is at issue is 2 per cent of the national vote?  I am not referring to the Progressive Democrats Party or Democratic Left but small parties.  It would appear that no new party is qualified until it has obtained more than 2 per cent of the vote.</P>

      <P>It seems an interesting coincidence that one of the partners in Government has a national vote hovering around 3 per cent.  I am curious as to whether this is what influenced the figure of 2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Senator Fitzgerald said is correct.  I have a problem with the concept of registering political parties.  I am sure the Minister's officials will clarify this, but I understand the registering of political parties arose from the operation of subversive elements within the State, namely Sinn Féin, which was then engaged in financial collections. A raft of legislation was introduced in the 1950s when it became necessary, for example, to register in order to collect money.  For decades one could go out and collect for anything without a licence from the Garda Síochána.  Legislation was introduced primarily to stop the collection of money from the sale of Easter lilies.  Even though <Col N="981" /> I was in short trousers at the time I remember that it caused enormous controversy.  Around the same time we also introduced a register of political parties.  A raft of legislation was put in place to define what was a political party.</P>
    <P>To tell the truth, I am really a secret member of the Monster Raving Loony Party but, unlike in Britain, we cannot stand because we are not a nationally organised party.</P>

      <P>I am being facetious.  The UK has a colourful electorate.  There are those who would say we should not allow these nutters to take part in elections at all, but if democracy in its purest form is to operate why should we have a restriction on a percentage of the national vote if people want to involve themselves in participative democracy?</P>
      <P>It goes to an extreme in the UK in that they have the weirdest of people but it has not upset the political equilibrium there nor has it endangered the institutions of State.  It seems to be a particular eccentricity of the British tradition that they tolerate all these eccentrics.  We have banished them completely since we introduced a register of political parties.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, tells me that Dustin, for example, cannot legally stand for election.  There is a view that people will be tut-tutting under their breaths, saying it is terrible and that it brings democracy into disrepute.  However, the point Senator Fitzgerald made, which I was attempting to make in asking about this 2 per cent of the vote, is why should there be any percentage at all.  Why should people not be allowed to participate if they so wish?</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, there is an attempt in the Bill to introduce a sum of money for Independent candidates, which flies in the face of this section relating to the register of political parties.  If an individual wishes to stand once this Bill is passed, they will be given £5,000 for the privilege.  One point contradicts the other; the Minister of State cannot have it both ways.  Why have the 2 per cent at all?  This is why I raised the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the idea of a register partially because of what I have seen in Britain. It is necessary to recognise a party.  Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Mooney are asking why somebody should be restricted from becoming a party.  However, if people receive 2 per cent of the vote they are worthy of becoming a political party.  Whether the 2 per cent should be 3 per cent or another figure is a subject for another debate.  However, it seems they are not recognised <Col N="982" /> until they have earned that 2 per cent.  If one is confident enough to run for election and receives 2 per cent of the vote, one's deposit will be refunded.</P>
      <P>I support section 16 which is realistic and sensible if we are going to have a register of political parties.  Not too long ago a former Member of the Lower House, Mr. Sean Loftus, fulfilled an ambition to have his party's name appear on the ballot paper by changing his name to Christian Democrat Loftus.  Later still he added Dublin Bay and Rockall to his name.  There are ways around this.  I would much prefer to see the sense of section 16 coming through.  We are not talking about money at this stage but about the recognition of what a registered political party will be.  I support the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney has a terribly suspicious mind.  We need to be clear about what is being proposed in this Bill.  Anybody can stand for election.  Some people would say that anybody does stand for election, but the freedom is there for anybody to stand.  If one wants to be a registered party one must qualify.  There are many registered parties.  If one stands for election and attains the 2 per cent level one can then become a qualifying registered party.</P>
      <P>There is always a debate about where to draw the line but we must draw it somewhere.  During the lengthy debate on this Bill, I have certainly learned much more about Fianna Fáil and that party has learned more about how smaller parties operate.  I have no doubt that as we go on, if anything, there will be more smaller parties, not necessarily the Monster Raving Loony Party, but parties who seriously represent people in the Houses of the Oireachtas and who may not have the enormous base Fianna Fáil has.</P>
      <P>The Senator cited the example of the Green Party.  Had we decided to do this purely on the basis of the number of TDs it would have been unfair because the Green Party has a national vote but only one TD.  That does not reduce its status as a registered party if it achieves 2 per cent of the vote.  We have to set a fair threshold. We must also set a practical threshold so that registered political parties that are growing, although they may not necessarily grow very big, will be entitled to qualify in proportion to their vote once they have achieved base level.</P>
      <P>A major party is in a different league to a smaller party but they are all in the same game. It is important to acknowledge that this is a specific mechanism.  Other countries use different formulae but it is essentially the same business of setting a line and saying that this is a qualifying registered party because of what it has achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.&mdash;The Electoral Act, 1992, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3) of section 25:</P>
      <P>`(3)  Subject to the provisions of this section, the Registrar shall register every political party which applies in accordance with this section for registration provided that at the time the application is made&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the organisation and direction of the party are governed by a constitution, articles of association, rules or other regulations which have been adopted by the party and which provide for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  annual or other periodic meetings or conferences of the party; and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the conduct of the business of the party by an executive committee or similar body elected by the party; and</P>
      <P>(b)  (i)  the membership of the party as certified to the Registrar in writing by a person qualified for appointment as auditor of a company in accordance with section 162 of the Companies Act, 1963, comprises not less than 300 persons (or, in the case of a party applying for registration as a party organised to contest a local election only, 100 persons) each of whom has reached the age of 18 years, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  at least one person who is a Member of the Dáil or an Irish representative in the European Parliament (or, in the case of a party which applies for registration as a party organised to contest a local election only, each of three persons who are members of a local authority) certifies in writing to the Registrar that he or she is a member of the party.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On an earlier section, I had been making my case in relation to this section and I made it on Second Stage too.  Therefore I do not want to proceed any further.  I am interested in the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>Since becoming a Member of the House I have tried to keep a watching brief on most Bills going through to see if they are in line with what I call best management practice.  I have a serious worry about taxpayers' money being used in this case.  According to Parkinson's law, spending will increase to use up the money which is allocated.  The same applies in business.  If we <Col N="984" /> allocate money to political parties it will become something that has to be spent.</P>
      <P>What is questionable is not where the money comes from but where it will be spent.  Over the next few weeks literally million of pounds will be poured into advertising for political parties and it will be spent in a reckless way.  The advertising agencies and newspapers love this spending but a marketing manager, looking at how the money is being spent, would regard it as squandered taxpayers' money.  It is wasteful to use taxpayers' money in this way.</P>
      <P>Experience in the United States has shown that restricting political funding does not seem to have reduced secret political funding, which still continues. Have we asked our taxpayers whether they wish their money to be used to support political parties in order for it to be spent recklessly as we are likely to see over the next few weeks? I wanted to get that off my chest.  I think it is a bad law.  I would like to see section 17 dropped but I know that is unlikely.  I know the section has been debated at length with great conviction and I heard both sides of the story.  This is a step in the wrong direction.  Parties which wish to fight an election should be able to earn their keep with the enthusiasm of their supporters rather than by taxing people who do not necessarily support them.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 15 provides for various requirements, including those related to the party leader and the chairperson, for a party to be registered.  The amendments would be appropriate in a context providing strict procedures for registration because the Bill provides that one of the main qualifications to be satisfied if a political party is to receive funding under the Bill is that it would be a registered party. However, in view of the Government decision to defer the coming into operation of provisions relating to payments to parties until January 1998, I consider this matter should be dealt with in the context of further legislation dealing with miscellaneous electoral matters, some of which were referred by me to the select committee for response some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters raised in the amendments propose very important changes to the registration procedures and I feel it would be prudent to have more time to consider the points raised.

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party opposes the concept of the payment of taxpayers' money to political parties.  I wish it were otherwise.  This country is undergoing a period of considerable change.  Politics, politicians and the concept of public duty have come under severe threat over the past couple of years.  I am not one to blame the media for this because to shoot the messenger is the easiest cop out in the world.  Newspapers will print whatever the editor believes will sell newspapers in much the same way as my friend and colleague, Senator Quinn, will only stock products which he knows will be sold and not for other, altruistic reasons.  It has nothing necessarily to do with a philosophy or an ethos.  The fact that this matter has become central to debates, whether in a public house in west County Cork, County Leitrim or County Donegal, means that we, as the body politic, need to get our house in order.  I have believed for some time that politicians should be more proactive and less reactive to allegations and statements which are made against them.</P>
      <P>I have never apologised for being involved in public life.  I am the third generation of my family to contribute to the public life of this country.  I know, in even making that statement, that some people will say &ldquo;God deliver us from political dynasties&rdquo;, but one never hears such statements with regard to professions, such as banking, tailoring, drapery or the retail sector, where the training of a family member is part of the family tradition.  I look on my upbringing as a period of training, albeit informal training.  Anybody who has a political background will understand what I mean.  One learns by instinct as much as anything else.  One learns from experience on the hustings at various elections and comes to have an appreciation of what is public duty.  One is constantly exposed to it on a daily basis with people calling to one's home irrespective of the time of day, whether one has just sat down to dinner or whether one has just finished it, because public duty knows no time limits.</P>
      <P>I say all of this because I do not want my party's opposition interpreted as being against the furthering of democracy, since the thrust of this Bill is to strengthen our democratic institutions, do away with the covert political donations from major corporations and introduce more openness and transparency into the finances of the country's political system.  However, the people of this country do not yet have the full understanding of what is involved in the political process which would enable them to readily accept this particular proposal and we are as much to blame for that as are the perceptions which have grown up outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> In normal circumstances, and because this is the norm in other European democracies, we should not be having a debate on this section.  We should be accepting it because it is the most sensible thing to do.  Sometimes public opinion can be behind politicians, which is rather strange because we are constantly accused of following rather than leading public opinion.  Maybe we are a little ahead of our time on this matter because it is being proposed in a rather spiteful, nasty atmosphere at a time when there are allegations and counter allegations about political donations, big business and golden circles.  This has been going on for the past three or four years and it can be traced back to the beginning of the beef tribunal and all that emerged from it.  People have become angered by what they see as monopoly money being shifted around among a business and professional elite and we are seen as being part of that elite because this is an extremely exclusive club.  Not everybody understands or appreciates how we go about our business even though we are interviewed on television and radio and reported in the printed media.  There is still a cloak of mystery about what goes on in here.  How many times have constituents said that they never see us in the House, that we are never there.  Whenever they see the Houses on television, they only see a Minister and an Opposition spokesperson.  They conveniently ignore the fact that, because of the heavy demands placed on them, Ministers and Members of both Houses keep abreast of debates by watching the monitors in their offices while taking telephone calls from constituents and replying to representations. The demands placed on the body politic are horrendous and we are not paid well enough for the work we do.  However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>In addition to outside events, a gross misunderstanding of our work and the workings of democracy has led to public irritation and annoyance about and opposition to any move by politicians to be seen to be feathering their own nests.  I wish it were otherwise.  I hope that, because of events in the past number of years, the legislation will act as a catharsis and we will emerge from this debate as better people.  Equally, I hope the public will gain a better understanding of our work.</P>
    <P>Practically everyone who enters this House is honest, decent and honourable.  Our differences are coloured by ideology, emphasis and nuance, and in some policy areas those differences are basic.  Members will concede that, on a purely personal level, friendships are forged across the benches of both Houses which transcend political considerations.  It is right and proper that this is the case.  However, if one is seen by one's party's political activists to have that type of personal relationship, the reaction is one of surprise. Members are asked why they have such relationships with their opponents, given that they are on <Col N="988" /> opposite sides of the fence, which also leads to misconceptions about our work in the House. Members' differences are not personal.  If the day arrives when they become personal, politics in general will suffer.</P>
    <P>For a variety of complex and confusing reasons, I have outlined my opposition to this section. From discussions with party colleagues and our spokesperson on this area, I am aware that there is a genuine resentment among the public which, on the eve of the general election, will be used as a stick to beat all politicians.  For that reason, we oppose the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue was discussed on Second Stage.  Senator Mooney readily admits that, in general, he agrees that the Bill is exceptionally good in the way it sets out to address this area.  However, he also believes that the general public are not ready to accept it.  In my dealings with members of the public in my area I have listened to comments about recent tribunals and heard people's perceptions regarding politicians. As Senator Mooney stated, everyone appears to be tarred with the same brush.</P>
      <P>For the first time, the Bill before the House deals with politicians in general.  When its provisions, the Minister of State's remarks and the 18 hours of debate on Committee Stage in the Lower House are taken into account, Senator Mooney must accept that this matter will be tackled once and for all.  A person who might go too far in trying to gain election, by ridiculing other candidates or overspending can be investigated by the proposed independent commission. I am satisfied with that development because everyone will be placed on the same level.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point but, as Senator Mooney stated, that is a matter for another day.</P>
      <P>I am not pleased that everyone is tarred with the same brush because the vast majority of Members are friendly with each other and can engage in debate despite their differences.  When discussing what is best for ourselves and the public, is Senator Mooney stating that tribunals should be established to deal with every issue? He may want that process to continue after the election but I do not.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that my party will be allocated funding in line with the percentage of first preference votes it receives.  A larger party such as Fianna Fáil will also be allocated funding commensurate with the percentage of votes it receives.  I would prefer this to a situation where someone could enter backstage and make donations of between £5,000 and £30,000 to my party, about which I would not be informed.  I would not like that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> Like Senator Mooney, I was brought up to respect people's principles.  Questions have been asked, rumours put about and the perception has developed that some companies or individuals gained from making donations to political parties. Many people work 60 to 70 hours a week for low pay and I would not be seen knocking on their doors during an election campaign if I thought that was the case.  I would demand to know what was happening and I make no apologies for that. The Bill represents a golden opportunity for politicians to be open and up front about their activities.</P>
    <P>I understand the concerns of Senator Mooney and his party, but the Bill will provide politicians with the opportunity to campaign on the same level.  Its provisions will ensure that people do not remain under the impression that accounts were paid off or that donations were made backstage.  I understand why Fine Gael and other parties were obliged to collect money to pay off election debts by means of church gate collections, private contributions, etc.  However, that should not be the case.  A small number of individuals should not be given the opportunity, whether they did so or not, to dictate political affairs.  The public will thank us if we ensure that they are not allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not share Senator Mooney's view of the public's perception.  I believe they would prefer to give me 37p per vote for every election because they would be assured that everything was above board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat my earlier comments on the section.  As Senator Cregan stated, the Bill's objectives are worthy.  However, it has one flaw, namely, taxpayers are asked to fund political parties even if they do not wish to do so. The American experience illustrates that public funding of political parties does not stop people making major secret donations.  If it did, I would have no difficulty with giving the Bill my full support. Experience shows that we are likely to get the worst of both worlds.  As happened in other jurisdictions, taxpayers will be obliged to fund political parties.  They will spend the money they receive and then discover that they require finance from another source.  As well as taxpayers' contributions, what Senator Cregan fears will come to pass.  I understand the motives and objectives behind the Bill.  I support what it tries to achieve but this is the wrong way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We must view this as an integrated package consisting of limited payments to political parties, the requirement to disclose substantial political donations and a control on the amount of money which may be spent by a party or candidate at an election.  In formulating the proposals contained in the Bill it was recognised that the requirement to disclose substantial political donations would bring openness into the system <Col N="990" /> but it would also most likely lead to a reduction in the size of such donations and we had to compensate for this.</P>
      <P>We, therefore, provided for a limited system of State funded payments to parties.  The limitation on election expenses will ensure fairness in the electoral system and the demand on the resources of political parties and candidates at an election will be reduced.  Limited State funding will be provided to qualifying political parties that achieve a minimum threshold, which we have discussed already.  Candidates who achieve a minimum level of support will recoup expenses incurred from the Exchequer up to a maximum specified limit.  This is in line with legal advice following the Supreme Court judgment in the McKenna case.  It must be remembered that the Bill must comply with that judgment, which clearly stated that all candidates must be treated equally.</P>
      <P>As was pointed out, the level of funding for political parties is small &mdash; 37p per year for each registered elector.  The Bill does not make it compulsory for a party or candidate to accept such funding.  Any party or parties wishing to receive such funding and any party candidate wishing to receive recoupment will have to apply for it.</P>
      <P>We must make clear to the public that the Bill contains a good reform package which deals with a problem that must be addressed.  Disclosure and limits on spending will be put in place and limited State funding will be provided to ensure the system is open and accountable.  People may try to avoid that or secretly receive donations but at present there are no controls and that has led to a tribunal which is sitting.  We must implement a package which meets the need as it exists.  We all wish no one had to pay anything to political parties but our democratic system has a cost.  It is a good system and we must ensure the cost is met if our democracy is to flourish and is not to be distorted by funding which is out of proportion to the expected funding and completely unregulated. This introduces regulation to the system.</P>
      <P>The Senator will recognise there are standards in the media as there are in supermarkets.  It is not just a matter of printing what sells, we must ensure the products sold meet a certain standard.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister and her latter remarks are correct.  I fail to understand why the newspaper industry has not initiated a voluntary code of conduct which would, in the absence of a statutory press council, go a long way towards addressing many concerns.  I should perhaps have declared my interest &mdash; I have been a card carrying member of the National Union of Journalists for over 20 years so my comments are influenced to a degree by the environment from which I come.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that, which may be why I agree with the last point.  It is easy for politicians to lash out at the media when they write something we do not like and to bask in reflected glory when they do something we like. The Minister is right about standards and I am sure she agrees that the manner in which some columnists have attacked politicians and the political system over the last number of years has been nothing short of despicable.  That is why the proposals for a regulatory body should go beyond talk.  The editorial columns only call for reform of the libel laws, never for reform of the newspaper industry.  Perhaps we all have agendas to pursue.</P>
      <P>Section 17(2)(a) relates to the aggregate of payments over a 12 month period.  In 1981 and 1982 there were three elections.  Given the talk of a hung Dáil after the coming joust, what would be the effect of this paragraph if we had to return to the hustings within a year?</P>

      <P>This concerns anonymous donations.  I am not breaching confidentiality by informing the House that at this morning's meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party there was a brief question and answer session to clarify the provisions of this Bill.  Many provisions do not come into force until next January but because of the upcoming election, concern and surprise was <Col N="992" /> expressed about this section.  I would like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
      <P>Section 23(1) provides that a political party shall not directly or through any intermediary accept a donation exceeding £100 in value unless the name and address of the person is known to the party member, representative or candidate. Section 23(3) states that the Public Offices Commission shall cause notification of each payment to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and shall dispose of all moneys, property or goods received under the said subsection in such manner as may be directed by the Minister for Finance. If an anonymous donation exceeding £100 is received by the people referred to, one not only must inform the Public Offices Commission of the fact but also must provide the name and address of the person and send the money.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if one receives a donation of over £100, one has to send the money but not the name and address because it is anonymous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It states &ldquo;exceeding £100 unless the name and address of the person are known&rdquo;. I was attempting to establish that if one receives £100 or more anonymously, one must send it to the Public Offices Commission.  Is that right?</P>

      <P>Why was it necessary to include this section?  It caused surprise and it will be incumbent on the people involved to ensure they get it right.  If they do not and it transpires they received such donations following which this information enters the public arena, what sanctions will be imposed on them?  Could they lose their seats in a subsequent legal challenge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an offence.  The purpose of the section is to ensure there is not an avoidance of the disclosure measures.  It would be convenient if everyone sent in anonymous donations for any amount and arrangements could be made easily for this.  We must ensure it is not used as a means to subvert the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is a radical departure and all candidates will have to be aware of it.  A sum of £100 does not buy one a great deal.  Will this be open to abuse?  Could an individual subsequent to an election say that they sent £110 or £120 to a candidate which was not disclosed?  Public embarrassment could ensue because the politicians <Col N="993" /> could be fined.  The Minister of State's answer could be that if it is anonymous, why was it sent anonymously?  They may have done so with an ulterior motive.  I am concerned and I understand the Minister of State's position.  Her answer is plausible and reasonable, but it is wide open to a variety of abuses as many candidates are running, many of whom will not be elected.

    <P>These amendments were tabled in the other House.  The intention was to make it more practical, because while there are noble aspirations in a number of sections and the general thrust of the Bill is to be commended, there may be difficulties with monitoring and implementation.  The amendments propose new and more realistic levels of expenditure for candidates.  A sum of £14,000 for one individual is enormous.  It is in excess of the annual income for a significant number of our population, but any person who has <Col N="994" /> been involved in an election campaign will know that the costs involved are huge.  Printing and related costs are significant.  Such a sum is not sufficient in today's monetary terms.  What is the Minister of State's view?  Has she received any submissions on this proposal?

      <P>In page 54, subsection (2), line 36, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or elsewhere&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I introduce this amendment primarily because of Part VII of the Bill which relates to persons unable to vote at polling stations.  All the sections in this Part relate to applications, the entry of names in the postal voters list and provides for those on the voters list who are unable to vote in person at the polling station.  My amendment proposes that section 63 (2) will read:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section &ldquo;employment&rdquo; and &ldquo;service&rdquo; shall be deemed to include participation by a person on a full time basis on an educational course of study in an educational institution in the State or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that in the drafting of section 2 the Minister was motivated by the concern expressed that people could be on educational courses or studying in educational institutions at the time.  Under our haphazard system they do not know the date of the election.  This subsection will facilitate a significant number of people to whom this problem applies on 6 June.  It is also the case that there would, at worst, be a small number of citizens who may be outside the State pursuing courses of study in an educational institution on 6 June or the date of a future election.  Why should they be disenfranchised?  Having gone three quarters of the way in facilitating the category identified under subsection (2), will the Minister go the whole hog and acknowledge it could also apply <Col N="995" /> to people outside the State?  In legal terms, &ldquo;outside the State&rdquo; means Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Where a person's work takes them away from home, whether in the State or abroad, to such an extent that he or she is unable to vote in person on polling day, under section 63 he or she can apply for entry on the postal voters list.  However, ballot papers would be issued to the address in the State at which the elector is registered.  As ballot papers are posted not less than one week before polling day, this arrangement would allow many people in this category to vote before they leave home.  The Senator's amendment opens up the question of emigrant voting.</P>

Under other sections, specifically sections 64 and 65, one must vote in front of a member of the Garda Síochána.  Is it correct, therefore, that a person has to be in the State on the date of the election?</P>

      <P>I accept that and although the Minister accurately referred to the possibility of emigrant voting, I was not entirely motivated by that in putting down this amendment.  I saw it as a bonus in the context of the acceptance of the amendment.  I was genuinely thinking of people who, under subsection (2), could conceivably be outside the State, which means, in legal terms, Northern Ireland and it may not be convenient for them to vote.  I appreciate that travelling is relatively easy, but we are talking mainly about students who may not have a great deal of money. It is a small flaw in the legislation that the Minister, in going so far to facilitate people, may unintentionally <Col N="996" /> disenfranchise others.  That is the reason for my amendment.

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 57, before section 69, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;69. The Minister shall make provision for voting by electors who are on the Register of electors but who are outside the State on polling day for a Dáil election.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment returns to the points I made on section 63(2).  This section refers to the method of election.  It means that anybody who is on the postal vote list must vote in front of a member of the Garda Síochána.  The amendment applies to those who are outside the State on the day of an election.</P>
      <P>The haphazard nature of our parliamentary democracy means that we do not know from one year to the next when there will be a general election.  It is in the gift of the Taoiseach to decide on the date. There are related constitutional requirements &mdash; the election must be within a five year period. Although there is some disagreement, the Government could remain in office until December or January next.  Because of the nature of our democracy, an election can take place at any time, depending on the political climate. However, people's lives continue and they make their arrangements.  Some people may be abroad on business and will not be able to avail of their franchise.  They may apply for a postal vote because they know they travel a great deal.  They may secure inclusion on the register having complied with the large number of regulations involved, yet having done so may find themselves outside the State and disenfranchised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the spirit of the Senator's amendment but it is not possible to include such a wide ranging amendment in the Bill.  The Bill improves the provisions for people <Col N="997" /> who expect to be outside the State on polling day. It enables people who may not be able to vote for specific reasons to avail of a postal vote.  We are making progress but this Bill will not be able to solve every problem.  The amendment refers to a wide ranging issue with which this Bill is not equipped to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's difficulty.  It is unfortunate that we are in a catch 22 situation on the eve of an election because this amendment might be accepted if the Bill could be returned to the Dáil.  I framed the amendment so that it would not be unduly restrictive. It provides that the Minister shall make provision for electors who are on the register but who are outside the State.  They could vote at our embassies and consulates abroad, rather than having to vote in front of a member of the Garda.</P>
      <P>Why is it that the vote must be cast in front of a member of the Garda?  There are other professions which would be equally worthy and acceptable.  I am sure the Garda would be happy not to have to take on this responsibility.  I am reminded of a public official who told me a story about having to remain available until a late hour because a voter in a Seanad election insisted that he or she must vote in front of this public official. Although there were alternatives, the voter did not avail of them, but kept this public official waiting until late in the evening.</P>
      <P>The provision seems unduly restrictive.  The timing of the debate on this Bill is unfortunate.  I appreciate the Minister of State's point that we are progressing slowly in this area.  However, an opportunity to vote must be given to people who are outside the State on polling day.  We have embassies and consulates in an increasing number of countries and business people use them for trade purposes.  Why not provide a framework to allow them to be used for voting?  This is related to the issue of providing votes for emigrants.  I am unapologetic in my commitment to providing votes for emigrants, but that is an argument for another day.</P>
      <P>Ryanair has been very successful with its summer fares initiative for flights to European cities and many people have booked flights travelling between the end of May and the middle of July &mdash; at least enough to elect one or two Deputies. Those people will be swanning around Europe on election day.  I know that the offers happen to coincide with the election period but there will be more people abroad on 6 June this year than on that date in past years.  I accept that one cannot frame legislation on a year by year basis, but if my amendment were accepted the Minister would be able to make provision for those people to vote.</P>

      <P>Legislation should make sense. This is a common sense amendment.  However, it does not make sense that at any particular time <Col N="998" /> up to 50,000 people may not be able to vote because they are abroad.  There are people who are working in the Six Counties who would be considerably inconvenienced if they had to travel to the South to vote.  In this era of technology a commissioner for oaths, a county manager, a county secretary or people in similar positions could be engaged to witness a postal vote.  The fact that less than 1,000 votes decided eight seats in the last general election highlights the importance of this amendment.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we are on the eve of a general election, but Senator Mooney has worded the amendment is such a fashion that the Minister could introduce the regulation where it was necessary to do so.  The amendment would be particularly important for a summer election because, at a conservative estimate, 50,000 people may be absent, particularly as Ryanair, Aer Lingus and British Midland have transformed air fares.</P>
      <P>Most of the people who may be abroad are in the PAYE sector which, although it has played a major part in the economy's growth in recent years, has been neglected.  The Minister of State should at least indicate that this issue will be dealt with in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>To protect the integrity of the ballot paper it is important that the Garda is central to the arrangements.  Senator Mooney referred earlier to public perception and making sure the system is above suspicion.  We must be careful to ensure such a perception is maintained. The Garda is the appropriate body in this case.</P>
      <P>With regard to people travelling abroad we must thank Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  However, more than anyone else we should thank this good Government which has put so much money into people's pockets and put so many people into work that they can afford to go on holidays.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State and I have a very warm understanding and the Senator should not upset our relationship.  I do not wish to reduce the status of this House to that of a television programme, considering its dignity and Protocol which we all try to uphold, but it might be an interesting exercise to ask the members of the audience who will be in the country on 6 June, and will not be availing of the Ryanair, British Midland or Aer Lingus budget fares to the Continent, to raise their hands.  I presume this section is fixed but could the Minister of State make a regulation on the matter?</P>
      <P>The provision regarding Garda Síochána stations was unduly restrictive.  I know precisely what the Minister of State is saying and I agree with her.  However, for example, Members of the Seanad are legally allowed to vote in front of a wide variety of public officials; it is not restricted to any one public official.  I am sure the Clerk of the Seanad could tell me who those officials are. I know the Minister of State wanted to ensure in this section that not a scintilla of suspicion would attach to the process.  However, as inevitably happens with all legislation, when she comes to review the workings of this legislation she will probably come to the conclusion that it is a little unduly restrictive.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, we live in changing times.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the whole thrust of policy is towards making us a more attractive location for tourists and industry by reducing costs to ensure easier access.  As a result of those changes, far more people are now leaving this country on a temporary basis than ever before.  Thank God they are only doing it on a temporary rather than permanent basis, as was the case heretofore.  We should address the changing realities.  The mindset of this Bill has not fully acknowledged those changes in modern Ireland, although I do not wish to cast aspersions on the Minister of State's excellent officials who, no doubt, were heavily involved in the drafting of the Bill.  That is why I tabled this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister of State mentioned the road from Castletownbere to Killybegs.  Several of my friends and I, particularly when I travel with my dear wife to her home town of Castletownbere, would love to see the part of that road between Cork and Kerry improved.  I understand there was a meeting last week which I hope will create a few bob.  Perhaps my two friends from Cork will contribute to the road fund for next year for the Castletownbere road.</P>

      <P>What has been said about the postal vote is right.  A number of people who will be unable to leave their home to vote due to illness approached me about this recently, in the knowledge that the election date is almost set. They were in a position to go to a polling booth at the time of registration for postal voting, but they have since deteriorated.  I have had two genuine inquiries about this from elderly people whose health has deteriorated and who are now seeking a postal vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The manifesto will go to the household.  The same applies at the moment if one is on a register and voting in different constituencies. My view is that the public would be much happier getting one piece of literature to the household.  Obviously a household made up of people who are not connected &mdash; for example, people living in apartments &mdash; would all get separate post.  Generally speaking, the public would much prefer one piece of literature to a household rather than a plethora of literature where there may be eight people on the register and where they can all read the one piece of literature.</P>

Will she send it to the Fitzgerald family, Ballinaboola, Dingle, County Kerry?  There are <Col N="1003" /> two Fitzgeralds by the name of Thomas, there are a couple by the name of Michael and there are three separate families.  I do not agree with this proposal.  My daughter shares accommodation in Dublin with five people.  Who will get the literature in that household?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House and I know this is bordering on the frivolous, but I presume the reason for this measure is to reduce the cost to the Exchequer and reduce the amount of unsolicited mail to households.  As somebody who lives in an apartment, I must sometimes wade through circulars, notices and handouts that invariably tend to be piled underneath the postboxes. I have the greatest sympathy for the Minister's point of view, but I am thinking about the Independent candidates, the non-party candidates, who operate with a limited amount of money and who need all the help they can get in order to get themselves across to their electorate, as distinct from a party manifesto where the candidates are well established.  I feel there is an inbuilt disadvantage in this measure for those who wish to participate in our parliamentary democracy.  I would ask the Minister to look at this proposal again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that an arrangement could be arrived at for this year where one piece of literature would go to each household.  This would mean a great saving as only one-third of literature would need to be printed.  Many candidates were anxious to see this happen.  However, An Post does not have the facility at the moment, but they will have the facility for this in the future.  They are already sending out items of mail for advertising and they may be able to use the same process.  It is a bit up in the air at the moment, but perhaps it should be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider all the points made by Senators in relation to my discussions with An Post.  The proposal would be beneficial to Independent candidates who at the moment are trying to compete with parties who can send one piece of literature to everyone listed on the register.  In my view this is not only wasteful, but it is extremely expensive.  It is also a fairer way of operating.  Perhaps there will be hiccups, because it will not be possible to get it right in every case. But if one looks at the electoral register, it is not always possible to get it right either.  We are talking about human beings who are fallible.  I have no doubt that An Post is a very modern and streamlined organisation and that I will be able to deal with the various issues raised to the best of my ability.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 79 to 81, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1004" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 69, before section 82, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;82.&mdash;Subsection 2 of section 88 of the Act of 1992 is hereby amended by the insertion after paragraph (a) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>`(a1)  The photograph of each candidate should be printed in black and white and shall be included on the ballot paper in a manner prescribed by the Minister.' &rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that there has been a campaign for a considerable time by a gentleman in County Mayo who has circulated his reasons why photographs of candidates should be included on the ballot paper.  I understand from the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, and from what I have read in newspapers that this particular facility will be introduced for the next European elections.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm that fact.  I would like to know why it has not been included in this legislation, especially as most of the sections are not due to come into operation until 1 January 1998.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned on Second Stage, the single most important reason photographs of candidates should be included on the ballot paper is that there is a hidden literacy problem in our society. From her experience in local government, the Minister of State will be aware, as will those of my colleagues who are members of vocational education committees because the adult education officers usually implement the adult literacy programmes, that significant numbers of people refuse to acknowledge that they have a reading problem.  Just as with a gambling or drink problem, acknowledging the problem is half the battle.  For many years, my mother has been a presiding officer in our home town and she has often told me she is aware of people with reading problems.  Like most small communities one tends to know people more intimately perhaps than in urban areas and she would know them in some other context.  However, it is not her duty or obligation to point it out to them and they consequently probably spoil their ballot paper.  A percentage of spoiled ballot papers come from that source, which is why this initiative should have been acted on in the past.  I will be pleased if the Minister of State confirms that it will be implemented in a limited way, but I hope it will not be long before it is a standard activity in our parliamentary electoral process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the principle stated by the Senator and the objective would be to try to reach it at some point.  There has been much discussion and many representations made over a number of years on this issue.  Subject to resolving any technical problems, the intention is that candidates' photographs will be included on ballot <Col N="1005" /> papers in the 1999 European elections.  The question of including photographs on other ballot papers will be considered in the light of experience of those elections.</P>
      <P>There is a twofold technical problem that must be examined.  The first relates to ensuring that the printing process can generate photographs of sufficient quality on ballot papers.  The second is the time factor.  Ballot papers must be printed immediately after the close of nominations to maximise the time available for postal voting.  In addition to their myriad other duties, returning officers will have to check photographs and ensure that they match the names on the ballot papers.  We must get these technical problems right before embarking on the next stage. However, we are making a start and it is an important breakthrough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister of State's points regarding technicalities, but when one looks at the manner in which some of the sections have been drafted, it is not beyond the capacity of the excellent officials in the Department of the Environment to draft the correct regulations to ensure, for example, that it would be a requirement to provide a photograph that, similar to passport photographs, would have to be countersigned or stamped by a garda or whoever. There are a number of ways that can be done.</P>
      <P>The Electoral Act, 1994, provides that local government elections must take place in 1998.  I understand the pilot scheme is to be introduced for the European elections in 1999.  Why will it not be introduced for the local elections first?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided to start with the European elections because it gives a long leadin time.  While photographs are easy to produce, they can be misleading and it may be possible that somebody could submit an incorrect photograph, which would be disastrous if it were put onto the ballot paper.  It is an important matter. While we hope to start with the European elections, we are not fully confident yet that we will be able to do so, but we expect to and will do our best to overcome the technical problems.  We are doing well.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State give consideration to having the polling stations open until 10 p.m. rather than 9 p.m. on the day of an election?  With regard to the section dealing with the arrangements for the counting of votes, would it be possible to allow flexibility to returning officers who may wish to start the count immediately after the close of poll rather than having to wait until 9 o'clock the following morning?  While this is more practical in Britain, which has single seat constituencies, I am curious to know why provision has not been made for this.  Section 79 refers to 9 o'clock on the day after polling day.</P>
