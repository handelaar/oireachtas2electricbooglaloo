      <P>I have received notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to take urgent measures to reduce the hospital waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to review the eligibility for the Christmas bonus for certain categories of social welfare recipients, particularly those who have recently completed CE schemes.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to intervene to secure the welfare of the residents of Maxwells Terrace, Newry Road, Dundalk, County Louth, currently threatened by consistent oil spillage and petrol fumes.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator Costello's and Senator Doyle's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Norris may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
      <P>I remind Senators that we are operating under the sessional Order which was agreed yesterday. I ask Senators who wish to raise matters on the Order of Business to be relevant and brief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 2. Item 2 will be taken at 2 p.m. I suggest 20 minutes for the spokespersons and 15 minutes for other <Col N="1034" /> speakers.  There will be a sos between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of the Adoption of Foreign Babies Bill.  During the previous Government, this matter was raised on a daily basis by Members of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Independent Senators.  They impressed on the Government the need for urgent action.  As a result of this urgency, there was all-party agreement when the last Seanad ended that the Bill would be restored at Report Stage.  A few weeks ago the Leader said that this would be done soon and that certain inquiries were being made.  When will this Bill be restored and what will be its status?  The sense of urgency which we were told about on a daily basis cannot have dissipated in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to, but I must, raise the issue of accommodation and secretarial services to Members of my group.  This may also be a problem for other groups.  Our accommodation is seriously worse than was the case in the last session. We have made every effort to resolve the matter in meetings with the Government Chief Whip of the other House.  However, we have made no progress.  We are waiting for three or four weeks for a reply from the Government Chief Whip.  I realise that this is not the fault of the Leader who has been helpful and constructive in every way possible.  However, there is a serious problem that we, as a House of Parliament, do not have control over our resources and accommodation. I am giving notice that if this matter is not resolved soon we will have no alternative but to suspend many of the aspects of co-operation that are part of the running of this House.  I would regret having to do so.  This is not a personal attack on the Leader.</P>
      <P>It is outrageous that the Leas Cathaoirleach, a constitutional officer, is obliged to share a secretary with three other people.  The ratio is unacceptable and we are asking for some action. We have gone through all the usual procedures but have made no progress.  I ask the Leader for action on these matters.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  I support Senator Manning's comments on foreign adoptions.  This is an urgent matter for those involved.  May I thank the Leader for saying he will get the Department of Health and Children guidelines on raped, pregnant, suicidal 13 year olds back to me today?  We must take into account the fact that suicide in unwanted pregnancies is a real threat.  It is important to know how the health boards deal with these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's remarks on adoptions and on accommodation in the House.  I agree that it is most unsatisfactory the Leader of the House should not have an office of his own with a separate secretary and that the House does not have control over organising its accommodation.  That is an important <Col N="1035" /> matter which should be examined and suitable accommodation should be found.</P>
      <P>I would like the Leader of the House to congratulate the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on reintroducing Operation Freeflow as announced yesterday.  Will he ask the Minister to consider having Operation Freeflow all year round.  It is not enough to have it operating for one month of the year.  The best way he could do this would be to establish a Dublin traffic police.  Presently 160 gardaí are being taken off other duties and put on road traffic duties.  We need to keep as many gardaí as possible on the beat doing the job they are employed to do with a separate traffic police to deal with traffic duties.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader express my concern at the statements made by the Minister for Public Enterprise yesterday at a function in south Dublin that she is going ahead with the research and consultation phase of the light rail project Luas?  It was indicated there that £150 million was lost due to traffic congestion in that area alone and the taxpayer would have to foot the bill if the project did not come within the timeframe of the European requirements.  The taxpayer will have to foot a bill of £220 million because an unnecessary phase of consultation is being put in place when there is not the slightest hope we can meet the timeframe laid down by the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to raise a matter with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs which relates to old age contributory pensioners who, for one reason or another, might not have claimed their pension in time. Many of them would have arrears of several years.  There is provision under section 37 of the Social Welfare Act, 1997, which allows the Minister to make the necessary regulations under which all of these cases could be re-examined and most of the arrears repaid.  The matter has lain there since.  Will the Leader ask the Minister what he is doing as regards making the necessary regulations and bringing forward to both Houses the changes which might need to be discussed?  This matter was to be resolved before the end of this year</P>

      <P>Will the Leader confirm that the Scientific and Technological Education Investment Fund Bill will be taken next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though Independent Senators do not have the same problems, I have great sympathy with Senator Manning and the assertion that this House should control its own affairs including its own resources and support services.  As one who has been here, intermittently at least, for as long as many people, the idea that people who are not connected with this House can make decisions which profoundly affect the working conditions of Members of this House has always rankled.  It is time the Members of the House asserted themselves as a group.  The Leader of the House has <Col N="1036" /> made enormous efforts in this area, but we should say we are in charge of our own affairs and business and are better capable of looking after our affairs than anyone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House consider having a debate on the revaluation of property?  I do not know whether it is the Department of the Environment and Local Government or the Department of Finance that deals with this. The Leader has promised a debate on the restructuring of local government and perhaps this issue can be covered then.  The valuation levied on a square footage basis is the same in the west of Ireland as in Dublin 4.  This is unfair and impractical. Small business people in rural areas are levied resulting in a £12,000 rate increase.  It is a matter of importance to every Member in the House. I ask the Leader to clarify which Department is responsible for this matter and, if possible, to arrange a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello touched on the issue of traffic in the south Dublin area.  This has gone beyond being a local issue.  The southern cross route is to be launched next March, yet there is no forward planning in relation to consultation as to how traffic can best be managed. Operation Freeflow exists in the city centre but nothing has being done for the area south of the Liffey.  I ask the Leader to go back to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and find out what plans exist.  Perhaps he could make a statement and prod the two councils in the area into entering a consultation process to plan for traffic management.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise the issue of the proposed abolition of duty free facilities.  I am concerned this matter has not been given attention recently.  I met representatives of Aer Rianta in Dublin yesterday.  The workers are extremely concerned.  The whole Shannon region would be affected because in excess of £12 million is contributed to Aer Rianta from sales of duty free products.  Minister McCreevy should be alerted to this problem when dealing with revenue in the proposed budget.  We should also put pressure on Commissioner Pádraig Flynn in Brussels to deal with this immediately.  The spin off effect on employment in the region would be catastrophic particularly for the ancillary services and the advances Aer Rianta intend making at Shannon Airport.  The sales of duty free contribute to the efforts made to provide increased infrastructure. The abolition of duty free sales would affect the whole country, the ferry ports and Dublin Airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In case people think traffic problems only occur in Dublin there should be a debate on the matter.  If we are to be fair, some of <Col N="1037" /> the 160 gardaí brought in for Operation Freeflow should be sent back to their barracks in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin is over-endowed with roads at present.  I ask the Leader of the House when he is organising this debate on traffic problems in Dublin to consider the traffic problems in Kilkenny where there is no ring road.  There is gridlock from Mullinavat into Waterford on the Kilkenny-Waterford road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Callan was bypassed and it was the best thing that ever happened because it has developed further as a result.  We should remember there are places outside the Pale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are too severe on motorists.  If people took their time we would all get there. The quicker we go through this life the quicker we will enter the next.  The motorist has become a new found criminal whom everybody is criticising.</P>
      <P>We have a problem with ring roads in Sligo, where we are in a position to build the road but objectors will not allow us.  It is a Tweedledum and Tweedledee situation.</P>
      <P>I support Senator McGowan's comment regarding valuations.  As an auctioneer I know how valuations operate.  I have spoken with the Valuation Office on many occasions and have had problems sorted out, but the problem in rural Ireland is that many businesses have to upgrade to comply with EU or other regulations.  If they do not upgrade they are put out of business because of non-compliance with hygiene and other regulations.  When businesses upgrade the Valuation Office imposes higher rates which put them out of business.  They are in a no win situation. The Valuation Office should be reasoned in its work so that when people have to upgrade to comply with regulations, their valuations are not interfered on the basis that the value of the property is not being increased.  I support the call for a debate on the matter to highlight the anomalies.</P>

      <P>When is it intended to bring the Air Navigation Bill before the House?  Introducing it would resolve the difficulties expressed by Senator Jackman as debate on the Bill would include discussion of duty free.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to announce to the House that the Taoiseach, <Col N="1038" /> Deputy Ahern, has appointed Senator Dardis as Deputy Leader of the Seanad.  I wish him well in his new post.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Henry and Ryan inquired about the restoration of the Adoption Bill.  The information I previously gave the House was correct as of then and I will check it immediately after the Order of Business.  Senator Manning also raised his serious concern at the lack of action taken regarding facilities in the House.  I will meet with the leaders immediately after the Order of Business and arrange a joint meeting with the Chief Whip today to see how this matter can be progressed.  I will report to the House at the start of business next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Ormonde and Lanigan raised their serious concern about the free flow traffic programme which is being put into operation over the next few days.  All Members concur with their sentiments.  We are all experiencing difficulties due to the huge growth in traffic on the roads, which is attributable to the buoyancy of our economy and the various things success brings.  Perhaps we can raise this issue during a debate on the Second Stage of a Bill which the Minister for the Environment will introduce over the coming weeks.  If Senators are not satisfied with this, we can arrange for a special debate on the issue early in the next session.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor raised the question of pension rights.  I concur with him and have experienced what he spoke about.  Perhaps he will raise the issue during his own party's Private Members Business in two weeks' time.  If this is not suitable, then we will see how we can facilitate him.</P>
      <P>I take account of the requests of Senators McGowan and Farrell, two senior Members of the House, and have no difficulty in arranging for a debate on the valuation of property.  Senator Jackman and many other Members have raised their serious concern regarding the abolition of duty free on 1 July 1999.  I will consult with the relevant Department with a view to organising a debate on this serious issue which has far reaching implications for more than 100,000 people. Duty free has been one of this country's successes because of low airfares and the attracting of tourists in the off season.  I wish to enable business progress as favourably as at present and accede to the Senator's request.</P>
      <P>Regarding the matter raised by Senator Coogan, I understand that the Air Navigation Bill is going into Committee Stage.  Committee members were appointed yesterday and they are starting to meet immediately.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Title>150th Commemoration of the Famine: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to have this opportunity to address the Seanad, something I did not have the opportunity of doing as Minister for Defence.  I am <Col N="1039" /> delighted to have the opportunity to speak on a subject which is dear to my heart and that of many Senators.  It is a subject many of us have studied, especially over the past couple of years in light of the 150th commemoration of that terrible period in our history from 1846-50.  The literature is wide and varied.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years we have been assessing the impact the Great Famine has had on the contemporary and longer term structures of Irish society.  As the House will know, the opportunity to do so has been spearheaded by the Famine Commemorative Committee, which was established in May 1994 by the then Minister, Deputy Tom Kitt, and developed by a Member of this House, Senator Doyle, in her capacity as a member of the last Government, and continued by the present Government by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan.  I pay tribute to these colleagues and to the work of the committee.  As a result of this work, we have as a nation a new awareness of a great tragedy.</P>
      <P>The facts and figures of the period suggest that during the late 1840s there were unprecedented levels of sickness, emigration, death and misery, what Mrs. Cecil Woodham-Smith called &ldquo;the Great Hunger&rdquo; when she published her study under that title in 1962.  <i>The Great Hunger</i> and other literature provide a definitive collection of works on the famine.  <i>The Great Hunger</i> is worth reading for those who want an unvarnished overview of the famine.  Over the years the Great Famine also developed a unique folklore that passed from generation to generation and became embedded in our minds as a defining moment in our history.  As it did so, the topic remained highly emotive, affecting our view of ourselves, our neighbours and our role in the world.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the series of ongoing articles by Brendan Ó Cathaoir, &ldquo;Famine Diary&rdquo;, which are published every Saturday in <i>The Irish Times</i> They are certainly very helpful to those of us interested in this subject and keep us mindful of that terrible time in our history.  Other offerings on the famine include a compilation of a very interesting series of essays by Professor Dudley Edwards and Professor T. Desmond Williams.  The Quakers, the Society of Friends, played an immense role in the famine outlined in a book entitled <i>Transactions of the Society of Friends During the Famine in Ireland.</i>  This is in the nature of a reference book, which outlines the contribution the Quakers made to the relief of the terrible distress which afflicted the country at the time, but it is interesting to dip into and gives one a sense of the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 20 years or so, historians have been questioning the received wisdom on the Great Famine.  Although this has created different schools of thought, the debate has encouraged a more multifaceted and &ldquo;total history&rdquo;.  It is no <Col N="1040" /> accident that this &ldquo;revisionism&rdquo; and &ldquo;neo-revisionism&rdquo; have been evolving as Ireland enters a new chapter in its history and development, as it is becoming more urbanised and industrialised and as it develops new relationships with Britain and the wider European Union.</P>
    <P>However, there is no contradiction between learning from our own experience during the Great Famine and the development of these new relationships.  Indeed, because of our own painful and relatively recent experience of famine, we are in a better position than most to develop an honourable and honest role to both comment on, and lead the campaign against, starvation and want in our late 20th century world, especially as this is manifest in North Korea.</P>
    <P>This must surely be the most important legacy of our most recent review of our own Great Famine, all the more so in that most modern famines are not the result of socio-economic collapse. Instead, they are, more often than not, associated with civil wars, cold wars, a lack of democracy or, in some cases, with what are perhaps the unintended by-products of ideology, whether it be collectivisation, forced migration or some other form of social engineering.  It is difficult, for example, to instance any recent African famine which has not been associated with, or greatly exacerbated by, warfare.  Our own experience in Somalia is evidence of that.  Tragically, while many thousands of lives were saved between 1992 and 1993, the position has again deteriorated with the flooding of the River Juniper.  I hope the international community will re-examine these events.</P>
    <P>However, not only does this make modern famines no less worthy of intervention, but, given our own history, it makes such intervention an even greater imperative.  During our own Great Famine, the head of the Treasury, Sir Charles Trevelyn, opposed British assistance on the grounds that the Irish were &ldquo;unworthy&rdquo; of relief on the grounds that it was the nature of Irish society itself which had brought the famine about. Specifically, what Trevelyn had in mind were those small holdings which proliferated the countryside.  Indeed, one result of the famine was to clear away such holdings and bring about a more commercialised farming during the second half of the 19th century.</P>
    <P>In our own history Trevelyn's comments have been controversial, at times misused and taken out of context.  However, the basic point remains as true for mid 19th century Ireland as it does for North Korea today; there is no such thing as a &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; famine.  As a nation, we are in a position to know and state as much.</P>
    <P>One of the more striking aspects of our own famine was that so many people should perish in an era associated with better communication, improved medicine and unprecedented wealth.  It shocked many people at the time and has shocked many people since.  Yet, we also need to remind ourselves that even the richest countries then were very poor by the standards of places such as the United States, Germany and even Ireland <Col N="1041" /> today.  Therefore, whatever about the middle of the 19th century, a lack of resources is no reason why anyone should perish from famine in the late 20th century.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest qualities of the Irish people is their generosity of thought and action.  In keeping with this viewpoint, I regard humanitarian concerns as being central to Irish life, politics and foreign policy.  It is perhaps one of the few positive legacies we gained from our terrible experiences during the Great Famine last century.  As a people, we have always felt a strong solidarity with the peoples of other countries who are suffering similar catastrophes or disaster, whether natural or man-made.  This Irish sense of solidarity is summed up succinctly and eloquently in the proverb &ldquo;Ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine&rdquo; which means that people live in each other's shadow.  From our own experience we should realise that facing up to poverty and hunger in the world today is not just a question of charity but of justice as well.  Next week I shall have the honour of visiting the Canadian disembarkation point in the last century for Irish emigrants fleeing the Great Famine.  I know that when I reach the evocative island of Grosse Ile in the St. Lawrence River, I shall be thinking of the tragedies which are affecting people in the modern world, not least those who may be suffering from hunger and starvation.  I will also be thinking of the one million people who died during the Famine and of the one million people who emigrated.  We sometimes forget that the generation of people who emigrated lived in the most appalling and horrendous conditions in the countries in which they were generously received.  It took a number of generations to bring them up to a relatively comfortable standard of living.</P>
    <P>The holding of this debate today expresses the very deep concern felt by myself and the Government as a whole regarding the humanitarian situation in North Korea.  There are in fact many comparisons which may be made between Ireland and Korea.  The Korean peninsula, like the island of Ireland, has been fought in and fought over through the centuries.  Like us, the Koreans have known many invaders and have struggled unrelentingly to maintain their national identity, culture and independence.  Like us, their homeland has been partitioned in a manner which has done enormous damage to the development and progress of their nation.</P>
    <P>For Korea as a whole, the 20th century has for the most part been a troubled and difficult one. For nearly all of the first half of the century, Imperial Japanese forces controlled the peninsula and created conditions whereby Koreans became second class citizens in their own country.  At the end of the Second World War, Korea was finally liberated only to become a pawn in the ensuing superpower conflict as the Cold War quickly developed and expanded to touch almost all corners of the world.</P>
    <P>The Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950 when Communist forces from the north crossed <Col N="1042" /> the 38th parallel into the south and overran the capital, Seoul.  For three long years, the fortunes of war favoured first one side and then the other. China and the Soviet Union provided troops and equipment for the north while a United Nations force, led by the United States, helped to defend the south.  In the end, an armistice was signed with the antagonists separated more or less along the 38th parallel, which was where they had started out from in the first place.  The war devastated the Korean peninsula causing enormous damage to industry and agriculture.  More than a million soldiers and civilians were killed, not to mention the many thousands of foreign troops who perished.</P>
    <P>The Korean War was a true catastrophe for all the people of Korea destroying factories and farms alike.  It separated families from each other and created an enmity between the two halves of Korea which has remained to the present day and which has ensured that the armistice line running across the Korean peninsula is one of the few remaining hot spots of international tension in the modern world.  It is consequently greatly to the credit of the Republic of Korea, which comprises the southern half of the peninsula, that its economy is today the eleventh largest in the world.  It has created huge industries whose products are sold and highly appreciated throughout the world.  It has exported its technology and its capital so that even countries as far away as Ireland have benefited from its industrial and financial investment.  Our direct trading relationship with South Korea is particularly robust with more than £200 million being exported in each direction in 1996 alone.  Our overall bilateral relationship is now so important that in the past few years full residential embassies have been established in each country's capital.</P>
    <P>Sadly, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the northern half of the peninsula has followed a very different socio-economic path. Hidebound by rigid Stalinist social policies and political repression, the breakdown of the Soviet bloc lost it what few friends it had left in the world; its economy has stagnated to such an extent that it is now clearly no longer even able to feed its own people.  It has suffered natural disasters through flooding and drought in recent times.  Two successive years of floods in 1995 and 1996 were followed this year by a devastating drought throughout the country and a destructive typhoon last August which damaged crops in the west of the country.  It has to be admitted, however, that the intrinsic root of the problem has been North Korea's stubborn inability as a society to adapt itself to the economic and technological realities of the modern world.</P>
    <P>A society or nation State anywhere in the world can only achieve its full potential and function for the betterment of the individual and society in general in an atmosphere of freedom: freedom of belief, freedom of speech and freedom of association.  Economically, I believe there is no alternative to a system of free enterprise <Col N="1043" /> linked with co-operative endeavour.  Nobody can claim that these freedoms exist in North Korea. Even with the end of the Cold War and the demise of the former Soviet Union, it would appear that North Korea remains impervious to change.  With few friends anywhere in the world, it has attempted to maintain a policy of <i>juche</i> or self-reliance based on outdated Marxist ideology. Not only has this policy brought economic ruin to the country but it has failed the most basic self-sufficiency requirement of all, which is the ability to feed one's own people.</P>
    <P>Whatever the cause or causes of the current crisis in North Korea, let us turn to the facts.  Only 18 per cent of the country is suitable for agricultural use and food production has been in decline since 1990, mainly due to a high dependence on agro-chemical inputs, soil exhaustion, lack of agricultural investment and poor farming practices. The annual cereal requirement to meet the needs of the North Korean population is believed to be five million tonnes.  It is estimated by the World Food Programme &mdash; WFP &mdash; and by the Food and Agriculture Organisation &mdash; FAO &mdash; that the 1997 harvest yield has amounted to only 2.6 million tonnes, creating a deficit which will have to be met by humanitarian aid and barter exchange arrangements.  The WFP alone has shipped and distributed over 650,000 tonnes of cereals this year already.  The various UN agencies have appealed for and received to date a total of US$178.5 million for distribution as food aid. This emergency aid has been focused on the following priority sectors: approximately 2.6 million children aged six and under have received food rations at nurseries and kindergartens throughout the country &mdash; almost three quarters of the food provisions under the emergency programme was directed at this group; 250,000 farmers, farm workers and 850,000 dependants in flood-affected areas have received assistance for work involving clearing of agricultural land, rehabilitation of rural infrastructure and participation in disaster mitigation schemes; and up to one million patients received food supplies during short term hospital stays.</P>
    <P>In addition, UNICEF is undertaking a massive immunisation programme for all children.  The European Commission has donated at total of 56.5 million ECUs in emergency humanitarian assistance, most of which has been disbursed through the WFP.</P>
    <P>The immediate crisis has probably passed, and there now appear to be sufficient supplies to carry the population through the winter.  There is general agreement, however, that the poor harvest gathered this year means that without further assistance, a new crisis may arise by next April.</P>
    <P>I am proud that Ireland has been to the forefront of international donors in its response.  The Government has so far given £815,000 in emergency humanitarian assistance to North Korea since June 1996; this represents a sizeable portion of Irish Aid's emergency budget in this period. <Col N="1044" /> Irish Aid's assistance has been channelled through the WFP, Trócaire and Concern.</P>
    <P>Many Members will be aware that Irish NGOs have been very active in the humanitarian assistance effort for North Korea.  In addition to the Government's contribution, Trócaire has raised almost £2.3 million from their public appeal.  I pay particular tribute to Trócaire's director, Mr. Justin Kilcullen.  He has given an immense lead in this regard, and he has done his organisation and his country proud.  Concern has also donated US$150,000 to the WFP and is now running a winterisation programme involving the production of heavy clothing for distribution during the coming winter.  No words can express the admiration I feel for these Irish agencies which, in North Korea and elsewhere, are maintaining the proud tradition of helping those who are most in need.</P>
    <P>I also wish to express my appreciation to the group of parliamentarians who visited North Korea in September at the invitation of Mr. Kilcullen. The group comprised Deputy Eamon Gilmore, Bernie Malone, MEP, and Dr. Joe Hendron, the former MP for West Belfast.  I wish to express again my appreciation to Dr. Hendron who gave me more literature on the North Korean situation when I visited Belfast.  The report of their visit provided many useful insights into the internal situation in North Korea and was brought to the attention of our partners in the EU who expressed considerable interest in it.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a keen interest in this situation and has been anxious to be as well informed as possible and to take the most effective action in the circumstances.  I am pleased to inform Members that a technical mission comprising a technical expert from the development co-operation division of my Department and an officer from the Irish Embassy in Beijing visited North Korea last week.  Their brief was to assess the humanitarian situation there in order to determine the precise needs of the population and to ensure that the assistance provided by Ireland is being used to the best possible advantage and distributed to those most in need.  During their stay, the members of the technical mission visited a number of centres under the supervision of the Korean authorities.  They also had an opportunity for a range of consultations and meetings with several agencies and others who are closely involved in the effort.  They formed the view that there continues to be a food deficit and that there is some evidence of malnutrition, but in so far as it can be determined from the available evidence, the situation cannot be described as a famine in the conventional understanding of the term.  The technical mission was informed by the international agencies that reports that as many as 1 million people may have died earlier this year from starvation were exaggerated. It was clear, however, that a potential disaster could certainly have occurred earlier this year had timely international assistance not proved adequate to cope with the crisis.  The leader <Col N="1045" /> of the technical mission is highly skilled and very knowledgeable in this area, and we were glad to have his expertise to lead this mission.</P>
    <P>Most of the UN agencies consulted by the technical mission stated the basic problem in North Korea was not just one of food security.  They stressed that a short-term response would be no substitute for the political and economic reforms which would be needed if North Korea were to achieve stability.  Many believed furthermore that the economy was operating at as little as 20 per cent of capacity.  They reported indications of extreme infrastructural neglect everywhere, with rail, port and secondary road systems in decay. The health sector appears to have fallen apart even before the latest set of natural disasters, and the main water/sanitation systems have collapsed. Electricity and motor fuel are in short supply and water chlorination plants have shut down due to lack of resources for repair and maintenance.</P>
    <P>It seems that no matter how much aid is distributed now, and there is no denying that it will be urgently needed in coming months, the root problems of North Korea will not be solved unless the politico-economic structures on the Korean peninsula are changed.  For this reason we have always held, and will continue to hold, that the two parts of Korea must be willing to co-operate together and to discuss their shared concerns.  It has to be made clear in this regard that it has been the North Korean Government which time and again has refused to negotiate in good faith and on an equal basis with its counterpart in Seoul.</P>
    <P>Quadripartite talks involving the two parts of Korea, China and the US, have finally been put in place to be held in Geneva, starting on 9 December.  Last week's announcement came after months of negotiations between the parties involved.  Earlier attempts at setting up talks had failed due to North Korea's insistence that the question of US troop reductions in South Korea be specifically included on the agenda.  It has now been agreed that the aim of the Geneva conference will be to discuss the &ldquo;establishment of a peace regime on the Korean peninsula and issues concerning tension reduction there&rdquo;.  This is not dissimilar to our situation.  It would appear that the US has assured the North Koreans that they can raise the issue of troop reductions at Geneva along with any other issue which they feel might help to achieve the two aims of the conference as announced.  It seems most unlikely, however, that US troop reductions will take place in the absence of a comprehensive peace agreement on the peninsula.</P>
    <P>Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea.  The only North Korean representative in the EU is accredited to Denmark and lives in Copenhagen.  Despite this, we are contributing significantly at present to the alleviation of malnutrition in North Korea and we shall continue to do so for as long as is necessary.  It is clear, however, that the economic problems of North Korea are not solely, or even principally, due to <Col N="1046" /> natural disasters or events outside the control of the Pyongyang Government.  There is no doubt that socio-economic reform is required in North Korea but there is little indication of a willingness on the part of the regime to follow that route.</P>
    <P>Likewise, in relation to human rights and association with terrorism, very serious charges have been raised about the regime.  There is a complete absence in North Korea of political freedom as we know it; it is widely believed furthermore that the number of political prisoners held under extremely harsh conditions by the regime is very high &mdash; perhaps as many as 200,000.</P>
    <P>On the international front, North Korea's record is far from spotless.  It seems to have given up even the pretence of adhering to international standards and is currently attempting to withdraw from the UN Covenant of Civil and Political Rights &mdash; an action which is not even provided for under the terms of the covenant.  The export of missiles and other military equipment to areas of international high tension also presents the international community with serious worries. While these circumstances continue, Ireland will have to be cautious about drawing any nearer politically to the regime in Pyongyang.</P>
    <P>The people of North Korea nevertheless cannot and must not be held responsible for the sins of their Government.  What matters more than anything else in the present circumstances is that innocent men, women and children in North Korea, or anywhere else, should die from starvation simply because the outside world is unwilling to do what is necessary to save them.  It behoves us all in today's independent world to ensure that the global economy provides adequate food security for the entire population. We in Ireland will continue to work with the rest of the international community to play our full part in preventing further crises.  Ours is a proud record, both in peacekeeping so ably conducted by our Defence Forces and in the continuous response of the people to appeals for aid for less well-off parts of the world.  This relates to the national psyche and the fact that our ancestors were the victims of a famine for which they had no responsibility.  The memory of the suffering of our own people 150 years ago will allow us to do no less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending this important debate.  I know the busy schedule of any Minister and sometimes the handling of topics can be seen as easily transferable to junior spokespersons or Ministers of State from other Departments, particularly in relation to the Seanad.  Last night we criticised the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, for not attending the important debate on agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was my privilege as a Minister of State in the last Government to take over the running of the Great Famine Commemoration Committee.  For the past two and a half years I traversed virtually <Col N="1047" /> every county attending famine commemoration events.  I travelled extensively on behalf of Ireland, to Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Liverpool and other parts of the world where Irish people have had an enormous impact, largely due to enforced emigration during and immediately after the tragic years of the 1840s.  We are now drawing parallels between the tragedy of famine in Korea and the tragedy of our Famine 150 years ago, to see if lessons have been learnt.  What is the relevance of the Great Irish Famine for modern times?</P>
    <P>Between 1845 and 1850, the potato crop was destroyed by blight.  Over a million people from a population of 8 million died from starvation and starvation related diseases.  Many more died from disease than starvation; they were so debilitated they did not live long enough to die of starvation. A further million emigrated under appalling conditions, many dying before they reached their destinies or soon after landing.  These are facts and they are not open to any historical revisionism.</P>
    <P>In large parts of our country, at the bottom of a class-driven society governed by access to land, there was a large seething mass of cottiers and landless labourers whose sole means of existence was the potato.  The potato was to these people what today's social, health and other State welfare support systems are to so many.  It is beyond imagination that next week the Minister for Finance would announce in the budget that all social welfare supports are withdrawn, all FÁS schemes, community employment schemes and rent subsidies are gone, medical cards are withdrawn, free education is gone and all State support systems are to be withdrawn overnight.  Trying to contemplate the impact this would have on the community brings us a little closer to understanding the tragedy of the Famine.</P>
    <P>In the mid-19th century the potato harvest was to almost six million people, the cottiers and landless labourers, what the social welfare support system is to the people today who cannot find work and cannot house themselves.  The potato harvest, following the hungry months of June, July and August when the previous year's supply of potatoes ran out, acted like a single annual social welfare payment which sustained entire families and communities for another 12 months. When that safety net snapped and the <i>phytophthora infestans</i> arrived, it pitched into an ever descending vortex of misery, death and emigration, a rural proletariat who had no one and nowhere to go except to a helpless alien administration physically and psychologically removed from the people.</P>
    <P>This administration, despite having one of the most advanced systems for addressing poverty in Europe, namely, the poor law unions, was overwhelmed by the magnitude of the disaster &mdash; to put it at its kindest &mdash; evidenced by the insertion of the Gregory clause, and considered land and property before people.  While some lessons were <Col N="1048" /> learned and applied to the Indian famines in subsequent decades, how chilling it is to realise as we stand here today thinking of famine, particularly in Korea, that not much has changed in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The scale of our disaster 150 years ago is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine.  Sometimes a single instance can have more impact in the telling than all statistics.  A doctor in Skibbereen described the following visit:</P>
    <P>The shed is exactly 7 feet long by about 6 feet in breadth.  By the side of the western wall is a long, newly-made grave.  By either gable are two of shorter dimensions which have recently been tenanted.  Near the hole that serves as a doorway is the last resting place of two or three children.  In fact, this hut is surrounded by a rampart of human bones which has accumulated to such a height that the threshold, which was originally on a level with the ground, is now two feet beneath it.  In this horrible den, in the midst of a massive human putrefication, six individuals, males and females, labouring under the most malignant fever, were huddled together as closely as were the dead in the graves around.</P>
    <P>These are the people we must remember as we strive to commemorate, as best we can, the tragedy of the Great Irish Famine.  The Government's programme is an appropriate and respectful commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the greatest tragedy in modern Irish history.  This year, 1997, is the 150th anniversary of &ldquo;Black &rsquo;47&rdquo;, and as the year draws to a close it is appropriate to have this dignified discussion of that tragic period.  We must try to commemorate those who died or were forced to leave our shores.</P>
    <P>Of what relevance is the Great Irish Famine to famine in our times?  Having painted a picture of exactly how the Famine was in Ireland, what have we learned?  Have we learned anything?  Is there not a parallel between our experience of the 1840s and the state of the world today?  In Korea it is not just that there is no food; it is that &mdash; as the excellent literature that Trócaire has published tell us &mdash; people who depend on subsistence crops which are removed from them, as the potato was removed from our people 150 years ago, do not have the purchasing power to buy alternative food supplies.  That is the huge parallel. Those who have their basic staple food removed from them through natural disaster have not had an alternative food supply given them by the administration they were depending on.  The Irish did not have it from the British administration of the day and the landless Korean people are not having sufficient alternative food supplied by their Government.</P>
    <P>The fact that their Government has isolated itself from international development for so many years &mdash; they have a culture of secrecy and self-sufficiency behind closed doors &mdash; has meant that perhaps they are not able, even if they were willing, to supply food for the people.  There is little <Col N="1049" /> point in raking up the willingness or otherwise of the administration in the 1840s to look after our people.  At the time there was a <i>laissez-faire</i> economic system and many felt that by letting the situation resolve itself, somehow we would bring the Irish cottiers and landless labourers kicking and screaming into the modern agricultural economy that was developing on the British mainland in the 1840s.</P>
    <P>There was also an unspoken but pervasive feeling that we deserved what had happened to us. What would you expect from such a ragged mass?  They would genuflect to the concept that it was a tragedy, but maybe it would bring a better life for those who survived, while solving the problem of the teeming masses, the underclass in Ireland at the time.</P>
    <P>What is most insidious is that, even from the modern world &mdash; and we are part of the western developed world today &mdash; there is a feeling that the North Koreans have &ldquo;brought this on themselves&rdquo;. We will not see that printed anywhere or stated at any international forum by the heads of the UN, the IMF or of any Government, but there is a feeling that they &ldquo;almost deserve it&rdquo;. They allied themselves with the Communist regime over the years while the western world was allied to South Korea.  That difficulty went back over the decades to Kim Il Sung and the Korean war.  In the same way as the Irish proletariat underclass was perceived by the British administration, it was felt that North Korea was always a sore on the global economy and that the country deserved what befell it.  This parallel is an indictment of us all.</P>
    <P>Yes, there was a downturn in the Korean economy over the years because of a failure to face the international developed world and come on board.  The catalyst of natural disasters, including drought and flooding, meant that millions have been facing starvation.  Over 20 million people live on a small land mass in North Korea.  They were paid by the State in wages and food, but when the State ran out of cash they got nothing and there was no food due to drought.</P>
    <P>It is a huge crisis and I join with the Minister in commending Trócaire.  I thank the agency for the information they sent me on request concerning the facts of what is happening in Korea.  I also thank Concern and the State agencies that have gone to Korea to try to help.  However, I am not sure that collectively western Governments really faced the tragedy that has been developing in Korea over the last few years.  There has been a denial in the same way that a denial culture developed in Ireland in the decades following the Famine and lasted until recently.</P>
    <P>One of the great assets of commemorating the Famine in the open and non-contentious way we have is that we have made the Irish people face the facts.  The impact the Famine had on the national psyche, including a survivors' guilt, has been opened up.  In facing what actually happened to us, we recognise that we are here today <Col N="1050" /> because we and our forebears were survivors and in trying to establish why some survived and others died of disease and starvation or had to emigrate, we face the facts of what happened at the time.  We face the fact that it was a class riven society dependent on land and that the iniquitous landlord and tenant system contributed enormously to the tragedy.  The alien administration that did not reflect or respond democratically to the people's needs was responsible for exacerbating the situation.  The administration did not cause the potato blight but it did cause the Famine, and there is no denying that.  The administration in North Korea today did not cause the drought or the flooding, but the inadequacy of the administration in running its affairs has caused the famine.  That is the big similarity between modern famines and the Great Irish Famine.</P>
    <P>There is also the iniquitous system of indebtedness to the IMF and the World Bank by many poorer countries.  As a country which survived such a tragedy and became a major economic player not only in Europe but, thankfully, in the world, I am not sure that we are contributing sufficiently to the world wide debate on cash crops that have to be grown by some of the poorest countries to repay international debts before they can grow food crops to feed their starving people. This is an enormous tragedy.  That is the debate I want to see us dealing with in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Let us see if we can contribute as a nation that survived the awful tragedy of the Famine.  What a price we have had to pay to come kicking and screaming into the modern world.  Famine is too high a price to pay for modernisation.  There has to be another way to bring countries and economies into the modern, international, globalised and developed state in which we are other than by famine which pitches people into facing up to what to many of us seems inevitable.</P>
    <P>There has to be a way whereby we can get in and help these Governments to face modern economic realities rather than watching them descend into the tragedy of famine which may drive them into a modern economy; but at what a price, as we stand by and let it happen?</P>
    <P>I accept we have our ODA targets and each year successive Governments are getting closer to what the UN regards acceptable overseas development aid targets should be.  Our progress has been slow, but with the rate our economy has grown in the past two or three years we should be able to accelerate the time by which we reach acceptable targets.</P>
    <P>The people, as distinct from the Government, have been inordinately generous in their response to famine appeals over the decades.  That is largely due to our tragic experience of famine. Perhaps modern communications expose famine, which results in a generous response.  However, the more famine is seen on our television screens, the less impact it has.  One can become inured to tragedy and famine, or donor fatigue can set in. <Col N="1051" /> It is becoming harder to get voluntary contributions for non-governmental organisations to continue their excellent work in places such as Korea.  Our track record has been second to none in terms of people's generosity.  In recent years the Government has focused on the fact that we must reach the UN target and that we are no longer considered among the poorer nations of the world.  We will have great difficulty keeping our Objective 1 status when the time comes to make our case.  That is both good and bad.</P>
    <P>Let us see what we can do and how we can head towards the stage where we can be the leaders in terms of awakening world opinion to what needs to be done in the famine spots of the world today.  There is sufficient food in the global economy to feed everyone.  However, poorer countries, such as Korea, do not have entitlements or purchasing power.  If their government fails the people, as the Government in Ireland in the 1840s failed its people during the natural disaster, the western world must step in.  Governments can be shored up in a diplomatic way.</P>
    <P>The people in Korea have been eating soup made from grass and seaweed for the past 12 months.  One does not have to dig too deep in Irish literature to know that grass, seaweed and nettles were one of the people's mainstays during those terrible years in the 1840s.  Deaths in both countries are mainly due to epidemic diseases rather than starvation.  However, I hope that today mass immunisation makes it possible to shore up some of the worst infectious diseases in parts of the world where there is famine.</P>
    <P>Our overseas development aid is in response to the aid Ireland received from 19 different sources during our Famine.  We are now giving back what we received during our darkest hour.  We know the stories about the poorhouses, workhouses and soup kitchens in Ireland.  The migration of families to relief centres in Korea and other areas of famine is similar to our people's migration to the workhouses.</P>
    <P>Both were secret famines &mdash; our Great Famine and the Korean Famine.  Through lack of communication and the absence of the electronic media in the 1840s a degree of tragedy had occurred in Ireland before the story became worldwide.  The administration did not face up publicly to what was happening here and in the Scottish islands and highlands.  Similarly, the secret culture and operation of the state in Korea meant its attempt to move towards self-sufficiency was done behind closed doors.  It was a secret famine until the non-governmental organisations revealed what was happening there.</P>
    <P>There are many other similarities between the two famines.  The great tragedy is that people are dying and will continue to die for some time in Korea through lack of an alternative food supply, now that their staple food has been destroyed in a natural disaster.  In Ireland there were large exports of cattle and grain during the Famine. The <i>laissez faire</i> theory &mdash; governments should <Col N="1052" /> not become involved in the market system &mdash; was prevalent.  Yet the people did not have the purchasing power to replace the potato.  The people in Korea do not have the purchasing power to replace rice.</P>
    <P>As we commemorate the great tragedy of the Irish Famine and try to remember the sacrifice many people made for a number of decades, we should learn the lesson that there must be a way to support famines in the world today where no one should die for lack of food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>As 1997 comes to a close it is appropriate that we are discussing the famine which occurred 150 years ago.  There were famines between 1823 and 1847 in Ireland but it is only in recent years that literature relating to the hunger and deprivation at that time has come to the fore.  It is appropriate that the Minister is here to discuss this matter of concern to those who want to remember the effects of the Famine and to address the problems of famine throughout the world.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is visiting Grosse Isle in Canada in the near future.  Mr. Edward Brennan, a former Irish ambassador to Canada, noted that the great Famine was Ireland's holocaust which condemned the Irish to be the first boat people. Some 100,000 people left Ireland by boat to go to Canada, the United States and Australia.  The horrific stories about unmarked graves in Liverpool are testimony to the fact that these people left Ireland as a result of the Famine.</P>
      <P>When Senator Avril Doyle visited Australia, a series of lectures were given on the exodus of people from Ireland to Australia and what happened to them there.  The amount of literature on this subject is increasing.  One would not like to think about the stories of what happened on board the <i>Catalpa</i> and other ships which left these shores.  It was easy for many people to forget the Famine in Ireland because there was no literature on it, apart from historical papers kept by academics.  The publication of a book by Mrs. Cecil Woodham-Smith in 1962 was the first study of what happened to the people in Ireland.  This book was a big seller as it highlighted many horrific instances of hunger and disease.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Senator Avril Doyle said that disease caused as many deaths as starvation. Cholera was probably as big a killer as lack of food at that time.  There is no county or parish in Ireland which does not have unmarked graves or Famine graveyards.  However, it is difficult to find out who is buried in these graveyards as people were put in graves without any headstones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be said it is difficult to equate the Famine in Ireland 150 years ago with what is happening in North Korea today, but there are parallels. One could say that Great Britain's imperialism caused the starvation and the cholera epidemics from 1823 onwards.  Although there are no exact figures, approximately 1.5 million people died in the midst of plenty.  At least three or four ships a day left Ireland with food at a time <Col N="1053" /> when people were starving.  The people of Great Britain could not believe that there was famine in Ireland when food from Ireland was arriving daily into the markets of London, Liverpool and Manchester and the stores in Scotland.</P>
    <P>The Great Starvation, the Great Hunger or the Great Famine &mdash; which was it?  People died, and whether they died of starvation because of British imperialism or because of the scarcity of food is largely immaterial.  Frank O'Connor once observed that &ldquo;famine&rdquo; is a useful word when you do not wish to use the words &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; or &ldquo;extermination&rdquo;.  No doubt there was a certain element of genocide and extermination involved.</P>
    <P>Where are the parallels with what has happened in North Korea?  No doubt the regime in North Korea is at fault to a large degree because, having hidden itself away from modern society, it has caused the famine there.  Having said that, it is also a major natural tragedy.  There have been huge floods and natural disasters over the past few years.</P>
    <P>We must also look at what happened when the rigid Marxist/Communist regimes came into being.  Over eight million people died of starvation or were killed because they would not take up Stalin's offer of collective farming in Russia and over 30 million Chinese died between 1958 and 1964.  One might say that the death of 1.5 million in Ireland in the 1840s is not comparable with the eight million Russians and 30 million Chinese, but when one compares the size of the populations, the extent of the Famine in Ireland was greater proportionately.</P>
    <P>The North Korean authorities have monopolised the basic foodstuffs, such as rice.  They allowed the peasants to use and sell other foodstuffs, but the peasants were obliged to devote greater effort to the production of rice and when that crop failed the people could not sustain themselves.</P>
    <P>A problem arose when it was suggested that marginal land should be brought into production and the same mistake was made as has been made in Africa over many years.  When the original method of slash and burn farming was replaced by deep ploughing in North Korea, as in Africa, the soil was churned up, the roots of the trees and crops were taken out instead of being left in the ground and the land was eroded by the floods. This soil erosion is a partial contributor to much of the famine, deprivation and malnutrition in Africa and it has contributed to the situation in North Korea also.</P>
    <P>The fact that North Korea is a closed society has not helped and there are suspicions that the North Korean Government is trying to use the famine as a means of control.  It wants to deal in arms, but the people are starving and we must do something for them.</P>
    <P>There is enough food in south-east Asia to feed the people of North Korea.  It is suggested that there are at least 2.5 billion tonnes of rice in Japanese stores, but the authorities there are not prepared to give this rice to North Korea because <Col N="1054" /> it might sustain the regime.  As with other places around the world, in regard to Iraq, people say &ldquo;impose sanctions and they will hurt Saddam Hussein&rdquo;.  Sanctions will not hurt Saddam Hussein; they hurt the people of Iraq.  The same applies to the situation where people are dying in North Korea.</P>

      <P>Exactly.</P>
      <P>What can we do about it?  The Government has made great steps in the past few years, directly in helping out in countries where human tragedy occurs and, indirectly, in helping NGOs.  I sincerely hope that the fire brigade solution works and that we will continue to help.  I know the Minister will increase the level of aid to North Korea by as much as possible.  If there is to be sustainable development and hope that famine will not reoccur, fire brigade tactics alone are not sufficient.  For that reason I am glad of the visit of technical people to assess what can be done. Only long-term planning will alleviate the problems there and in other countries.</P>
      <P>The Irish people have responded generously to the needs of the people of North Korea and other areas of famine, perhaps because we remember subconsciously what happened in the 1840s.  The Irish Famine has been described as the greatest ecological disaster of the western world of the time; I suppose one could not deny that, but the people of Ireland contributed greatly to the development of North America, Australia and Great Britain following the unfortunate exodus thereafter.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending this useful debate at the end of 1997.  I know he will keep up the pressure to ensure the Government does what it can in areas of conflict where there is starvation.</P>

    <P>An rud is mó a chuireann ionadh ar dhaoine agus ormsa faoin nGorta Mór ná an ciúnas faoi i seanachas na tíre.  Ní luaitear an Gorta Mór fiú amháin i gcaint na ndaoine ach an drochshaol.  Cheapfá i slí amháin nach raibh cosmhuintir na tíre seo ábalta an rud a lua go díreach.  Tá sé éasca a thuiscint cén fáth gur mar sin a bhí sé.  Is é an fáth gur mar sin a bhí ná go ndeachaigh sé i bhfeidhm chomh láidir sin orthu nach rabhadar ábalta glacadh leis, ceangal leis nó dul i dteangbháil leis gan ach strac-fhéachaint a thabhairt air.  Tá sé <Col N="1055" /> suimiúil gur beag comóradh a bhí sa tír seo i 1947, céad bliain tar éis an Ghorta Mhóir.  Níl mé ag rá gur drochrud é sin.  Ní rabhas féin ach bliain amháin ar an saol ag an am sin.  B'fhéidir go raibh sé ró-chóngarach dúinn tar éis an Chogaidh Domhanda agus gur shocraigh daoine go mb'fhearr gan é a lua in aon chor in ionad a bheith ag caint faoi rud a d'osclódh piantaí agus mothucháin.</P>
    <P>Fiú amháin fós nílimid imithe ró-fhada ón nGorta Mór.  Bhí sean-athair liom féin ar an saol roimh an nGorta.  Bheimis thar nais roimh an Gorta le five generations.  Tá na mílte daoine sa tír seo a chuala a sean-athracha agus a seanmháthaireacha ag caint faoin nGorta, tá sé chomh cóngarach sin dúinn.  Sin an fáth, b'fhéidir, nach bhfuilimid ach anois sásta labhairt faoi agus an cheist a phlé go hiomlán.  Ceann de na rudaí is mó taobh amuigh de na rudaí atá luaite cheana ag cainteoirí eile anseo go gcaithimid snaoineamh gur chuir sé tús le meath na Gaeilge.  D'athraigh an Gorta Mór meon an phobail agus cheap cuid mhaith daoine gurb í an Ghaeilge ceann de na rudaí a bhí á gcoimead ar cúl.  Ar an ábhar sin thánig athrú ar dhearcadh na ndaoine.  Mar shampla, mo shean-mháthair i dTiobrad Árann ní raibh focal Gaeilge aici cé nach raibh focal Béarla ag a sean-mháthair siúd.  Tharla an t-athrú taobh istigh de dhá ghlún.  Ceann de na rudaí a tharla ná nach raibh aon chumarsáid idir an dá ghlún mar go raibh teanga amháin ag glún amháin acu agus nach raibh an teanga eile ag an nglún eile. Sin an fáth gur cailleadh a lán seanchais faoin nGorta Mór.</P>
    <P>Briseadh an leanúnachas agus an folk memory leis an nGorta Mór.  Chuaigh sé chomh dian sin i bhfeidhm orainn nach raibh daoine ábalta glacadh leis.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go gcuimhneomis air, ní chun locht a chur ar rialtas a bhí ann nó nach raibh ann 150 bliain ó shin, ach chun a bheith cinnte go dtuigimid cad a tharla agus go dtuigimid gur féidir lena leithéid tárlú arís.  Tá sé ag tárlú agus is beag nár thárla sé i dtuaisceart Korea le déanaí.  Tárlaíonn gorta ó am go ham timpeall an domhain.</P>
    <P>Is féidir ceachtanna a fhoghlaim ón rud a tharla sa tír seo chun a chinntiú nach dtarlóidh a leithéid arís.  Caithimid féachaint siar ach caithimid glacadh leis gur thárla sé 150 bliain ó shin.  Ní gan fáth a thárla gorta riamh.  Is féidir a rá gur le toil Dé a thárla sé ach ní Dia a dhein an cinneadh go gcaillfí na mílte nó na milliúin daoine le gorta nó leis na galair a tharlaíonn mar gheall ar ghorta. Thárla sé de dheasca polasaí talmhaíochta, polasaí sóisialta agus go mor-mhór polasaí eacnamaíochta.  Sin mar a bhí agus bí cinnte gur mar sin atá fós.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, famine is rarely, if ever, an accident.  It is sometimes caused by social policy or population policy but most often its is caused by economic policy or the lack thereof. The British Government's response to the Great Famine was as much driven by a nonsensical 19th century ideology of the free market as by a particular <Col N="1056" /> malice towards the Irish people.  Indifference to the Irish people was probably the chief fault on the British Government's part.  A rigid ideology which prevented its responding to and dealing with the Great Famine is the other major charge which could be made against that Government. One of the lessons we should learn from the Great Famine and the unhappy experience of the people of North Korea is to be wary of ideologies that are based not on reality but on assumptions of what is right.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to digress but the Common Agricultural Policy is an extraordinary contradiction of the general will of the world.  That policy and United States supports for farming were put in place because the security of food supplies is a major and profoundly emotive issue which goes beyond simple commerce.  Governments are always concerned about the security of food supplies which motivates them to either construct models such as the CAP, which are divorced from the realities of the free market, or leave an enormous latitude in the free market in the hope of stimulating production.  There seems to be a political belief that food shortages cannot be risked. For example, in the 1970s there was a shortage of pasta in Italy because of a change in government taxation policy.  Despite the fact that no one starved, the shortage became a major political issue due to the fact that it is never advisable to interfere with food supplies.</P>
    <P>If ideology did the damage in 1847 or resulted in damage being done following the onset of the potato famine, it is also true that the people of North Korea have been badly served by an extraordinary ideology.  I believe in free enterprise but it was somewhat simplistic of the Minister to suggest it could be the solution to the problems of North Korea.  The ideology and dictatorship which have gripped that country for many decades have played a major part in causing the current crisis.  There cannot be an intelligent response to famine in a country where no one can speak or publish freely and international agencies must be careful about the action they take.</P>
    <P>There is a lesson to be learned from North Korea.  However, it is not merely in that country that rigid ideology does enormous harm to large numbers of people.  To a degree famine is the absence of food rather than starvation.  In large areas of South America, Africa and some parts of Asia, the IMF and the World Bank have imposed an economic ideology which makes food available.  If one visits any of the major cities in South or Central America, one will see plenty of food.  However, the people are so impoverished that they cannot afford to feed themselves.  That is also an ideology, one which believes that certain things are necessary and worthwhile but which creates large scale malnutrition.  It may protect us from the spectacle of large numbers of hungry people in one place, but it does not protect large numbers of hungry people from serious malnutrition and the consequential damage to their health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> We must be wary of ideologies &mdash; one dominates for a while and then another takes over.  If they are not based on reality they produce misery. What is described as &ldquo;neoliberalism&rdquo; in Latin America is producing wonderful economic growth from an economist's perspective, but it is also producing profound inequality.  That inequality is not manifest as famine but as large scale malnutrition, very high infant mortality rates and the return of diseases such as tuberculosis, which can be eradicated.  As Senator Avril Doyle said, it is often the case that hunger is not the greatest cause of death in famine but the diseases which prevail because of malnutrition and which kill people long before hunger does.</P>
    <P>We are in danger of allowing that to happen as the IMF imposes its will on a greater part of the developing world.  There is no point in having plenty of food in society if the majority of people do not have the wherewithal to buy it.  The solution to the problem of food security is not simple. Neither model works to provide adequate food for the great majority.  We have discovered this in Europe and North America &mdash; one either ends up with food surpluses or food prices which make life difficult for large numbers of people.  A commodity as rudimentary as fish will become a luxury in the next ten years as it becomes increasingly scarce because of overfishing.  The problem is far more complex than looking back and blaming the British for what happened in 1847 or blaming Stalinism in North Korea, not that it deserves any excuses.  We operate other policies which, while they do not produce spectacular famine, produce great misery.</P>
    <P>Such phenomena do not happen by accident. Indeed, they are often deliberately willed.  There is one poor country which has done a remarkable job of feeding, educating and providing health care and basic shelter for its people, yet it is the main enemy of the richest country in the world.  I refer to Cuba.  One does not have to give unequivocal support to the political regime in Cuba to wonder how the world can worry about famine and starvation yet watch while the most powerful country in the world attempts to crush a country which has managed to tackle successfully famine, starvation and misery.</P>
    <P>It is always wrong to turn on peoples because one does not like their governments.  It is always wrong to make life miserable for the people of a country, particularly one which is accused of not being democratic and where the people have no choice, and to try to undermine food supplies and health care.  The US Government is trying to create famine in Cuba and we should say that is wrong.</P>
    <P>North Korea has a disgusting, obnoxious and corrupt Stalinist regime.  It is essentially a family which owns a country and claims it in the name of an ideology.  Until recently, South Korea was not a nice place.  It was a brutal dictatorship with large scale repression where students were massacred <Col N="1058" /> in the 1970s because they did not like their government.  It is turning out to be quite a corrupt country, which explains why many of its major conglomerates and banks are in serious financial trouble.  We should not busy ourselves with eulogies for what we call free enterprise, which turns out be an oligarchy in South America.</P>
    <P>I regretted the limited way in which the Minister expressed his concern about the export of missiles by North Korea to areas of high tension in the world.  He was right to mention it. However, he should have said that the export of arms to any country is a dubious practice fraught with profound moral questions.  More innocent people die every year as a result of wars fought with weapons exported from the rich West than will die in the West from drugs exported by poor countries.  Armaments are the single biggest killer of young people and children, far ahead of drugs. Governments of left and right in the developed West have been corrupted by the arms industry. It is impossible to have a moral arms industry. Ending the arms industry could release enormous resources.  No country should export arms, and any country which wishes to arm itself it should produce its own armaments.  There is no such thing as a moral arms trade, no more than there is a moral drugs trade.  It may make the West rich but it does others great damage.</P>
    <P>In examining the Great Famine or the famine in North Korea there are lessons to be learned. The first is to test an ideology against reality, and if it does not match up one should not be bound by it.  In particular, let us remember what the IMF has done to the former Soviet Union, which has a spiralling infant mortality rate, rapidly dropping life expectancy and increasing numbers of people who do not have enough to eat and have nowhere to live.</P>
    <P>Let us not talk ourselves into another ideological deadend.  We should believe in the principle that anybody in any society should have a guaranteed income sufficient to feed themselves.  Let us also accept that an ideologically driven external body, such as the IMF, should not be able to require a country to take apart the fabric of a basic health care system.  If we do not do these things we are simply creating an illusion of affluence, leaving millions of people in starvation.</P>
    <P>Let us also begin to engage with the biggest problem for the next century, the rapidly decaying environment.  It is not something from which we will be able to protect ourselves.  If we allow the environment to decay as it is at present, and will continue to do as countries such as China and India grow, the security of all will be threatened. Climate change will threaten food security everywhere. The Minister was right to say that famine does not happen by accident; it is caused.  We must begin to deal with basic human rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was privileged to attend a special mass of commemoration for the famine dead in <Col N="1059" /> the west, celebrated by his Grace the Archbishop of Tuam, the Right Reverend Dr. Neary, at the Basilica in Knock on 16 November.  I attended a talk by Mr. David Alton, who said:</P>
      <P>Famine took the land by the throat; the foul smelling breath of plague rose over the little patches of fields as the people's humble cabins became death-ridden hovels.  The rotting stems of potato stalks, the stench from decayed tubers were the foreshadowing of the stench of death which would shortly follow.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, November is a month for remembering the dead.  But the legend &ldquo;lest we forget&rdquo; engraved on so many memorials requires also a determination to understand: to understand how these horrors came about in the first place; and to understand their relevance in our own times.  The famine had no need of cenotaphs, every scattered stone had its story to tell.</P>
      <P>Indeed, every stone has its story to tell, especially in the west.</P>
      <P>To fully appreciate the devastation and to make comparisons with Korea, we must look at our country first.  Famine was a common feature of life in the 18th and 19th centuries.  During the 19th century there were famines in 1800, 1807, 1817, 1820-82, 1830-84, 1836, 1839, 1845-89, 1878-81 and again a number of times in the 1890s.</P>
      <P>Today, we are speaking of the Great Famine of 1845-89.  This should be called the Great Hunger or the Great Starvation.  It was Ireland's first holocaust, one we could not prevent.  The second holocaust is on its way and I hope we can prevent it.  The Great Starvation, as I prefer to call it, was one of the worst catastrophes of modern Irish history. It was caused by the failure of the potato through blight which came to Europe from North America.  The crisis was worse in Ireland than anywhere else because of the role of the potato in the Irish diet.  For one third of the population, it was the sole article of diet.  The poorest peasant rented a piece of land on which to grow potatoes, other crops were used to pay the rent and even at the height of the Famine, millions of pounds worth of food left Irish ports often passing ships bringing in the hated Indian corn which, known colloquially as Peel's brimstone, was distributed for relief.</P>
      <P>Even after 150 years, the Famine or the tragedy which began in late summer 1845 is one of the greatest human ecological disasters of the world. When the fungus had run its course at least 1.5 million, possibly as many as two million, Irish had died and another 1.5 million had emigrated.  No one can fully capture in words the magnitude or intensity of suffering and the hardship endured by the Irish people from 1845 to 1850.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very interesting to look at the figures. Speaking at St. Nathy's College in Ballaghaderreen at a conference reported on 21 July 1977 in <Col N="1060" /><i>The Irish Times</i> a former Senator, Dr. Joe Lee, spoke on the Great Famine between memory and history.  He addressed the question of famine death figures illustrating how these often reflected the political sympathies of historians. He began with John Mitchell's assertion in 1858 that 1.5 million had died, tracing the figures through to 1896 when a retired poor law official, Mr. W. T. O'Brien, put the figure at 300,000.</P>
    <P>A study by a Welsh geographer in the early 1960s put the figure at 800,000.  With the outbreak of the Northern troubles in the late 1960s, the Famine death figure was played down to 500,000 for fear of giving encouragement to the IRA. However, a study by a Dutch American Jew published in 1983 indicated that 1.1 million people had probably died.  It does not really matter &mdash; it sad people died at all.</P>
    <P>The British call it the Great Famine.  The scarcity of food was blamed on the weather, the potato fungus and perhaps most of all on the Malthusian notion of over-population.  The Irish had overbred and there was not enough food to feed them given the crop failure.  However, as Frank O'Connor once observed, famine is a useful word when you do not wish to used words like &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; and &ldquo;extermination&rdquo;.  The terms are philosophically embodied in what I call the Great Starvation, which is more a realistic way to refer to a time when Irish peasants starved in the midst of plenty.  Wheat, oats, barley, butter, eggs, beef and pork were exported from Ireland in large quantities during the so-called Famine.  In fact, eight ships left Ireland daily carrying many foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Robert Kee in his famous book <i>Ireland &mdash; A History</i> said that on 14 November 1848 the following produce was exported from Cork:</P>
    <P>147 bales of bacon</P>
    <P>120 casks and 135 barrels of pork</P>
    <P>5 casks of hams</P>
    <P>149 casks miscellaneous provisions</P>
    <P>1,996 sacks, and 950 barrels of oats</P>
    <P>300 bags of flour</P>
    <P>300 head of cattle</P>
    <P>239 sheep</P>
    <P>9,398 firkins of butter</P>
    <P>542 boxes of eggs</P>
    <P>He also gives figures which illustrate that during this period of starvation food was being exported from other ports such as Kilrush, Tralee, Limerick and elsewhere.  The figures speak for themselves; they are a sad reflect on the Government of the time.</P>
    <P>Dorothy Macardle in her book <i>The Republic</i> said:</P>
    <P>The famine was not a natural one.  There were excellent grain harvests that year in Ireland: there was enough grain in the country to keep the whole population supplied with food.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" />
      <i>The Times</i> of 26 June 1845 stated:</P>
    <P>The people have not enough to eat.  They are suffering a real though artificial famine.  Nature does her duty; the land is fruitful enough, nor can it be fairly said that man is wanting.  The Irishman is disposed to work; in fact man and nature together do produce abundantly.  The island is full and overflowing with human food. But something ever intervenes between the hungry mouth and the ample banquet.</P>
    <P>Something intervened all right and that something was simple.  Rents had to be paid.  The grain was claimed by the landlords in payment and the Government refused to close the ports.  In <i>The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps),</i> John Mitchell recorded the rage and despair when the people saw &ldquo;immense herds of cattle, sheep and hogs.  . . floating off on every tide, out of every one of our thirteen seaports, bound for England; and the landlords were receiving their rents and going to England to spend them; and many hundreds of poor people had laid down on the roadsides, for want of food&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The relief schemes which the Government instituted were largely ineffective, imposing hampering conditions and employing a great number of officials.  In four years over 700,000 people died of hunger and famine fever and more than 800,000 fled from Ireland in emigrant ships, &ldquo;coffin ships&rdquo; as they were called.  The Famine was added to by the terror of eviction.  Whole villages were being razed to the ground.  Speaking in the House of Lords on 23 March 1846, Lord John Russell said that more than &ldquo;50,000 families had, in one year, been &lsquo;turned out of their wretched dwellings without pity and without refuge&rsquo;.  We have made Ireland, I speak it deliberately &mdash; we have made it the most degraded and most miserable country in the world.  . All the world is crying shame upon us; but we are equally callous to our ignominy and to the results of our misgovernment&rdquo;. On 3 June 1879 referring to an official report on evictions, Sir Robert Peel said: &ldquo;I do not think the records of any country, civilised or barbarous, present material for such a picture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the three years following the end of the Famine vast numbers of men, women and children were evicted and a great number of them perished from exposure and disease.  The census of 1851 showed that in six years nearly two million of the population had disappeared.  The number of people in the country, including a Great British army of occupation, had fallen to 6.6 million. The census report submitted: &ldquo;In conclusion, we feel it would be gratifying to Your Excellency to find that, although the population has been diminished in so remarkable a manner by famine, disease and emigration and has since been decreasing, the results of the Irish census are, on the whole, satisfactory&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> In 1854, the <i>Quarterly Review,</i> stated:</P>
    <P>The cabins of the peasantry were pulled down in such numbers as to give the appearance, throughout whole regions of the South, and still more of the West, of a country devastated and desolated by the passage of a hostile army.</P>
    <P>A French writer, Monsieur Paul-Dubois, stated in <i>Contemporary Ireland</i> that Ireland had become, in English eyes</P>
    <P>. . a conquered country, from which nothing need be feared, from which nothing could be hoped; a country that was done for, that could never revive, and towards which the best policy to pursue was to draw from it as large a tribute as possible, of men for the army, and of money for the Empire.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps),</i> Mitchell wrote:</P>
    <P>The Almighty indeed sent the potato blight but the English created the famine.  . a million and a half men, women and children were carefully, prudently and peacefully slain by the English Government.  They died of hunger in the midst of abundance which their own hands created.</P>
    <P>Such sentiment expressed by such great an Irishman who witnessed these horrors must always linger and refute any revisionist attempts to obscure reality.</P>
    <P>We must learn a lesson and be wary of revisionism because it would appear revisionism is an attempt to undermine the basis of Irish nationalism and leave Ireland without heroes of historical memory.  It also plays down the British responsibility for the catastrophic aspects of Irish experience.  It was none other than William Makepeace Thackary who characterised British colonialism in Ireland as follows:</P>
    <P>It is a frightful document against ourselves.  . . one of the most melancholy stories in the whole world of insolence, rapine, brutal, endless slaughter and persecution on the part of the English master, ..  There is no crime ever invented by eastern or western barbarians, no torture or Roman persecution or Spanish Inquisition, no tyranny of Nero or Alva but can be matched in the history of England in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is time for us to stop being euphemistic about the Famine and to call it what it was.  It was a starvation based on systematic British exploitation of the people, inaction in the face of potato crop failure and a vindictive racist attitude towards us.  The events of 1845-50 were truly a holocaust.  In 1904, Michael Davitt, the founder of the Irish Land League, called it a holocaust. James Connolly said: &ldquo;The English administration of Ireland during the famine was a colossal crime against the human race&rdquo;.  The Minister <Col N="1063" /> referred to Grosse Ile.  It is worth remembering that in August 1989, Dr. Edward J. Brennan, Ireland's Ambassador to Canada, noted that &ldquo;The Great Famine was Ireland's holocaust (which) condemned the Irish to be the first boat people of modern Europe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We should never forget the terrible suffering which occurred between 1845 and 1850 and fix it indelibly on our personal collective consciousness. My family was desecrated by the Great Starvation; half of them emigrated and some died. Those who remained were extremely poor.  Fortunately, both branches of our family prospered, but we were not fully reintegrated until 1980, more than 100 years after the Great Starvation. The Famine is a very real memory, alive and well in my family.  We forgive but we never forget, because if we forget we fail to learn the lessons of history.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we are good people to empathise with the Koreans.  I know the Korean people well because I work with the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God who have a number of establishments in Korea.  They are like us in many respects and I hope it will not be too long before, like ourselves, they will be reunited.  Although the immediate crisis in Korea has passed, we are told the harvest this year is poor and without further aid nothing will happen.  I am delighted the Minister said we will offer aid.  It is good that, in the year of the Celtic tiger, we can send aid to others, but we must not forget our own poor people &mdash; the homeless, travellers and other disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>In times of plenty it is common for nations to become arrogant, selfish and self-centred.  In such times we must seek to nurture and protect the most vulnerable and helpless and to prevent a second holocaust here &mdash; in this case I refer to the holocaust of abortion, which is on our doorstep. The Minister used a phrase, the rough translation of which is, it is in the shelter of each others' lives that people live.  We should not forget that.</P>
    <P>In one of Daniel O'Connell's last speeches he said:</P>
    <P>Ireland is in your hands.  . she is in your power.  . If you do not save her she can't save herself.  And I solemnly call on you to recollect that I predict with the sincerest conviction that one quarter of her population will perish unless you come to her relief.</P>
    <P>Those words fell on deaf ears, but O'Connell's challenging words resonate down the pages of history, speaking prophetically to the indifferent and hardened hearts of our generation.  There is sufficient food in the world to feed the hungry. Ireland has sufficient food to feed its own people. Ireland has sufficient funds to feed, clothe and house its population and we should have enough to aid other nations.  If we do not remember our <Col N="1064" /> desperate past, we cannot possibly empathise with the future and the desperate present of other nations like the North Koreans.  I trust that our aid will be increased.  It is a regime of which I do not approve, and most other Senators have said likewise.  Remember, it is governments which control and make laws and regulations, not the poor, the destitute, the homeless or the hungry. We must strive to send aid to these people.  We have had one holocaust in this country, let us not have another one and let us try to prevent one happening somewhere else.</P>

Tá a fhios againn gur déanadh iarracht athscríobh a dhéanamh ar an stair ach, buíochas le Dia, bhí go leor daoine ann, idir scríbhneoirí agus gnáth-dhaoine, nár lig le daoine a theastaigh uathu athrú a dhéanamh ar ár stair dul chun cinn a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>I was delighted the Minister came to the Seanad and made a statement on the Great Irish Famine, especially in the context of the famine now raging in North Korea.  It is appropriate that this Minister came before us because he has a pre-eminent record in the area of human rights.</P>
      <P>In New York a law was recently enacted dictating that all schoolchildren would be taught about the Irish Famine and that it would be put in the same context as the Holocaust or any other acknowledged major world violations of human rights.  That is significant.  It is also significant and appropriate that the Canadian Government bowed to national and international pressure to ensure there would be a fitting memorial at Grosse Ile.  It was one of those occasions when the Irish diaspora, particularly in North America, supported by Irish people at home, worked in a united manner to ensure the memorial was established. The former Uachtarán na hÉireann, Mary Robinson, made a pilgrimage to Grosse Ile and spoke of the great tragedy of the Irish Famine. She said the greatest memorial we could erect to those who died, suffered and survived that tragic period would be to ensure that other people would not find themselves without friends at time of famine or deprivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that the Irish Famine traumatised our spirit up until now.  That is one of the reasons commemoration was so important: it enabled us as a people to relieve that trauma and <Col N="1065" /> to grieve for the great suffering of our ancestors at the time.  It is particularly sad that people would find it necessary to make an effort to revise Irish history.  We are all aware through local history and folk memory what the Great Famine was.  It happened not that long ago.  In fairness to those who suffered, it is vital we are authentic in any commemoration we have.  That is not to suggest there should be any lingering bitterness towards those who caused it.  At the same time, if we forget, there is always a grave danger we will allow the same to happen again, if not in our country, then in some other part of the world.</P>
    <P>One of the positive developments of the Irish Famine was that the Irish nation survived and that our people clawed their way out of the pit of depression in which they found themselves.  They spread to the four corners of the earth, and in their adopted homes they used their newly found opportunities not only for their development and enhancement but for that of the people with whom they now lived.  It is through that exodus from Ireland that we developed a huge Irish nation in exile.  Over 40 million people of Irish extraction live today in North America.  Tens of millions of people of Irish descent are to be found in Britain, Australia and other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Those of us lucky enough to travel abroad have discovered that Ireland has few enemies in the international fraternity.  There is little hostility towards us.  One of the main reasons is that we never colonised any other country.  We sent peacekeeping forces, missionaries, architects and many others abroad in the service of sharing.  For the same reason it is important that we do not forget our past when a situation arises such as that in North Korea.  We should not forget those who did not ignore us at such a time.  People came to our aid, irrespective of religion or political allegiance.  Perhaps they did not do so in great numbers; nevertheless, they helped us in those traumatic days.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly linked North Korea with the Irish Famine.  I accepted an invitation to visit both North and South Korea.  I found the people to be very cultured and dignified.  I saw many similarities with the early years of our development, particularly in agriculture.  Having met the people, one does not think of them as statistics but as fellow human beings.  When an opportunity arises we should not neglect them.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Trócaire was successful in raising £2.3 million for North Korea.  No other European country reached an equivalent figure. There are some improvements in the situation in North Korea.  The rice crop is being harvested, but there will be a shortfall of two million tonnes. This means that there will be a recurrence of the famine in the near future.</P>
    <P>New political alignments and movements exist today.  Many changes have taken place in the last ten years and it is conceivable that North Korea <Col N="1066" /> will wish to be a part of that new alignment in the near future.  It will find it difficult not to do so because its former colleagues will be a part of that alignment.  It is important that we give North Korea the opportunity to do likewise and treat it with generosity.</P>
    <P>I was greatly impressed by South Korea and found a spirit of reconciliation when reading the editorials in its English speaking newspapers. This was a spirit of seeking to bring about a harmonisation of the two parts of Korea.  I was pleased to read in last Sunday's newspapers that formal talks will begin in Geneva on 9 December involving North and South Korea, the United States and China.  These talks will attempt to negotiate a lasting agreement to replace the armistice which ended the Korean War of 1950-53.</P>
    <P>In such a context Ireland can play a vital role for the reasons I have enunciated.  We can be seen as an honest broker in any international development and not to be one-sided.  We come from an oppressed background; yet we are capable, not only of overcoming the difficulties involved, but of forgiving those responsible.  However, I wish to sound a note of warning.  I visited Moscow shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union and I was ashamed to see how deprived the people had become.  I was ashamed to see how a dignified people could be brought almost to their knees with no food.  No sensible, generous or logical person could suggest that it is in anyone's interest to bring to its knees a country which must be brought into the broader fraternity of nations.  It is vital that such countries are helped in the early transition period so that they can reach their full potential.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann invited two North Korean performing groups to Ireland for a number of weeks.  We believe that, through culture and diversity and the distinctive traditions of different nations, we can bring about a spirit of reconciliation.  I have always believed that dialogue is the great weapon of peace.  It is the only weapon we should consider when trying to normalise relations throughout the world.  In the dialogue we had with our North Korean friends we discovered a hunger and thirst for knowledge of the wider world.  We should use every opportunity to address this desire.</P>
    <P>It is easy to have an empty commemoration of the Famine.  However, as I travelled abroad and spoke to the Irish community, I realised that not only was the trauma of the Irish Famine still very much with our people, but they were also seeking ways of helping other countries.  It was evident from the Minister's statement that the Government has given much thought as to how to help solve problems in other parts of the world, particularly in North Korea.  There are difficulties and it would not be helpful to this debate or to the potential of the situation to ignore them.  Courage and independence of thought are very important <Col N="1067" /> at times such as this.  Ireland is well placed to demonstrate that courage and independence of thought.  I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, for ensuring that we had the opportunity to express heartfelt views on our own great tragedy of genocide and ensuring that the lessons we have learned will be used in a positive manner to help other countries, such as North Korea, when they find themselves in difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that this House has the opportunity to debate the Irish famine of 1845-47 and to draw comparisons with other famines, particularly that in North Korea.  There are famines all over the developing world, particularly in Africa, where millions of people are at risk of starvation.  Without taking from the seriousness of the problem in North Korea, there are larger famines in Africa.  However, they are no longer sexy issues for the media because they have dealt with them before.</P>
      <P>Famine stalks the land in Liberia which is emerging from a civil war.  There is little reportage of Somalia, which has virutally no Government and where anarchy almost exists.  There are no accurate figures for the annual rate of starvation in these countries.  Some African countries of relative prosperity suffer terrible local famines. Relatively developed countries such as Kenya and Malawi all suffer famine due to crop failure. Hundreds of people die of diseases related to malnourishment as a result of food shortages.</P>
      <P>We have matured enormously in this country. In 1945-47, the centenary of the Irish Famine, it was hardly mentioned because we had a certain inferiority complex about it.  Officially and at every other level it was decided to ignore that seminal event in our history.  As the Minister said, we have moved on in terms of history.  I am delighted that we can now look in a mature way at the Famine and its true causes.  We no longer view it with a sense of shame.</P>
      <P>Out of every bad event good events can follow. Something not often mentioned is the enormous influence the Irish post-Famine immigrants had in the United States, especially in developing the political culture of that country.  After the civil war in the United States a whole new political culture developed, as is the nature of any country going through a civil war.  The Irish, as one of the English speaking groups of immigrants arriving in droves in the United States, highly politicised by events at home, quickly filled the political vacuum there forming the Democratic Party.  The Irish became extremely strong and almost invented the political culture.  This is not acknowledged by historians but it is a fact proved by the influence of the Irish in Boston, Chicago and New York.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post-Famine immigrants had an enormous influence on political development for the <Col N="1068" /> reasons I have given.  If you came from Germany to the United States at the end of the 19th century you spoke German and that was a disadvantage. If you came from any other European country you did not have the same level of politicisation as the Irish.  One thing about us being part of the UK from 1800 onwards was that we participated in the political system.  I know the franchise was limited for the Irish as it was for everybody in the United Kingdom at that time but least we were part of one of the world's democracies, in so far as democracy existed in the 19th century.</P>
    <P>After the great Reform Bill of 1832 at least Irish MPs went to Westminster.  The Irish MPs in four of Gladstone's administrations in the 19th century held the balance of power.  That had an enormous impact on the politicisation of the Irish population.  They brought that knowledge of politics with them to the new world and made an enormous contribution to the political development of one of the greatest democracies.  Some people might disagree with me giving that plaudit to the United States but I believe it is true.</P>
    <P>Last year many people said the British should apologise to the Irish nation for the Famine.  I wonder about that.  Often historians ignore the fact that there were local famines in Britain at the same time.  The potato failure was a phenomenon which occurred in Wales and south east England at the same time.  The blight had not been seen on these islands until then.  There were no anti fungal sprays at that time to save the crop.  There were local famines in the south east of England, a prosperous part of that country nowadays, where there were small farming communities.  The landlord system in Britain was even more prevalent than it was here.  The response was the same. People died of starvation in Wales, Devon and Cornwall but it is not written about as the number of people who died would probably be in the hundreds. Sir Charles Trevelyn's response to events in Kent was the same.  He was the true <i>laissez faire</i> politician of his time.  <i>Laissez faire</i> was very much in vogue in developing economic theory at the time.  Governments felt if these things happened it was not the duty of Government to intervene where the economic system failed to the extent that food production failed and people starved.  Political thinking was not as developed as it is now.  Now we would find it abhorrent if the economic system failed and did not produce enough food.  Resources would have to be redistributed to ensure that nobody died of hunger.</P>
    <P>There is ambivalence about this.  The economic system in this part of the world would never cause a famine because of the complicated system we have developed over the years, the level of prosperity and the technology in the agricultural industry.  In the European Union we produce more food than we need.  A very large percentage of the population, myself included, is obese because of overeating.  But we live in the global <Col N="1069" /> village and in Africa and Korea, there are millions of people starving or at risk of starvation. The best we do is pay lip service.  The developed world donates enormous sums of money in assistance to these poor countries.  On the other side of the balance sheet, those poor countries pay back to the developed world in annual loan repayments greater amounts than they receive in annual transfers to them to deal with their development and food production problems.  We do not stand on very good moral ground.  While we would decry it if it happened in our part of the world, the response the developed world makes to these countries in not adequate by any means.  Everybody acknowledges the generosity of the Irish people to the developing world and to those countries that have problems that relate directly to their capacity to produce enough food to sustain their own populations, but remember Ireland's overseas development assistance is not yet even half of the United Nations target for overseas development assistance for a developed country.  This year we will reach 0.34 of one per cent whereas the target is 0.7 of one per cent.</P>

      <P>While in the current year we will be transferring a substantial sum of money to the Third World nevertheless the amount is about half of what we would be morally obliged to donate under a direction from the United Nations, the premier international organisation to which we subscribe and of which we proclaim ourselves to be a model member in every way.  We do not have a good reputation in terms of that target.</P>
      <P>At the time of the war which divided North Korea and South Korea in the early 1950s, Kim Ilsung, one of the last old-fashioned Stalinist tyrants who died some years ago, was ruler.  It was amazing that there was massive mourning for a man who kept his country in the stone age in so many areas.  The society was totally closed in the manner in which Albania was closed.  He has been succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-il.</P>
      <P>The international community must keep pressure on that country to bring about some better form of government.  The tragedy of North Korea should not have happened and it is directly related to bad Governments.  The country isolated itself from the rest of the world.  A country can be independent and sovereign, but its internal mechanisms of government must be related to its people and their needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to avail of this opportunity to make a statement to the House on the recently published annual report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMC.  I will address what this Government is doing about the problem but first, I want to give the House some information on the EMC, its role and functions.</P>
      <P>The centre was established by European Union regulation in 1994 with its headquarters in Lisbon. Its task is to provide objective, reliable and comparable information at European Union level concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences.  It gathers information on the demand for drugs and measures to reduce the demand; national and European community strategies and policies; international co-operation and the geopolitics of supply and the control of trade in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals.  It is also involved in aiming to reduce the number of people turning to drug misuse in the first instance through information, education and prevention programmes and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which must be a return to a drug-free lifestyle. Although this may not be a realistic goal in every instance, it must be a goal in the short term at least.</P>
      <P>A ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs was set up by the previous Government in 1996 and produced two reports. The first report, published in October 1996, identified a response to the heroin problem as a priority and its recommendations in relation to service provision were as follows: the speedy establishment of information databases by the health boards in order to establish the extent of addiction; health boards were to move to eliminate drug treatment waiting lists, with the Eastern Health Board waiting list to be eliminated in 1997; particular attention was to be paid to the needs of young misusers in priority areas, together with priority status for community employment applications offering integrated services for recovering addicts; and a series of education and prevention steps, including stronger truancy measures and anti-drug programmes for all primary schools in priority areas.  There was also to be an estate improvement programme for severely run-down urban housing estates and local authorities were to develop sports and recreation activities in priority areas within the national sports strategy framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, new structures were put in place involving the establishment of a Cabinet subcommittee on drugs, a national drugs strategy team and 13 local drugs task forces in areas where the hard drug problem was most acute.  Twelve of these are in Dublin and one is in north Cork city. A sum of £10 million was made available for the <Col N="1071" /> implementation of service development plans in the task force areas as well as £1 million for services in health boards outside Dublin and £3 million for estate improvements by local authorities.</P>
    <P>When this Government assumed office, it decided that the work already in progress should not only continue but be given a new impetus. The brief of the Cabinet sub-committee was therefore expanded to include social inclusion and local development in addition to drugs, as it is considered that the drugs problem is a manifestation of wider problems of economic and social deprivation that contribute to a sense of exclusion for some sectors of our society.  This is borne out by the Health Research Board's Report on Treated Drug Misuse for 1995 which outlined that of the 3,600 cases treated in the greater Dublin area, 63 per cent had left school at or before the official school leaving age of 15 years and 87 per cent were unemployed.</P>
    <P>The second ministerial task force report dealt with drugs other than heroin and found that the misuse of such drugs is a nationwide phenomenon, the misuse of ecstasy and cannabis being most common.  Its key recommendations were to establish a youth services development fund, with contributions from the Exchequer and the corporate sector, to develop youth services in the most disadvantaged areas.  It also recommended the development of a number of other initiatives aimed at meeting the needs of young people in disadvantaged areas where drug misuse is most prevalent.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children and other agencies continue with the implementation of the recommendations in the two ministerial task force reports.  I will now outline for the House the progress made in the development of treatment, prevention and education and other services.</P>
    <P>I will start with information and research.  All health boards are working on the establishment of information databases which will provide accurate and timely data on the subject of drug misuse.  Earlier this year, a meeting of all boards was held and health board representatives were briefed on developments at European level regarding the standardisation of data so that it can be comparable from one area to the next.  A working group is currently formulating these standards so that by 1998 all health boards will have comparable data.</P>
    <P>In the area of research, 26 research projects have been given a total of £1 million funding through Forbairt's science and technology against drugs initiative during 1997.  This was grant aided by Europe for this purpose.  A number of health boards have also undertaken research into the extent and nature of drug misuse.</P>
    <P>One of the areas I consider hugely important is addiction.  During 1997, the addiction studies course in Trinity College, which is funded by the <Col N="1072" /> Department of Health and Children, was given additional funding to double its input of students in the 1997-98 academic year.  The college is developing a Master's degree course in addiction studies.</P>
    <P>Let me focus for a few moments on treatment services for those already caught up in the drug scene.  All health boards have developed appropriate prevention and treatment facilities to respond to the drug problem in their respective areas.  The Eastern Health Board developed a comprehensive service plan for 1997 aimed at eliminating waiting lists for treatment by the end of the year and expanding all of its services, particularly rehabilitation services.  The board has commenced an emergency and assessment service in a number of its treatment centres.  Treatment services are being expanded throughout the board and the emphasis is on providing treatment to people in their own local area.</P>
    <P>The methadone prescription/dispensing scheme continues to be expanded, evaluated and regulated.  The total number of people on the central treatment list is 2,660, with approximately 70 GPs and 55 pharmacies involved in the scheme. A review group was established to examine the arrangements for the prescribing and dispensing of methadone.  Its recommendations are now being implemented and I am satisfied that the full implementation of these recommendations will help remedy the present unsatisfactory elements of the service.  By inappropriate elements I refer to inappropriate dispensing by certain GPs.  A small number of practices appear to be signing scripts for a fee.  I also believe that some pharmacies are dispensing far more than should be normal for their local areas.</P>
    <P>This morning, I met concerned groups in Dún Laoghaire.  There is a need to ensure that satellite centres are set up in the appropriate areas but attempts appear to be made to prevent this happening. If we are to have successful drug treatment programmes, drug treatment and satellite centres must be set up.  Each area must take its own share of the burden otherwise the drug treatment programme is undermined.  There seems to be an element of &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo; involved in this.</P>
    <P>Health boards must provide appropriate facilities; we cannot turn away from this problem.  It is estimated that there are 8,000 addicts in the Eastern Health Board area alone, but only 2,666 are on the voluntary register.  It may be necessary to make that register mandatory, as there should be notification of any occasion an addict obtains a prescription or receives methadone from a pharmacy. Addicts should be on a database and kept on the register.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed about drug treatment centres.  It is important that we have consultants in those centres.  Satellite centres can be used for those who have been stabilised by a medical and clinical course of methadone treatment. <Col N="1073" /> In the past, methadone distribution has not been regulated, and if there is no analysis while addicts receive methadone we are defeating the purpose of the programme.  People cannot use an illegal opiate, heroin, and then be given methadone to top up their addiction.  When methadone is prescribed and then resold the situation is even worse.  The State is then subsidising the consumption of drugs.</P>
    <P>Methadone is very dangerous if not used in the proper circumstances, and I intend to regulate this area in the coming months.  The Dublin City Coroner has expressed concerns at deaths that may have occurred from overdose of methadone rather than illegal opiates.  That is intolerable and cannot be allowed to continue.  Those who are genuinely interested in treatment should have a drug treatment programme available to them which may involve the dispensing of methadone in regulated and controlled circumstances.  If there are addicts on those programmes who subsequently fall back into addiction and the illegal consumption of heroin, then consultants and others running these programmes should have the freedom to decide whether those addicts should remain on those programmes or continue with their chaotic lifestyle of addiction.  We cannot allow methadone to be dispensed to people who are not serious about or genuinely involved in a drug rehabilitation programme but who are using that programme to top up their illegal opiate addiction with methadone provided by the State.</P>
    <P>This strategy has, however, been reasonably successful to date.  It will continue to succeed only with the consent and support of communities.  If people turn against the prospect of satellite centres or drug treatment centres in their area, that defeats the best interest of those communities. If an uncontrolled addiction situation continues and flourishes, it will undermine the fabric of that community and destroy individual lives.  I plead with communities where addiction is prevalent to recognise that a positive contribution can be made by facilitating the health authorities in providing satellite centres or drug treatment centres.  That is becoming more apparent to the task force and drug strategy team.  In the absence of proper, fully resourced and well equipped centres, we will not get a handle on this problem, and that is a major concern for me.  I appeal to local public representatives and community activists to ensure that the purpose of these schemes is not defeated by deferring the provision of satellite centres.  To do so would be to put the progress made so far at risk.</P>
    <P>People feel that more co-operation and more general practitioners are needed.  Those doctors would each deal with a small number of stabilised addicts for the provision and dispensing of methadone. We also need more pharmacies to co-operate. There is a need for every area of the health service to come together and deal with this situation <Col N="1074" /> in a way that will give confidence.  Recently some doctors and pharmacies have been reluctant to get involved because they feel they may be asked to take too many addicts on their books and that if addicts destabilise business problems will be caused.  The purpose of the strategy is that in a consultant based treatment centre situation, if addicts show signs of being less stabilised than when they came out of satellite centres or having their methadone dispensed from pharmacies, then they can be referred back to the drug treatment centre under the direct care of the consultant. A stabilised situation would then re-emerge. There is also the prospect of providing more detoxification places for those who require long term care.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the problems in this area.  We need the co-operation of more bodies than the health authorities, who are committed to putting a credible drug treatment programme in place for those who wish to break their addiction. We must recognise that a certain percentage of people will want to continue with their chaotic lifestyles.  They have chosen to continue and are not interested in rehabilitation at this time. However, we must make sure we have the resources available so that an addict who wants to break an addiction can be taken in by the system, assessed by consultants and put in a proper drug treatment programme.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that estimates of the total number of drug misusers would suggest that considerable further expansion of services is required in order that health services can adequately address the needs of drug misusers presenting for treatment.  The Eastern Health Board is providing a total of £2.2 million to voluntary and community organisations in 1997 to support the valuable work done in the area of drug misuse prevention, treatment and support for drug misusers and their families.  In addition, up to 30 community support workers will be employed by the board by the end of the year. Because of the importance of rehabilitation the board is ploughing in significant resources towards expanding the number of rehabilitation places available.  This development of further rehabilitation facilities for stabilised drug users will be a priority issue for me.</P>
    <P>There are ongoing education and prevention measures.  Resource materials for primary schools have been developed.  A programme has been successfully piloted with special emphasis on the delivery of the programme in schools in priority areas.  Health boards are providing a range of services including parenting programmes and modules for youth clubs and other agencies dealing with young people.  The Health Promotion Unit, in conjunction with the Cork Social and Health Education Project of the Southern Health Board, has developed a parenting programme on drugs and family communication.  The unit has also funded Community Awareness of Drugs, a voluntary <Col N="1075" /> organisation with offices in Dame Court, Dublin 2, to develop a &lsquo;Parenting for Prevention&rsquo; programme.  The unit's Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers Programme, which is being disseminated throughout the country, helps local communities to address the drugs problems in their locality.  The Eastern Health Board has appointed six education officers and four more will be in place by the end of the year, and the board launched an anti-heroin campaign in May.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the EMC report which I want to touch on before I finish.  I have dealt up to now with what is known as the demand reduction aspect of the drug problem. The EMC report deals with other aspects, such as strategies on supply reduction, the joint actions being taken by the EU and the overall international environment for co-operation.  In so far as supply reduction is concerned, a range of legislative measures has been put in place.  These include the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996; the introduction of legislation to give gardaí the powers necessary for effective action; the passing of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, which provides for periods of detention of up to seven days; the Disclosure of Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, which provides for more effective exchange of information between the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners; the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act, 1997, which provides more powers for gardaí to deal with drug abuse in dance halls and pubs; the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, which reduces the amount of time spent by gardaí on court related duties and the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, which has focused on remedies to deal with new life threatening menaces such as syringe attacks.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also working at EU level to improve co-operation among member states in responding to drugs issues.  In late 1996, Ireland ratified the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by reiterating to the House that the fight against drugs is one in which a number of Government Departments and State agencies have a role.  I have resolved to play my part in preventing the increase in drug abuse.  It is an essential part of my job that the health services continue to develop their role, particularly in the areas where the drug problem is most acute.  This must be matched by a commitment from all other agencies, both statutory and voluntary.  The Government must work with local communities to build up social and economic infrastructures where people are encouraged to turn from drug misuse as a way of coping with life.  It is at community level that real success can be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> Our primary defence against the misuse of all drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, is the educational system, both formal and non-formal, where young people can be equipped with the skills and knowledge to make informed decisions about the use of drugs in their lives.  The extent of drug misuse in Ireland, as identified in both the EMC and ESPAD reports, highlights the need to intensify our efforts both at prevention and treatment levels.  We have developed the foundations for appropriate responses to the drug problem and now we must continue to build on this with the aim of reducing the extent of drug misuse in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Minister came to the House to deal with this important issue and that he spoke about the regulation of dispensing methadone.  He also made an impassioned plea for co-operation between the community and the satellite centres dealing specifically with drug addiction.</P>
      <P>Drug addiction has always been associated with headlines, which reflects the nature of Irish society.  We have always ignored the fact that alcohol abuse, child sexual abuse, violence against women and other horrific crimes existed until we realised there was an endemic problem. We failed to nip these problems in the bud.  As a teacher, I have seen how young people are enslaved and ensnared by drugs at an early stage through substance abuse.  We have tried to eliminate Tipp-Ex and glue sniffing.  The public was not aware this would lead to more dangerous drug abuse.  I was not surprised by the statistics which are the focus of this debate &mdash; along with Britain, we have the highest instance of drug abuse.</P>
      <P>I accept there are areas of priority as regards disadvantage and social exclusion.  This issue was not given the emphasis it deserved until it concerned middle-class parents.  Priority areas have to be highlighted, but I am concerned that the merry-go-round of soft drugs associated with every village, town and city in the country will not be dealt with immediately.  I understand the need for resources and how difficult it is to deal with the problem.  However, funding should be distributed across the board.  While the priority areas are given priority, the other areas, if ignored through lack of finance, will become a problem.  I do not know how this will be arrested if it continues to happen, although I do not wish to be that pessimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a teacher, local representative and a former member of the Mid-Western Health Board, I know of the levels of drug abuse, which people were not aware of until recently, because parents do not want to believe their child is taking drugs. In retrospect, I know my daughter was smoking and drinking at an age I did not believe possible. I know about it now because she is mature, has explained to me what she did and laughed about <Col N="1077" /> it.  She is 28 years old.  The problems of drink and tobacco substances, which youngsters will always dabble with because they are exciting, have existed for years.  It is obvious that parents have not accepted that drug abuse affects their Johnny or Mary.  It is frightening that parents are the last to accept that their children have access to drugs.</P>
    <P>The problem is not just associated with second level students.  Children aged nine, ten, 11 and 12 are also affected.  I call on parents to understand the drugs issue.  Some parents attend parent-teacher meetings where the local drugs squad speak to them while others think it is an issue which does not concern them.</P>
    <P>The Minister highlighted the complexity of the issue.  I am concerned that media headlines often mask the underlying torment and problems associated with it.  I listened to &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; yesterday and heard the mother and mother-in-law of a 23 year old heroin addict whose two children were affected by her drug taking and physical suffering.  The girl received £10,000 from an insurance claim which she spent in six weeks.  This was frightening and made me realise what people will do for drugs.  A case like this does more to highlight the problem than books, reports and surveys, which do not filter through to concerned parents.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse does not only affect a person's health.  People can be arrested for possession and supply.  The additional problems of AIDS, robbery, theft and violence are all associated with drug misuse.  We cannot underestimate the costs to the individual or family in terms of suffering. In the past, responses to the problem of drug misuse, not just here but abroad, tended to concentrate on the reduction of supplies and to legislate for stricter enforcement measures.  To a large extent these measures were successful in limiting suffering and frustrating the efforts of organised suppliers of illicit drugs, but they can only be fully effective if operated in conjunction with policies covering the area of education, treatment and social occupational rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I want to look at the basic element, concentrating on education &mdash; the area with which I am most familiar &mdash; as a means of primary prevention.  It is not always politically correct to look at long-term solutions because people cry out for pragmatic solutions but, because I am a teacher, I believe the role of the school is of the utmost importance and cannot be overstated.  Schools have a multifaceted role. They must educate through structured programmes in which students may be helped to avoid experimenting with or misusing drugs to prepare them for life by enabling them to take charge of their own health, encourage them to recognise the benefits of a healthy and drug free lifestyle and protect them by limiting the availability of drugs in the school environment.</P>
    <P>It is important to collaborate with all other agencies to ensure there is a comprehensive structured <Col N="1078" /> approach towards evaluating the effectiveness of drug education programmes in our schools.  If we do not have an evaluation mechanism we will not know whether drug education programmes are benefiting those students.</P>
    <P>There must be a clear policy in respect of the management of students who have abused drugs. Recently, I read in a British publication, <i>The Times Education Supplement,</i> that research has shown the key debate for schools concerns the severe penalties approach versus the pastoral approach.  Traditionally, the model involving severe penalties was typical.  In other words, you just got rid of the students by expelling them or suspending them indefinitely.  It was not successful because it failed to discriminate between those who were experimenting and those who were serious abusers.  It is not sensible to exclude those who are most at risk and throw them onto the street.  Education presumes that young people can learn, change and improve.  We can benefit from that approach.</P>
    <P>It is vital that teaching drug related issues in schools should take place within the broader context of ongoing health education programmes.  I teach in the Presentation secondary school, an inner city establishment in Limerick.  For ten years it dealt with drugs education as part of an integrated health and social education programme, which proved to be very successful. Dealing with drugs misuse on a once off basis can have the effect of highlighting interest or sensationalising the topic.  Remember that we are dealing with students who are permanently exposed to sensational topics, including drink and sex.  That is not the way forward for them.</P>
    <P>In the past we felt that second level students were still young and tender so we tended to focus on third level.  Now, however, the emphasis must be on primary level, especially in high risk environments, as the Minister mentioned.  Such environments do not always necessarily mean disadvantaged areas.  Affluent areas are also high risk environments.  Of course, priority must be given to disadvantaged areas of social exclusion, but I am also concerned about affluent environments where young students may have ready access to money.  They can manipulate parents who may not wish to believe their children are at risk.</P>
    <P>Education on drugs must take place at three levels: at the final years of primary level when young people leave the sheltered environment of their first school, at second level young adolescents are most at risk when thrust into peer relationships possibly in different areas with new friends, and the level outside and beyond school which we must examine.</P>
    <P>In dealing with education on drugs, the health and education programme stresses the encouragement of recognising the benefits of a generally healthy and drug free lifestyle as well as giving students accurate information about the harmful effects of drugs on their health.  The Mid-Western <Col N="1079" /> Health Board looked at the idea of utilising the Limerick hurling team to emphasise that you can have fun and become a good role model to be emulated.  There were different reactions to that innovation.  Some people said they wanted tips not hurleys.  It was an effort by the health board to utilise a vibrant young hurling team to become a role model for students, thus telling them they could get their kicks from sport.  It was a gamble that paid off in the Mid Western Health Board's region, although some people criticised this use of resources when there were hospital waiting lists for cataract and hip replacement operations.</P>
    <P>From a teaching viewpoint, elements of prevention must take place within a caring school climate.  Co-operation between parents and school is an integral part of that.  The school structure facilitates this through the principal, the guidance counsellor, the home school liaison officer and pastoral care liaising with parents and parents' councils.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána's Drug Squad have been to the fore in making a major effort in the past when there was little or no emphasis on drugs.  They were able to gauge the need and could see the effects of fall out from drug abuse. In Limerick two retired gardaí, Garda Michael Murphy and Garda Michael Marrinan, came to schools to alert students to the drug problem.  In their Garda work they employed an early intervention policy with few arrests, keeping Limerick city drug free for many years.  Their work was continued and followed up by Detective Garda Oliver Stapleton who has 16 years' experience. Not alone does he work in an official capacity by giving talks to students of all ages as well as parents and community groups, he also devotes his free time to doing similar work.  There is a massive positive mood on the part of such professionals to come together and give of their expertise for the benefit of students and parents. We should be looking more closely at this integrated approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the work of the Eastern Health Board which is similar to that of the Mid-Western Health Board whose committee on drugs misuse is headed by Mr. Brian Neeson, the health promotion officer.  He heads an integrated team including representatives of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, the health board, the Limerick youth service, health board GPs, a pharmacist, a garda and a member of the clergy.  That is the way forward because it links many strands.  Counselling services are available with plans for three extra addiction counsellors. The resources the Minister spoke of should be provided for established organisations and committees which have expertise, so that it is not a case of reinventing the wheel but helping people to work with what already exists.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago the then Department of Health produced an adult education video <Col N="1080" /> entitled &ldquo;My Best Friend&rdquo; which is used in all second level schools.  It was nominated for a prestigious international video award.  Another film, &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo;, which the Minister mentioned, is used by about 80 per cent of second level schools.  It places emphasis on students taking charge of their own health by making conscious and informed decisions about the use of drugs, both legal and illegal, in their lives.</P>
    <P>The National Parents Council's post primary section and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board have also produced information leaflets and television advertisements have been broadcast. Each group seems to be working extremely hard, but the problem is so immense that it has galloped ahead of all remedial efforts to control it.  That does not mean, however, that one shies away from it and admits it has gone beyond our intervention.  It definitely deserves an enormous commitment, a community/statutory body and an integrated approach whereby citizens would recognise drug misuse as their problem because it affects society.  While an individual or family may not be personally involved, they can recognise drug related problems including vicious attacks on the elderly and loutish behaviour on our streets.  They can also recognise the fact that families can be riven by the enormous problem of having an addicted member.</P>
    <P>We all know the harrowing effects of drug abuse, from the very soft ones through to heroin which is the biggest killer of all.  Education is the key to tackling the drugs problem.  However, remedial action must also be taken in the short term.  An integrated approach between agencies and services is the key component in the battle against drugs.  This would create awareness among parents and young people about who they should approach if a problem arises.</P>
    <P>The aim of our agencies is to prevent drug abuse and to support young people and families at risk.  It is not intended to be punitive.  Parents and young people can find a sympathetic ear if they approach key personnel in schools, the Garda Síochána and the health boards.  The extraordinary economic boom has a positive effect on our society, but it would be shocking if we forgot about its dark, bleak side.  We must use our resources, including moneys provided in the budget on 3 December, to solve this problem. Everyone, including health boards and community groups, must help to promote the millennium as a time when young people can live fulfilled lives without the spectre of drug abuse.  That is our challenge in the remaining years of this decade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chuir roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach seo chun fadhb na ndrugaí a phlé.  I do not understand why reports are not written in simple language.  It would take a day to read this report and to understand the information in it.  I appeal to those writing reports <Col N="1081" /> to make them more simple so that people can read and understand them.</P>
      <P>We think drugs are new, but every generation had problems with them.  At the end of the last century and the early part of this century poitín and shebeen houses were a terrible scourge.  In an effort to come to grips with the problem, many rural villages built temperance halls and Governments brought in rules and regulations to control the sale of alcohol.  Ireland was relatively free from alcohol abuse in the 1940s and 1950s, perhaps because of a lack of money after the war. The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was also set up and it did a lot to encourage young people to join.  People took the pledge at their Confirmation to stay off alcohol until they were 21 years of age and many kept that pledge for life.</P>
      <P>I remember when the Astoria dance hall was built in Bundoran.  If a person was not properly dressed in a suit or had drink taken, they were not allowed in.  However, those standards no longer exist.  People go to dances now in their old clothes.  When our standards and morals disappear, people's lives disintegrate.  We should try to maintain high standards rather than dropping to the lowest common denominator.</P>
      <P>Liberalism is to blame for our drug problems. I welcome the Minister's statement that he will do all he can to prevent an increase in drug abuse. This problem is like Frankenstein in that it has got out of control.  All we can do is try to control it.</P>
      <P>I was a member of a health board for 22 years. I remember at one of the first meetings we had a discussion with a lady who had come back to work in Ireland.  She told us we would need to be careful because drug manufacturers on the Continent and in England, where she had worked, were targeting Ireland as a bonanza.  We have created a drugs culture.  We believe a doctor is no good unless he prescribes a bottle of pills for every ailment. However, many doctors now agree that advertised medicines, such as vitamins, are no good; yet people continue to buy them.</P>
      <P>This report refers to legal and semi-legal drugs. It states that a mixed bag of drugs, which are used as medicines, are not controlled under drug laws but are nevertheless used as intoxicants, such as inhalers.  These are as big a problem as illegal drugs.  How will we rid the market of such drugs?  Many people have died from sniffing glue.  We should try to come to grips with this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that new laws relating to dance halls and discos will be introduced.  I have said for years that plainclothes gardaí should be allowed to attend a disco or dance where drugs are being sold.  If people are caught, they should be charged and the owner's licence revoked for one year for a first offence, five years for a second offence and then confiscated for a third offence. That is the only way to tackle this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> It is easy to say we do not have enough social and recreational facilities.  We spend a lot of money on recreational centres.  There are green spaces in every town where children play and horses graze.  People lie in front of the television to the early hours of the morning and then get up at 1 p.m. I do not accept that such people should not be made to work.</P>
    <P>I have said on many occasions that the Government should bring in a system where everyone who leaves school at 15 or 16 years of age is sent to an institution, such as a boarding school, where they can be educated.  There is no point saying to children who do not go to school that their parents, who probably did not go to school either, will be prosecuted.  We must take them out of such an environment if we want to change our society.</P>
    <P>One would not put a person who had an operation out in the open air.  One would put him or her in a sterilised unit where he or she can be treated until he or she was strong enough to go out in the air.  These people have problems and we will not solve them until we put an end to truancy.  One must remember that truancy was under control when we were going to school and schools were smaller.  The percentage of people who cannot read or write is huge despite the millions of pounds that have been spent on education.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse has become a huge industry and that is part of the problem.  It is an industry for the people who grow the weed and for those who produce solvents and glues.  It is an industry for the criminals and for all the people involved in security, the legal and medical professions, the paramedics, etc., so if it ceased in the morning, there would be thousands of people out of work. It will not be dealt with overnight so we must act carefully.</P>
    <P>The first way to tackle the problem is through education, but we will not be able to educate children who are running around in a drug polluted environment by telling them that they must go to school, because they will not go.  We must develop a system which takes those people out of that environment to a sort of boarding school in which they could receive training and controlled recreation.  They could probably become good sportspeople.  They might even become Formula One drivers.  They need a place where they can get an opportunity to use their energies and talents. These teenagers are not stupid.  Any 12 year old who can start a car in five seconds has plenty of grey matter, but it is not being channelled in the right way.  That is why I say that they must be put in an environment which will challenge their ability and energy.  That is one way of coming to grips with the drug problem.</P>
    <P>There is a problem within the community. Community care is a great notion which has been bandied about over the past 15 years, but the community does not want care because people <Col N="1083" /> are not willing to realise that a percentage of drug users can benefit from satellite centres &mdash; the local community centres or parish hall, as it was in my day &mdash; and I would appeal to the community to support these centres.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees the community must have drug treatment centres, proper caravan sites for travellers, cemeteries and dumps; but if one sets about providing these services anywhere in Ireland, all of a sudden the designated area will have archaeological significance, beautiful rivers, fish life and huge potential &mdash; of which we had never heard &mdash; precluding such development. However, nothing seems to be developed when these services are not assigned to these areas. Nobody wants to face the reality.  If community services are to be provided, we must educate the community to accept the need for them.  Otherwise, they cannot be provided.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe the forerunner to all drug abuse is the abuse of alcohol and glue, both of which are legally available, and we must come to grips with that fact.  My friend was very active in the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and we ran an annual pioneer dance.  With the advent of the liberal agenda, some said we would have to allow pioneers and friends to attend.  When the dances ceased, my friend said to me, &ldquo;We started with pioneers, then it was pioneers and friends and now we have neither pioneers nor friends&rdquo;, and that is what happened.  We dropped to the lowest common denominator to facilitate those who did not want to live up to our standards.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the system of education, because the points system is designed towards failure.  A child reaches a standard which is probably higher than that attained by his or her teacher; but when he or she does not get the desired number of points we say that he or she failed, but that is not the case.  The boy or girl reached a far higher standard of education than that which the teacher reached when he or she left college because the standard was not nearly as high then.  We must create a system of education which encourages people to be successful.</P>
    <P>A large percentage of road accidents are caused by prescribed medication, which has the same effect as alcohol.  We must realise there is a culture of legal and illegal drugs, but we must first work on the abuse of prescribed drugs which we can control.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that unemployment and social exclusion &mdash; two phrases which are often bandied about &mdash; are to blame for the drug problem; but it is ridiculous that a person must be a certain age or a year out of work before he or she can avail of FÁS and other schemes and that one cannot participate a second year.  There should be a system in which every school-leaver must work in State employment.  If they only cleaned a stretch of road each day, that would be enough.  They would be out in the morning at 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. <Col N="1084" /> and, if they only breast-fed a shovel, as the comedian used say, it would help create a work ethic. They could not be out until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. creating havoc, keeping neighbours awake, dealing in drugs or getting drunk.  That system might cost money but it would be worthwhile.  It would be work instead of welfare and, as the Gospel states, we must earn our bread with the sweat of our brow.  The present system demoralises society.</P>
    <P>To come to grips with drugs we must try to create an environment in which people are taught to work.  People of my generation were expected to earn a couple of pennies from about the age of ten by minding cattle for a neighbour or weeding a street on a Saturday.  If a person did not earn money, he had no pocket money.  It was as simple as that.</P>
    <P>We should create a system where, depending on their standard of education, young people are encouraged to work or enter training schemes and FÁS courses from an early age.  We are approaching the stage when there will be no tradesmen left in Ireland.  If we do not create a work ethic and ensure that people are trained according to their abilities, we will go down a slippery slope and be unable to put a stop to the drug problem.</P>
    <P>Great value has been placed on youth services. The people involved in providing such services are doing a great job.  If the voluntary organisations for which they work were not in existence, I have no doubt that the drug problem would be much worse.  However, many of those organisations have the same opinions as me.  We should take youth leaders into our confidence and enter discussions with them.  We must adopt the old maxim &ldquo;prevention is better than cure&rdquo;, because if the money spent on fighting drug abuse was spent on our health service it would be the best in the world.</P>
    <P>It was reported on radio earlier in the week that a drug addict gave birth to two children who are both dependent on drugs.  The health board has now refused to allow her to have her children because she is a drug addict.  We must come to grips with the awful problems that exist.  We will not do so by using fancy, flowery reports of the kind under discussion which must have cost thousands of pounds to produce.  The simple answer is to create jobs and place young offenders in an environment where their full potential can be targeted in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this report and the debate to which it has given rise in both Houses.  Its findings hold up a mirror to the dark, ugly underbelly of the Celtic tiger.  If nothing else emerges, I hope that the report, shocking as it is in its findings, will propel us into a higher level of action.  It should encourage us to intensify our efforts to reduce the supply and demand for drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> Having said that, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt.  It is good that he has come to hear the solid words of wisdom uttered by Senator Farrell and the fine contribution made by Senator Jackman.  I acknowledge the earlier appearance of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.  It is an indication of the importance he attaches to this issue that he saw fit to commence the debate.  That gives some grounds for optimism as we confront the shocking findings in this report.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that in recent years Governments have put in place tough legislation to deal with the supply of illegal drugs.  There is evidence to suggest that legislation is now being more strenuously and rigidly enforced &mdash; a welcome development. However, despite the best efforts of those charged with making drug seizures and preventing the availability of drugs, the findings of this report confirm that Ireland is top of the league in respect of the availability of drugs.  Of the 24 countries surveyed recently, it emerged that harmful drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy and heroin are most freely available in Ireland.  Of the young people surveyed, 61 per cent stated that cannabis is easily available, 51 per cent stated that ecstasy is easily available and a shocking 20 per cent stated that heroin is easily available.  That is the current state of play in respect of the availability of drugs in Ireland despite enhanced efforts to come to terms with their importation and distribution.</P>
    <P>The evidence to which I referred must compel us towards greater activity in terms of cutting off the supply of drugs.  It confirms our suspicions, based on experience, that this country is awash with illegal drugs.  At certain educational establishments, second and third level, drugs are freely available on campus.  That must provide grounds for increased activity.  I pay tribute to the Garda Síochána for its recent success, to customs officials for the co-operation which now exists between them and the gardaí and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  However, despite their efforts, the figures to which I referred illustrate the current state of play.  There is no room for complacency.</P>
    <P>Returning to the report, I am infinitely disturbed by the attitude of young Irish people to drugs.  There appears to be a lack of real understanding of the implications of substance abuse among large numbers of teenagers.  For that reason Irish teenagers are singularly vulnerable. Of those surveyed, when compared to their European counterparts 63 per cent fewer Irish teenagers see heavy drinking as a serious risk, 32 per cent fewer see cannabis as a serious risk and 5 per cent fewer see cocaine, crack or ecstasy as serious risks.  That is truly shocking and it raises questions about the way we approach this issue through our education system.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Senators Jackman and Farrell placed heavy emphasis on education because that <Col N="1086" /> is the thrust of my contribution.  Experience confirms that other countries which are successfully confronting the drugs problem are using their education systems as a primary weapon in the battle against drugs.  It is a proven fact that young people who are self-confident and have a sense of self worth and purpose in life are less likely to drift into drug abuse.  They may experiment with drugs but it is a long way from experimentation to addiction.  Such people may experiment and decide that drugs are not for them.  It is the children who drift into drug abuse about whom I am most concerned.</P>
    <P>Schools in other countries work hard to instil in their charges the qualities to which I just referred.  By so doing they are directly and indirectly tackling the drug problem.  In the formal education received at school and that received at home, in the community and through the media, there should be a stronger emphasis on the prevention and early detection of drug use. Prevention is the key.  A self-respecting generation of adults cannot allow its young people to drift aimlessly into addiction and a lifetime of drug taking, with all the implications for their health, their job prospects or any prospect of happiness to which they ought to be entitled.  That cannot be allowed to happen easily.  Are we to some degree complacent in our attitudes to drinking, for example?  Our attitude to drink is telling about the climate which breeds a culture tending toward substance abuse.</P>
    <P>We have a fairly accurate picture of the young people who are most at risk.  They are to be found mainly, although not solely, in areas of deep social deprivation and in dysfunctional families.  It stands to reason that well designed, multi-agency programmes targeted to root out social and economic deprivation will yield positive results.  That is what Senator Farrell had in mind when he spoke of the provision of work for young people. Young people should not be allowed to go from school directly onto the dole.  Young people should have the option of further training or the prospect of a job.  It is difficult to overstate the hopelessness that besets the young people who leave school with no prospect but to draw the dole.  That is a poor offering to young people.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell is right to emphasise the importance of work in the community for the long-term unemployed which would allow young people to grow up in an atmosphere where there is a work ethic, where they can see the adults in the community going to work and get a sense of work being an essential part of healthy living.</P>
    <P>While legislation is essential, it will not solve the problem alone.  We must use well designed and well monitored programmes in areas of high long-term unemployment and high social and economic deprivation.  Such an approach would yield results.</P>
    <P>We know from experience that a good educational experience is a great protection against <Col N="1087" /> drug abuse.  The young people who achieve at school and in its related activities are least likely to be caught up in a lifetime of addiction.  It follows that young people who drop out of school early or who attend infrequently are already putting themselves at risk.  A programme aimed at preventing drug use must first target those with a high level of absenteeism from school and those who drop out early.  A shocking report was made available last week about high levels of absenteeism from school in certain parts of Dublin city.  I was pleased to read in the newspaper this morning that the Minister for Education and Science has promised urgent, modern, effective and enforceable legislation on truancy so that young people will attend school until at least the age of 16 as required by law.</P>
    <P>We should honour the provision in our Constitution to cherish all the nation's children equally. There is something wrong in the schools, the homes or in the community when young people do not want to go to school, particularly primary school.  Primary schools which function well are pleasant, creative and challenging places for young people.  It is often the schools which are the safest places for young people.  As a former second level teacher, I acknowledge that there is a great amount of pressure at that level. However, primary schools are pleasant and good places of learning when they are organised properly and the programmes are delivered properly. It is not enough to put legislation in place which will require young people to go to school.  They should go to school because they benefit from the experience.</P>
    <P>The best approach is put in place a sufficiency of home school liaison teachers who will help to create the conditions in which parents will encourage their children to go to school because they will benefit from their children's attendance. This will encourage the parents to become actively involved in and supportive of their children's education at primary level.  That is the key to many other benefits which could flow from that measure.  Where there is a good home school liaison scheme in place it enhances greatly school attendance and performance there.  More than anything else we need specially trained teachers who can relate fully to the parents and actively link the parents to their children's education.</P>
    <P>It is a sad fact that in many cases the problems start with the parents.  If parents are to become part of the solution they cannot continue to be part of the problem.  This is the key if we are to reach young vulnerable people in areas of high absenteeism.</P>
    <P>All parents need to be alert to the early warning signs of drugs.  There is nothing as devastating as the anguish of parents who find out for the first time that a child is into drugs and, for one reason or another, they have not detected it.  Their anguish can be acute.  There are easily identifiable <Col N="1088" /> symptoms and parents need to be alert to have warning well in advance when their children are drifting in the direction of addiction.  There is an overwhelming need to link parents into drug prevention programmes.</P>
    <P>In areas where there is a high level of absenteeism it is not enough to put in place a good home school liaison scheme.  The schools need an injection of specialist staff &mdash; more remedial teachers, a more up to date psychological service and a good counselling service.  Investment at that level would pay high dividends and would avert a lot of the money being spent on young people who have done irreversible damage to themselves, their families and their communities.  Such an approach would pay dividends because we would be taking early preventative action.  Investment at that level would pay huge dividends in the long run because we would be acting early enough and on the basis of prevention.  I will speak to the Minister for Education and Science about this issue when an opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the increasing number of young people being expelled from school.  We must confront this issue, because once a child is expelled from school their life drifts into chaos in no time and they are vulnerable to problems, including drug taking.  I am also concerned about teenage drinking.  The prevalence of teenage drinking creates a culture into which drug abuse slips.  Very often teenage drinking is the first step on the road to hard drugs.  We must seriously tackle the problem of teenage drinking.  There is a law but it is not enforced.  Gardaí have told me it is not enforceable because we do not have a national ID system.  Why do we not have a national ID system if we are serious about tackling this problem?  If I was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and found young people being served alcohol night after night on a premises, I would close it for a couple of days or a week.  That would have sufficient economic consequences to bring the pub owners and their staff to their senses.  We need not put them out of business, but we should give them a shock.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that we do not have proper modern juvenile justice legislation.  We still operate under juvenile justice legislation enacted in 1908, before the foundation of the State, despite the fact that almost eight years ago a Select Committee, of the other House of which I was Chairman, prepared a comprehensive report outlining the need for modern juvenile legislation.  That report has not been acted on and we await modern juvenile justice legislation.</P>
    <P>The Rainbow Government addressed itself to the issue but did not introduce a Bill.  How can we expect young people to grow up as responsible young citizens if we do not put in place a proper legislative framework under which they may grow and develop?  It is a scandal that we have not introduced legislation.  I urge this Government to introduce modern juvenile justice legislation <Col N="1089" /> without delay so that at least we may be able to put in place a legislative programme and create a healthy culture in which our children may grow up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with Senator Quill's remarks on health education, school attendance, the criminal justice system and the fact we do not have juvenile justice legislation. Much work was done by the previous Administration and the Select Committee which was established in drawing up proposals.  Unfortunately, legislation has not been brought before the House and we must work with an outdated Act from 1908.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the annual report of the European Union Monitoring Services.  It is ironic that we are debating this report after one of the largest hauls of cannabis &mdash; £3 million worth &mdash; involving much painstaking Garda activity.  Two of those arrested and charged were allowed to go free as a result of a mix up in legislative procedures and responsibilities.  Ludicrously, their passports were returned to them and they have fled the country, which anybody in their right mind would have expected, and are not available to be recharged. It is unacceptable that this process was stymied by a foul-up which should not have happened, considering the seriousness of the issue.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the European Union Drugs Monitoring Centre in Lisbon in 1994 was a valuable development and we are participants through the Health Research Board.  This is the second report we have debated concerning findings on the drug problem, drug and alcohol addiction and drugs such as cannabis, Ecstasy, amphetamines, heroin, cocaine and so on.  It is valuable that we look at this report because we must deal with a number of aspects of it, the most important being the question of drug supply.  There must be co-operation between the various agencies here and on mainland Europe.  All drugs, including cannabis, heroin and Ecstasy, are imported into Ireland as no sector of the community is involved in producing drugs, apart from cannabis which is produced on very small scale.  It is extremely important that we maintain good relations with Europol and with other EU member states so that we can monitor the movement of drugs through other countries and prevent them reaching Ireland.  From that point of view, it is important we look at this problem in a global context.</P>
      <P>There has been an increase in the level of drug abuse in virtually every European country.  The use of cannabis and various amphetamines is on the increase.  Heroin use comprises a small part only of drug use.  Nevertheless, heroin is a serious problem and results in much misery and crime and impacts far beyond the numbers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only good news in the report is that there seems to be a slight decrease in HIV infection in <Col N="1090" /> the EU.  That is due to a greater awareness of the spread of infection through sharing needles, which was a major problem in this country.  Heroin use was almost a social gregarious thing in the capital city.</P>
    <P>A number of other serious matters have been revealed as a result of recent surveys.  The European school survey on alcohol and other drugs found that of the 2,000 surveyed, Ireland was found to have the highest level of drug abuse of 16 year olds in year.  Our young teenage population is more prone to drug abuse, including alcohol and other drugs.  The findings showed that cannabis and alcohol were used, as well as Ecstasy and a small amount of heroin.  It is alarming that this most recent report has shown us to be top of the list in the EU in terms of being prone to drug abuse.  The mean age at which youngsters became involved in drugs is lower than that in most other countries.</P>
    <P>An OECD report published this month shows that Ireland is almost bottom of the list in terms of literacy and that we have a serious problem in this regard.  Some 25 per cent of the adult population or 200,000 people, experience literacy problems.  Recent surveys conducted in Clondalkin and Ballyfermot which were in the news indicate there is a serious school attendance problem in deprived areas.  The health research board of the European Monitoring Centre for drugs produced startling figures in 1994 to the effect that, of those abusing heroin, 63 per cent left school before the age of 15 and 87 per cent were unemployed. Statistics paint a picture of Ireland having a large youth population a proportion of which leaves school at an early age, is exposed to drugs and becomes addicted, and that this is associated with lack of employment opportunities.  They also show a serious literacy problem which has not been addressed.  While the Celtic tiger benefits those at the top and middle of the pyramid, there is a subclass of people who have no access to the benefits of the booming economy and that must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with children getting into trouble and some say it is their fault or that of their parents.  However, it should be remembered that every crime committed to feed a heroin habit has an impact on the wider community.  While the abuse may take place in disadvantaged areas, it has an impact on the wider community in terms of people's homes being burgled, handbags being snatched, various forms of larceny, increased police presence, extra prison spaces, more drugs rehabilitation centres, etc.  It has a ripple effect on the community and the taxpayer picks up the tab in the end.  I am concerned about young Irish people whose lives are being destroyed by these drugs.  We do not seem to be able to get our act together to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in the past 12 months in dealing with the drugs barons, more or less since the death of Veronica Guerin. <Col N="1091" /> It was only then that pressure was put on the authorities to introduce tough measures for policing and detecting and a comprehensive form of treatment.  The task force on drugs also produced its report and £10 million has been allocated towards that.  Some £20 million has been allocated to youth service development, especially in the area of education and programmes to deal with children at risk.  Significant gaps still exist in the operation of the service at almost every level.  It was shown they exist at the policing level, for example, when two people charged with possession of £3 million of cannabis were released on a technicality because of messy administrative procedures which were not properly adhered to. That must not happen.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the product of the finest legislation we have introduced in terms of dealing with the problem.  It has had significant success to the extent that most of the major criminals now operate from the Continent rather than from Ireland.  They have been pushed out and are afraid to return.  However, I am worried they are beginning to regroup, establish new outlets and recruit new personnel for dealing in drugs here. They are beginning to recover from the onslaught against them in the previous 12 months and are putting together a new operation, which is dangerous.  The increasing quantities of drugs seized is testimony to that.  It is clear that access for the purposes of supply is being maintained and expanded.</P>
    <P>I would like if the assets of drug pushers seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau were put in a special fund to be used exclusively for dealing with the victims of drug abuse.  The community would then see that those who create such misery would pay for it by having the proceeds of their crimes ploughed back into the community to its benefit.  We need that type of symbolism to help us believe that criminals are not benefiting from the proceeds of their criminal activity but are suffering by having their assets seized and set aside for community development and treatment facilities. It should not pose a problem as a similar procedure is already being used by local authorities whereby a certain percentage of motor tax receipts is being used for local government purposes. Why can something similar not be done with the money seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau?</P>
    <P>The health boards have begun to get their act together after many years of neglect in dealing with the drugs epidemic.  I am speaking specifically in the context of the heroin problem in Dublin where the worst of the drug abuse takes place. The correct approach is being adopted where local communities are consulted and the principle of local areas addressing local problems is put into practice.  This means that if addicts in an area seek treatment, they do not have to go outside <Col N="1092" /> the area because they will be treated in local satellite clinics.  That would surmount the tremendous suspicion that the Eastern Health Board is foisting a disproportionate amount of responsibility for dealing with the problem on specific sections of the community.  I want to see the central and satellite clinics operating effectively and this can only be done through consultation with local residents' associations and not proceeding with methadone dispensation treatment without the knowledge of local residents.  They get very annoyed if they believe people with serious drugs problems are being imposed on their area.</P>
    <P>Prescription is another bone of contention. There is no practice of general practitioners prescribing to chemists in the locality.  A number of chemists have developed their operations in such a way that large numbers of addicts go to their premises for methadone.  This is highly unsatisfactory from the point of view of local residents because large numbers of people are hanging around causing huge inconvenience and indulging in petty crime by selling some of the dispensed methadone.  Gardaí are often present to monitor and regulate the dispensing of methadone. If all chemists co-operated GPs' prescriptions could be made out to the local chemist.  If this were done, waves would not be created in the community.</P>
    <P>I have often been critical of how the prison service operates in relation to drugs and other matters. However, the greatest concentration of drug addiction is in prisons.  It is a captive audience and there should be intensive, appropriate treatment programmes for each addict when they enter prison. The Minister should look at the approach taken by the Department of Education and Science on education services.  Local vocational education committees are responsible for education in the prison system.  Why should local health boards not be responsible for drug treatment in prisons?  That is the only way to achieve an effective system but we are not doing so.  It is a simple solution.  The same procedure, facilities and approach which operates on the outside can also operate inside prisons.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is a growing problem.  The Oireachtas's response should be to appoint a Minister of State with no other responsibility but to tackle the problem of drug abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report.  Unfortunately, drugs are becoming a problem in every corner of Ireland.  We constantly hear of our national problem but this report gives us a wider view of how effective our policies are in tackling the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objective of the EU report is to provide policy makers with information so that they can compare and contrast the effectiveness of policies in different European countries.  The main findings of the report are that cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug in the EU, <Col N="1093" /> with 5 to 30 per cent of the population having tried it at some stage.  Amphetamines are the second most commonly used illegal drugs. Despite the fact that less than 1 per cent of the population has tried heroin, it has caused the greatest social, economic, financial and mental problems for those involved.  Ecstasy and LSD are the most popular misused drugs among young people.  Heroin misuse is largely confined to Dublin and other major urban areas.  Cannabis and Ecstasy are a nationwide problem.</P>
    <P>In tackling the drug problem we must deal with the supply and prevention issues.  The problem can be related to the principle of supply and demand; prevention can be used to reduce demand.  The Garda must be congratulated for battling relentlessly against those who accrue vast wealth at the expense of the most vulnerable and, very often, socially dysfunctional people.  There have been important measures introduced nationally and internationally to deal with the parasites involved in the drug trade.  The word 'parasite' is not strong enough but I could not use a more appropriate term in this House.</P>
    <P>As a nurse, I have met young children whose parents are drug addicts.  Very often there is horrendous physical, emotional and psychological neglect of these children.  Some parents are spaced out of their minds while, supposedly, looking after children.  I was 27 years of age before being offered drugs.  That offer was made in a children's hospital in Dublin by a 14 year old child who volunteered to get me hash if I wanted it.  I do not know if it is laughable or the saddest of situations when a 14 year old child offers drugs to a 27 year old nurse.</P>
    <P>One of the most upsetting things I experienced as a midwife, was to watch a newborn baby suffering withdrawal symptoms because its mother was a drug addict.  For anyone who has never experienced it, the child is like an alcoholic going through the DTs.  A day old baby shakes and jerks from one end of a cot to the other.  It is not a pleasant sight.  Drug addicted mothers should be made to watch their babies for five minutes. Everything must be done to deal with the parasites and drug barons.</P>
    <P>We must welcome the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which enables the Criminal Assets Bureau to freeze and seize assets procured as a result of crime, and the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, which provides for periods of detention of up to seven days.  I also welcome the proposed changes which will allow for a ten year minimum sentence for drug trafficking. These measures send a clear message to drug barons that this Government will be tough on criminals.  The recent large seizures of drugs will worry those involved in drug trafficking and they know that Ireland is no longer a safe haven.  The Garda can only be effective as a result of action at national, European and international level. However, so long as there is a demand, there will <Col N="1094" /> be supply.  There must be a more local emphasis involving the family and local community to deal with the demand.</P>
    <P>The EU report indicates that young Irish people are near the top of the European table as regards using tobacco, alcohol and illegal drugs, such as cannabis and Ecstasy.  Why do young people get involved in drugs?  The argument is that there are increased pressures on young people at school, such as the points system and the need to get into college.  This is rubbish and an easy way of passing the buck.  There are pressures but there were pressures 60 and 70 years ago when there were ten to 12 children per family in a one bedroom house, no money and, at times, very little food.</P>
    <P>Our drug problem is a legacy of today's culture. The increasing movement of people nationally and internationally and the media make people more aware of what is going on.  Awareness leads to curiosity.  Peer group pressure and curiosity are two of the common reasons why young people initially take drugs.  Often young people will dabble in drugs for the hell of it, often they are introduced to them by a friend.  It is just a bit of fun when out for the night with the gang.  Boredom appears to play a large part in encouraging children to experiment with drugs, particularly in urban areas.  Every rural community in Ireland possesses sporting facilities, and yet boredom is seen as an excuse.  Sport is a life saver in rural and urban areas.  If love of sport is instilled in a child from an early age it leads to a healthy competitiveness as well as a keen spirit, helping to develop that child's character in a positive way. Involvement in sport gives children confidence above all else.  Lack of confidence makes any young person vulnerable to peer group pressure and bullying.  Often they will turn to alcohol to achieve confidence, but in fact it demeans them as a person and makes them even more vulnerable. When children have low self esteem they are an easy target for anyone who wishes to exploit them.</P>
    <P>In Ireland 42 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age.  Tackling substance abuse must therefore be a priority.  There is no point pontificating about the harm these substances do. What must be done is alter the attitude of young people by channelling their energy in a positive way.  I commend groups such as Foróige and the various other voluntary groups for young people. Foróige is for children between 12 and 18 years of age, the most vulnerable age when discussing drugs, alcohol and tobacco.  As a product of Foróige myself, I know it gives young people the opportunity to express themselves and develop their talents which would be left hidden otherwise.</P>
    <P>Parents have a major role and must be involved in this stage of their child's life, especially now when both parents work and leave children with child minders.  It is not good enough to make voluntary <Col N="1095" /> workers responsible for children.  Parents must hold some responsibility.  It is irresponsible of parents to allow a child to sit in front of a television for hours on end.  Parents must be encouraged to become more involved in their children's upbringing.</P>
    <P>In large, deprived urban areas, where young people have no positive community involvement and where drug pushing is commonplace, avoidance of drug abuse is more difficult.  As a rural Senator, I can say we do not have a drug problem as widespread as in the cities.  We do, however, have a problem with substance abuse.  A North Eastern Health Board survey published on 25 November contains the replies to a confidential questionnaire of 1,516 adolescents from 21 schools.  This research showed alcohol and tobacco consumption was higher than the national average, with 26 per cent of 13 year olds having tried both.  This figure increased to 81 per cent of adolescents by age 17 years.  The survey showed that young people who smoked and drank were more frequently offered drugs, generally by a friend.  Those involved who had tried drugs gave their reasons as boredom, family problems, experimentation, sociability and peer influence. Young people need their energies to be channelled in a more positive way to avoid these problems.</P>
    <P>We can leave the authorities to deal with curtailing the supply of drugs at national level, but there must be more emphasis on parents, teachers and community workers to deal with demand.  If demand is reduced, supply will reduce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming at the tail end of the debate I do not intend to take up my full amount of time.  Neither do I wish to repeat the words spoken by the previous speakers or have a go at the Government for not wiping out the drugs problem in the first six months of office.  Let us be clear, every child will be offered the opportunity to use and abuse drugs.  Anyone who thinks their children will not be offered drugs does not know today's world.</P>
      <P>There is a view that the supply of drugs can be controlled.  The European Union has taken some daft approaches to dealing with this problem.  The most amazing of all was they were going to ask the drug growing farmers of Columbia to grow carrots instead.  That was the most amazing response from Brussels so far.  Even if we were to control the supply of drugs coming along the traditional routes all that would happen would be an increase in designer drugs.  There is no future in attempting to address the drugs issue by controlling supply.  There is a future, as Senator Leonard said, in dealing with demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trying to fool, terrorise or mislead young people about the dangers of drugs is a non-starter. The dangers will not prevent young people trying them.  Young people do not believe <Col N="1096" /> drugs are killers; it is time we told them not all drugs are killers and not all drugs are equally dangerous.  It is time we told them the truth: that cannabis is less harmful than tobacco, but there is a vested interest in the world-wide tobacco industry to ensure cannabis will not be legalised. I do not think cannabis should be legalised, but people should know the truth about it.  It is no more dangerous than tobacco.  It is less addictive. It is also important to state that tobacco is more addictive than heroin.  Young people should be told these things so they learn to understand drugs.</P>
    <P>The biggest issue to examine is the great killer of all drugs, heroin.  There has been a debate about legalisation of drugs and the criminalisation of the people who use them.  I ask the Minister examine the possibility of legislation which would make heroin a controlled substance rather than legalise it. There have been successful experiments in recent years, particularly outside Liverpool, where a number of heroin addicts were treated by the local health service with a daily supply of heroin. All the addicts were employed in areas which included the Civil Service, the medical area and clerical jobs and they lived what appeared to be a normal life.  It is time we looked at the possibility of decriminalising heroin and making it a controlled substance like most other drugs.</P>
    <P>In my office I have an advertisement from the German Bayer pharmaceutical company &mdash; perhaps the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world &mdash; dating from 1907 advertising heroin as a cure for influenza, colds and other feverish ailments. This shows how times can change.  People did not realise the dangers of heroin at that time. I am not aware of any medicinal application for heroin.</P>
    <P>The crime which revolves around heroin could be demolished tomorrow morning if it were made a controlled rather than an illegal substance.  It requires guts on behalf of the Government to take this on board, but the only reason there is a huge criminal industry based on the supply of heroin is because of the normal laws of economics pertaining to supply and demand.  We should look at the question of supply in the context of heroin being a controlled rather than an illegal substance. It could be controlled by the medical profession or some other relevant body.  This would immediately pull the rug from under the gangsters and mobsters who are terrorising this and other cities, putting lives at risk, killing people and offering drugs in the worst possible manner and from which people are dying.  I ask that this be carefully examined.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Leonard said about focusing on young people, something the Minister also referred to.  Two or three times in his speech the Minister spoke of the necessity of this focus beginning at primary level and I welcome this.  It is only in the last 18 months that Governments have begun to see the importance of dealing with <Col N="1097" /> this issue at primary school.  We have come across situations of drugs being made available to senior primary school children in order to get them hooked.  They are trying substances about which they know nothing.  When it is offered it may not be called heroin; but whatever it is called in the street it is being offered in patches, injections or for smoking.  Young people do not understand what they are being offered and they should be given the facts and told the truth.  We should not try to deal with the issue by scaring them.  If scaring worked then nobody would have climbed Mount Everest, stolen a fast car, bungy jumped or risked their lives in the million different ways which people do every day.  Risk is attractive and people will be drawn towards it and reference to it is not the way to educate young people about drugs.  We should tell them the truth and allow them control their lives in dealing with drugs.  We should inform them so that they have the power, authority, confidence and self-esteem to deal with the matter and say no.</P>
    <P>One survey said one out of three young people have taken cannabis at some stage during their teen years, confirming the fact that two out of three have rejected it, while others may not have admitted trying it.  It can be taken for granted that every child will have been offered drugs during the course of their teen years.  Whether it is Ecstasy tablets, cannabis or something stronger and more dangerous is irrelevant.  We should inform young people so they understand the difference between drugs rather than saying they are all the same.  The truth about and dangers associated with each drug should be spelled out.</P>
    <P>We should also look at gateway drugs, whether they are alcohol and tobacco or cannabis and Ecstasy.  It is untrue to tell young people that one drug leads to another.  It is true that I have never seen a heroin addict who was not also a tobacco smoker.  However, it does not necessarily follow that one leads to another.  Young people need the facts to enable them make choices and take on peer pressure.  This requires a strong sense of self-esteem and self-confidence.  We need to focus on demand.  Those who want drugs and are buying them, thus pushing up sales, are the people we need to reach.</P>
    <P>We need to look carefully at treatment.  I strongly favour local neighbourhood treatment centres.  We should not establish major drug treatment centres in two or three areas in a large city such as Dublin.  People should get treatment and deal with their problems in their own neighbourhood. It is a shame and a poor reflection on this and previous Governments, and on all of us, that we do not have the facilities and resources to deal with the number of people who wish to avail of detoxification and other treatments to beat their addiction.  Much can be done, but people need to be imaginative and creative and deal with the issues which have been taboo.  The main issue is <Col N="1098" /> that of decriminalising, which is different from legalising, heroin to make it a controlled substance. We need to carefully examine such issues and see where the criminals fit into such change. Criminals work on the terror of people who will do anything to get a fix and who lose all sense of balance and judgment to get their daily dose of heroin.  If this could be supplied by a controlled legal source, parallel to detoxification and treatment, we would have a far better chance of success in beating the drugs problem and eliminating the interwoven fabric of crime which surrounds the drug scene in Ireland and Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who have contributed to the debate.  I share their concern about the use of illicit and legal drugs by young people.  As the report of the European monitoring centre indicates, we must be cautious when comparing figures from one country with another because of variations in data collection systems.  However, this does not avoid the fact that many young people appear to accept the use of cannabis, ecstasy, tobacco and alcohol as normal. It is incumbent on us to equip young people with the wherewithal to make responsible choices about their lifestyles.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that various educational preventative initiatives had been undertaken by the Department's health promotion unit in conjunction with the Department of Education, such as the On My Own Two Feet programme which commenced in 1994 and which has been very successful in second level schools.  One thousand two hundred teachers have been trained in delivering the programme to date.  This year a further 64 training programmes are being run.  The basic philosophy behind the programme is to give young people the confidence to deal with the decisions they have to make about their lifestyles.  At primary level there is an initiative under way, including an information booklet for school managers, parents and teachers; information awareness seminars for teachers, parents and others, liaison with local community groups to involve them in the process of raising awareness about drugs and in-service training programmes for teachers.  At community level, the programme Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers has been running for some time and provides community based training for health and education professionals, Garda, youth workers, voluntary workers and agencies and others interested in drug related problems which they encounter through their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has given a new impetus to the structures put in place by the previous Government by extending the brief of the Cabinet subcommittee to encompass the question of social inclusion.  This will ensure the co-ordination of activities in the areas of drugs misuse, local development and anti-poverty strategies to <Col N="1099" /> allow for a more focused approach.  The 1996 Government decision also emphasised the need for demand reduction measures to be put in place in each health board area outside Dublin.  Following these decisions, my Department instructed each health board to put in place a range of measures suitable to their area aimed at reducing the demand for drugs.  A number of steps have been taken by the boards to implement these decisions, including the employment of education officers, community workers and counsellors, the development of databases on drug use and increasing education and prevention measures.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the absence of hard facts about the extent of drugs misuse.  For that reason health boards are concentrating on developing databases which are relevant and capable.  I am satisfied that health boards are aware of the need to have a suitable range of services in place in order to respond to those who are misusing drugs. It is important to remember that benchmark figures have been established through the EMC and ESPAD surveys.  This means we can repeat such surveys in coming years to establish whether the problem continues to grow or our efforts at education and prevention are bearing fruit.</P>
    <P>With regard to treatment in the community, I am aware that large numbers of patients can attend a particular pharmacy to have their methadone dispensed.  The review group which examined methadone treatment services for opiate misusers has made recommendations on this issue and these recommendations will include placing controls on the use of drugs and the numbers of drug misusers attending any one general practitioner or pharmacy.  The group's report is being printed at present and will be available in the near future.  A group has been established by the Eastern Health Board to drive forward the implementation of this report.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that the solution to the drug problem must be looked at and addressed in a wider social context.  That is why the Cabinet subcommittee dealing with drug misuse is called the Sub-committee on Social Inclusion.  No Government sector, on its own, can be effective in tackling the problem.  It has already been pointed out that the Health Research Board's figures for treated drug misuse clearly identified the links between drugs misuse and social deprivation.  The 1995 report showed that of the 3,600 cases treated in the greater Dublin area, 63 per cent had left school before the official school leaving age of 15 years and 87 per cent were unemployed.  For these reasons, drug prevention and rehabilitation strategies must include policies aimed at equipping people with the necessary skills to make informed choices about the use of drugs in their lives.  More importantly, social policies must provide the environment where these people have the ability to choose the healthy option.  Social policies must encourage young people to remain at school and <Col N="1100" /> to acquire the relevant skills to achieve their optimum potential as worthwhile members of society. They must aim at providing employment for people particularly in inner city areas where unemployment figures remain high.</P>
    <P>The issue of decriminalisation of drugs is frequently raised; indeed, it was raised by Senator O'Toole today.  Government decisions of February 1996 include a clear statement that no steps should be taken to legalise or decriminalise the use of soft drugs such as cannabis.  This Government's position has not changed on that issue.  I disagree with Senator O'Toole; I do not believe that controlling drugs such as heroin would limit the amount of illegal heroin being imported to, and distributed throughout, the country.</P>
    <P>The figures in the EMC report give us all food for thought.  We should not fall into the trap of overstating the problem, neither should we be complacent.  We must face up to the problem and respond to it.  Much work is already being done in responding to the drug misuse problem. However, we have some way to go.  I assure the House that the Minister and I will continue with our efforts to ensure that strategies are put in place aimed at preventing drugs misuse whenever possible.  In addition, those who require access to drug treatment will be in a position to get it without delay.</P>
    <P>All Senators referred to the need for a strong emphasis to be placed on prevention.  I agree with that; the education and prevention programmes which are in place are key to reducing the drug misuse problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello suggested that health boards should be made responsible for the provision of drug treatment services in prison.  At present, the Eastern Health Board consultant psychiatrists provide sessions in prison and work closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on improving services to prisoners.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman noted that priority areas are well funded and resources but others are not. Since 1992, funding has been provided to all health boards to provide education and treatment services.  Each board has a co-ordinating committee on drugs misuse similar to that which exists in the Mid-Western Health Board.  This committee identifies the needs of the region and the appropriate action to be taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell spoke about the abuse of legal substances such as glue and similar products. Under the Child Care Act, it is illegal for anyone to sell those products to young people if they know they will be abused.  Persons knowingly selling these products can be fined or even imprisoned. The Senator spoke about the alternatives to drug misuse; local drug task forces have established priorities in regard to those.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Senator Leonard's description of her personal experience as a nurse and midwife.  If anything said here today emphasised the tragedy of the drug problem, it was the <Col N="1101" /> Senator's description of dealing with babies born to drug abusing mothers.  She spoke about the desperate condition those babies were in as a result.  That epitomises the tragedy of this problem.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to put in place strategies which will prevent, as far as possible, drugs being imported here.  There has been considerable success in this area recently.  The Government will continue the fight against drug distribution on the streets and will do everything possible to provide treatment to the victims of drug abuse, particularly heroin abuse.</P>
    <P>A major effort is being made, which has been successful to date, to confine the heroin problem to the areas in which it currently exists.  In cities such as Galway, owing to Garda surveillance and intelligence, we have succeed by and large in keeping heroin out.</P>
    <P>Since I took up office, I have had occasion to speak to children as young as 12 years of age.  It is a shocking tragedy to think that some of those young children are taking heroin and are the victims of drug abuse.  Drug abuse adds to the possibility of those children being abused in many other ways because of their vulnerability.  It is tragic to meet children of 12 to 15 years of age who are victims of drug abuse.  It behoves us all to put every possible effort into getting to grips with this scourge.  I compliment Senators who contributed to this debate, and I hope it will add to the ongoing effort to end this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Hospital waiting list numbers are showing a sharp increase.  There are now approximately 30,000 people on hospital waiting lists. Approximately 10,000 of them have been waiting longer than the Government's maximum target of 12 months, and 50 per cent of children on those waiting lists have been waiting for treatment for more than six months.</P>
      <P>The Mater Hospital has a current overrun of £1.6 million.  It has had to close 20 beds and its CAT scan system to save money, and it has the largest number of people on its waiting lists in the country.  The Minister for Health and Children has introduced a supplementary budget, which is to be welcomed, but I am concerned that much of that supplementary budget will go to health boards and various hospitals, where it is unlikely to make a serious dent in waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State will remember that when Deputy Brendan Howlin was Minister for Health in 1993, there was a co-ordinated, phased programme <Col N="1102" /> to reduce hospital waiting lists.  When £50 million was allocated specifically to that purpose, there was a consequent benefit in the 30 per cent reduction of numbers on the waiting list. Now the numbers are increasing again, and the problem is becoming very serious.</P>
    <P>It is believed that 20 per cent of coronary patients die while awaiting bypass operations. The waiting list problem faces the elderly and the youth.  In 1992, Dr. John O'Connell produced a patients' charter while Minister for Health which stated that everybody, irrespective of income, would have access to high quality medical care. He specified the elderly, children, those with mental or physical disabilities and expectant mothers.</P>
    <P>We now face a problem that is getting worse and we do not appear to have a coherent programme to deal with it.  I am worried that the situation will worsen and that the numbers on the lists will increase.  The Minister received a report from the advisory group on materials management for the health boards and hospital services. It indicated that approximately £30 million could be saved if there was a more co-ordinated approach to the tendering and purchasing of stocks and supplies.  What has the Minister of State to say about that report?</P>
    <P>There was a recent newspaper report relating to the President of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association which concerned me.  The president condemned a practice that the health boards are operating whereby general practitioners have made savings on medical cards to the amount of £30 to £40 million.  They are doing so by prescribing generic drugs rather than top of the range designer drugs.  An incentive is being given to general practitioners to keep 50 per cent of the savings to improve their practices.  This would not be tolerated in the private sector, where a private patient would be expected to pay over the odds for top of the range drugs which are not necessarily better than a generic drug which could be prescribed at a much lower cost. Various schemes and refunds benefit the private patient, however, and the taxpayer picks up the tab for designer drugs.  It is appalling that the President of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association can make such remarks, and the Minister should respond to them.  Anything that can save money for the taxpayer in this area is very desirable as long as it does not interfere with the health service.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with hospital consultants. The Buckley report indicated a link between hospital costs and the activities of hospital consultants. Those consultants should be integrated into the management of hospitals, as that might reduce costs.  Consultants' services and salaries are matters of concern.</P>
    <P>I experience these problems in my constituency in relation to the Mater Hospital, which is having serious problems, and Temple Street Children's <Col N="1103" /> Hospital, which is in a deplorable condition.  It must be replaced and not refurbished.  Conditions there are Dickensian, and although a wonderful service is being provided, it is not satisfactory. Enormous investment and work are necessary, and the Minister of State should indicate what steps are being taken to reduce the waiting lists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will be aware that between 1993 and the end of this year £58 million has been provided for the reduction of waiting lists for hospital treatment.  When the waiting list initiative commenced in June 1993, there were 40,130 on waiting lists for hospital treatment.  By the end of June 1997, this figure had been reduced by 9,677, or 24 per cent over three years.</P>
      <P>In 1997, £8 million was set aside to continue the work of reducing waiting lists.  This funding was targeted at areas where waiting times for surgery were excessively long and special attention was again paid to reducing the waiting times for cardiac surgery, including heart bypass operations. This represents significant progress in the reduction of waiting lists and demonstrates the Government's concern that the necessary resources are provided to improve waiting times for treatment.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be notifying health boards and hospitals of revised arrangements for implementing the waiting list initiative in 1998. Among the primary steps to be taken for 1998 will be: agencies will be notified of their waiting list funding shortly.  This will be much earlier than in previous years and will enable them to plan their waiting list work accordingly during 1998; hospitals will be required to structure their services to ensure that, over a period, there are no adults waiting for more than 12 months and no children waiting for more than six months in targeted specialities.  This will obviously take some time to achieve but the objective of eliminating waiting times over this period should be clearly stated.  It will involve agencies planning carefully the level and type of activity to be carried out; where it has not already done so, each agency will be asked to designate an individual to co-ordinate waiting list work.  This is aimed at ensuring that all the arrangements relating to planning and delivering waiting list services are done in an effective and co-ordinated way.  The emphasis will be on obtaining value for money and on catering for patients in the most efficient and sensitive manner possible; the importance of validating waiting lists will again be emphasised, in order to ensure that my Department has an accurate and up-to-date picture of the overall situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in previous years, attention will continue to be paid to waiting times as well as numbers on waiting lists with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six <Col N="1104" /> months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialities targeted for attention.  As part of the revised arrangements for 1998, the Minister will shortly commission an independent evaluation of the waiting list initiative to examine how it has performed and to identify other possible areas of improvement and development.  I am confident that hospitals will continue addressing the issue of waiting lists and waiting times and that, using the resources made available to them, they will make good progress in this important area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to deal with the issue of Christmas bonuses.  I have a copy of a recent press release issued by the Minister so I am aware of the state of play this Christmas.  This scheme has been well received by long-term social welfare recipients on contributory and assistance payments.  Over 722,000 people and their dependants will receive a Christmas bonus this year that will cost £41 million.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty with the categories not included in the Christmas bonus scheme which is inequitable.  We should be fair to all categories. This scheme was discretionary when it started, but once anything is given under the social support system, it quickly becomes a right.  It is now a part of the budgetary planning of families who depend on social welfare.  Among the categories who receive a Christmas bonus are families on employment support payments, such as the back to work allowance, and those who are on CE schemes.</P>
      <P>If people are working on a CE scheme, they earn little above their social welfare payment and receive a Christmas bonus.  If they came off a CE scheme two weeks ago, having completed 12 months, they will get no Christmas bonus.  They miss out by a week and in many cases are on a short-term payment, usually reduced unemployment benefit or short-term unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>This is hard to explain to someone who got a Christmas bonus last year on a CE scheme and who is taken off it because they can only participate for 12 months.  They are now on less money, with the same number of children to feed, four weeks away from Christmas.  The logic of this defeats them and it is hard to defend the principle on which the scheme is operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to encourage people to work and our social welfare system should be constructed to do this.  This problem is a disincentive.  I came across an example recently of a woman from Wexford with eight dependent children.  Her husband finished a 12 month CE scheme three weeks ago.  They are now on reduced unemployment benefit, which is not much more than the unemployment assistance rate.  Last year while he was <Col N="1105" /> working on the CE scheme, they got a Christmas bonus, which mades a difference when providing for such a large family.  This year he will not get any Christmas bonus.  Ironically, he has been offered a place on another CE scheme, as in certain circumstances someone is offered another scheme without having to wait the requisite time to qualify.  He is reluctant to go back on the CE scheme which is starting on Monday week in Wexford.  He reckons he will be taken off the scheme before next Christmas and will again miss out on the bonus.</P>
    <P>This bonus is important to people, particularly those with large families.  The timing of its beginning and end can be critical to them having a worthwhile Christmas.  If the Minister or I had eight children and very little money, we would like to be in a position to provide the basic necessities so they could enjoy the same Christmas as their peers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the matter of supporting people who want to work.  Those who come off a CE scheme should be entitled to a Christmas bonus, if they are entitled to one when they are on it.  There is no logic in the present system and I am not sure how it evolved.  Many social welfare support schemes evolve and we tack on extra categories every year.  There are incentives to keep people on schemes &mdash; they are allowed to keep their medical cards, etc.  but we build up secondary benefits which disadvantage people further down the road.  This is what has happened here without any deliberate intent.</P>
    <P>We want the long-term unemployed to participate in CE schemes.  However, when they come off them, they should not be disadvantaged when compared with those on long-term unemployment assistance who have never participated in a scheme.  Can the Minister explain the logic of denying them the Christmas bonus if the scheme finishes two or three weeks before Christmas?</P>
    <P>We need a good social support system to help those who cannot help themselves.  As our economy grows, the State must provide for these people.  We must not create disincentives for those who want to work.  We must not make it less attractive for people to go on CE schemes where they acquire extra skills and get back into the work cycle.</P>
    <P>I would like to reach the point where all those on social welfare get 70 per cent of their weekly payment as a Christmas bonus, regardless of what it is.  I am not sure how much this would cost. There is a large number of categories who receive the bonus &mdash; old age pensioners, those who have retired, the blind, invalids, widows and widowers, orphans, those on disability benefit, one parent families, those in receipt of the carer's allowance, pre-retirement allowance, disability allowance, long-term unemployment assistance, employment support payments and participants on FÁS and CE schemes.  There are probably as many people, <Col N="1106" /> in terms of cost, on short-term unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>We are approaching the point where we could perhaps afford to remove the anomalies and the division from the Christmas bonus system and ensure that all those on social welfare receive 70 per cent of their payment.  I particularly want to see if this year the Minister can sort out the difficulty for those who have just come off CE and FÁS schemes to be sure they are looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for her kind remarks on my first appearance as a Minister in the Seanad.  I thank her also for raising this issue which has exercised the minds of quite a few of her colleagues in the Oireachtas over the last while.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to set out the background to this issue for the Seanad today. The issue arises directly from the introduction of class A PRSI for community employment scheme workers, which was provided for by my predecessor in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of CE workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.  I understand that its introduction was largely prompted by representations from groups such as the Scheme Workers Alliance and the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed.  It is my understanding that the issue of the possible loss of secondary benefits was pointed out at the time to the groups who pushed for CE people to have a class A stamp.  Certain structures were put in place in order to alleviate that in relation to people who were then on CE schemes.</P>
      <P>Class A PRSI provides cover for a full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance scheme, including, as the Senator said, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age contributory pension, widow's contributory pension, treatment &mdash; dental and optical &mdash; benefits and occupational injuries benefit.</P>
      <P>One of the consequences of the introduction of Class A is that CE workers who revert to the live register when their CE scheme finishes will have qualified or requalified for UB by virtue of having paid 13 Class A contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of such persons who qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons who qualify for a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit and who have an underlying entitlement to unemployment assistance are entitled to opt for unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit in <Col N="1107" /> accordance with the relevant social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>The social welfare secondary benefits of the Christmas bonus, free fuel allowance and butter vouchers are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.  Unemployment benefit claimants do not therefore have an entitlement to these benefits.</P>
    <P>I should mention at this stage that the secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a CE scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or a job start scheme. That perhaps gives an indication that the people who organised these schemes have a view that there should be, as the Senator said, efforts to make sure people go back to work.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that as regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance or mortgage supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that in the normal course former CE workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should <Col N="1108" /> continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>

      <P>While I recognise the difficulties faced by some CE workers who requalify for unemployment benefit when their period of CE finishes, I trust Senators will appreciate that I cannot introduce special concessionary arrangements for such people without having equal and due regard to the position of other people who are on short-term social welfare payments.  Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry an extremely high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities within the wider social welfare system.</P>
