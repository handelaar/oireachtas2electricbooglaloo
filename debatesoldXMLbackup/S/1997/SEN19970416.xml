      <P>I am sure I speak for all Members when I say how horrified I was to hear the news this morning about our colleague, Senator Norris.  However, I am glad he is displaying his usual resilience and courage by being here.  We all send him our best wishes.</P>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to intervene in the fees and charges dispute appertaining to University College Dublin.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 2 and the item on road safety, item 30, motion 25. Item 1 will be taken until 2.30 p.m. and there will be a sos from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.  Item 2, the Universities Bill, 1996, will be taken from 3.30 p.m. until 6 p.m. and item 30, motion 25, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
      <P>While item 30, motion 25, is in the name of the Fine Gael Senators, it is, in effect, an all party motion because I know that Senators from all parts of the House would wish to be associated with it.  With the agreement of the House, we will suspend the usual practice for Private Members' time and allow ten minutes per speaker as if it was a series of statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Leader's comments on this evening's Private Members' time because there was mention on a major national morning radio programme that the matter was being debated tonight and I welcome his idea that the debate will be treated as statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I add my voice to the comments of the Cathaoirleach with regard to our colleague, Senator Norris.  I am sure that when he spoke <Col N="1498" /> recently in the House about this type of incident he never thought he would be here this morning as a witness to the fact.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I am pleased that he is here with us this morning and wish him a speedy recovery from the injuries which he received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with you, a Chathaoirligh, and Senator Wright in sympathising with Senator Norris on what happened to him last night.  I am very glad he is with us this morning.  He anticipated what would happen in a sense when he spoke previously about what was happening in the vicinity of his residence.</P>
      <P>When will the legislation to establish the Food Safety Board come before the House?  The board was established some considerable time ago. Recent answers to Parliamentary Questions indicate that it has virtually no staff.  It appears that there has been only minimal contact between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Health.  The board was set up under the aegis of the Department of Health in response to the BSE crisis to assure domestic and foreign consumers of the safety of Irish food. It was appropriate that the board be set up but it seems that little has occurred since the announcement of its establishment.  When is that legislation to come before us?</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the arrangements for Private Members' time this evening.  I suppose that the next motion which comes from this side of the House, on which there is overall agreement, will also be dealt with by statements where speakers are allowed ten minutes each.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with you, a Chathaoirligh, and others in welcoming Senator Norris to the House today because I was afraid he would not be present.  The issue he raised previously in relation to activities in his and other areas of Dublin is a serious one and I am sure he will speak about it.  I am delighted he will be here to attack the Universities Bill, 1996, with his usual style and vigour.</P>
      <P>The House is due to take Second Stage of the Credit Union Bill tomorrow.  In view of the fact that amendments tabled on Committee Stage in the Dáil were agreed, I believe everyone would like to ensure that the Bill is passed as quickly as possible.  In that context, will Committee Stage be taken next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, an appeal was made to the Leader to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to address the House in connection with the serious crises in agriculture and the beef industry, particularly in respect of live cattle exports and the sharp decrease in the price of milk.  Thousands of jobs are at stake in these industries and I appeal to the Leader to ask the Minister to appear before the House to give some hope to those involved.  Many of these people worked very hard during the past 12 months and borrowed to purchase cattle but they face the <Col N="1499" /> prospect of having no income.  If this happened to any other section of the community various task forces would be established and emergency meetings arranged.</P>
      <P>Various farmers' organisations visited the House yesterday to lobby Members about this issue.  I do not expect the Minister to be able to travel to Brussels and appear before the House at the same time.  If he is not available, the Minister of State might come before us to clarify the current position.  This is an extremely serious matter and, in addition to people losing money, loss of our beef and store export markets will have grave implications for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make inquiries with the Department of Health in respect of the report of the National Task Force on Suicide? The task force was established in November 1995, issued an interim report in mid-1996 and was due to report by the end of last year.  I understand that delays occurred because the task force wanted to ensure that its report would be detailed and comprehensive. When will the final report be published?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my appreciation for the good wishes expressed by the Cathaoirleach and other Members.  I am glad to state that rumours of my demise have been considerably exaggerated. I did not intend to say much about this matter, but since it has been raised and become a matter of public awareness I will now do so.  I raised this matter on previous occasions and I would be grateful if the Leader communicated our concerns to the Ministers for Justice and the Environment.</P>
      <P>Last night's incident occurred at the end of a preservation society meeting which concluded at 11.30 p.m.  At midnight a number of people were still in my house and there was such an outbreak of noise on the street outside that it could be heard at the real of the premises.  I went out to remonstrate with those involved and received a clout in the face.  Later last night, a young man was stabbed and, apparently critically injured, following a fracas in Rumours nightclub.  On the last occasion I raised this issue, I referred to Rumours in addition to P.J. McGrath's, Fibber McGee's and the Back Gate and I do not know why such establishments are allowed to release drunken louts on to our streets at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. each morning.  Taking cognisance of the fact that a planning application has been made to add another late night shebeen to this list, I hope the Minister for Justice and the Environment will increase Garda strength in the area.  Last night, the gardaí were efficient, arrived on the scene quickly and attempted to find those involved.  I informed them that this is the kind of thing that happens when one goes out without one's shillelagh.</P>

      <P>Now that Senator Norris has spoken, I know he is alive and well.  When I heard the news on the radio this morning I had wondered about his health.  I am glad he is able to account for himself.</P>
      <P>It is commendable that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, has agreed to introduce legislation to legalise deflector systems.  I live in an area where this is a major issue and I ask the legislation be expedited.  People should not be forced to adopt a wait and see attitude.  We want to end the controversy as quickly as possible by having the legislation introduced as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for arrangements he has made for Private Members' time this evening.  He has been generous enough to realise that Members on all sides will have a contribution to make.  Will the House have an opportunity to debate the future of the country after 1999 when we may no longer have Objective 1 status for EU funding?  Large areas of the country, including my region, are not ready to lose this status.  We in Donegal have succeeded in getting a commitment from Fianna Fáil that there will be regionalisation to take account of the areas which are not ready to lose Objective 1 status.  Perhaps it is easier to get a commitment from a party in Opposition.  Will the Leader organise a debate on this matter which is not party political but which concerns all Members?</P>
      <P>The west and the Border counties are not ready to be removed from this status because their infrastructures have not been built up.  We are told about the present economic boom but in my part of the country there is not a sound, never mind a boom.  It is widely accepted that a debate on this issue would be useful and the Leader should consider organising one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the successful conclusion of the fisheries talks in Brussels conducted by the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett. When the acting chairperson of BIM, Mr. Joey Murrin, says the outcome was not as bad as had been expected, we can consider progress to have been made.  One must also welcome the funds that will be made available to modernise our fishing fleet.  Some of the boats in use are up to 50 years old and one has good reason to fear for their crews' safety.  Will the Leader indicate when the House might have a chance to discuss the safety review on the fishing fleet?  It was published some time ago yet we have not had a chance to discuss it.  We should debate it as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I note this morning there are many parking cones on Molesworth Street and I presume they are there in preparation for the today's Garda march.  I have raised this issue on several occasions.  How many gardaí are expected to march on Leinster House today?  Has the Minister for Justice made any emergency plans to man <Col N="1501" /> Garda stations and ensure proper emergency cover is provided?  This may be the first time in the State's history that gardaí have marched to the Dáil.  There is an onus on the Minister for Justice to come to the House today to explain to Members why the march is taking place, how many gardaí will be marching and what emergency procedures are in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Cathaoirleach's indulgence.  I cannot gloss over this issue because it is of grave importance.  Is the Leader prepared to ask the Minister for Justice to come to the House today to give a full explanation of the facts pertaining to this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago I informed the House that a serious problem had arisen in sugar beet growing areas, especially in County Carlow where one of the country's remaining sugar factories is located.  Since then, the workers in that factory have gone on strike and, according to newspaper reports, Greencore is being investigated by the EU with regard to bad practices in the sugar trade.  The situation has become serious. It is also significant that Greencore claims prices for sugar beet are too high.  However, although it could not reach agreement with growers about this year's price and conditions, it had no problem reducing the quota by 3 per cent.  That is a dangerous strategy.  While the company claims the raw material costs too much, its actions will have the effect of driving up the price of the raw material by between £2 and £3 per tonne.</P>

      <P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  This is an important issue in County Carlow and the Cathaoirleach should give me a little latitude.  If we have a bad beet growing season it could lead to a shortage of Irish produced sugar which, in turn, will allow sugar traders to import more sugar from France and England.  That will have a long-term detrimental effect on the economy and on workers and farmers.  I ask the Leader of the House to use his judgement to have these three disputes resolved as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the remarks made on radio this morning about the efficacy of the deflector system, can the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications come before the House today to explain what will be involved in the proposed legislation for the autumn?  What value will it have for deflector groups who are in a state of flux this morning?  They do not know what will happen.  They say their taxes are up to <Col N="1502" /> date and some of them intend to go on air this morning while others will not.</P>
      <P>As it is a matter of grave concern throughout the country, the Minister should come before the House to explain how he will deal with the fact that some companies have guaranteed licences at present.  What compensation will these companies be paid by the State if there is a dilution in the quality of those licences?  The State will have huge difficulties paying such compensation.  This is an urgent matter.  It is also a matter of electoral concern which is why legislation will not be introduced until the autumn.  The Minister should explain his actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago the House debated the NESF report on early school leavers.  That debate was well received.  Can the Leader organise a debate on the latest NESF report on rural renewal and combating social exclusion?  In view of the continuing crisis in the beef industry and the growing crisis in the dairy industry a debate on rural poverty would be apt and it would be helpful if time were made available for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in deploring the attack on Senator Norris not simply because he is a Member of the House but because he is a citizen.  It was a disgraceful assault, although it is not easy to close the Senator's mouth.</P>
      <P>If the Leader invites the Minister for Justice to this House to discuss the situation in the Garda, she might consider setting up a commission not just on pay but on the effectiveness and the deployment of gardaí throughout the State.  I find it difficult to take Senator Mulcahy seriously on this issue.  He tries at every opportunity to heighten people's fear because he believes there are votes in fear.  That is his <i>modus operandi.</i>  He knows as well as I that the deployment of gardaí in Dublin during this march on the Dáil is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. The Senator is a lawyer so he should know it more than I and yet he persists in his nonsense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Minister for Justice should instruct the sergeants and inspectors on how to deploy themselves today.  He should stop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda has occuppied a preeminent place in the affections and respect of Irish people since its foundation but it is in grave danger of diluting that respect because of the behaviour of gardaí in the past over internal differences, and this march on the Dáil does it no credit whatsoever.  Having said that, I recognise the gardaí's entitlement to march.  I may deplore <Col N="1503" /> it but I recognise it.  I urge Senator Mulcahy to stop trying to heighten the public's fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Norris is with us today.  There are dangers in being a university Senator of which we were not aware, so we will have greater respect for him from now on.</P>
      <P>I am glad there is a general welcome for the way in which we are handling Private Members' time this evening.  I assure Senator Dardis I would be happy to make similar arrangements at any time if there were general agreement.</P>
      <P>The legislation regarding the food safety board is at an advanced stage but the board cannot function without it.  I will return &mdash; I hope tomorrow &mdash; with a more up to date account on the state of that legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan asked about the Credit Union Bill.  It is very important and I have deliberately left Second Stage tomorrow open ended. It will start at 2 p.m. and will continue until it is completed.  I hope we will have co-operation as there was wide consultation and there is now general agreement on the importance and need for this legislation.  I hope we will deal with Committee Stage next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Byrne raised the issue of agriculture problems and made a strong case.  I will convey what he said to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to see if there can be a debate on the matter in this House.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville asked about the task force on suicide, on which I will get information.  Senator McGowan raised an important and non-partisan issue and I will see if some mechanism can be found to have it discussed in the House but I cannot guarantee it.</P>
      <P>Senators Maloney and Burke raised the issue of the sea fisheries talks.  We congratulate the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, on the successful outcome of the talks.  A discussion on the modernisation and safety factors of the fishing fleet is overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised an issue which he has often raised before and I want to clarify some points on that.  Gardaí are not marching on Leinster House, as he has persisted in saying, as if there were some attempt at a <i>coup d'état</i> or to intimidate or take over the House.  The gardaí are exercising their democratic right to stage a protest.  Many may feel, as I and probably most Members of the House do, that an error of judgement is involved and that they would be better advised not to do that.  Nonetheless, what they are doing is entirely within their rights and is not a breach of the law. <Col N="1504" /> Operational matters are in the capable hands of the Garda Commissioner and the senior officers of the Garda force.  There is no breach of the law and it is important we put this into perspective. They are doing what they are entitled to do.  We may not approve of it but it is their right.  There is no threat to democracy, to the safety of the public or to ordinary people.  We should be balanced and fair on this issue.  Senator Townsend exercised the Carlow dispensation to make a strong case on the beet industry.  I will convey his remarks to the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan suggested that the deflector groups are fluxed by events.  They are not fluxed. We have announced legislative proposals which need to be carefully examined.  These proposals set out to undo the damage caused by the granting of a licence to a cartel by the Fianna Fáil/PD Government.  Our proposals are an attempt to restore fair play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should ask the deflector groups about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has thought carefully about this issue.  The Senator is a fair and even minded person and he should take his time and study the proposals.  He will see that there is wisdom behind them.  I assure the Senator that electoral considerations have entered into no one's thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 28 and 29, to delete &ldquo;together with&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;excluding&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill as drafted defines the Department of Defence as &ldquo;that part of the Department together with the principal military branches, but does not include a Scheduled Office&rdquo;.  My amendment seeks to delete the reference to the principal military branches and exclude them from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary of a Department has considerable powers under the Bill.  These powers could be used to the detriment of the Defence Forces. <Col N="1505" /> The present system is satisfactory.  The Chief of Staff and senior officers should not be included in the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is an important principle at stake.  That principle is the relationship between the State and the Defence Forces.  Historically, and with good reason, we have been reluctant to introduce a political dimension into the Defence Forces.  The civil sections of the Department of Defence should be governed by the Secretary.  That is satisfactory. However, that is where it should stop.</P>
    <P>There are inconsistencies between this Bill and the Defence Act.  I wonder about the constitutional aspects of it, although I am not an expert in that area.  There is potential for ambiguity and conflict between the Bill and the Defence Act, 1954, which is the basic code of military law in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I and the Minister have attended several commissioning services at the Curragh.  The commissioning ceremony mentions obeying orders from an officer, military superior or the Minister. This is undermined by the Bill.  In other sections of the Bill the powers conferred on the secretary general of the Department, as the person will be called in future, are in fundamental conflict with what the powers and responsibilities of the Chief of Staff, the staff in general and the three branches should be.</P>
    <P>Under section 4(1)(a) the authority and responsibility for the management of the Department is the function of the secretary general.  This includes military personnel and the outputs of the Department, including the military branches.  I have problems with the Bill as drafted.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter and I will then consider how to proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis that there is a need for overall responsibility.  This responsibility, in the military sense, should not be taken over by a superior within the Department of Defence, which would appear to be the case if &ldquo;together with&rdquo; is included in section 1.  The division between the military establishment and the Civil Service is one which should be maintained to ensure the Chief of Staff and the chief officers should deal with military matters.  There should be consultation with the Department of Finance on the overall organisation outside military matters. If section 1 is combined with the first part of section 4, there is a diminution of power from the military point of view and the Civil Service is given increased power, which they do not deserve.  I do think this will be welcomed by military personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify this important issue.  Under the Defence Act, 1954, three military branches &mdash; those of the Chief of Staff, the Quartermaster General and the Adjutant General &mdash; are described as the principal military branches of the Department of <Col N="1506" /> Defence.  They are accordingly included in the definition of the Department of Defence for the purposes of this Bill.  It is essential to do so to ensure the Secretary of the Department of Defence, who is currently the accounting officer for the Department's Vote, which includes the expenditure of the principal military branches, retains overall accountability for those branches and to ensure his strategy statement covers the totality of the Department.</P>
      <P>This definition does not cover the Defence Forces generally.  It does not imply or authorise any interference by civilian staff in operational matters relating to the Defence Forces; nor does it interfere with the right of direct access to the Minister which the heads of the principal military branches enjoy.  The current proposal does not alter the line of authority over the Defence Forces or diminish the position of Chief of Staff. When the draft outline of the Bill was circulated prior to its submission to Government, one of the staff associations representing personnel in the Defence Forces became aware of this definition and formed the view, which they publicly expressed, that this measure represented an alteration to the <i>status quo.</i>  The Minister for Defence has been particularly anxious to allay these fears and has explained the position to the military authorities.</P>
      <P>The Government has been involved in a significant and substantial reorganisation of the Defence Forces which will involve alterations in the arrangements under which the Defence Forces operate and which will involve changes in relation to the three military branches.  These are currently being addressed, together with other issues affecting the Defence Forces, and will necessitate a major overhaul of defence legislation. It has been made clear to the military authorities that this work is being given highest priority within the Department of Defence and that legislation for the new blueprint outlining the future organisation of the Defence Forces may require a consequential change in the arrangements set out in this Bill.  That change should be effected in comprehensive legislation rather than creating problems in the transitional period.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence sought and obtained a clear assurance from the Attorney General regarding the constitutionality of this Bill.  The advice of the Attorney General was as follows:</P>
      <P>The conferring of functions on Secretaries in section 5 is subject to an exception where provision is made by or under any other Act and, therefore, the functions conferred on the Chiefs of Staff under Part II of the Defence Act, 1954, are not in any way affected by the provisions of the new legislation.  I confirm your view that the respective position of the Chiefs of Staff and Secretary are not affected by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still uncomfortable about the matter.  The principle is an important one.  The <Col N="1507" /> Schedule lists the offices and branches of the public service which are excluded, including the Houses of the Office of the Oireachtas, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Director of the Public Prosecutions.  Perhaps the matter could be dealt with through the Scheduled Office.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the position had been explained to the military authorities by the Minister for Defence.  Is there any indication of how satisfied they were with the explanation?  I do not know how satisfied they were.  The Minister is correct in his assertion regarding the staff association. The matter was raised at their conference in Galway when reservations were raised.</P>
      <P>This is part of an overall strategy.  We have the efficiency audit group and the implementation plan and defence amendment legislation which would appear to diminish the status of military office holders, namely, the Adjutant General, the Quartermaster General and the Chief of Staff. There is a proposal for two Deputy Chiefs of Staff and that those appointments would be made by the Government rather than the President.  The President has appointed the present office holders because she is the commander of the Defence Forces under the Constitution.  The Office of the President and the role of the President arise, therefore.  It is not at all satisfactory to treat the Army in this way.  There should be an exclusion and an absolute separation.  The military authorities could be given responsibility for certain outputs by giving them a budget and authority for administering it rather than having to constantly refer to the Department.</P>
      <P>I remain unconvinced.  I believe there is merit in the amendment and I am not convinced that the Bill would not be improved by the exclusion of the principal military branches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the statutory group, which was part of the overall strategy and said that the Defence Act, 1954, is currently being reviewed by the efficiency audit group.  He also said that when the new defence legislation is brought before the House, this legislation might be changed.  Would it not be better to accept this amendment now?  It would not create any major difficulty since there will be a new defence Act in any event.  The separation and the perceived diminution of the role of the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant General and the Quartermaster General are causing problems. Why can the Minister not accept the amendment at this stage?  It is not radical and its acceptance would not alter the Bill.  Acceptance of the amendment would maintain the <i>status quo</i> until such time as the new Defence Act is brought before the Houses at which stage this Bill could be reviewed again.</P>

      <P>There are two issues arising here. Senator Dardis raised the issue of the new proposals for the Defence Forces.  What is being done in this Bill is simply an acknowledgment of <Col N="1508" /> the <i>status quo.</i>  The Bill does not change anything and I am confirmed in that view by the Attorney General.  Without this provision we would be changing things and it would be absurd to enter into a specific change about the financial accountability of the Secretary of the Department of Defence without reference to the new proposals which will be far more comprehensive and extensive and which will require lengthy debate.  The legislative changes made in the new Defence Act &mdash; which will be substantial legislation &mdash; will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If, arising from that, amendments are needed to this Bill to implement what is in the major legislation, they will be made.  For us to introduce a change in the current arrangements at this stage would cause more problems than it would solve without reference to all the legislation which will have to follow in relation to the new arrangements for the Defence Forces.  These new arrangements are widely known and are largely welcomed.  I regret that I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;A Minister of the Government having charge of a Department shall, in accordance with the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, <Col N="1509" /> 1924 to 1995, be answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the performance of functions that are assigned to the Department pursuant to any of those Acts, but shall be personally responsible only for such functions of which he or she can reasonably be expected to have personal knowledge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to explain the reasoning behind my amendment.  On Second Stage the Minister said better than I could what part of the problem seems to me to be in terms of trying to establish genuine accountability.  He said: &ldquo;The notion that every Minister can even know about, let alone direct and manage every action every day in his or her Department, is absurd&rdquo;.  This dichotomy between legal requirement and practical reality creates enormous difficulties for us in trying to do our jobs as parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>Everyone, including the Minister of State, who knows the reality of managing anything will be aware that the Ministers and Secretaries Act, as far as the presumption that a Minister can know about everything going on in the Department, has long lost its relevance.  A way must be found to liberate Ministers from the type of responsibility which is still attributed to them when something goes wrong in the Department.  It may go wrong at a low level in certain respects but the repercussions may reverberate and suck the Minister in in terms of responsibility.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister said this Bill would bring the legislative situation into close correspondence with current reality.  This reiteration in section 3 copperfastens, as far as it goes and despite the changes in Departments and among civil servants, the principle underlying the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  My amendment tries to separate general parliamentary accountability which somebody must have, and the Minister is the natural person in this regard, and explain things which need to be explained in departmental terms while protecting the Minister from accusations of personal responsibility for things about which the Minister could not reasonably be expected to know.  How one defines that is a different matter, although it becomes a detail in practice if one accepts the principle.</P>
    <P>I am trying to find a way to separate ministerial departmental responsibility from ministerial personal responsibility.  I could go back over rows in the Dáil which attributed blame to Ministers from all parties, and this has nothing to do with individual parties or Ministers.  It is part of the inevitability of the growth in the size, scale and complexity of Departments that a Minister cannot know everything that happens in his Department. Once that is accepted, as the Minister's speech did, surely there is some way to recognise and incorporate this reality into legislation.  Section 3 ignores that reality.  While it is accepted a Secretary General of a Department cannot be expected to know about everything at all times, this does not apply to a Minister.  Is my understanding of what is involved correct?  What is the Minister of State's reaction to the route I have <Col N="1510" /> tried to signpost along which one might go to achieve this distinction?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee raised a point dear to the hearts of all Ministers and potential Ministers. When replying to Second Stage, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Doyle, explained that under the Bill the Minister would remain legally responsible for all the actions of his or her Department.  However, she expressed the hope that since the Bill identified clearly specific matters which required a personal input from a Minister in relation to a Department or scheduled office, the practice of this House and of Dáil Éireann would evolve in a manner which took account of the distinction in responsibilities which the Bill set out to effect.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee's amendment attempts to give that distinction statutory form and it is one which I suspect would be personally endorsed by every Minister or Minister of State, particularly those who have been pilloried for actions of which he or she knew nothing until they became politically live issues.  If I emphasise personal issues it is because we have a responsibility, in bringing legislation before this House or accepting amendments to it, to ensure that the final product accords with the Constitution.  That is the problem here.  Our Constitution is unambiguous on this point.  It states that Ministers are &ldquo;in charge&rdquo; of Departments and the Government is answerable to Dáil Éireann in respect of those Departments and their activities.  It does not allow for a statutory distinction to be made between answerability and personal responsibility.</P>
      <P>In bringing forward this Bill we have had in various sections to underline the continuing role of Ministers to ensure that the arrangements proposed remained within the confines of what is constitutionally permissible.  That exercise involved elements of walking a tight rope.  I am afraid that following all our natural instincts as politicians and going along with Senator Lee's amendments would cause the Bill to stumble into unconstitutionality.  For that reason only I am compelled, with some reluctance, to oppose the proposed amendment and to rely on the evolution of a set of practices in the House and in the Dáil that will allow the spirit and content of the rest of this Bill to emerge in the way we would all like.  It does not seem constitutionally possible to do what the Senator is proposing and which we probably would prefer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for that explanation.  I take the point that the Constitution may be or is a problem in this respect if one chooses to interpret the Constitution's mention of &ldquo;in charge of&rdquo; in that global way.  Maybe that is the best legal advice one has.  However, if this matter is as important as I for one think it is; if it is important both in terms of managerial efficiency and in terms of the way our political system operates; and if it is important in terms &mdash; which I would hold &mdash; of a Constitution where it <Col N="1511" /> relates to the actual practice of Government, it ought to reconcile reality with practice closely.</P>
      <P>There are symbolic dimensions of Constitutions which are also important and where we all know the image may diverge from the reality or <i>vice versa.</i>  That would not necessarily be a reason in the symbolic sections of a Constitution for wishing to change the symbolism.  Here we are dealing with the actual functioning of government. This is not symbolic, it is practical.  It is also of vital importance for good Government and the most effective possible conduct of government.</P>
      <P>Therefore, all I can say is that if the present Government's advice is that this would be definitely unconstitutional, I will not press something that is so in the current circumstances.  The Constitution is coming under increasing review in terms of possible amendments.  I understand we are shortly to have a referendum about Cabinet confidentiality.  In practical terms this is at least as important as Cabinet confidentiality.  I agree with the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality because I thought, unfortunately, that the Supreme Court ruling was misguided.  Leaving that aside, this particular matter seems to be of such significance that it will continue and become more serious.  It will not go away and Departments will become ever more complex.  The range of responsibilities that Departments and Ministers take upon themselves will grow, so this will remain a problem if we do not do something concrete about it.</P>
      <P>One would hope that practice will evolve in the Oireachtas to take cognisance of the list of things for which Ministers are attributed particular responsibility here.  In reality, however, it will be a difficult for Opposition Deputies to resist the temptation to hold Ministers responsible for something which is not specifically listed here as such.  I strongly urge that the responsible governmental authorities think seriously about the possibility of a constitutional referendum on this issue as soon as possible because it is that important in terms of the realities of good government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his contribution. The Bill has gone a long way towards highlighting particular things for which Ministers will have a high level of accountability.  However, they will have a lower level of accountability in a debate in the House on wider issues about which they could not be expected to know everything. The Houses will recognise those distinctions in time.  It may be worthwhile to consider changing the Constitution in the context of other changes that may arise in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>One must distinguish between symbolism and practicalities in the Constitution. There are few Constitutions which include the degree of detail about the functioning of government as our Constitution.  That may have been done for valid reasons at the time, but perhaps <Col N="1512" /> we should consider deleting or amending them along the lines I have suggested.  I would favour amendment rather than deletion.  I take the Minister's point about the specification of responsibilities. However, as long as section 3 is included, which reiterates the principle of ministerial responsibility with no qualification, any Member of the Oireachtas is entitled, while adhering fully to the letter of the legislation, to hold the Minister personally responsible for anything in his or her Department, including things about which they have no way of knowing.  The legislation is out of kilter with reality, so who can blame Deputies for abiding by the letter of the law? That is why the issue of constitutional change is a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Section 3 agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 deals with responsibility and accountability within Departments and Offices.  Any section which makes Departments more accountable and staff more responsible is welcome.  On Second Stage I said I hoped such accountability would be extended to local authorities and health boards.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Doyle, also emphasised that point on Second Stage.  Departments, particularly heads of Departments, should be more accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the greater precision of accountability, although I question how this will work in practice.  Will Ministers name civil servants who are held accountable for errors or oversights?  How will accountability be perceived to be exercised in the public domain in terms of the attribution of responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A strategy statement is managerial terminology. Who could be against a strategy statement? There are so many demands for strategy statements littering legislation, one wonders how people get time to do anything apart from writing strategy statements.  The section states that strategy statements will be written within six months after the coming into operation of this Act or within six months after the appointment of a new Minister of the Government having charge of the Department.  This seems to be based on the premise that we will have four to five year Governments on a regular basis.  What will be the effect of this legislation if there is a rapid turnover of Governments?  Can one six months' statement cover a number of things?  It might be useful to clarify the rigidity of the six months concept.  I did not table an amendment because nobody can foresee such a situation, but some elasticity should be permitted for circumstances which may <Col N="1513" /> occur in the near future if we do not have regular four to five year Governments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee raised a practical point which I will consider and come back on Report Stage.  Short term Governments occurred in the early 1980s.  We cannot spend six months in Government preparing a strategy statement and then do so again after a general election.  I will reflect on the Senator's point.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Freedom of Information Act, 1997, shall not apply to a record containing&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a strategy statement that has not been approved under subsection (1)(c),</P>
      <P>(b) a preliminary or other draft of the whole or part of the material contained in a strategy statement,</P>
      <P>(c) the unamended version of a strategy statement that is approved under subsection (1)(c) with an amendment, or</P>
      <P>(d) a direction under section 7 in connection with the obligations of the Secretary General of a Department or Head of a Scheduled Office under section 4(1)(b) or 5(1),</P>
      <P>during the period of 5 years immediately following the creation of the record.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to clarify the position of strategy documents in relation to public information.  The strategy document is of fundamental importance in the new administrative structure envisaged in this Bill.  It will be prepared by the secretary general or the head of a scheduled office and approved with or without amendment by the appropriate Minister and then laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It may well be that in the course of preparing and finalising the statement documents, some proposals may be floated which do not survive rigorous appraisal or which fail to secure full political endorsement.  The Government thinks it is important that secretaries general, and those on whom they draw when considering what to include in a statement, should have the fullest freedom and should not be inhibited by any feeling that sensitive issues should not be explored out of fear that should they not find a place in the final authorised document, their subsequent decimation might be used to generate adverse publicity for the Minister or secretary general involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been drafted to deal with that situation only.  It provides that rejected and <Col N="1514" /> discarded drafts do not pass into the public domain through the normal operation of the Freedom of Information Bill, which, having passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas, awaits the President's signature, for a period of five years.  It imposes a similar embargo in relation to directions given by a Minister in connection with the preparation of a strategy statement. I emphasise that this restriction applies only to availability under one piece of legislation; it does not preclude in any way such documents being sought and provided to the courts, to tribunals of inquiry or to Oireachtas committees under the legislation now before the other House. It seeks to place the strategy statement in the public domain but not the drafts involved in its preparation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a dangerous amendment because the Freedom of Information Bill, 1997, has not yet been signed by the President.  Local authorities and health boards are not included in this legislation and now we are excluding people who draft strategy statements.  The danger is that secretaries general will try to include such an exclusion in all legislation.  We must oppose this amendment, otherwise the Freedom of Information Bill will be diluted by new legislation. Civil servants might be inhibited if they are asked questions at an early stage.  Perhaps, however, it will ensure that those who draft strategy statements get it right the first time so that they will not come under such scrutiny.  If strategy statements are the way to go in the future, it would give a better focus on the people making strategy statements.  As Senator Lee said, nobody knows where they will go because of the time limits being placed upon them.  This is an unfortunate dilution of the Freedom of Information Act before that Act even comes into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this amendment quite surprising. Perhaps &ldquo;surprising&rdquo; is not the right word because it is unwarranted.  I described the Freedom of Information Bill as the &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; Bill when it was debated in the House and I am now confirmed in my view that it was such a Bill.  In other words, the general philosophy is that information should be available to the public &mdash; that is a philosophy with which I would agree &mdash; but there are many reasons for not furnishing information.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that when a document is being drafted within the Department it should probably reach completion before it becomes available, but will this be the &ldquo;anti-leaking&rdquo; element of the Bill?  The Minister talked about the potential for adverse publicity when he moved the amendment.  We can be fairly sure that the leaking system would work extremely efficiently if there was a potential for favourable publicity before the strategy statement had been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an immediate example of the limitations of the heralded Freedom of Information Act.  The <Col N="1515" /> question then arises: how many more pieces of legislation with similar limits will there be because we do not want to abide by the terms of a Bill which was put before the House, approved and welcomed by all?  Although I can understand the reason for it, this is quite extraordinary and I do not find it acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I must share the concern expressed by Senator Lanigan and Senator Dardis. It is disappointing that last week we celebrated the passing of the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996, and congratulated ourselves on the fundamental change this would make to the ethos of the public service and almost first thing the following week we are dealing with a Bill in which the &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; mentality appears to operate.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that not everything which is discussed or proposed in Departments can become public knowledge on the day of discussion.  There is a reasonable question to be raised about where a balance is drawn between what is and is not necessarily confidential in the course of policy formulation.  Perhaps it is just unfortunate that this Bill comes before the House at this particular time.</P>
      <P>I want to probe the implications of this a little further.  I got the impression that this was meant to protect civil servants.  As I read it, it seems more likely that it will be used to protect politicians because the Minister used a delicious phrase with regard to an original draft.  He spoke of where it &ldquo;does not survive rigorous appraisal&rdquo;. The implications of that would be that a strategy statement, composed by the secretary general and the brightest and best minds of the Department, may be lacking in rigour.  Who is to provide the rigorous appraisal which finds the departmental submission defective in terms of rigour?  In reality, what we mean by that is that there will be considerations other than administrative or Civil Service rigour which will influence the amendment. In that sense, it is politicians more than civil servants who are intended to be protected by this amendment.</P>
      <P>Where the question of optimising public benefit in the matter arises is whether it is possible to achieve the degree of confidentiality in the formulation of policy at a certain higher level than is envisaged here.  It would be in the interest of public discourse if there was greater public access to thinking at an earlier stage of policy formulation partly because a great deal of what tends to be deemed confidential, because there is an ethos of confidentiality, <i>de facto</i> need not be confidential.  It may well be that everybody in their senses would agree to 90 per cent of the contents of these things; but one invokes or fosters an ethos of confidentiality, the subversion of which was the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act, by making documents 100 per cent confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a specific matter, the amendment states that the Freedom of Information Act shall not <Col N="1516" /> apply to &ldquo;the unamended version of a strategy statement that is approved under subsection (1)(c) with amendment&rdquo;.  Does that mean that if the strategy statement is approved by the relevant Minister without amendment, for which section 5(1)(c) allows, it will then come into the public domain?  Is it only the strategy statement which has been amended after this subsequent &ldquo;rigorous appraisal&rdquo; which will not be available?  After all, if it has not been amended, it is in the public domain already.  That is a way of informing the public that there has not been an amendment, that this is the original strategy statement.  Is my reading of that correct?</P>
    <P>Would it be possible to bring this more into accordance with the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act?  Is it necessary to have this blanket blockage on the entirety of an amended version? I am teasing this out as I stand on my feet, so I am not suggesting there is an infallible way of doing it.  Why the entirety of a document should be blocked before a limited section has been changed is not entirely clear to me. Obviously, it then allows people to home in on the changed area.  Nevertheless, if a document is amended, there will be the suspicion that large sections may have been amended, which would almost be a vote of no confidence in the Civil Service.  I would have thought one might wrestle with the ways which are necessary to preserve what is deemed to be essential confidentiality and at the same time release more information into the public domain or at least not try to block it under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to say a few words on this timely debate because the lack of information brought down one Government and almost brought down a second six months later, when there was a dispute about officials A and B and important issues which affected the State, and politicians had to carry the can.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Burke.  Civil servants and local government staff should be accountable. The day of small local authority developments with the ass and cart are long gone and projects now cost millions of pounds.  If a major mistake is made, one can never find out who made it.  The county manager will defend the people who made it, but one will never find out and the person concerned will never be made accountable.  We have moved away from that and it is high time we rectified that at all levels and left the dark ages.  For far too long there have been people in responsible positions who may not have given their full attention to the job on hands and major mistakes have been made.  The case of officials A and B cost taxpayers a great deal of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six months after the collapse of the Reynolds Administration, the foundations of the current Government were rocked because of a lack of accountability.  A democratically elected Government must be able to obtain the truth and those responsible for administering the system should be obliged to answer for their actions.  Unlike <Col N="1517" /> Pontius Pilate, I am not seeking anyone's head on a plate.  However, people in positions of power at local or national level should be responsible for their work and be accountable to the Minister of the day.</P>

      <P>I reiterate that this proposal does not apply to the strategy statement, which will be placed in the public domain, in full and in a completely transparent way, under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Bill.  In addition, there is nothing attaching to the strategy statement, including previous drafts, etc., which cannot equally be produced before committees of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, the question of concealment of information is not at issue.  What is at issue is the necessity to give civil servants and Ministers space to enter, discuss and consider drafts, table and evaluate proposals and, ultimately, develop a strategy statement which can be placed, in its entirely, in the public domain.  If any Oireachtas committee has concerns about any aspect of the process, it will be free to obtain the fullest information, which can then, if required, be placed in the public domain.</P>
      <P>To expose the freedom of information legislation to the kind of necessary cut and thrust dialogue which should go into the making of a good strategy statement would be likely to inhibit the working of that system to its fullest potential. That system is not designed to protect one side or the other; it is aimed at protecting the relationship so that both sides, civil servants and politicians, can engage in the interaction necessary to produce a good strategy statement.  This will assist and facilitate the efficient, modern approach untilised in the operation of Departments to which Senator Lee alluded.  I do not believe it represents an attempt to prevent the public from gaining access to information in the sense that, through the Oireachtas committees, such information can be quite easily obtained.  I ask Senators to accept that there is nothing more to the matter and that the process outlined is a sensible way to proceed.</P>

      <P>The Senator stated earlier that this represented a precedent or the thin end of <Col N="1518" /> the wedge.  However, I assure him that it is not the intention.

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister of State's assurance.  It is important he placed it on record, that this is not intended as a precedent or thin end of the wedge.  The week after a wide welcome was given to the freedom of information legislation, we were dismayed to believe that that legislation would not apply, for whatever reasons, to certain provisions of the Bill.  This seemed to mean that what had been given with one hand was being taken back by the other.  For this reason, I welcome the Minister of State's explicit commitment that this is not intended in that way.</P>
      <P>I accept that there must be a reasonable balance of confidentiality in the formulation of policy at certain stages.  The Minister of State made a good case in that regard.  However, I suspect that if one had more time to consider this issue in detail, one might develop a slightly different formulation which would be more satisfactory to those who sought the most liberal freedom of information legislation possible.  The Minister of State's assurances go some way towards alleviating my own anxieties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 24, to delete &ldquo;the&rdquo; where it firstly occurs and substitute &ldquo;general policy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the nature of the directions a Minister might give to a secretary general of a Department should as far as possible be clarified. In the context of my earlier amendment about areas of personal responsibility as distinct from institutional responsibility, these should also be confined to matters of real substance and should not involve possible trivia.  For that reason I suggested a Minister ought to confine himself to using the phrase &ldquo;general policy&rdquo; when giving directions because, as it stands, the provision is totally open ended in this regard.  There is a policy implication in this amendment &mdash; it does not simply involve a stylistic revision &mdash; which concerns the legislative image and perception of relation between Ministers and secretaries general. I would welcome the Minister's response on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1519" />
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, as set out in the Bill, would allow a Minister to give a direction to a secretary general on any matter other than a dismissal.  Senator Lee's amendment would confine this power to the general policy obligations of a secretary general.  I am conscious that earlier proposals for public service reform, particularly those contained in the report of the Public Service Organisation Review Group in the late 1960s, emphasised a distinction between policy and execution.  I accept that the board delineation of functions between Ministers and secretaries general set out in the Bill attempts to follow in some respects this broad distinction.  However, our experience and that of other jurisdictions in the intervening years suggests that the distinction between policy and execution is less easy to effect in practice than previously thought and securing consensus on whether a specific matter falls on a particular side of the boundary line tends to be difficult.  That circumstance alone would make me wary of any restriction which confined a direction specifically to the words &ldquo;general policy obligations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is, however, a second point to which I already alluded which involves the need to preserve, because of the strict requirements of our Constitution, the position of the Minister as the person in charges of his or her Department.  Whether he or she has a wide power to direct is possibly the crucial touchstone by which the reality of a Minister's chargeship can be ascertained.  For these two broad reasons, the difficulty of defining &ldquo;general policy obligations&rdquo; and in particular because of the constitutional imperative that the Minister is the person in charge, I cannot accept the amendment, although I accept the spirit in which it is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I hear about constitutional imperatives, the more I think of the need to revise the Constitution.  In general, if there is agreement in terms of operational efficiency, invoking the Constitution is a way of inviting suggestion for its revision.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister of State's point that the distinction between policy and execution cannot be drawn in black and white in many instances.  That was probably too abstract a distinction as drawn originally in the Devlin report because they can feed on one another and influence one another. That said, I would seek a phraseology whereby if one were to amend a general policy one would be talking about general execution as distinct from anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important in terms of good public management to convey that it is not the responsibility of a Minister to consider that he or she should be involved in possibly minute detail as a matter of course.  Mindsets are important in such matters and the sooner Ministers acquire managerial mindsets the better &mdash; as distinct from the mindset that anything which arrives on the desk can be dealt with as a matter of course.  It is important <Col N="1520" /> to instil that ethos into governmental concepts of decision making.  While the Minister of State's invocation of the constitutional dimension adds a further layer which had not been in my mind when I drafted the amendment, from the point of view of management efficiency and the way in which Minister's conceive of their roles, the more that can be sharpened and tightened the better. My amendment goes in the right direction even if it cannot be accepted at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Senator made about the Constitution is as relevant to this issue as to others he raised and I will pass on his points to the Minister.  There is a specific reference to the giving of instructions in writing.  From my limited experience I do not think Ministers would be disposed to giving written instructions to secretaries on minor issues.  There is constant dialogue between Ministers and senior civil servants but a matter would have to be fairly serious before a Minister would put pen to paper to issue a direction in writing.  The likelihood of it being abused over every minute detail is fairly remote.  I do not want to harp on the point, but the constitutional imperative does not allow us to accept the amendment.  However, the Senator's comments are well taken.</P>

      <P>In page 7,lines 34 to 36, to delete paragraphs (a) and (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  provide policy advice in relation to the subject-matter of the assignment and related matters,</P>
      <P>(b)  achieve the outputs specified in the assignment,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This may appear a somewhat precious amendment in that it proposes to rearrange subparagraphs (a) and (b) in the list in section 9 (1). However, it is important in terms of the ethos or mindest of the Bill.  To my mind, the first responsibility of a senior civil servant &mdash; it is senior civil servants who are in question here although assignments are made &mdash; is to provide policy advice to the Minister and further up the line.  People of the highest possible calibre are recruited to become senior civil servants on the basis of an assessment of their quality of mind and their capacity to give high quality, disinterested and informed advice.  I consider that the top priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be indicated that the paragraphs (a) to (f) are not listed in a hierarchy of importance, but we need not linger over that.  Paragraph (a) refers <Col N="1521" /> to achieving outputs specified and paragraph (b) to providing policy advice.  I would like them reversed because it seems to me that policy comes before achievement of the outputs which result from policy decisions.  I would like that mentality carried as far down as possible in departmental structures.  It may seem a pedantic revision to alphabetical rankings but there is something more important involved.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Appeals Officers with independent authority to receive and investigate complaints from the public on any function or matter which has been assigned under this Act must be appointed in each Department or Agency where such officers do not already exist prior to the commencement of this Act&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>While some Departments or officers have appeals officers, their function is not so much to deal with complaints as to adjudicate on decisions made by others which are challenged. They tend to operate with regard to very specific categories of decisions rather than as a local complaints officers, which Senator Roche envisages.</P>
      <P>The Bill envisages a more formal assignment and recording of assignment of responsibility than exists at present.  Assignments begin from the Minister to the secretary-general and cascade downwards through the hierarchy of the Department or office.  The range of matters to be formally assigned includes giving advice, ensuring service quality or value for money.  Taken at face value, Senator Roche's amendment would provide for a person in each Department who would deal with complaints against the secretary, for example, in relation to value for money, quality of advice etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives a formal statutory basis to certain arrangements which have come into being and operated on an informal, extra-statutory basis for many years.  It does not give the various civil servants involved statutory powers which they exercise outside the purview of Ministers, <Col N="1522" /> the Oireachtas or its committees.  The Bill is clear that everyone below the level of secretary-general in a Department to whom a function is assigned is accountable to the secretary-general, who is in turn accountable to the Minister.  Therefore, accountability will not be a mere formality, particularly when it is combined &mdash; as the Minister, Deputy Quinn, indicated that it would &mdash; with a system of performance management.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche has a professional expertise in this area and I do not have to indicate to him that there is an Ombudsman to deal with unresolved problems between Departments and their clients. In his report the Ombudsman spelled out what he sees as acceptable standards of administrative procedures.  My Department is preparing a series of amendments to the Ombudsman's legislation and legislation on administrative procedures which it is intended to link in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche is familiar from previous experience with how the Civil Service works in practice.  He might hold the belief that each official in the chain of command is so committed to rallying around a subordinate against whom a complaint is made that nothing less than 30 or so independent complaints officers can ensure fair treatment in this respect.  My experience, which is not as extensive, either as a public representative or in the three Departments in which I have held office, does not lead me to the same conclusion, although I understand the Senator's thinking.  The issue could be more appropriately dealt with in the context of the Ombudsman legislation. Accordingly, I do not support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Under this legislation a wider range of public servants will appear before Oireachtas committees than has officially been the case hitherto.  It is vitally important that a good working relationship exists between civil servants and such committees.  There is a danger of a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; syndrome emerging, if it has not emerged already.  In terms of good government, the more both sides see each other as part of the same team as distinct from playing against each other, the better it will be.  Inevitably there will be conflict from time to time, but the ethos of collectivity or co-ordination is most important in this respect.  I hope both sides will remember they are playing for the same side.</P>

At times it might be a reflection of the frustration which backbenchers and Senators might feel at not being able to tackle the problems that when they get access to a civil servant who has perhaps made a mistake or an error of judgment, they wish to hammer him or her in public.  That has created great fear among civil servants of coming before committees.  It is necessary that both sides try to resolve that conflict without taking from the cut and thrust which is important to the public.</P>

      <P>In page 8, lines 48 to 50, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The terms and conditions of employment and the qualifications of a Special Adviser, shall be such as may be determined from time to time by the Minister for Finance, subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one of those who are so churlish and unsporting as to regard this section as that which is closest to the hearts of members of the Government. I put down this amendment to seek clarification. If one were to seek a criticism of the Bill from those who believe it is welcome legislation which is moving in the right direction, it is the danger that two parallel authorities existing within the same Department can lead to conflict, contradiction and confusion and that the authority of the secretary general within the Department <Col N="1524" /> is in danger of being undermined by this perceived parallel authority.</P>
    <P>I have long advocated the introduction of some type of outside advice and perspective, although not necessarily the <i>cabinet</i> system with which we have become familiar in Brussels or Paris.  The possibility of an outside perspective should be incorporated into how we approach these matters because many departments historically tended to become too introverted.  I do not oppose the principle of the section but am simply looking at how it can be made most effective.</P>
    <P>My amendment refers to terms and conditions of employment and to qualifications.  There is no reference in the section to the qualifications required by a special adviser, aside from being nominated to be a special adviser.  All civil servants must have specified qualifications for entry to the Civil Service.  Special advisers are not civil servants in that sense.  However, there is a danger of not just two parallel streams of advice or influence but of two parallel streams with potentially conflicting concepts and views.  It would be unfortunate to make provisions in the legislation for the appointment of people to potentially influential positions with, possibly for the first time in legislation, no reference to the qualifications required. Even if one states that no specific qualifications are required and that somebody can be parachuted into a position, I would like to see the reason for it.</P>
    <P>What will the qualifications be?  We must look at the functions of a special adviser.  Incidentally, the number of special advisers is open ended.  In terms of good management practice, I presume there will be realistic number for particular circumstances even if one cannot predict what it ought to be.  &ldquo;One or more special advisers&rdquo; is an elastic concept of what good management practice might require from time to time.</P>
    <P>The functions of the special adviser is, first, to provide advice.  The type of advice is not specified. What qualifications are required for somebody whose first functions is to provide advice to a Ministers?  I do not presume to know and I would like an explanation of what is envisaged, knowing that much thought went into the conceptualisation of this requirement.  The second function is monitoring, facilitating and securing the achievement of Government objectives that relate to the Department.  That obviously requires people of high calibre and great sensitivity to policy formulation.  I would be more confident if specification about the requirements of that person were included in the legislation.  These people do not grow on trees and a case could be made for some type of qualification requirements being stitched into the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have also included the terms and conditions of employment being subject to the approval of the Oireachtas for this reason: what are such people worth?  If they are to be high level functionaries, as it appears from their responsibilities defined in this section, and they are to provide <Col N="1525" /> unlimited advise to the Minister, how does one put a reasonable value on their services?</P>
    <P>I raise this from a broader perspective because I believe we do not sufficiently reward our best civil servants, by which I mean those giving good advice.  They are worth far more than their remuneration acknowledges.  They are not rewarded enough for the work they do or for being responsible for public funds.  If a good public servants gives good advice, they can save or make the State substantial sums of money for which, in private employment, they would get bonus payments and performance recognition worth much more than anything they would get in the public sector.  However, a bad public servant can correspondingly lose a substantial amount, but I like to think the bulk of our senior public servants are very good.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the Government thinks would constitute a fair and equitable remuneration for a special adviser in the light of the seriousness of the responsibilities he or she would have to undertake.</P>

There seems to be a proliferation of a special advisers.  I am prepared to accept that Government Departments and Ministers should have people available to them from whatever area is the Department's responsibility and expert advice is welcome. While much of that can be given on a voluntary basis, there is a difference between it and with what this section is concerned, which is political advice.

I have no problem with cumann and branch secretaries doing this on a voluntary basis&mdash;and they do it all the time&mdash;but I and, I think, most taxpayers have a problem with it being paid for out of taxes.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee is correct on the issue of qualifications. We are asked here to sign a blank cheque to provide for advisers <i>ad infinitum.</i> There is nothing to stop a Minister having 430 advisers in his or her Department and office.  The proliferation of personnel in ministerial offices since 1981 should be examined as there has been an exponential explosion.  It is costing taxpayers tens of millions of pounds every year.  Ministerial offices now have four dozen personnel working in them where in 1981 there had only two or three.  That is partly a reflection of the changing nature of political life.  However, there are also dozens of advisers and constituency secretaries and Senator Lee is correct when he makes the point that the issue of their numbers is not dealt with in this section.</P>

Senator Lee is correct when he says we are paying for any number of these personnel, a shadow civil service, without requesting any requirements of qualifications or experience.  The only requirement is that they be politically affiliated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember when advisers were first introduced because I thought it was a good innovation. At the time it could be seen why they were brought in because they added something to what was done in Government Departments.  They <Col N="1527" /> provided Ministers with the kind of political advice and co-ordination which they do not get nor should they expect from civil servants.  All we have now are political hacks doing the constituency work of Ministers.  A way has been found around the limitation placed on the numbers of people in Minister's offices.  That is reprehensible.</P>
    <P>All political parties in power in the past ten years, including mine, bear responsibility for this. In the last Government, which comprised Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, there were a number of advisers but all those employed by Ministers from my party, with one exception, were civil servants. The other party in Government employed people who were all clearly political and there has been a proliferation of them since.  There is no qualification requirement for these advisers other than they be political.  There is nothing to stop a Minister in the next Administration from appointing every secretary in their constituency as an adviser.  One could logically argue that this would give the Minister an insight into the feeling on the ground.  However, it would not be agreed to by the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>This provision is deficient on several grounds. Senator Lee correctly pointed out that there are no requirements regarding qualifications.  There is no mention of salaries &mdash; it is an open ended cheque.  The top adviser is paid the same if not more than a senior civil servant.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about this amendment.  Senator Roche made a strong case for the need for some control on special advisers.  I have some experience of special advisers.  I am not talking about the kind of advisers the Senator spoke about. These advisers have been very beneficial to the operations of Departments.  A colleague of mine worked without pay in relation to purchasing by the Department of Health.  His contribution was very beneficial to the Department.</P>
      <P>If this House was to determine the qualifications needed by every adviser, we might not be improving the management systems in the public service.  Senator Lee referred to best practice.  It would not be best practice if the appointment of every adviser had to come before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some difficulty with the use of the term &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo;.  Senator Lee's proposal would result in us having to be informed of, and discuss, the qualifications of every proposed adviser.  That <Col N="1528" /> is not best management practice.  However, I am supportive of what the Senator is trying to achieve.  He is trying to introduce some control on the proliferation of advisers, who are costing huge amounts of money to the taxpayers.  They are not necessarily being selected for business or management expertise but for political reasons. We need to hear the Government's response to this and the next amendment.  I will wait until I hear those responses before deciding how to proceed.</P>

The primary of Parliament is being continually eroded.  Decisions are increasingly made by the Executive.  These decisions are then rubber stamped by Parliament.  The voting majority in the Houses supports the Government's decision.  I have no difficulty with that, but there is a tendency for Governments of whatever complexion to ignore the view of Parliament. That is dangerous.  For this reason it is appropriate that advisers should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.  The Oireachtas approves the formation of the Government and the Cabinet.  We should also approve advisers if they are regarded as part of Government.  In America, committees examine the suitability of candidates for senior Government positions.  That is a good system which we should imitate.</P>

A Minister who employed a dud to deal with these matters would be foolish.  Advisers are highly qualified and should not be referred to as political hacks. We can all talk about jobs for the boys.  There are strict terms and conditions laid down for the appointment of these advisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember the Cork by-election in which he was elected.  During that campaign one of the Minister's colleague parties in Government &mdash;Democratic Left &mdash; circulated a blue leaflet in the constituency with a picture of a Rolls Royce leaving Government Buildings.  That leaflet referred to political hacks being employed as advisers.  I did not coin the term.  I have a copy of that leaflet which was used <Col N="1529" /> throughout the by-election.  It makes interesting reading, particularly considering Democratic Left's actions on coming into Government.  No one took to the Mercs and perks of office more than our socialist friends.</P>
      <P>The functions referred to by Senator Calnan are carried out by the Civil Service.  The Civil Service deals admirably with ECOFIN and the Intergovernmental Conference.  Senator Burke made a valid point that advisers are there to pull together the diverse elements within the legislative programme.  I understand that point. However, my concern is that the concept of adviser and programme manager has been debased by this Government.  I can provide the Senator with evidence of an adviser being paid in excess of £40,000 a year from the taxpayers' budget.  As we speak, he is visiting housing estates in Wicklow in a State car.</P>

      <P>This gentleman is not standing for election.  This person works for the other Minister of State.  The Minister knows that the reality is that this grade has been debased.  If this Bill is to stand, some form of parliamentary clearance &mdash; I take the point made by Senator Quinn that an adviser's job description cannot be written &mdash; is necessary.  Currently, the only scrutiny and control for this proliferation of nettles are parliamentary questions, which one has to ask every six months.  We would not be doing our job if we did not put a halt to this.</P>
      <P>If we are to allow this section to stand, the essential elements of Senator Lee's amendment must be included.  There is a series of controls on numbers, qualifications and the cost of civil servants, which is right and proper.  Since 1981 there has been a progressive series of policies to reduce the number of civil servants.  The first programme managers, or advisers as they were called, came in the mid-1970s and the number has increased several hundred per cent.  There has never been so many advisers.  Perhaps Senator Burke is correct in saying many hands have to be held in a multi-party coalition.  The reality is that this section gives a blank cheque, not just to this but to every Administration from here to Tib's Eve, to do what it wants with the public purpose.  This is not good legislation.  I have no doubt that if the Minister was in Opposition and a Government of a different hue produced this legislation, he would make the points I am making.</P>
      <P>There is a role for advisers provided they are controlled, qualified and make necessary inputs which cannot come from the full-time Civil Service. We are giving people a blank cheque.  We will regret it if this section is agreed &mdash; perhaps not in this Administration but in those to come. There has been an exponential increase in the number of advisers over the last ten years.  It is up to us as lawmakers to deal with this issue comprehensively. We are not doing that in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>He has been to Cork about four times, mainly to see his mother.  That is the background I am coming from.  I am also aware my party was a severe critic of this principle when it first emerged.  It has now taken to it like a duck to water.  I do not deny that.  In principle, the system is quite effective.</P>
      <P>The amendments proposed by Senator Lee broadly fall under two headings.  The first is that the Minister for Finance should specify the qualifications of a special adviser.  The fundamental thrust of the section as proposed in the Bill is that advisers have a relationship with the particular Minister or Minister of State which will differ in character from that of a permanent civil servant. The skills and attributes which are and will be required of them will be dictated by the problems and the agenda facing the particular Minister. What is demanded of them will be influenced by his or her perception of what is needed to ensure that part of the Government's programme for which he or she is responsible progresses with the minimum of difficulty and the maximum awareness of the Minister's priorities and agenda and the relevant importance to them of actions taken.</P>
      <P>In some instances he or she may be selected to provide a Minister with skills which complement his or her own or to provide a counterbalance or devil's advocate element to advice of a technical nature coming from official sources.  From my own experience the most important qualifications are those of trust, reliability and competence.  I do not know how these can be packaged into a conventional specification of actual qualifications, a difficulty alluded to by Senator Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second suggestion included in Senator Lee's amendment is that whatever qualifications are specified by the Minister for Finance should be subject to approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  At present the Minister for Finance, and the full weight of the advice available to him <Col N="1531" /> in his Department, has to be invoked on remuneration.  In my experience it takes a long time before that authentication is given.  I am not sure what precise mechanism is envisaged in this amendment.  Before anyone is employed is it envisaged that on the appointment of a new Government, each House should debate, Department by Department or office by office, the specific qualifications to be sought when advisers are recruited; or does the Senator envisage a general qualification laid down in advance and applicable to all future appointees?  I do not think either of these is feasible or practical.</P>
    <P>It has to be borne in mind that advisers, even more than politicians, are birds of passage and are not permanent appointees.  The fact that each appointment under this Bill has to be made by Government rather than an individual Minister or Minister of State provides sufficient protection against abuse, as does the general accountability of Ministers through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Permanent civil servants being made advisers is a matter of choice between individual Governments and Ministers.  Senator Roche is right in saying that most of the programme managers in the last Fianna Fáil administration were civil servants. There is no saving to the taxpayer in this.  If a civil servant is removed from his or her normal departmental role, he or she has to be replaced. From the taxpayer's point of view, there is no difference between using a permanent civil servant or someone outside the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I do not intend to accept Senator Lee's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept these issues require teasing out.  The contributions by Senator Dardis, Senator Quinn, Senator Roche, Senator Burke and Senator Calnan have illustrated some of the reasons I formulated my amendments along these lines.</P>
      <P>I support the use of outside expertise which may not be available within the Department.  It helps to broaden departmental perspectives if that expertise can be incorporated effectively into decision making.  However, I am struck by what has been said by those with more experience of the political process.  I accept that many existing and previous advisers, including the Minister's, have contributed far more than they will get back from the State in remunerative or other terms. They have made a significant contribution.  It is important in particular to facilitate cross departmental activities for which the Civil Service by virtue of its structure is not well equipped to cope.  Problems often transcend Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the casual legislative approach to genuine, objective problems.  There is casualness in the open-ended approach outlined in the Bill and the almost complete absence of information to the Houses of the Oireachtas about qualifications of advisers and what may happen as numbers proliferate.  Senator Roche was emphatic about the proliferation of numbers. <Col N="1532" /> I had not realised they had expanded so rapidly since 1981.  The provision of &ldquo;one or more&rdquo; is so open-ended that Ministers or Ministers of State could become used of the idea of an endless number of special advisers &mdash; and there are always political arguments revolving around Government, constituency, etc. as to why there should be more.</P>
    <P>It is time to take a more considered view of the role of and controls over special advisers.  We need a clearer idea of how we envisage special advisers contributing significantly to the effectiveness of Government.  I do not think section 11 is sufficiently well conceptualised to get the best from the role of special advisers.</P>
    <P>Senator Calnan referred to the high level tasks with which a number of special advisers are entrusted.  I have no problem with this.  Indeed, I do not see why they should be present if they are not involved in high level decision making. However, this is all the more reason for ensuring that their qualifications are commensurate with their responsibilities.  This does not mean that every individual has to be cased in a detailed way by the Houses of the Oireachtas, although there is something to be said for Senator Dardis's idea about bringing in a degree of interrogation associated with the American system.</P>
    <P>In his introductory speech the Minister said it was no exaggeration to say that this Bill is the most important legislative provision affecting the administration of central Government since the original Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924. Section 11 deals in a very casual way with a significant component of public administration which may grow in importance and will certainly grow in numbers.  We need to look very closely at its implications.</P>
    <P>While I accept the principle of the section, I remain uneasy about its looseness.  I will wait to hear what Senators Roche and Dardis have to say in support of opposing the section rather than amending it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of the proliferation of special advisers until today.  This amendment has been useful in that it brought this proliferation to light.  It needs some control, although I am not sure how best this can be achieved.  I am concerned at the Minister's response as he has not relieved the concerns expressed.  I understand the deep and clear concerns being voiced by others apart from those who have spoken today. There is concern about the proliferation of advisers among the public and if knowledge of that proliferation was widespread there would be more concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution controls the number of Cabinet members &mdash; at least we thought there was a control.  The number now seems to be 15.5.  Perhaps the Minister could suggest or take into account suggestions of how to overcome the problem of the dramatic increase in special advisers and the lack of control on them apart from that exercised by the Minister for Finance. <Col N="1533" /> The Minister for Finance has not been too successful in controlling numbers.  If this is best management practice I would like to be convinced. I would like the Minister to say how he intends relieving the concerns expressed.</P>

      <P>If there was a normal parliamentary system with the Minister coming before Parliament on a regular basis there would be much less need to bring advisers before Congress.  The parallel with the system in the United States is not entirely valid.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche spoke about proliferation. There are numerous advisers today in comparison with 1980 when there was none.  However, the number is very strictly controlled.  When I came into office I was given a memorandum outlining in precise terms that I could have three personnel by way of programme managers and special advisers as a Cabinet Minister and two as Minister of State.  This is very clear cut.  There is no question of bringing in all cumainn secretaries and appointing them as advisers.  There are specific regulations from the Government allowing Cabinet members to have a programme manager and two advisers and Ministers of State to have two such personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I wish to kill the notion raised by Senator Quinn regarding the potential for proliferation of advisers and the possibility that a Government could facilitate that proliferation.  The current numbers provided for is reasonable and I find the prospect of Governments embarking upon a proliferation of numbers incomprehensible.  There may be an argument for a Government to decide that one adviser might be warranted for a particular Department.  We did not feel the Bill should contain definite numbers.</P>
      <P>The position is not being abused in my view. One could certainly say that, because there were no special advisers in 1980 whereas there are today, there has been a huge increase.  I do not think there has been any significant increase per Minister between this Administration and the previous one.  I do not have precise information on that but I think the system has evolved over the past ten years to the point where we have reached a plateau on numbers.  In relation to the salary levels of special advisers, the public service element of the Department of Finance as well as the Minister are very involved with those to ensure that people are not out of line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> While I made the comment that I regarded my own special adviser as being capable of earning more money elsewhere, I am happy to say he is thrilled to be doing the job.  He and I recognise that he will probably be more valuable when he returns to the workplace as a result of his experience. I am not making a case, nor is he, for paying him more.  I am merely making the point that he is not overpaid and that, generally speaking, there is a rigid approach to the issue of special advisers and programme managers.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for the Marine, my programme manager there was an actuary who had come from Irish Life.  He could clearly be earning more money elsewhere but is happy to do the job he is doing and is gaining a good deal of valuable experience.  In that sense, the remunerations is fair because the experience of being close to Government is unique for somebody who will be returning to the private sector.  The system works well, in my view, and I do not think there is any huge proliferation in numbers.  I am sure Senators will want to comment on the potential for such proliferation when we discuss the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>We were exercising a great deal of restraint.  It is very difficult to speak on an amendment without straying into the issue of numbers. My grave concern with section 11 is that we are giving an open-ended and unlimited remit to every Administration from this day forward to introduce as many advisers as they wish.  That is bad law.  On the basis of what the Minister has said, the number of advisers has gone from three or four in the mid-eighties to a minimum of 75 today.  That is proliferation by any standard.</P>
      <P>I think the words &ldquo;relative austerity&rdquo; are appropriate in the Minister's case.  I could not conceive of a case were the Minister would instruct his adviser to start knocking on doors in council estates in Cork asking people if they had any problem with their drains.  Unfortunately, not all the Minister's colleagues are exercising the same degree of constraint.  There is a well documented case in Wicklow where an adviser employed in the office of a Minister of State is doing precisely that.  Anybody could do that; it is not necessary for an adviser, who is being paid £45,000 per annum by the taxpayer, to do that. That is wrong and it is an abuse which should not be tolerated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to Senator Lee's point, the problem is that there is no remit, terms of reference or job specifications for this task.  The task of adviser is an important one and I have always accepted the principle that it is important that Ministers should be able to call on fresh advice from time to time. Where there are a number of parties in government <Col N="1536" /> together, it is important that a Minister should have somebody close to them to assist them to co-ordinate activities.  That is a role which has a political element attached to it and which could not be fulfilled by the traditional Civil Services.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look at the cost of running Ministers' offices &mdash; including the cost of advisers, programme managers, special constituency assistants and so on &mdash; today and compare it with that which prevailed ten years ago?  There has been an absolute explosion in costs which is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 we are giving a legislative basis to the concept of adviser but we are doing so without putting any form of qualification on numbers, quality, capacity or the kind of people who would be seeking the job.  We are not providing for any proper scrutiny of advisers.  I am not a fan of the American system of scrutiny but a similar system here would give us the benefit of bringing advisers before a committee of both Houses and asking them how they feel they will increase the efficiency or the effectiveness of the operations of public administration.  In many cases special advisers achieve that but in others they do not.</P>
    <P>The draft legislation currently before us does not provide any restriction whatsoever on the number of special advisers who may be appointed.  If we have 75 special advisers operating in Departments at the moment, there is no reason to believe we will not have 750 in ten years time.  We have actually gone from having seven or eight special advisers ten years ago to 75 today.  I do not know what the total cost of these advisers is but I would like to know and to compare it with the cost ten years ago.  I know there has been a series of parliamentary questions on this issue over the years.  We have come to associate integrity and honesty with this Minister but he mentioned the criticisms his own party levelled at the issue of advisers when they were in Opposition not too long ago.  Some of that criticism I felt was over the top but much of it was valid. Incidentally, it is not valid to say that it is the same thing if civil servants do this job as people from outside the Civil Service.  The net additional costs are significant from bringing in advisers.</P>
    <P>My greatest concern relates to what exactly advisers do.  If we can show objectively that advisers, programme managers and the special assistants who have been brought in in recent years are engaged in the process of public administration and if they serve the public rather than individual narrow political interests I would have no problem with that.  However, in a number of cases advisers are clearly an abuse of the system. There was a well documented case in the past years and a half of an adviser who had difficulties with the Department of Social Welfare.  The case was well documented at the time because it was carried in <i>The Examiner.</i>  I do not know the outcome of the case but it brings us back to the point made by Senator Lee that it is bad if we do not have control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> It would be fine if the Minister said there would be a limit of one or two advisers per Minister, but it will be one or more.  At some stage in the future my hypothesis that one could engage everyone involved in one's political operations at constituency level in some advisory capacity is not nonsense because that is being provided for in this Bill.  Looking at the junior partner or the third party in this Government, it is extraordinary that having been hysterical about the issue of advisers and programme managers in a by-election, it managed to bring virtually everyone who worked for it at national level on to the public pay roll.  Not all of those people are engaged in improving the lot of &ldquo;Ireland Incorporated&rdquo;, but are clearly pursuing a political agenda with significant pay.</P>
    <P>The issue of advisers is highlighted in this section and we need terms of reference for advisers and some control.  If the House allows this measure through without a challenge, we are doing ourselves, politics and public administration in the future a disservice.  In the full knowledge that everything is not as it should be, we are endorsing something we know is wrong. There are abuses at present, but I accept many advisers are fine people.  I am not suggesting for a moment that they are all wrong because that would be a grotesque injustice.  Many are fine people and are working for salaries below those which they could properly command outside the public administration system.</P>
    <P>We need control, otherwise we will regret it and will have given <i>carte blanche</i> and have written into law a potential rogue's charter, something in which we should not take pride.  I am not suggesting for a moment that is the Minister's intention.  This is good legislation which, in its generally, has my support.  However, this legislation looks at core issues relating to public administration and addresses the concept of ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>Originally, I proposed that the section be deleted and not opposed.  It is a mistake to incorporated this section in the Bill because it addresses something other than the issue of advisers, which would have been better dealt with in separate legislation dealing with Civil Service regulations, amendments or something of that order.  The Minister would probably see validity in that point.  We can only speak about what is before us, which contains a danger of future abuse.  That is the reason I oppose this section and not to make a cheap political point, which is not my style and why I am interested in politics.  I am here to try to do something, particularly in the area of public administration in which I am interested.  It is time somebody rang the alarm bells about this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also oppose this section, which should be deleted.  I do not understand the reason for the inclusion of this section.  Senator Roche rightly said this matter could have been dealt with in separate legislation.  I recall that when an <Col N="1538" /> additional Minister of State was required above the specified number, the matter was dealt with in legislation.  It would be easy to do the same in this regard.  What is at issue is not whether there should be advisers but the nature of their job&mdash; whether it is to provide technical support and to advise the Minister of the legislative areas in his Department and so on or a political support. Senator Calnan said one of their functions was to deal with their constituencies.  It is inappropriate for a special adviser to telephone the county manager in a county council to do some constituency work on behalf of the Minister.  We must draw a distinction.</P>
      <P>The deficiency is that everybody, except the special adviser, is defined in the Bill.  We define &ldquo;head&rdquo;, &ldquo;Minister of the Government&rdquo;, &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; and &ldquo;Secretary General&rdquo; and not special adviser, which should be defined because there is a considerable degree of confusion about what these people do.  If they are to be included &mdash;I do not believe they should be &mdash; they should defined.  If one follows the logic of including special advisers in the Bill, one should also include consultants, of which there is a proliferation. There is a saying that if one has the knowledge but not the equipment, one should set up as a consultant.  Departments and county councils must be a godsend to consultants.</P>
      <P>People who are good at their job and who are in a position to give expert advice, like the person whom the Minister described, are worth money and it is appropriate that they should be available to Government.  Much voluntary expertise is available to members of the Government if they seek it.  It brings us back to their function.  Do they perform a purely political task?  There are a couple of cases where the technical connection between these people and the activity of the Department is extremely tenuous.  This leads us to the conclusion that they are fulfilling a political function at the taxpayers' expense, which is in appropriate.  There is nothing wrong with drawing these people from within the Civil Service.  I wonder what departmental Secretaries think of special advisers and the degree to which they believe they must report to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the powers conferred on special advisers.  Section 4(1)(d) relating to secretaries general states: &ldquo;providing advice to the Minister of the Government&rdquo;.  It then delimits the advice by stating: &ldquo;in respect to any matter within, affecting or connected with, the responsibility of the Minister or the Department or Scheduled Office giving rise to material expenditure chargeable to its appropriation account;&rdquo;.  There is no such delimitation on advice given by the special adviser.  Section 11 (2)(a)(<i>ii</i>) states: &ldquo;monitoring, facilitating and securing the achievement of Government objectives that relate to the Department&rdquo;. That is a considerable power.  Section 11(2)(a)(iii) states: &ldquo;performing such other functions <Col N="1539" /> as may be directed by the Minister&rdquo;, which is appropriate.</P>

      <P>It would be inappropriate if the direction was to canvass.  It is appropriate that the Minister should give directions to advisers who must be under their control.  The powers conferred on advisers in the Bill are so broad that they are totally inappropriate.  Senator Lee made the point about the quality of people in the permanent Civil Service and the degree to which they are rewarded.  It is certainly the case that some of our most senior civil servants would get significantly more money in the private sector.  It is a credit to them that they take their service to the State responsibly and accept service as being something important and that they continue to work within the public service.  Take the example of Mr. Michael Dowling, who is retiring as Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is appropriate that we should be able to mention his name.  I am quite certain that Mr. Dowling's remuneration would have increased had he gone into the private sector, but he stayed in the public sector up to retirement.  I suspect that had he left a few years ago &mdash; and he might have been tempted to do so on a few occasions &mdash; he would have been an extremely marketable commodity.</P>

Special advisers are within the public service and there should not be a political connection, which is quite evident.  It is totally inappropriate, to quote Senator Roche's case, and it is nothing more or less than a misuse of the system.  There was an implicit acceptance by the Minister that there is abuse when he pointed to his own situation. He is able to defend the advice he is given, and I accept that defence, but he almost implicitly accepted that there were abuses in other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to concentrate on one aspect of this.  When I read the Bill first I welcomed the definition of special adviser.  I am a believer in getting the best advice and trying to use it.  I do not have a problem with that.  In management terms it has been a useful addition to government.  The Civil Service has benefited from the extra help of special advisers.  On some occasions the Civil Service may have rejected the thought of this happening and, therefore, it is better to have it defined in writing.  Therefore, I welcome it.</P>
      <P>I accept entirely the point Senator Dardis has made.  I am not sure whether this is the right place for it to be written down.  I am concerned, however, about the lack of control over the number of advisers.  If the only way to solve this is to have a debate &mdash; as Senators Dardis, Roche and Lee have done &mdash; to oppose the Bill, then this is the right place to have it.</P>
      <P>If I understood the Minister of State correctly, he said Cabinet members have three special advisers or programme managers between them. I reckon that is a total of 45.  The 17 Ministers of State have another 34 advisers.  So, we suddenly have a maximum of 79 special advisers or programme managers.  I think, however, that figure will become the minimum because each Minister is told they may have three advisers while each Minister of State may have two.  Suddenly, without any control by this House or by the State, other than through the Minister for Finance, we now find a situation where there are &mdash; permanently, I suggest &mdash;79.  There is nothing to stop that number suddenly jumping upwards because some other Government, perhaps a coalition Government, could give Ministers four advisers instead of three, and Ministers of State three advisers instead of two.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this section.  I want to hear the Minister of State's response.  We talked about proliferation earlier and there is concern about the lack of control over numbers.  I would welcome a solution to this.  Rather than totally removing the section from the Bill, there may be a better solution.  It is a healthy sign to have the position of special advisers recognised in legislation, but I would like to be able to control it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section of the Bill because it clearly lays out the position regarding special advisers.  In negotiating a programme for Government after the 1992 election, the two parties involved agreed to, and availed of, programme managers and advisers.  It does not make a difference whether they came from outside or inside the Civil Service because it was the choice of the parties to pick their own programme managers and advisers.  People who came from the Civil Service to work as programme managers or advisers went outside the Civil Service in such posts.  Therefore, they were not acting as civil servants, <Col N="1541" /> although some people may have given that impression.</P>
      <P>If we exclude this section from the Bill we will go back to the <i>status quo.</i>  A question is being raised here concerning the qualifications and integrity of many people who have been programme managers and special advisers for the four parties that have been in Government at various times since the last election.  They did a fine job in synchronising what was being done between Ministers.  We should not try to belittle them over some small incidents that may have occurred.</P>
      <P>If an adviser is free, he or she should be able to go canvassing in their own spare time.  Very often in the past too many people were straight-jacketed in situations where they could not go canvassing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>After Senator Calnan's contribution there may be some misunderstanding, so I want to make it quite clear that I welcome the idea of special advisers.  In fact, I was being castigated 15 years ago or more for recommending the idea of special advisers in the public service.  I am on record to that effect.  The question is not whether there should be special advisers or not, but how to most effectively relate the special adviser to Government.  As this is the first time they appear in legislation, it is important to get it as right as possible because this will determine the basis of their role in Government for a long time to come.</P>
      <P>There is a concern that we all share, whether in a party or not, about how they can be most effectively used, how the office can be used rather than abused, and there is potential for abuse there.  Nobody, as far as I know, used the word &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; in the entire course of this debate or queried the integrity of special advisers as such. Reference was made to qualifications, but that is an entirely different matter from integrity.  I am not raising any questions about integrity.  On balance, the contribution of special advisers has been a positive one, irrespective of which parties we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concern is, however, that for the first time we are talking about unqualified and unregulated numbers.  That means a potential expansion of responsibilities without any question of qualifications involved.  I do not know where the numbers of three advisers for Ministers and two for Ministers of State came from, when the convention came about or whether it was like that from <Col N="1542" /> the beginning and will grow a bit more, which was the point that Senator Quinn made.</P>
    <P>It would be irresponsible of us not to have raised the issues we are raising about the incorporation of this section in this Bill.  The case has been made that it is peripheral to the content of the Bill.  There is no reference in this section to anything else in the Civil Service or the public service.  The relationship is between the Minister and special adviser only.  There are legitimate concerns about the relationship of special adviser to the permanent Civil Service.  Senator Dardis highlighted it well when he mentioned the remit of providing advice in section 11, the remit of the special adviser and his qualified remit in section 4(d) as regards the advice to be proffered by the secretary general, which seems to be more confining on the secretary general of a Department than on the special adviser.  That may create unnecessary tensions.  We are striving to include the best possible section or, if that is not possible, to have separate legislation on special advisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this section which has brought many things into the open.  I welcome the inclusion of this section in the Bill because it proves there is a need for control. The section also covers special advisers and programme managers appointed under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.  It would not help to delete this section as that would maintain the <i>status quo.</i>  This section covers many aspects of these people's employment.  The Government should be congratulated for including this section in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Concern was expressed about the numbers in Departments.  I have given Senators the best information I have on the numbers, although there is no guarantee they will not increase.  I take this opportunity to knock the idea that there is wild proliferation in Departments.  I will try to respond to the points made on Report Stage.

      <P>I welcome the fact the Minister recognises that our concern about numbers is not just to score political points.  There is a lacuna in the Bill which must be addressed.  We need to write a formula into the Bill.  As a taxpayer and ex-public servant, I am concerned about the generality of proliferation. It is time the extraordinary growth in ministerial offices over the past ten to 15 years was controlled.  It would probably be unfair to say there are 79 special advisers and programme managers because that is not true, but the number is significantly more than it was.  It would cost an additional £3.5 million per year to employ 70 advisers and programme managers.  Senator Calnan said no savings are made if a civil servant becomes an adviser, but a civil servant will not be taken off the payroll if someone from outside the Civil Service becomes one.  There is a significant net additional cost in wages, but that is not the issue.  The issue is how to control it.  I am sure the Minister will address this matter on Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross made a good point about the language used in the section.  It had not occurred to me that a visitor is someone who is usually invited to lecture.  There seemed to be a perception that visitors were put into universities as inspectors of a sort.  That was not the point I made.  The basis of my point is that I want to include the phrase &ldquo;or Visitors&rdquo; because, in the case of Trinity College, there are normally two visitors.  However, I understand the legal advice may be that, in technical <Col N="1545" /> drafting practice, the singular is held to contain the plural in the same way that, in the unreconstructed past, the male was taken to include the female.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can inform me that the college is satisfied and that she is happy that the existing arrangement for the visitor or visitors in Trinity College will be left undisturbed, I will not press the amendment.  However, I would have thought that the simple inclusion of the term &ldquo;or Visitors&rdquo; would do no damage, might make things clearer for lay persons such as myself and would indicate the Government's good grace in accepting Opposition amendments.</P>

      <P>I will return swiftly to the point made by Senator Norris who proposed in amendment No. 7 that the definition be amended because, like the terms &ldquo;God&rdquo; and &ldquo;sheep&rdquo;, it should include both the singular and plural.  I hope he has been reassured but, if not, we can return to deal with the matter on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest and concern to views expressed by Senators who represent university institutions about the potential for conflict within those institutions and the inadequacy of existing procedures to deal with this.  I am persuaded by the views expressed that the Bill should address the issue.  If there is nothing to be concerned about, so be it.  However, if there is something to be concerned about, this is a good occasion on which it can be addressed.  I would like to do so within the principle just outlined by giving universities, by statute, the responsibility for drawing up adequate procedures.  A possible solution might be for Members to consider a new function to have been included in section 13 to provide that a university should establish procedures for dispute resolution for staff and students.  These procedures could be established in consultation with the normal industrial relations structures operating in the universities, the existence of which Senators acknowledged but believed did not go far enough, which include recognised trade unions, staff associations, students unions and other student representative bodies.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to note that such an approach would be consistent with section 29(1)(e) of the Bill which provides that in its charters or supplementary charters a university may set &ldquo;the arrangements for review of, or appeals against&rdquo;. Senator Ormonde was concerned about students' fears in respect of examination appeals and in that regard I refer her to section 25(2)(e) of the Bill which relates to the functions of an academic council.  With my offer to return to the matter on Report Stage and having taken Senators' concerns on board, perhaps we should proceed to address other matters.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking on board our concern that this should be incorporated in the Bill.  However, I do not agree with <Col N="1546" /> the term &ldquo;procedures to solve disputes&rdquo; which relates to normal industrial relations as part of the internal arrangements within our universities. I was not referring to industrial relations; I am concerned about the mechanism in section 25(2)(e) to which the Minister referred.  There is no mechanism in place at present which gives staff or students with psychological not industrial relations grievances an opportunity to air their views.  Whatever mechanism is in place, whether it is section 25(2)(e) or a new procedure, it should take into account the psychological impact which may affect students or staff.</P>

In the spirit of co-operation I will wait to see what arises between now and Report Stage.  However, it leaves us with the problem of boards of visitors as conduits between universities and the Minister &ldquo;being of the opinion&rdquo;, which was the mechanism I was trying to use to reach a compromise.

      <P>Amendment No. 10 in the name of Senator Norris on today's Order Paper is in substitution for amendment No. 10 printed on 10 April 1997.  Amendment No. 11 is related and they may be taken together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 15, after &ldquo;apply&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;except in the case of Universities which are not in receipt of monies provided by An tÚdarás&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has shown flexibility and I hope she can accept this amendment which is a comparatively simple matter.  It is what has become known as the &ldquo;opt out clause&rdquo;.  We are looking far into the future but a university such as Trinity, which has existed for over 400 years, would anticipate lasting for another 400 years.  Who can tell what may occur in the future in the country's political and economic arrangements.  It is possible that Trinity and the State may decide to separate and the university might decide to return to financing itself, which is even to this day practised by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The amendment would mean that the Bill would operate except in the case of universities which are not in receipt of money provided by An tÚdarás.  The Minister has made the argument cogently and persistently with regard to some sections of the Bill that where the State provides money it has an interest and should have an input.  In other words, he who pays the piper should call the tune.  However, where the piper is not paid there is no reason a third party should dictate the melody.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises as a substitute because I was telephoned by the Provost of Trinity College yesterday.  I have had discussions with the Provost, the secretary of the college, other officers and with the Fellows of the university. They support this wording and asked me to propose it.  It is partly to satisfy queries that have been raised by the Department of Education because the original text of my amendment referred to &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; funding.  The university has shown that it is flexible and has agreed to the removal of the &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; element.  Consequently, where a university has no funding from the State, the State would only have the normal interest in the proper running of an institution.  In not providing funds it would not have the rights the Bill provides to investigate, interfere and regulate.  I hope the Minister can accept this amendment.  It is one of two amendments the university has indicated to me that it regards as crucial.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 11 is in the name of Senator Henry.  For the reasons Senator <Col N="1548" /> Norris has outlined I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  I am aware that the Long Title of the Bill refers to universities which are in receipt of money provided by An tÚdarás and it could be argued that these amendments are unnecessary.  However, it is a matter of concern to some of the universities.  The amendments would not offend against the general thrust of the section because, according to my understanding of the Long Title and this section, the amendments would not change what is contemplated.</P>

Nobody would lose out and it would provide reassurance.</P>

      <P>I support the general principle involved.  Circumstances in higher education and the economic circumstances of the country are changing rapidly.  It is possible that in a far shorter period than 400 years there might be propositions for universities which are not primarily or at all funded by the State and that the relationship between the private and public sector in the university context would change dramatically.  I have tabled amendment No. 146, which we may not reach, but it is aimed at trying to ensure amicable separation in circumstances where it might arise.  It may not happen today or tomorrow but it could happen much sooner than we anticipate.  It would be desirable to have provision for constructive and amicable arrangements when and if those circumstances arise.  I hope the Minister will propose an amendment to this effect on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The mild form of the affliction from which I suffer is not really a sin.  I have also been advised by the university that this is the form of words it seeks.  The university has been flexible and it would demonstrate the Minister's good <Col N="1549" /> grace, of which she has an abundance, if she were prepared to accept the amendment recommended by the university.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has argued that because it is contained in the Long Title of the Bill it is the intention of the Minister.  However, the university's legal advice is that this is not as strong or binding legally as having the provision in the Bill. We are not thinking in terms of 400 years.  Somebody mentioned that because the university I represent is already 400 years old.  Nevertheless, as Senator Lee pointed out, economic circumstances are changing rapidly and within 20 to 50 years it might be seen as beneficial by both State and universities to separate them.  This House should engage in long range thinking.  It is possible that in decades hence the universities might be grateful for this afternoon's work if it resulted in this mechanism being included in the legislation.</P>

      <P>The reason I said either of the amendments is that both are inaccurate in their wording.  Senator Norris' amendment states &ldquo;for as long a time as the listed universities&rdquo; which does not clarify what would happen if only one or some were no longer listed.  Senator Henry's amendment simply says &ldquo;where universities&rdquo;. The amendment must be specific and should apply only to universities which are funded by An tÚdarás and each should opt in or out on that basis.  There is a lack of clarity in both amendments.</P>

      <P>This is an important amendment and the universities are anxious that it is accepted.  It relates to Trinity College in particular.  The Minister has already shown flexibility and I must put on record the gratitude expressed to me for the Minister's attitude by the senior members of the university. It is remarkable and generous that the Minister will permit the university to introduce private legislation.  There are legal, technical and historic reasons for this but a more intransigent Minister might have made the position more difficult.</P>
      <P>Instead of stating &ldquo;in a manner consistent with the sections mentioned in that subsection&rdquo; and because it is a delicate and sophisticated area, the university is extremely anxious to change the wording to read &ldquo;in a manner consistent with the purpose and substance of the sections mentioned in that subsection&rdquo;.  Permitting that small margin of appreciation, to use a phrase beloved of our President, would be greatly appreciated by the university.  I and my colleagues &mdash; I hope I can speak for Senator Ross &mdash; consider the change essential.</P>

      <P>I have had regard for the views of the college and of its Senators in my approach.  Trinity College is unique and I have every intention of allowing it, and other colleges, to retain their traditions and uniqueness.  All other institutions rely on Acts of the Oireachtas. Proposing a Private Act sponsored by the college in a manner consistent with the provisions allowed me to respond in a positive way to Trinity College as part of the university system, without having to make all universities look as old and new as each other in anything so awful as an unimaginative Bill.  I would not turn my back on an institution which has made so valuable a contribution over a number of centuries to the development of education, particularly third level education, in the community that surrounds it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised that the amendment adds nothing to the provision.  However, a spirit of understanding permeates this debate and if the Senators wish me to pursue the matter I will reflect further and return to it on Report Stage.  I believe it is unnecessary but the Senators claim it is necessary. I have confidence in my advice but if it adds <Col N="1551" /> nothing to the provision I will be able to accommodate it on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is most satisfactory.  I will not launch divisive elements into the debate but we need more than a vague promise to readdress the subject on Report Stage.  What we need at this stage is a commitment from the Minister that she will introduce an amendment which means the same as Senator Norris's.  I do not want her to return on Report Stage and say she has given it further consideration and thinks it unnecessary.  I know she thinks that and that the amendment does not add much to the Bill but the authorities in Trinity College and in Dublin University think it is necessary and that it adds a lot.  We are in no way apart; it is just a matter of interpretation.  If it is harmless in her view but important in theirs, we should get a commitment from her now that the amendment will be introduced in this form on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to help but, like Senator Ross said, we need a firmer commitment. The Minister said the amendment neither added nor detracted from the Bill and in that case her view and that of her advisers is that the Bill remains the same.  No harm can be done as nothing is changed.  We are not contradicting the Minister's intentions or those of her advisers. There is no earthly reason we cannot be given a clear and specific commitment this afternoon and that is what I require from the Minister.  She said she has taken advice and I have no doubt it is professional, competent and well thought out. However, the Minister makes the final decision and I appeal to her to give us a clear undertaking.</P>
      <P>It has been said to me at the highest levels in the university to call a vote on this if necessary and we have the numbers but I would much prefer to dispose of the amendment rapidly and not enter into a bruising confrontation or to waste time &mdash; which we would do walking through the division lobbies &mdash; which would be better spent discussing essential matters.  If she cannot give a commitment to something which she says will not change the Bill but will merely satisfy a worry of the university, it is obvious to me she cannot give a commitment on anything.  One could not possibly give a commitment in an area where one felt there was a substantial change but one was not sure whether one agreed with it or not and needed to study it further.  That is legitimate. When one takes the view it does not change anything and one's advisers can cope with it, I see no reason not to call a vote.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary to ask for a commitment to legislate for the autonomy of the oldest college in the country as I have already given one.  While the Senator's amendment does not add anything to my provision, it does not detract from it either.  However, he has pressed the issue and wishes me to give a commitment.  I <Col N="1552" /> am being careful not to be bullied into it and I know the Senator does not intend that.  While his amendment may not add to the Bill, I never suggested it would detract from it.  However, if he thinks it is so important to obtain a commitment that he will push his amendment to a vote, I will return to the matter on Report Stage after the draftsman has examined his request to legislate for the autonomy of Trinity College.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 30 to 36, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) If An tÚdarás considers that an educational institution or part of an educational institution should form part of the university the Minister shall by order made with the consent of the institution concerned provide that the institution or part shall become and form part of the university and on the making of the order it shall be so incorporated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we have as easy an agreement on this amendment as on the last.  This is about the setting up of a university or the addition of part of another institution to a university.  The purpose is to take the initiative from the Minister's hands. The current section 8(1) states: &ldquo;If the Minister <Col N="1553" /> considers that an educational institution or part of an educational institution should form part of a university,&rdquo;.  That is my principal objection.  The Minister should have no say whatsoever, certainly not an initial or final say, in what constitutes a university.  It should not be necessary to obtain the consent of the Minister for Finance because we are getting bogged down in political bureaucracy, moves and decisions when we should be setting up an academic institution.  That is fundamental and goes to the core of the Bill.  A university should be self-regulating as far as possible and ministerial interference should be reduced to nothing, and can be if the political will is there.  Such will is not in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposal here, while not perfect, is to give the initiative for setting up a university to An tÚdarás and to allow it to consult with anyone it likes, including the Minister and the institution concerned. It is to remove the setting up of a university from the political arena.  Whereas there are a few window dressing clauses on consultation in this section and in others dealing with the setting up of so-called international experts &mdash; whatever they are &mdash; chosen by the Government whose views of international experts are certainly different from many others, the bottom line is that politicians will decide who gets university status.</P>
    <P>That is something we should avoid at all costs because there will always be a suspicion that, if the Ministers for Education and Finance and the Cabinet decide a certain institution is to be given university status, it will be decided on other than academic grounds.  That suspicion will be justified over time because the pressure on politicians is not academic but to give university status to the place where the most votes place the greatest pressure.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister would resist pressure on her to give university status to an institution in her constituency but we will not necessarily always have Ministers with a strong political backbone.  We must be careful not to legislate for the present.  We should legislate for the worst possible scenario.  That is a scenario in which future Ministers see an opportunity for currying favour with their constituents and those who can return political favours and decide to award university status.  This section opens itself to political bargaining and exchanges of favours which a university should avoid.</P>
    <P>I have proposed that An tÚdarás be given the initiative.  I have reservations about An tÚdarás because it is politically appointed, but the appointees have academic qualifications.  I would like to see the initiative and the final say taken out of the hands of individual politicians.</P>
    <P>There is a clause which states that an order should be laid before the Oireachtas.  That is a standard clause which I propose should be deleted.  This clause is blancmange inserted to satisfy people.  Everyone knows that orders laid before the Oireachtas are never defeated or removed.  It is and always has been a rubber <Col N="1554" /> stamp.  Ministers use it in reply when confronted with the sort of charges I am making.  For the sake of this and future Ministers, the Ministers for Education and Finance should be removed from the procedures of conferring university status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ross.  There is no point in having a Higher Education Authority primarily responsible for the implementation of most of the rest of the Act if that authority, which is the most competent national body, is sidelined when key decisions are taken about conferring university status, whether through the incorporation of existing institutions with universities or the establishment of new universities.</P>
      <P>There is no educational justification for including the Minister for Finance in section 8(1).  The Minister has nothing to do with authorising the incorporation of educational institutions with existing universities.  The Minister has a role in the financial implications and allocation in due course.  However, as far as the principle is concerned, I fail to see why the Minister for Finance should be mentioned.</P>
      <P>Section 9 was alluded to in the discussion concerning the Dublin Institute of Technology.  My amendment substitutes An tÚdarás for the Government and allows the initiative to come from An tÚdarás.  It also ensures that the Government's decision to award university status would have to be taken in conformity with the recommendation of the body established and An tÚdarás, not simply after considering the advice. Under the present Bill the Government might reject that advice.</P>
      <P>I am attempting to ensure that the mechanisms by which universities emerge and the standards deemed necessary to qualify for university status will be seen to emanate from the institution specifically designated to deal with university affairs.  This is logical.  It is not intended to block anything but to ensure that the institutions which acquire university status will enjoy the prestige and standing commensurate with that status.  We do not want to end up with a situation similar to that in the UK where many institutions called universities are not regarded as such.  Our university sector has a well deserved and hard earned reputation, whatever individual improvements can be made.  It would be unfortunate for new and existing universities if the mechanism by which new universities were established was seen to be influenced by political pressure.  I am not impugning impropriety.  I admire the courage the Minister has shown in resisting many of the pressures placed on her during her tenure.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senators Ross and Lee.  There should also be an amount of agreement <Col N="1555" /> from the Government benches.  I recall Senator Cotter's eloquent speech on Second Stage on the necessity to remove ministerial direction.  He stated that it was important that Ministers did not make decisions about universities, one could not expect a Minister to say what a university was and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>The content of this section is relatively good.  There are some elements with which I disagree.  Amendment No. 15 states that if An tÚdarás considers that an educational institution or part of an educational institution should form part of the university, the Minister shall agree and bring in a relevant order.  This has a number of implications.  What of the funding implications? Any decision made by An tÚdarás would have to be accepted by the Minister.  An tÚdarás might make decisions which the Minister would not wish to introduce as they may be too expensive and for which he or she would have to make special provision.  The wording is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that the public think ill of us because we think ill of ourselves.  The Government makes decisions every day.  The inference running through this amendment is that the Minister has a dirty pair of hands on everything.  That is not the case.  In relation to section 8(1) and section 9, the Minister takes advice.  This advice does not come from An tÚdarás but from a suitably qualified body established by An tÚdarás. The decision as to whether an institution should be granted university status is a clinical matter which should be decided on empirical grounds. The spirit of section 9 is correct, whether Senators agree with the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with giving An tÚdarás the right to make decisions as proposed by amendment No. 15.  It is untenable that the Government should hand over that kind of control to such a body. The Government should hold the power to make the final decision.  I cannot imagine a Government ignoring a decision made by the body established by An tÚdarás under section 9, having considered the application of an institution to become a university, satisfied itself that the institution qualified on empirical grounds and advised An tÚdarás, which would then advise the Minister and the Government accordingly.  It might hold back a decision on funding grounds, but I <Col N="1556" /> think there would be a furore all over the country if a Government decided to act in that manner.</P>
    <P>I do not want politicians, Ministers or anyone to be involved at the initial stages.  If an institution wants to be a university it should make an application through particular channels.  The application should be considered, recommendation should then go to Government on the basis of the findings and they will decide in accordance with the best interests of the people.  If a Government received a positive recommendation that an institution should be upgraded to university status and if it did not react accordingly it would be brought down.  Many of the elements here to not stand up to scrutiny.  I worry about giving An tÚdarás powers which have financial implications for the country which they do not have to take into account when coming to their decision.  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say about this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have major problems with amendment No. 15 and the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The amendment reads &ldquo;If An tÚdarás considers that an educational institution or part of an educational institution should form part of the university the Minister shall...&rdquo;  This gives the Minister no flexibility whatsoever and means that An tÚdarás has more power than the Minister. The Minister has no discretion as to whether the decision is made now or later.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is imperative.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day we are democrats.  Those in the other House are elected by the people. Public representatives go on to elect a Government, who selects Ministers.  A Minister is given power directly by the people.  There is much politician bashing by people who have been and will be involved in the political process and are connected to those who have expressed wishes to be part of that.  What has been said about politicians &mdash; that they are spineless and unable to make firm, clear decisions on behalf of the people &mdash;is anti-democratic.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is important in this amendment. I would have been happier to see &ldquo;may&rdquo; used.  This would give some degree of flexibility to the Minister.  I reject this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened closely to the debate on this matter.  The words of Senator Kelly on Second Stage hit me strongly.  She described universities in other countries which do not live up to the university standard.  We value the respect in which our universities are held.  The Minister is attempting to protect universities in the future. Senator Ross competently expressed his concern that this may be lost if left in the hands of politicians. This concern is the objective of his and Senator Lee's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am concerned that in establishing a university, if we are to maintain its standard, recognition and prestige, we must have a system of checks and balances.  This will ensure universities are only created following a great deal of <Col N="1557" /> thought and nothing slips through without this intention.  When the Dublin Institute of Technology and the possibility of a university being established on an amendment to a Bill was referred to last week, Senator Henry said that if a university is to be established, it deserves a Bill of its own.  Senator Cotter said Ministers make decisions every day.  They do, but they do not make decisions to create universities every day. Senator Lee and Senator Ross are attempting to ensure this does not happen with a future Minister.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the Minister's thoughts on this area.  Concerns have been expressed that the wording in the Bill is not strong enough to ensure that Parliament has a say.  It seems the Oireachtas does not have a say, because the section states an order shall be placed before the Houses of Oireachtas.  That is not strong enough.  Both Houses would be made weak if political influence was removed from it and handed over to An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>I am looking for checks and balances.  There is room in these amendments for that.  I would welcome the response of the Minister on how she will arrive at the solution to this problem.  We want to ensure we have universities of the stature and prestige of those in the past.  We do not want to weaken the creation of new universities in such a manner that we leave it in too few hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ross that the enactment of university legislation is to provide scope for the evolution of the sector over the coming years and decades.  If we are confident of this evolution it is our way of acknowledging its contributions in the past.  The Bill will provide for substantial reform of present structures and will allow for the future development of the university system through the establishment of new universities and the incorporation of existing educational institutions into universities under section 9.</P>
      <P>Under section 8 an educational institution or part of an educational institution may form part of a university by order.  Any such order will be made by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Dáil Éireann agreed on Report Stage that any such order must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it is made.  I counsel caution in asking about the role of the Minister for Finance.  We are talking about the establishment of, and evolution into, universities.  There are substantial implications for education in the budget and in the Government's commitment to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to balance the vision we have for development with the practical realisation that we would be committing ourselves as minders of the public purse, the consent of the Minister for Finance should be incorporated without any difficulty. If Senators push the matter, I will go back and ask if it needs to be incorporated in a legal manner.  Recognising the practicality of our vision for the future, I cannot see any difficulty in the <Col N="1558" /> order being made by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion in the previous debate on Committee Stage about the section concerning significant safeguards for the institutions. We want to ensure the rigorous evaluation of existing practice and that the addition of new universities would only happen following the implementation of safeguards.  There are three safeguards to development, namely, the consent of the institution if it is being broadened, the agreement of the governing body of the university and consultation with the Higher Education Authority.  Only then could both Houses of the Oireachtas approve the making of an order.  This will preserve the high standards of our university sector and protect the rights of the institutions to manage their own affairs.  A conclusion could only be reached in the context of these safeguards.</P>
    <P>I see merit in the proposals in amendment No. 15 to give a prior role in making a determination on the amalgamation to the HEA, although it removes the initiative from the Minister.  I consider that the Minister, while constrained to act only on the advice of the HEA, should have discretion to make an order in the public interest. We will never agree on this matter.  I propose to return to this issue on Report Stage to include the role of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 proposed by Senator Lee is very worthwhile.  I agree with the concept of the expert group making recommendations to the Higher Education Authority rather than the Government.  I think Senator Quinn will be reassured by the concept of the expert group making recommendations to the Higher Education Authority rather than directly to the Minister. Regarding the new subsection (2) suggested in Senator Lee's amendment, the Government may only agree to the establishment if both the expert group and the Higher Education Authority have so recommended and even then there is no compulsion on the Government to do so.  As Senator Cotter said we are at that stage in the realm of public debate and concern.  The strong view of Dáil Éireann, with which I agree, is that experts should be employees of existing universities and national experts are not university employees.  I wish to further consider this proposal with a view to making an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not support amendments to sections 8 and 9 which would have the effect of leaving no role for the Oireachtas in the establishment of a university or the incorporation of an institution into a university.  I defend my role as Minister in a Government elected by the people.  I will defend democracy as is my role in the democratic process. The central role of the highest legislative body has been a feature in the establishment of all universities.  This includes universities founded since the establishment of the State and those founded before the 1908 universities legislation whose establishment was based on royal charter. <Col N="1559" /> Trinity College was also founded by charter in the manner of the time.  This Bill is enriched by the fact that it has taken on board the concerns of this House and the university community who look to us to reflect this in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I enjoyed the Minister's ringing words of commitment to democracy as I did Senator Kelly's.  It is not appropriate to make such comments in the context of ministerial powers. It cannot be said that the Minister was elected to do what she wants and to take certain powers.  The question is whether it is better for a Minister to have these powers or somebody else. The Minister has not responded to my point that it is almost inevitable that Ministers will abuse these powers in future; it is in the nature of politics that Ministers will abuse these powers.</P>
      <P>For example, we all have been subject to much pressure to give university status to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  None of us would be human if we did not feel that pressure and we would be liars if we said we never responded to that type of pressure.  Whereas the Dublin Institute of Technology case may have great merit, those of us with influence on the issue must admit that we pay more attention to what they are saying now because they have votes and influence in our constituencies then we would if they did not.  This is the reality of politics.</P>
      <P>When the Dublin Institute of Technology says it should be a university I am not qualified to make a decision because I do not know enough about it.  I am a politician, not a university academic; neither is the Minister.  I am subject to those pressures and I will respond to those pressures because I am a politician who responds to pressures in my constituency.  When the Dublin Institute of Technology tells me they have 1,000 votes in my constituency and that they want me to support their campaign for university status, I jump to attention.  Everybody else on these benches does likewise because of the potential of votes.  I would not be human if I did not lean in the direction of the Dublin Institute of Technology because of these 1,000 votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no coincidence that support for the Dublin Institute of Technology has come from the university benches.  It appears that we are unanimous in the opinion that it should be granted university status.  Perhaps that conclusion has been reached after much solid research into the academic standards in the Dublin Institute of Technology in comparison to UCD, UCC, UCG and TCD.  Of course this is not the case.  Senators have jumped to attention because of the 1,000 votes and have said they will put pressure on the Minister.  We are all guilty of this approach.  This is only a minor example of what can happen.  The Dublin Institute of Technology may well have a legitimate claim but a better decision would be made if the matter was taken out of our hands and given to An tÚdarás or a different group.  If a Minister continues to have these powers they will <Col N="1560" /> respond to similar political pressures.  Perhaps all Ministers for Education will be people of such purity and virtue that they will turn their backs on lobbying and university groups.  However, I do not believe this will happen.  I am trying to take this away from particular pressures, such as voting and lobbying pressures which are not relevant, and take this into an area where academic considerations are what matter most.  Political considerations matter most in the way the Bill is balanced at the moment and we will have terrible accidents with unsuitable places being given university status for all the wrong reasons.</P>

      <P>Anybody who is involved in politics in any shape or form would sympathise with much of what Senator Ross has said.  It was partly for that reason I seconded his amendment on section 15.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister has found some good in amendment No. 17 to section 9 and will return with her own amendment on Report Stage which will take on board the principles expressed in my amendment.  My amendment states that the Government may at any time appoint a body, the membership of which shall be recommended by An tÚdarás and shall include national and international educational experts who, in the light of sections 12 and 13 of this Bill, will make their recommendations and, on the advice of both such a body and An tÚdarás, the Government may recommend the establishment of a university.  They are the key principles which mark the divergence from the current section in the Bill.  Am I correct in assuming that the Minister's amendment will be drafted in accordance with those principles?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  Such an amendment would also encompass the principles of balance which Senator Quinn expounded earlier.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 15, I am going to &ldquo;do the dirty&rdquo; on Senator Ross to the extent that Senator Kelly and the Minister made a valid point in asking that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would be substituted by &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  It is not acceptable to impose a diktat on the Minister in that sense.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would be a distinct improvement.</P>
      <P>I completely reject any reference to the Minister for Finance in this context.  Financial considerations do, of course, have a role in the allocation of resources if university status is granted to an institution or part thereof.  The principle of whether the standards of such an institution are university standards or not, which is the key consideration in the first instance, has nothing to do with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 8, which we are trying to amend, line 34 states that the Minister shall make a decision following consultation with An tÚdarás.  It does not state that the decision will be made on the recommendation of An tÚdarás.  It does not, as <Col N="1561" /> it currently stands, require the agreement of An tÚdarás; it simply says &ldquo;after consulation with An tÚdarás&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Consultation&rdquo; is a word whose coinage is rapidly devaluing in the context of the current Bill.  As the Bill stands, it will be quite possible for the Minister to make a decision contrary to the advice of An tÚdarás.  Perhaps the Minister would correct me if I am wrong.  The Minister did say, in the course of an unscripted response, that the Minister would be constrained to act only on the advice of the HEA.  I thought she made the comment in the context of section 8.  There is a big difference between &ldquo;on the advice of the HEA&rdquo; and &ldquo;after consultation with An tÚdarás&rdquo;.  I would like the Minister to clarify this issue before I come to a decision on how much of section 8 is acceptable or how much of it may require further amendment now or on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>One could easily get very confused if one thought too much about this.  On a previous occasion we discussed the establishment of the Dublin Institute of Technology as a new university.  In my contribution I said that the Minister had gone two thirds of the way when she said she would transfer funding to the Higher Education Authority and would grant Dublin Institute of Technology the ability to award its own degrees by 1998.  The Minister said everything would be subject to section 9 of the Bill. Senator Lee's amendment to section 9 states that &ldquo;...the Government may, at any time, appoint a body, the membership of which shall be recommended by An tÚdarás and shall include national and international educational experts to advise An tÚdarás on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of the university under sections 12 and 13...&rdquo;.  I cannot go along with that amendment until we have discussed sections 12 and 13.  The Minister is saying that she will come back on Report Stage with an amendment which refers to the appointment of a body, the membership of which would be approved by An tÚdarás.  Such a body would comprise academic experts who would decide whether an institution would be awarded university status or not.  That would be subject to our having discussed sections 12 and 13.  Am I correct in thinking that?  I am very confused as to what the Minister's intentions are.</P>

      <P>I would ask Senator Ormonde to ask me one question at a time.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Lee's question on mergers, an institution and a university would have to agree to a merger and, following consultation with the HEA, the Minister would also have to agree to one.  The word used is &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 9, on the issue of the establishment of a new university, we are talking about appointing an expert group.  Discussion arose in the Dáil as to what the composition of such a group would be.  People asked how the academic requirements of a university would be evaluated. <Col N="1562" /> Under this legislation we have defined the functions and objectives of a university.  An expert group evaluating an institution which wishes to become a new university would involve national and international people.  We used the example of the expert group which I had formed to examine the request from the Dublin Institute of Technology to award their own degrees.  The experience of that group was good and it was accepted that it was effective.  I thought it was a model which had worked well on a previous occasion and which could be used again in this context.</P>
    <P>One needs to protect the professional and academic criteria of a university.  The advice of an expert group will be sought on the academic and professional aspects of a university.  The discretionary parts for the Minister and the Government are concerned with the financial implications of establishing new universities.  There is no doubt that there would be financial implications for the economy of establishing new universities.</P>
    <P>We have all discussed political pressures but I do not think this House simply succumbed to pressures.  The spirit of the debate which we had last week and the general agreement that we would accept section 9 was not one in which the force of a vote was used.  We looked at the request for a change in the definition of an institution and satisfied ourselves that there were procedures in section 9 whereby this and other institutions would be rigorously evaluated.  We did not succumb, but addressed a need to put in place a process which would not succumb in the way Senator Ross believes he has succumbed.  I do not know to what he has succumbed.</P>

      <P>We spoke about future developments because we accept that what is in place will not remain static.  We will respond to our responsibilities to ensure the development is a process which is rigorous.  Although it may seem to have the mucky paws of politicians on it, which for some reason Senator Ross does not believe himself to be a politician, I am satisfied with the process on which we have agreed of expert groups and academic evaluation and the responsibility of a Government accepting it.  We have put in place a process which will see future development, be it the merger or amalgamation of existing institutions or institutions under section 9 becoming universities.  We accept the situation will not remain static and that there will be developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill could be pushed through the House on numbers without engaging in the process outlined in section 9.  By agreeing to section 9, we will not succumb to lobby groups.  We are including a process which recognises future developments and through which evaluations will take place.  The balance of power in the House would be different if Members moved from one side to the other and <Col N="1563" /> it would be possible to establish a new university regardless of academic standards and procedures. This safeguard will ensure third level education develops through the process provided in the Bill. I recommend the process, because people may succumb to lobby groups too easily.  By accepting section 9, we will ensure confidence in the process.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Ormonde, we have agreed on the need to include a process in section 9.  I will be able to recommend this process to one institution, which has been concerned and lobbied, as a process it will be able to use.  I have not guaranteed the outcome of the process or the evaluation, despite headlines which might have suggested otherwise and Members who were here the last day will know that.</P>

      <P>This process started in 1992-3 when the Dublin Institute of Technology became an institution.  I know this institution inside out from my contacts with academics in the colleges. I am aware experts were brought in to begin this process.  I agree with the Minister's plans for the future in that there should be process for any changes.  However, this should be the end of the process as regards the Dublin Institute of Technology. An international review body was set up. What was the composition of that body?  Where these people academics?  I understand international and national experts were involved. What other decisions do we have to make about the Dublin Institute of Technology becoming a university?</P>
      <P>I agree with the introduction of a process, but this is the end of a process as regards the Dublin Institute of Technology.  We should include this process for new institutions which wish to become universities, but it should not apply to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I have a problem with this provision because we have yet to discuss sections 12 and 13.  It seems we will never make a decision on this matter.  I understand from where the Minister is coming.  This is a worthwhile debate and there is no pressure on us to make a decision.  This process has been well researched.  I do not understand, however, why we cannot go all the way as regards the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>

      <P>A group was set up in 1993 because the Dublin Institute of Technology made a request to award its own degrees, about which we spoke at length the last day.  The group's terms of reference did not require it to decide if this institution should become a university.  It was asked to evaluate this institution to see if it should award its own degrees and it made a number <Col N="1564" /> of recommendations about quality control, organisation and academic work.  It recommended that I accede to its request that it should no longer award degrees from Trinity College and that it award its own degrees.  In light of the fact that legislation was being introduced &mdash; it will be a long time before the next Queen Bess introduces legislation &mdash; it recommended we look at its future development.</P>
      <P>We set up a group with specific terms of reference which reported back under five headings. We have worked diligently with the colleges under those five headings.  I prepared the order which will allow the Dublin Institute of Technology to award its own degrees in 1998.  Despite campaigns, headlines and misinformation, the group was not requested to do otherwise.  There were five people on it, two of whom were international experts.  It had a lot more information the last day.  I did not ask them to evaluate this as a university or to set up the criteria.  They did not do the job that it is being suggested publicly they did. However, I responded to a point they made about the process of the university, given the fact that legislation is being introduced.  Section 9 sets out that there will be a process.  I am a bit wary of giving instant recognition to any institution.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;The Minister may, at the request of the governing authority of a university&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The governing authority of a university may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the surface this would appear to be a minor amendment but it is a fairly important one.  Subsection (1) reads: &ldquo;The Minister may, at the request of the governing authority of a university, and in the case of the constituent university with the consent of the Senate, by order, change the name of the university.&rdquo;.  I do not see any reason a university cannot call itself what it likes.  It is simple.  I see absolutely no reason whatsoever a Minister should have any act or part in what a university calls itself.  It looks as if the Minister, at the very least, has the power of veto over the change of name of a university, which seems incomprehensible to me.  No one has been able to explain why.  It seems symbolic of the nature of this Bill that the university should at least be able to call itself what it likes and that the Minister should not have any say in this whatsoever.</P>
      <P>It is a simple amendment.  I do not want to say anything else about it for the moment because I cannot see any argument for other side.  I will be interested to see what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <P>I will answer the second question first.  The senate of the NUI asked for it.</P>
      <P>I think that basically Senator Ross is right.  I do not think there is a requirement on the Minister to have any role whatsoever in the change of the name of a university.  I do not think the Minister should be able to change the name of a university against the wishes of the university and under the section the Minister cannot do it.  I do not support the amendment, however, because it is appropriate that the Minister should be the one to make the order to change the name of a university.</P>
      <P>In all but the case of Trinity College, the names have been conferred by Act of the Oireachtas and it is appropriate that the relevant Minister should have a role in effectively amending such an Act. The Senator asked the origin; he can be reassured that I have, and see, no role or function in the name.  However, because the names were conferred by an Act I do think the Minister of the day has a role in presenting the order for change, without the content of the change, before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>In many ways the Minister is far more conservative than I, which surprises me.  She says she approves of it because it was always so and was always done this way but that has always been a bad reason for doing anything of this sort. <Col N="1566" /> I am still not clear what she is saying.  I am not trying to be difficult but I want to ask her a couple of questions.  She may correct me but my impression is that under this section the Minister can prevent a university from changing its name. Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">

      <P>There must be some mechanism of order in the naming of universities.  Two universities or institutions might want to take the same name or an institution might take a name that is very similar to the name of an existing institution.  There must be some mechanism but what that is a different matter.  At the moment, the Minister is as good as, or maybe better than, any for that purpose.  I will not linger over the point because I want to progress things as quickly as possible.  However, it seems that if constituent universities of the National University of Ireland want to change their names in future it should be they who have to ask the Minister rather than the senate of the NUI.  I do not quite know what happened but I put down a market for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>It is up to the universities themselves to come forward with the name and the Minister places the order before the House. The names of the universities have been enacted by order of the Oireachtas.  As the Senator said, two universities could seek the same name.  I do not imagine there will be any difficulty with this but there is a role for the Minister of the day and for the Houses that the request of a university to change the name will be done by order here.  That is the only role I see the Minister having.  At that stage the input of the universities, their governing bodies and senates would be to come to the Minister of the day with agreement on the name and the Minister places the order before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  I do not think there is any difficulty about it.  It is something that gives the matter importance and gravitas so that we do not have people acting willy nilly.</P>
      <P>I am not more conservative than Senator Ross. We could challenge each other on that.  This is just an orderly provision following the request of the university.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Minister's explanation because I do not understand how a university can decide what to call itself.  Apart from the ingenious suggestion by Senator Lee, which seems obscure and unlikely, that a university would want to give itself the same name as another institution, in what circumstances can the Minister visualise herself forbidding a university to change its name or dictating the name of a university to it?</P>

      <P>It is difficult to understand the point made by Senator Ross.  The Bill states that the Minister may by order change the name of a university.  However, Senator Ross is saying the Minister may not do so.  A future Minister might decide to change a particular name because it is inappropriate, the people who chose it did so under the influence of drink or because they did not have their full senses due to a gas leak in the room where the decision was being made.  There are implications for this legislation because if institutions which are known by particular names in this Bill decide to change them, an amendment will be required.  On the other hand, they could be seen as new universities.  I assume a contra-case can be made every time, such as that the Minister may do this, which implies that she may not do something else.  We are wasting time discussing this issue.</P>

      <P>I did not think what the Senator was dreaming up would be possible.  If institutions wanted to call themselves names similar to other institutions, they would have to change them.  Titles of institutions are statutorily designated.  If an institution wants to change its name, the Minister must place an order before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that it would have a new statutory designation.  I want to prevent ministerial interference if, for example, the governing body wants to add another queen to Trinity College.</P>

I will persist in giving the same answer to the Senator who is challenging me on this matter. Senator Ormonde grasped immediately the point that there was no role for me in a debate on the name of a university; but, given the existence of these names in legislation, there is a role for the Minister to return to the House with an order in such cases.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 12 but in Part II of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;(1)  All universities have the right, and the responsibility, to preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of both their external affairs and their internal affairs.</P>
      <P>(2)  Nothing in the interpretation of this Act shall contravene, subvert or diminish the application of the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of the external and internal affairs of the university.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will be aware, this is a matter of fundamental importance to many of us in the university world and, I hope, the wider society beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on Second Stage that the Minister's exposition in her speech of both the concept and implementation of the principle of academic freedom was wholly admirable.  I did not see the intensity of her commitment as expressed in her speech adequately reflected in the Bill.  To try to explain how I came to suggest a separate section <Col N="1570" /> which would be clean cut on the issue of academic freedom, my first inclination was to take section 13(3), which states that a university &ldquo;shall be entitled to regulate its affairs in accordance with its independent ethos and traditions and the traditional principles of academic freedom&rdquo; and that &ldquo;if, in the interpretation of this Act, there is a doubt regarding the meaning&rdquo;, a construction that would promote the ethos and those traditions shall be preferred to one which would not, which was provided as a measure to alleviate the widespread anxieties in universities.</P>
    <P>This may seem a little pedantic but it is not meant to be.  I distinguish between the ethos of the university and the principle of academic freedom. The ethos of a university is internal to the university.  The principle of academic freedom concerns the wider society.  A university is entitled to regulate its affairs in accordance with its ethos.  That enables, but does not require, it to do so and that is correct because a university should have a right to modify or change its ethos as circumstances change if it so desires.  That is internal to the institution.</P>
    <P>However, the principle of academic freedom transcends individual institutions and it ought to be a core value of a liberal society.  Therefore, universities should be required, and not merely entitled, to regulate their affairs in accordance with the principles of academic freedom, both internally and externally.  This should not merely be an entitlement because that would give those who were not of that disposition the right to ignore the intention behind section 13(3).</P>
    <P>Looking at the matter, I despaired of finding a phraseology which would capture adequately this intention within the current phraseology of section 13(3), where ethos and the principle of academic freedom are basically different concepts despite the degree of overlap which may exist between them.  That is why I decided to insert a new clean cut section, the phraseology of which it may be possible to improve, giving the universities the right and imposing the responsibility &ldquo;to preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of both their external affairs and their internal affairs&rdquo;.  That seems to me to be as clear, unequivocal and, I would hope, uncontroversial a statement of the principle of academic freedom as one can provide in an Act.</P>
    <P>Second, section 13(3) states that if in the interpretation of this Act, there is a doubt regarding the meaning of any provision, it will be interpreted in accordance with the principles of academic freedom; but that confines the application of the principles of academic freedom to those clauses where there may be a doubt regarding their meaning.  It does not provide blanket coverage for the Act as a whole, but only in cases of doubt.  The second part of my amendment states that nothing &ldquo;in the interpretation of this Act shall contravene, subvert or diminish the application of the traditional principles of academic freedom&rdquo;.  In other words, it applies <Col N="1571" /> that principle without qualification to the interpretation of every aspect of the Act.  That is a clear, comprehensive and uncontroversial a statement of that principle, which ought to be a fundamental principle of civil society and not simply something to do with university privileges.</P>
    <P>If my phraseology can be improved, I will gladly defer to improvement; but I hope that the principles can be accepted fully by the Minister. If there is a difficulty in principle with accepting this amendment, it bodes ill for the real meaning of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment, amendment No. 23, seeks to insert the paragraph: &ldquo;(b) to protect and promote academic freedom,&rdquo; because it is not emphasised in the Bill that that particular freedom will be protected and it is important to the role the universities play in the social and cultural life of the country.  It is important that academics are free to make their contribution, irrespective of how they might wish to do so.  I consider this to be a mission statement and it should stand on its own.  We should cherish academic freedom.  There should be no fear that such academic freedom does not exist.  I believe paragraph (b) of my amendment stands on its own and is a mission statement.  Academic freedom should be protected by the legislation.</P>
      <P>The aim of paragraph (c) of the amendment is &ldquo;to promote the right of a university to regulate its affairs in accordance with its ethos, traditions and the principles of academic, operational and management freedom, consistent with the effective and efficient use of resources and accountability to the public.&rdquo;, and stands on its own.  The Minister referred to this issue in her position paper in November 1995.  The heads of the universities acknowledged that her statement would guarantee autonomy in terms of a college's academic and operational freedom to regulate their affairs and reflect their ethos in the best way possible.</P>
      <P>It is important that my amendment be incorporated into the legislation because it would provide an in-built safeguard that there would be no discrimination in respect of academic's teaching, work or the way they express themselves in such work.  We are discussing the adult population and there should be openness with regard to discussion. The only way the academic world can develop is if such freedom, without State constraints, is guaranteed.  I am concerned that if paragraphs (b) and (c) of my amendment are not incorporated in the legislation we will begin to enter the realm of semi-State agency thinking. That is why I made this strong argument in respect of academic freedom and the protection of that ethos.</P>

      <P>If I understand Senator Lee's arguments correctly, I agree with him that academic freedom must also operate within universities. Sometimes the views of an individual within a <Col N="1572" /> university are as much under threat from managers or senior staff members as they are from outside influences.  I believe internal freedom is as important as external freedom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kelly's point is good and useful and is addressed in some of the amendments under discussion, which I support.  For a number of reasons, I hope the Minister will be able to include them in the legislation.</P>
      <P>These amendments go to the heart of the ethos of a university which encapsulates independence, autonomy, the capacity for independent thought and the ability to pursue lines of research undisturbed, take unpopular positions and debate in the freest possible atmosphere.  This is a real core value of universities and it is important that should be addressed.  The Minister has addressed it in her speeches but, from the point of view of universities, it has not been spelt out in the legislation. This may be a function of the goodwill of the Minister who assumes that her intentions are clear and will be carried out by her successors. However, the universities want the matter addressed in detail.  For that reason it is important that the principles of academic freedom should be enshrined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to believe that the Minister or her advisers oppose the principle of academic freedom, even if they believe it would make the legislation bulky or represents unnecessary verbiage. However, in terms of the optics, it is very important that these matters be seen to be priorities to the Minister and her advisers.</P>
      <P>The amendments are well structured and well thought out.  Amendment No. 28 in the name of Senator Henry addresses the point made by Senator Kelly.  It would be astonishing if we were not able to enshrine in legislation the aim to protect and promote academic freedom.  That guarantees not only the autonomy of a university as an institution but also the individual freedoms about which Senators Kelly and Ormonde spoke effectively.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 30 in my name requests the insertion of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  In the performance of its functions, the right of a university to regulate its affairs in accordance with the traditions of university autonomy is recognised by this Act and nothing in this Act shall detract from the exercise of that right by any of the universities to which the Act applies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Minister, in her response, states that the she agrees with my proposal and indicates her acceptance of the amendment. If not, will she provide a considered view why it is not acceptable?  The quality of her response will be very important because if she chooses to reject the amendments it may seem that she is opposing the principles of autonomy, academic freedom and independent thought and research.  At the end of the day these principles are what universities are all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> There is a need for the Minister to be either careful or to take risks.  It would be risky for her to state that she does not agree with the degree of autonomy or freedom in place and that she believes it should be limited.  However, I would admire her courage if she made such a statement. I would not advise her to do so but I will be interested to hear her response.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 115 states that employees should not be disadvantaged as a result of opinions or findings advanced during the course of teaching or research.  This is a fundamentally important point and involves the protection of an individual teacher who may hold controversial views.  Some of the best teachers have controversial views.  I have probably learned more, certainly as much, from teachers with whose views I violently disagreed because they made me consolidate my opinions.  I recall one particular individual, an Englishman, who had the most aggravating views about the Romantic poets.  He was a very clever man but he annoyed me by upending my views during a discussion at a tutorial.  I was so determined to gain revenge that I researched the matter and I assure the Minister that Hibernia obtained victory in round two.  To my mind, the person in question was a good teacher because he stimulated his students.  However, if we take the route of conformism, we will not encourage stimulating debate.</P>
    <P>There have been people who adopted views in research which were not politically or socially correct or popular.  I myself have adopted such views and I have been attacked not so much by colleagues but by outside pressure groups who attempted to disadvantage me for doing so.  There are a number of my colleagues with whom I strongly disagree but it is wonderful that Trinity College supports them.  For example, the college has eminent legal people such as Professor William Binchy, who played a prominent role in various referendum campaigns, and Professor John Bonar.  I strongly disagree with these individuals but they are people of high integrity.  I would hate to think that because they took a view I believed to be incorrect &mdash; luckily the majority of Irish people subsequently came to believe it was incorrect &mdash; that they should be penalised in their academic research or their standing in the university. They were merely politically wrong.  That is my view and I am entitled to it, just as they are entitled to theirs.</P>
    <P>I had originally thought that amendment No. 114 would be taken with No. 115 because they are similar.  However, amendment No. 114 deals with financial conditions and the question of disadvantage. I presume it is not being taken for that reason and will be dealt with in the normal course of our deliberations.  I further presume it is not an oversight that the two amendments are not being taken together.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 114 reads:</P>
    <P>In page, 23, subsection (8) (b), line 23, after &ldquo;university&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;,and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> (c) no person who is a member of staff of an educational institution which is incorporated into a university pursuant to section 8 of this Act, shall, while in the service of the university, receive less remuneration or be subject to less favourable conditions of service than those to which they were entitled immediately prior to such incorporation.</P>

When I think of &ldquo;objects&rdquo; I am put in mind of the campanile and the Book of Kells; perhaps, &ldquo;objectives&rdquo; is more appropriate. I wonder if it is appropriate to include the list of objects.  However, it is there and we must see how it can be improved upon.</P>
      <P>I support amendment No. 23, which is in the names of Senator Ormonde and I.  It deals with the need to protect and promote academic freedom which is central to the idea of a university. The most important function of universities is to challenge orthodoxies, as has been their tradition. Some of the most odd people have come up with some of the greatest ideas.  This is not meant as a reflection on any of my colleagues from the Independent group.</P>

      <P>Some socially unacceptable and generally undersirable human beings were responsible for some of the greatest advances we have known.  Thus, the idea of a university as a semi-State body is repugnant.  I can think of people in very powerful places who have taken grave exception to some of the findings of the ESRI or Teagasc, particularly in areas of economics, because the findings did not agree with the propaganda being touted by influential people.  I can recall efforts being made to suppress or dilute what was being said.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the idea of promoting and protecting academic freedom would be included in the Bill.  If all the other objects were to fall, that alone would be the most important and should be included.  Mahaffy, if one reads Wilde's biography, seemed to be totally &ldquo;off the wall&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the author of amendment No. 22 has a good understanding of the Bill and has done a lot of research on it.  I like the outcome of his work.  The one problem is that subsection (1) of the new section proposed refers to the need to preserve and promote the &ldquo;traditional principles of academic freedom&rdquo; in the conduct of a university's internal and external affairs. The &ldquo;traditional principles of academic freedom&rdquo; are well understood by some, but I imagine that two academics might argue about them.  They could be open to different interpretations and I see that as a weakness in the amendment.</P>
      <P>The flimsy concept of the &ldquo;traditional principles of academic freedom&rdquo; should be specified and given more substance so that everybody reading the Bill would fully understand what is expressed by the concept.  Perhaps Senator Lee would consider how that matter might be tidied up.  I am also interested in the Minister's view.  I hope she will find it possible to follow Senator Lee's direction in this regard and to accept that amendment No. 22 has value.</P>

      <P>I find this section difficult.  It is hard to understand why it is necessary to include in legislation in such detail, albeit vague detail, the objects of a university.  The objects listed in the Bill sound worthy but they are subject to widely different interpretations.  The Bill has too many adjectives and too much scope for confusion and interpretation in the future.  This particularly applies to this section.  This section is used as the basis for the Minister to send visitors into universities along with other provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The section dealing with visitors indicates that where the Minister is of the opinion that the functions of a university are not being carried out, he or she can take certain actions.  These are listed. However, the objects of a university are so vague that a Minister could at any time say that they are not being complied with and act accordingly.  This gives immense powers of interpretation to future Ministers and Governments.  If the objects and functions of a university must be included in legislation they should be far tighter and more limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the objects and functions should be the subject of this Bill, which, incidentally, reads more like a political manifesto than an item of legislation.  The objects and functions should be left to the university to decide from time to time, because learning evolves.  If a university decides that the objectives set out in this section are not being complied with or are no longer relevant, will it have to come back to the Oireachtas to change them?  If a university decides that it does not want to promote the English language, must it revert to the Minister or the Oireachtas to get permission?  The section gives as one of the objects of a university the promotion of the Irish and English languages.  Perhaps it will not want to promote the English language in years to come for unforeseen reasons. However, if it makes that decision it must seek the approval of the Oireachtas or a visitor can be <Col N="1576" /> sent to the university to inform it that it is in breach of its obligations under the law.

While I sympathise with inserting a protection for academic freedom, it gives hostages to fortune in other areas of the Bill.  It gives power to the Minister to interfere where he or she believes academic freedom is not being protected.  I would prefer if no definitions and functions were included in the legislation; they should be left to the universities.  What have universities done that for some extraordinary reason they cannot be trusted to run their own affairs and change their functions and objects? We must leave these issues to the universities and not include them in a long and vague section of legislation which makes them subject to wide interpretation.</P>

      <P>We are discussing amendments Nos. 22, 23, 28, 30 and 115.  Amendment No. 115 relates to the staff of a university.  They should not be disadvantaged in their work because of how they deliver lectures or because of the content of their lectures.  We saw what happened in Iron Curtain countries, where if academics made statements which opposed the government of the day, their careers were stymied.  I am concerned that academics should be free to make statements in the context of university lectures and to express different views.  That is why I am anxious to insert the amendment.  It provides that <Col N="1577" />&ldquo;employees and officers of a university shall not be disadvantaged, or subjected to less favourable treatment, for opinions or findings advanced during the course of their teaching or research or as a result of any other activities relevant to academic expression&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Senator Ross said there were too many adjectives in the section.  My experience of academics is that, from their point of view, there can never be too many adjectives.  I remember introducing Professor R.B. McDowell to a meeting a couple of years ago in flattering and flowery terms. However, when he stood up to speak, he said: &ldquo;People often say they do not like flattery.  Well, I like it a great deal, although I found it lacking in Senator Norris' contribution.  In his introduction there was an absence of adjectives such as &lsquo;wonderful&rsquo;, &lsquo;very&rsquo;, &lsquo;superb&rsquo; and &lsquo;splendid&rsquo;.

      <P>A central theme of Senators' contributions has been the need to guarantee the academic freedom and institutional autonomy of universities.  I agree these principles are at the heart of the concept of a university.  The structure of the Bill is such that academic freedom and respect for ethos and traditions are given a central place.  Section 13 of the Bill is of crucial importance as it gives a statutory basis to the exercise by governing authorities of their functions.</P>
      <P>Central to section 13 is subsection (3), which is a clear expression of the entitlement of a university to regulate its affairs in accordance with its independent ethos and traditions and the traditional principles of academic freedom.  The subsection goes further to safeguard this by providing that where there is a doubt about the interpretation of a provision, an interpretation which will promote academic freedom and the ethos of a university is to be preferred to one which would not.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee has proposed in amendment No. 22 to insert a new section before section 12 to underpin the traditional principles of academic freedom.  Senator Lee and Senator Norris have further proposed in amendment No. 30 an additional subsection to section 13 on the point of institutional autonomy.  Senator Ormonde and Senator Henry have proposed in amendments that it should be an object of a university to protect and promote academic freedom.  Although the Bill as drafted leads inevitably to this conclusion, it is a reasonable proposal if any doubt remains on the matter.  I support the thrust of the amendments.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ormonde that if such an amendment is to be introduced to the objects, it should be introduced before the second object in the Bill.  If such an object should be included in the wording used by Senator Lee, it should state that it is an object of a university &ldquo;to preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of their internal and external affairs&rdquo;.  Such wording would be consistent with and supportive of the wording of section 13(3).  However, I wish to get advice on the wording with a view to returning to this issue on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ormonde proposes in amendment No. 23 that a further object similar to the provision in section 13(3) should be inserted in section 12. Given that the House is supportive of an amendment to the objects to ensure that the promotion of academic freedom is included and given that the principal elements of Senator Ormonde's proposal are already included in section 13, I do not <Col N="1579" /> recommend the inclusion of this further object. Furthermore, given the strong statement in section 13(3) concerning institutional autonomy, I do not favour the inclusion of a further statement on the same subject.</P>
    <P>I have considered in detail Senator Ormonde's amendment No. 115 that there should be specific provision that employees should not be disadvantaged as a result of teaching, research or other activities. Academics have the right to freedom of expression.  However, I consider the Senator's approach unnecessarily detailed and the revised section 13(3) provides sufficient reassurance in this regard.  It will now be articulated in legislation that a university shall be entitled to regulate its affairs in accordance with its independent ethos and the traditional principles of academic freedom.  Furthermore, in interpreting the legislation, a construction which promotes the ethos and traditions would be preferred to one which does not.</P>
    <P>I said in my opening remarks I would listen to the debate and concerns of this House.  Having given that commitment and bearing in mind the views expressed, I would like to use the time between now and our next exchange of views to examine the issue and return to it on Report Stage.  Senator Norris referred to those who disagreed with him as allowing him to sharpen his argument.  It might be an appropriate time now to conclude my remarks and have my argument sharpened by the time I return.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Minister for the Environment to review and update all measures relating to road safety with special reference to information provided to tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for a debate which has been long neglected by legislators.  I am <Col N="1580" /> here because no regulations have been made to date on providing information to foreign tourists on road safety and driving on the left side of the road.  Had these been in place, I might still be a student in University College Cork and my father, Liam Naughten, might still be Cathaoirleach of this House.  Sadly, this debate has come too late for my father and the Croatian in the other car but it is not too late for others.  That is why I propose this motion this evening.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a rapidly growing industry and predictions show it will soon become a major employer.  In 1996 4.2 million tourists visited this country and 20 per cent hired cars; 1.75 million were from mainland Europe and North America, of which over 554,000 hired cars and drove around Ireland.  All these people were accus-around to driving on the right and posed a major hazard to other road users, especially during the summer months.</P>
    <P>Road accident statistics for 1995, the most up to date available, show that 11.6 per cent of all car accidents involved a driver from outside Ireland and Britain.  The vast majority of these drivers came from countries where cars are driven on the right.  Had regulations been in place in 1995, some of the 29 people killed and the 1,080 people injured might not have been involved in road traffic accidents.  Therefore, road safety measures, with special reference to tourists, should be reviewed immediately to curb this growing problem on our roads.</P>
    <P>A number of measures can be put in place, some quite easily, to turn these statistics around. First, signs should be erected on approach roads to our towns, in hotels and places of interest to tourists providing information on driving on the left.  This proposal follows on from a motion passed by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in the name of Councillor Paddy Hand. I hope the Minister can ensure funds are made available to the council to enable it to implement the motion.</P>
    <P>Signs like these at the point of entry are crucial to make people leaving the ports aware of the correct side of the road on which to drive.  I am aware of only one such sign between Dublin and Galway, a road travelled by a large number of tourists and on which my father lost his life.  This sign, in German, French and English, was erected by a family from Roscommon who lost their daughter in a car accident in that location involving a foreign driver on the wrong side of the road.</P>
    <P>This information should also be made available in hire cars outlets, tourist brochures and hotel rooms.  The only information available at the moment is a two page information sheet which makes the brief statement:</P>
    <P>Road Conditions: Driving is on the left side of the road in Ireland.  Motorists without experience in left-drive countries should be extra cautious, as tourists driving on the wrong <Col N="1581" /> side of the road are the cause of several serious accidents each year.  Road conditions are generally very good, but once off the highway, country roads quickly grow narrow and uneven.</P>
    <P>There must also be a concentration of efforts on the car hire industry.  It has done very little to date to make tourists aware of the correct side of the road on which to drive.  A number of Members had a meeting with industry representatives a few weeks ago and they said they had been examining the issue for a number of years.  Their solution was to put stickers on the mirrors of hire cars stating that people must drive on the left. This is a small step but one in the right direction yet, to date, they have not implemented the proposal. The cost of implementing various proposals has been their excuse.  Placing stickers on mirrors does not cost a fortune whereas it could save a life.  The most effective proposal, but the most expensive, is to put an illuminated warning device into hire cars.  This device could warn drivers, when they turn on the ignition, that they must drive on the left and it could also include an audio warning in two foreign languages.  There are also a number of more sophisticated devices which could be installed but the car hire industry believe they are too expensive.  I ask the Minister to put in place a scheme for tax relief to ensure these devices are installed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Ms Ann O'Brien is in the Gallery this evening. She is the main proposer of these devices and has been involved in one such accident.  Among her proposals for a safer driving campaign for tourists are that all hire cars should have information, especially a device to constantly remind drivers to drive on the left; automatic cars should cost the same to hire as stickshift cars; there should be stricter controls over the age of drivers with medical certificates for people over 65 years; drivers should always get automatic cars if that is what they are used to driving and Bord Fáilte, the National Roads Authority, local county councils and the Automobile Association should get together to devise a sign, which could be sponsored by local business, which should be erected at the main exit routes of towns and cities and throughout the country.  These signs should also be put on exit doors or at the exits of car parks, tourist attractions, B &amp; Bs, hotels, restaurants and pubs.  The implementation of these proposals would ensure that there are fewer accidents on our roads involving foreign drivers.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to formally propose this motion and thank the Minister for coming into the House.  I earnestly request that he implement these proposals as they would be the greatest tribute which could be paid to my late father, the former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, and ensure that tragedies like this are a thing of the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This time last year he was in this House in relation to the same issue, although there was a variation to the motion.  On that occasion he dealt extensively with the issue of road safety.</P>
      <P>Every road death is needless.  When one considers the numbers involved it is important that the Oireachtas continually focuses on this issue.  I wish to put on record the support given by the Minister.  In last year's debate he placed a concrete road safety plan before the House.  Senator Naughten has raised a caveat and I compliment him.  This motion is proposed in conjunction with the campaign led by Ms Ann O'Brien, who is welcome to the House.  I compliment her on her campaign over the past few months on this important issue.</P>
      <P>Five hundred thousand people die in road accidents worldwide every year.  It is one of the biggest killers known to man.  In Northern Ireland more people lost their lives in road accidents than in the Troubles.  This puts the seriousness of this problem in perspective.  It must be addressed by central government and local and regional authorities. Many of the powers and controls formally held by central and local government are now vested in regional authorities.  I would welcome any proposals from the Minister in this regard.</P>
      <P>There is a connection between people's ability to drive and their status, size and gender.  Three times as many male drivers are killed as female drivers.  We have a persistent problem of speeding among young male drivers.  This has to be addressed by a more focused campaign directed at males between 18-25 years of age.  Many of these men are unsafe drivers.  The statistics speak loudly on this point.  Women drivers are frequently jeered at, but the reality is that three times as many men as women lose their lives in road accidents.  Men will have to address this problem.  It must be addressed in the context of education.  As a gender, men seem incapable of containing themselves on the roads.  This is causing devastation in the deaths and injuries resulting from these needless accidents.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Naughten's comments about driving on the left hand side of the road. Tourism is a huge industry in this country.  There has been a mushrooming of car hire companies as a result of tourists wishing to see the Irish countryside.  This is the kind of product we wish to sell, but it is important that tourists are continually made aware of which side of the road on which to drive.</P>
      <P>I have driven in Spain and they have a more continuous system of reminding drivers than exists in Ireland.  The Senator's comments should be listened to.  Until we implement a consistent mechanism of reminding tourists of which side of the road on which to drive we are not going to get far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> Senator McAughtry asked me to raise the problem of street names in our cities.  Many tourists experience great difficulty finding their way around.  If one is in Northern Ireland street names are clearly visible at junctions and intersections. We have no uniform system of street names.  It varies from one local authority to another.  We should standardise this process if we are selling tourism as a major industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to see permanent checks on the road worthiness of hire cars.  The last time this motion came before the House I had three specific proposals to put to the Minister.  I am glad he has enacted two of these &mdash; the extension of the car scrappage scheme and his decision not to extend tolling on the M50.  He is obviously a very receptive Minister.  I hope that by raising this issue we will bring home to people how significant this issue is at a time of the year when thousands of tourists are using our roads.</P>

      <P>Somebody has to mind the shop.  I worry about where the others are.  I compliment Senator Naughten on this motion.  He makes a compelling argument, given his personal circumstances, and this lends authority to what he has to say.  The Senator is also to be complimented on the statistics he brought before us.  I was not aware of many of these.</P>
      <P>There are two critical elements in this issue. First, people arriving by ferry driving their own cars.  This can be a greater difficulty as the steering wheel is on the left hand side.  I have driven in most European countries, New Zealand and Fiji and it makes it easier if the steering wheel is on the opposite side to that to which one is accustomed.  This acts as a continual reminder that one should be on the other side of the road.</P>
      <P>It is eminently sensible for hired cars to have more than a window display reminding drivers. There should be an audio signal.  Volvo introduced an audio and visual signal reminding people to wear seat belts and a similar system could be incorporated into hire cars given the existing technology.  Having hired cars in France, Germany, Spain, Holland and Denmark, I cannot remember a circumstance where it was explicit that I should be driving on the right hand side of the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One frequently picks up hire cars at an airport. There are plenty of signs adjacent to airports but there is an onus on the car hire companies to remind drivers.  Senator Naughten's statistics are a compelling argument for such initiatives.  Ms O'Brien is also to be complimented.  It is an achievement for a citizen to bring a motion to the <Col N="1584" /> floor of the Seanad or the Dáil.  We must take her recommendations into account.</P>
    <P>Tourists coming to drive in Ireland have the most time to read about this issues on the ferry or plane.  There is a lot of literature on aircraft and ferries.  It would be appropriate if the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Tourism and Trade could encourage <i>Cara</i> magazine or similar publications to include a routine section which reminds people they must drive on the left hand side.  The vast majority of these accidents happen within a short distance of the ports of entry, whether airports or ferryports.  This could be looked at.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of language on road signs adjacent to airports and ferryports.  They should be multi-lingual and we should not assume that everyone in the world reads English.  There is also understandable confusion in the translation from miles to kilometres on signposts.  This causes considerable confusion for tourists and even for English people visiting the country.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of our behaviour at roundabouts.  In France there is the system of &ldquo;priorité adroit&rdquo; so one keeps coming on the larger roundabouts.  This causes particular problems for some of our continental visitors.  Perhaps some system of uniformity could be introduced.</P>
    <P>It might also be assumed that because visitors are driving on a motorway they will automatically be on the right side of the road.  They will be in the direction they are travelling.  However, they tend, as do most of the citizens who drive down the Naas dual carriageway, to stay in the outside lane and pass on the inside, which is not what they should do.  They are not peculiar in that, as many Irish citizens do the same.</P>
    <P>We should consider measures such as automatic cars being the same price as other hired cars, the manual shift, the systems in hired cars, information on ferries and aeroplanes coming into the country, signage and road safety in general.</P>
    <P>We are self-conscious at our lack of signposting and we assume every tourist gets lost.  We find them in Connemeara looking at the signposts as Gaeilge, looking at their maps wondering where they are, not only where they are going to, which brings us to the point &ldquo;If I knew where you started from, I could tell you where to go.&rdquo;  When I visited Fiji, there were virtually no signposts. One goes to countries where one does not expect to find signposts.  It may be the case that many tourists who come to Ireland do not expect the same standard of signposting they would find in Germany or in France.  Perhaps they do; I do not know the answer.  Just as they expect to find rain, perhaps they expect it to be more difficult to drive around the country.  I do not think the difficulty is on minor roads.  Tourists tend to stay on the left on minor roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> In terms of finding their way around, I am not sure about the need for sophisticated signposts. Many of them are well able to use maps.  I know from my own experience, particularly in Fiji, that one follows the map, which hopefully gets one where one wants in safety on the right or left hand side of the road, whichever happens to be appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This motion is long overdue.  People like Ann O'Brien, who is here today, have suffered due to road accidents.  She is working hard to find ways in which the suffering and loss she has endured will not be visited on others.  The leader of our party, Senator O'Sullivan will address this motion further.  Ms O'Brien sent a very nice letter to our leader to remind her of this matter.</P>
      <P>Tourists coming to Ireland are reminded at our airports and ferryports of the need to drive on the left and often this is all they hear about it.  We need other signs throughout the countryside.  This can be done through consultation between the Road Safety Council and the Department of the Environment.  I do not expect them to put up signs everywhere, but there should at least be a number of reminders.</P>
      <P>Car rental companies can play a big role in handling the matter through signs and advice.  It would be of great benefit if the last thing said to someone hiring a car was &ldquo;Drive on the left&rdquo;. Such reminders and the spoken word can achieve the aim of safety.  The matter should also be thrashed out at county council level.  If the Minister contacted each council we could come up with suggestions and solutions.  Between us we could help to get rid of carnage on the road.</P>
      <P>Private enterprise and semi-State bodies could aid heritage centres and historic sites in providing small signs in different languages to remind tourists to drive on the left.  Hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;Bs could also have cards to remind visitors to keep to the left.  Entertainment venues could also use the public address system at the end of the night to ask visitors to drive on the left.  A combination of ministerial directives, local authorities and the private sector could make the roads safer.</P>
      <P>We need to standardise signs and road markings throughout the country.  As one goes from county to county the signs are reasonably clear but they need to be the same.  It is important that signs and lines on the road are uniform.  Often the lines on roads are different colours in different counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When roadworks are finished and roads are clear, it is important that all signs are removed. Sometimes signs remain and the reason they were put there is gone.  This makes people careless of other signs.  They see signs saying &ldquo;roadworks ahead&rdquo; when there are none and ignore others saying the same.  Sometimes the condition of <Col N="1586" /> roads where work is taking place is not the best, especially at night when vision is impaired. Uneven surfaces should be clearly signposted or traffic should not be allowed to travel over them.</P>
    <P>Something should also be done by the Minister and the Road Safety Council about lights.  On roads at night, one light often points to the moon and another to the ground.  The use of dimmer lights is often non-existent and many people do not remember what the dim switch is for, especially when travelling behind drivers.  All of these factors cause accidents.  If we can reduce these, we can reduce the number of accidents on the road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion with particular reference to road safety information for tourists.  There is no specific evidence to suggest that tourists are a high risk category of road user.  Individual accidents which we are aware of have heightened our awareness in this regard.  I join with Members in welcoming Ann O'Brien to the House and the debate.</P>
      <P>Road accident facts reports available to me do not provide information in relation to the number of accidents in which tourists are involved or the causes of such accidents.  However, in 1995, while 88.4 per cent of car drivers involved in fatal and injury accidents in this country were identified as being residents of Ireland, Britain or Northern Ireland, the other 11.6 per cent were identified as other or unknown.  As Senator Naughten said, it is fair to assume that some of these people were tourists.</P>
      <P>Special precautions are taken to assist visitors in their understanding and appreciation of driving, cycling or walking on our roads.  In 1996 almost five million tourists visited Ireland.  The involvement of even one in a road accident that might be avoided is one too many.</P>
      <P>Last September I introduced a new multi-lingual road traffic sign to warn drivers of the requirement to drive on the left-hand side of the road.  That sign illustrates the left-hand driving requirement in diagram form as well as stating it in English, French and German.  It is designed for use, in particular, at exits from ports and airports and for areas of high tourist amenity.  Details of that sign were circulated to all road authorities and are also set out in the traffic signs manual which I published and circulated last December.</P>
      <P>Provision of the sign is a matter for individual road authorities and as it was only introduced last September it may take some time for local authorities to erect it at all locations where they consider that it necessary.  I will do all I can to ensure that more of these signs are erected and seen by the millions of tourists whom we welcome each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another tourist specific measure is the National Safety Council's information leaflet for <Col N="1587" /> tourists.  This is distributed free of charge to the major car hire firms, including all firms operating from airports and ferry terminals; to Bord Fáilte and to local authorities.  The leaflet was redesigned and updated in 1996.  The text in English, French and German covers essentials, including clear advice that all traffic must drive on the left; on motorway, information and important regulatory signs; on speed limits and traffic lights.</P>
    <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, who has a special interest in this matter, that he has been in touch with the Car Rental Council of Ireland on the availability of road safety information to tourists.  That organisation has a strong interest in ensuring the safety of their clients and its members are very conscious of the need for proper information to be given to tourists about driving conditions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the majority of tourists in Ireland speak English to some degree and I hope that at least some of them pick up on the important safety messages on radio and television which advise on drink driving, excessive speeding and the use of seat belts.  These are not exclusively Irish factors in the long list of road accident causes: the messages are important for all road users.</P>
    <P>I am considering what further measures might be introduced in our effort to avoid the involvement of tourists in road accidents and I will support in whatever way I can any proposals for the fitting of signs or devices in hired cars which I understand are being developed.  We must continue to have regard also to the provision of information to the increasing number of tourists who bring their own cars and this is where the provision of information on road signs, in leaflets and through all tourists organisations is crucial.  A very positive comment has already been made regarding the use of airlines and ferries to provide on board information for those travelling to Ireland. I will bring this issue to the attention of the Minister for Tourism and Trade.</P>
    <P>Road safety with a specific focus on tourists is not the complete picture; we cannot look at that in isolation.  Our road accident record for the past two years is not good.  The decline started in summer 1995 when accident numbers shot up in comparison with previous years.  That rising trend has continued despite the trojan efforts of Government Departments, the Garda, local authorities, the National Roads Authority and the National Safety Council.  Since I spoke in response to a similar motion in this House almost 12 months ago, more than 400 people have died as a result of road accidents and many thousands have been injured.  This is the equivalent of a small village being eradicated, a sobering and staggering fact.</P>
    <P>Because of my concern when the rising accident <Col N="1588" /> trend became evident, in 1995 I had a review of road safety policy undertaken.  This involved all responsible agencies and was carried out under the auspices of my Department's high level group on road safety.  Following that review in May of last year I launched a new road safety strategy entitled &ldquo;Road Safety Together&rdquo;.  It focuses on all responsible agencies, namely, my Department, the Department of Justice and the Garda, the National Roads Authority, the National Safety Council, the Irish Insurance Federation and the local authorities, working together with the road user to increase the effectiveness of our enforcement, education, engineering and encouragement measures.</P>
    <P>If experience over the last ten years has shown us anything it is that there are complex factors which influence road accident trends.  There are no simple magic wand solutions.  It takes time for new measures to achieve positive results.  Trying to reverse the upward spiral is a challenging task for all of us.  The very sad and disturbing reality is that most accidents can be avoided by the road user whether they are a driver, pedestrian, cyclist or motorcyclist.</P>
    <P>There are many established road safety measures with which we are familiar, all of which are aimed at supporting the safe use of our road network.  It is important to ensure that increased levels of road safety are brought about by making it safer for people to move around and not by curtailing their freedom to do so.  In recent years there has been major investment in road infrastructure, with record spending on both national and non-national roads.  Intensive high profile road safety promotion campaigns have highlighted, in particular drink driving, excessive and inappropriate speeding and the importance of wearing seat belts.  These campaigns mounted by the National Safety Council are updated as necessary to accommodate changing accident trends, changes in road user behaviour and changes in advertising and media styles.  Improvements in vehicle safety include statutory increases in tyre thread depth, compulsory fitting of seat belts in front and rear car seats and fitting of speed governors in heavy goods vehicles over 12 tons and in buses.  Changes in vehicle design and demands for higher safety levels in vehicles tend in many circumstances to be consumer led.  This has the great advantage that changes are more readily and speedily accepted.</P>
    <P>An intensive review and update was applied to drink driving legislation in 1994 and 1995.  This resulted in a comprehensive restructuring of drink driving laws based primarily on the adoption of a limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and the adoption of one of the most stringent penalty systems in the EU.</P>
    <P>There has been a reaction in the past week to the announcement by the EU Transport Commissioner that the Commission will examine, as <Col N="1589" /> part of its new road safety programme, the harmonisation of blood alcohol limits in the Union to a level of 0.5.  The Commission has suggested that in certain circumstances such a measure could result in a reduction in accidents of between 5 and 40 per cent.  While I have no plans to change the limits in this country and it will be some time before there are substantive developments in Europe, if any, we cannot ignore the fact that drinking and driving continues to be a significant contributory factor in road accidents both at home and throughout the EU.</P>
    <P>Established road safety measures must continue to be maintained, developed and enforced. I agree that this is not enough and I have recently taken measures in the context of the continuous review and updating of road safety policy by Government.  There is no room for sitting back or for complacency.  The problem requires us to be continuously proactive in seeking new answers, suggestions and solutions.</P>
    <P>In 1996, I published a guide to road safety engineering in Ireland which has become known as the &ldquo;blackspots manual&rdquo; and that is literally what it is.  It is a code of good practice for the treatment of high accident stretches of roads by means of low cost engineering measures.  Such measures will have been noted by Members of the House as they travel around the country.  The guide will assist local authority engineers, draughtsmen and technicians in identifying, analysing and treating high risk sections of road and dealing with accident blackspots on the road network. Up to the end of 1996, almost £2 million pounds were spent by the National Roads Authority on the programme of low cost safety measures at high accident locations.  A further £1 million will be allocated to the programme in 1997.  These works are of direct benefit to all road users, Irish citizens and tourists alike.</P>
    <P>Last year I also published a comprehensive traffic signs manual for the guidance of local authorities.  It is a good code of practice which will help to ensure that we have an effective and well maintained traffic sign system in this country. This is fundamental to the operation of a safe and efficient road network.  One of the thrusts of the manual is the use of less text on road signs thereby getting messages across more directly to road users, whatever their native language.</P>
    <P>Some people suggest that enforcement is the most important element of any road safety strategy. I would agree that high levels of highly visible enforcement by the Garda Síochána is a vital and critical element of the strategy.  There is a continuing need for unrelenting attention to traffic law enforcement by the Garda.  Last year they undertook to provide vigorous and sustained levels of enforcement as part of our national <i>Road Safety Together Strategy.</i>  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, confirmed earlier this year in the Dáil that enforcement of traffic law remains <Col N="1590" /> a high priority for the Garda and that they would continue to have the necessary resources, both in personnel and equipment, to carry out this task. The Minister also assured the Dáil that the Garda authorities are committed to rigorous enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts, including the law on drink driving, on a year-round basis.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that he proposes at an early date to set up a national traffic policy bureau, in relation to traffic policing on a national basis, to ensure a co-ordinated and policy driven approach by all gardaí to the issue of traffic law enforcement.  My most recent update of road traffic law was to introduce fixed penalties, commonly known as on-the-spot fines, for speeding offences from 1 December 1996. These fines are only applied by the Garda to minor speeding offences because there is no question of avoiding court prosecutions and appearances for serious and repeated breaches of the law.  The aim of these regulations is twofold: to act as a clear, visible and instant deterrent to those drivers who travel at excessive speeds and to reduce the amount of time the Garda have to spend in the courts, thereby allowing them to spend more time on the roads and streets to enforce the law.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day we are hugely dependent on the road user in improving our road safety record and in eliminating the scourge of traffic accidents from our society.  One of the effects of a prosperous economy is that we have evermore vehicles coming on stream.  Increased volume of traffic means more accidents.</P>
    <P>All the measures we have taken are directed at the road user, some are passive and some are active.  It is up to all of us to receive the message, to use the information provided and to heed the warnings.  With regard to tourists I have outlined the measures in place and I have undertaken to support others whenever I can.  We can expect up to five million tourists to visit this country during 1997.  Those who drive cars will encounter Irish people whether it be when they are buying petrol, hiring cars or looking for directions.  Those Irish people who meet the driving tourist can play a part by giving a friendly reminder about driving on the left in support of our efforts at official level.  I remain open to any further proposition or suggestion from Senators which would bring about an improvement in our unacceptable road accident record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little in the Minister's speech with which anybody could disagree. However, he has lost sight of the proposition in this all party motion which seeks to update all measures relating to road safety with special relevance to information provided to tourists.  There is only one way we can avoid some of the major problems associated with tourists driving on our <Col N="1591" /> roads.  We must look for a common driving system where everyone would drive on the left. There may be a small state where drivers drive on the same side of the road as they do in Britain, Ireland and Malta but all other drivers drive on the same side of the road.  The five million tourists who will visit Ireland this year, excepting those from Britain and Malta, will think they are driving on the wrong side of the road.</P>
      <P>This motion has nothing to do with the specific road safety aspects of drink driving, speed or the law as it stands in Ireland.  It specifically seeks to ensure that a method is found to inform tourists that this is one of the few countries where drivers drive on the left.  Tourists coming off ships or planes will hire cars, find that the steering wheel is on the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; side of the car and will feel they are driving on the wrong side of the road. Irrespective of what one says to tourists, they cannot be detained for an hour at the car hire location and taught that, as they leave it, they must drive on the opposite side of the road to which they normally drive.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that what the Minister has said here about road safety is not important.  It is very important but the Minister must ensure that foreign drivers are always well informed.  They must be made aware of our drink driving laws and speed limits and of the fact that they must have roadworthy cars.  I have come across tourists who left Dublin Airport on busy weekends, hired cars and found they were not roadworthy.  These tourists have been stopped on the road between Dublin Airport and the city centre and have been told their cars are not roadworthy and they were stranded.  People should not drive vehicles which are not roadworthy and car hire operators should not rent non-roadworthy cars.</P>
      <P>Recently, I came across a case where a well known photographer who was on the way to Dublin Airport to return a car only to find he was not insured.  The garda, who confiscated the car, left him on the side of the road.  He had £22,000 worth of camera equipment with him and was returning from a delayed race meeting at Punchestown. He was not insured because the car hire company at Dublin Airport rented a car from a fleet in County Roscommon which was not insured.  Although the garda was right to confiscate the car, he was dumped on the side of the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years many road accidents have resulted in deaths.  These accidents have been caused by people driving on the wrong side of the road about which there is nothing we can do because people are conditioned to drive on a particular side.  The Department of the Environment has made new signs available to county councils which could erect multilingual signs if they so wished.  Few, if any, of the councils I contacted knew about the signs.  When driving between <Col N="1592" /> Counties Kilkenny and Waterford one will see a sign before going under a bridge telling people to drive carefully because they may come across vehicles driving in the middle of the road.  What is a French or a German person supposed to do when they see an English sign telling them they may come across vehicles in the middle of the road?  They should go to the Department of the Environment to ask for a new bridge.  Irrespective of the number of signs we erect, that will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The only way to resolve this problem is to change to the same system of driving which exists in 90 per cent of the world.  People will say that to do that would cost too much, but it would not. Approximately 90 per cent of cars in the world are left-hand drive.  We must change to the system enjoyed by the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>The aim of the campaign is to save lives but the Minister has not said anything which will do that. Special information should be provided to tourists. Where can a non-English speaking person from Germany arriving at an airport or a sea port get information?  Within two or three miles of Rosslare or elsewhere, they find they are driving on the wrong side of the road and they swerve. The Minister will know about the number of people arriving in Rosslare who create problems. The problems created on the road from Rosslare to Wexford town are unbelievable.</P>
    <P>Cognisance should be taken of these problems which will not be dealt with by the Minister's suggestion that we implement the rules of the road.  Ireland, Britain, Malta and some African countries must change from right-hand to left-hand drive.  Every county council should be asked to table a motion requesting a change in the rules of the road from left-hand to right-hand drive. We should drive on the same side as the Americans, Germans and French and the five million tourists who visit Ireland.  If we do that, we may have a chance of preventing 10 per cent of accidents which occur within ten miles of Shannon and Dublin Airports and Rosslare Harbour.  The Minister will be aware of the carnage on the road between Rosslare and Wexford because French and German and other continental tourists do not realise they should drive on the left.  I ask the Minister to consider this specific motion which does not concern overall road safety, but giving information to tourists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Leader of the House for tabling this motion and Ms Ann O'Brien for her courageous and determined campaign, which I am sure will be successful.  We only become aware of this problem when we visit a country where we have to drive on the right. People see signs and get leaflets when they rent cars but if their mind wanders as they approach a roundabout or turn right across traffic, problems occur.  There is need for constant, and not once <Col N="1593" /> off, reminders for people driving on the side of the road with which they are unfamiliar.</P>
      <P>For a year and a half I lived in a country where one drives on the right and when I returned home I had to adapt to driving on the left.  Those of us who have been on holiday will also have had that experience.  Although I had been back in Ireland for one month and thought I was familiar with driving on the left I found myself on the wrong side of an unfamiliar road.  One finds oneself in this situation when one least expects it and, unfortunately, that is when accidents occur.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Ms Ann O'Brien on the way she is conducting this campaign.  She has met the relevant bodies, such as the Car Rental Council, and has approached local authorities and Members of the Seanad.  I was glad to represent the Labour Party at a meeting.  She has gone about it in a systematic and organised way and for that reason I believe she will succeed.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has responded to the specific proposal this evening and says he will support in whatever way he can any proposals for fitting signs or devices in hired cars.  That is one of the central elements that would make a difference in this regard.  The Car Rental Council has also responded positively.</P>
      <P>Some kind of electronic device is suggested that would have both an aural and visual element so that drivers would be reminded which side of the road they should be on.  It would be a regular reminder which would respond to particular movements the driver may make &mdash; for example, turning or going onto a roundabout.  It is a practical proposal and I welcome the Minister's response to it.  It should be supported and should be available for hire cars in particular.  Obviously, the person who comes in their own car is a different matter and maybe some kind of stick-on device could be used in that situation.  The warning devices could also be hired by someone coming into the country and they could return them on their way out at the car ferry.</P>
      <P>As regards what Senator Lanigan said about the person from Germany who might need a sign, the Minister said there are signs at entry points in English, French and German.  I do not know whether there is a need for them to be in other languages or not, but they are certainly a help.</P>
      <P>We could mention many other issues of road safety.  Traffic calming measures are now being introduced by many local authorities which are quite effective in relation to other problems. However, I wanted to concentrate on the specific problem that was raised in this campaign.  I support it fully and I welcome the fact that the Minister is also supporting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised a good point concerning putting information on planes and ships.  That should be implemented as soon as possible.  It is crucial that when people have time, coming over on planes and ships, the magazines <Col N="1594" /> they read should contain special supplements on road safety.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes and Senator Dardis raised two points concerning signage in cities and in country areas.  Most Members know from Seanad election campaigns &mdash; I did the last one with my late father &mdash; that when travelling around the country signage is very poor and street signs, in particular, are inadequate.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan raised the matter of people bringing their own cars into the country.  One way around that might be to give such visitors audio tapes of Irish music and between each song they would be reminded to drive on the left hand side of the road.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned low cost safety measures in high accident locations, which is a good idea.  However, he should also consider putting rumble strips on every white line throughout the country.  It would be expensive but if people crossed the white line they would hear the rumble strips under their tyres and if they are falling asleep it would quickly awaken them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his speech that there is no specific evidence to suggest tourists are a high risk category on the roads.  Every single driver in the country, however, is aware of at least one incident in which they had a narrow escape with a foreigner driving on the wrong side of the road. Some 11.6 per cent of accidents are caused by drivers who are not used to driving on the left hand side of the road.  That is a huge number of accidents. The statistics suggest that over one in ten road accidents are caused by foreign drivers.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of road signs in different languages telling people to drive on the left hand side, but I hope the necessary finances will be put in place for this.  There is no point in telling county councils to put these signs up without providing the finance to erect them.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan's idea of changing over to driving on the right hand side of the road is pure lunacy.  He said that Ireland, Britain and Malta are the only places where driving is on the left hand side of the road, but he omitted Japan, which is one of the most populated countries in the world and has left hand side driving.  Senator Lanigan is suggesting the situation should be changed around so that we would all drive on the right hand side of the road.  However, if 10 per cent of road accidents are caused by foreigners, how many accidents would we have with local people changing to the other side of the road? Senator O'Sullivan said she had such difficulties after living only 18 months abroad.  Accidents would rise by 90 per cent if Senator Lanigan's unbelievable suggestion was accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of the problem comes back to the car hire companies, which have done little to solve the difficulty.  Regulations must be put in place because such devices as have been suggested will not be installed willingly by car hire firms.  There must be tax incentives to do so, in addition to regulations making the installation of such devices compulsory.  Tilt switches could also be <Col N="1595" /> installed in cars so that if someone becomes drowsy and swerves to the other side of the road a warning light and sound alarm would alert them.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister's agreement to erect multi-lingual signs and to install devices, he must also create structures to ensure they are put in place.  The problem to date has been that car hire companies will not install them because it <Col N="1596" /> does not pay them to do so.  At the end of the day, that is all they worry about.</P>
