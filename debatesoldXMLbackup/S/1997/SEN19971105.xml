      <P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to confirm if a £6 million grant has been approved to develop a luxury hotel, convention centre and housing site at Carton House and demesne.</P>
      <P>I have also notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that community employment workers receive secondary benefits for the duration of their community employment participation.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 6, motion 9.  For item 1 I suggest time limits of 15 minutes for spokespersons and ten minutes for all other Senators; Senators may share time.  Item 6, motion 9, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>Today's business is agreed.  Will the Leader indicate the programme of legislation for the remainder of the session?  Will he also indicate the progress, if any, that has been made in preparing the Trinity College Bill which was discussed during the passage of the Universities Act?  My understanding was that a Private Bill would be introduced to put into effect what was agreed at that time.</P>

      <P>The process of constituting the membership of committees has begun.  It is difficult <Col N="558" /> for groups to establish the membership of committees without knowing the Government's intentions.  The latest list we received did not indicate any Government decisions.  It is still reviewing most of the previous committees.  It is very difficult to organise business without knowing what committees are going to be established. We know about three of them but a huge number are under review.  Is the Leader in a position to tell us which committees will be re-established?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Leader the hundreds of angry people protesting outside the House despite the press statement issued yesterday by the Government about delivering on public service pension parity. Obviously this is not the case and considerable clarification is needed.  For example, in the teaching profession so much of the payment is for posts of responsibility, A posts, B posts and vice-principal posts, but they have not been included.  This is one anomaly and we are far from parity.  Seventyseven thousand public servant pensioners are affected by this.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader clarify Government thinking on the recent decision of Judge McCracken regarding the need for every court clerk to be personally appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the enormous and horrendous implications this has for the entire legal process?  If one step of the legal process is wrong then this would have serious implications for every person who appears at a District Court, the initial step for every case and we could have thousands of offenders in prison with questionable convictions.  This decision has huge implications for thousands of cases before the courts at present.  The Minister seems to be taking it very casually.  When one link in the judicial process is considered faulty, the entire process may also be wrong.  Will the Leader inform us whether the Government will introduce legislation to rectify this matter?</P>

      <P>In light of the confirmation we have just received about the nature and scale of the drug problem in this country, can the Leader arrange for this issue to be debated here?  I have no doubt there are people who have an insight into new initiatives which might be taken to prevent drug abuse and to provide better protection for young people.  It is evident that whatever initiatives have been taken to date have been unsuccessful.  It is time we debated this issue.  A Minister should come into this House, listen to our views and allow us to play our part in putting in place a better framework to protect our young people who live in an era where the drug culture has a strong influence.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the abduction of Fr. Des Hartford in the Philippines on 27 October last.  The safety of Fr. Hartford who is a native of Lusk, County Dublin, is a matter of grave concern to his brothers, sisters, extended family and <Col N="559" /> friends in my constituency.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the fears and anxieties of everyone for the missionary who has been in the Philippines for the past 30 years.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his influence with our EU partners or any other agency in the area to make a joint approach to the Filipino authorities to ensure that Fr. Hartford is released unharmed as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the fact that a great many people in this country continue to campaign for the transfer of prisoners from the UK jurisdiction. The British Home Secretary, Jack Straw, recently sanctioned the transfer of three such prisoners to this jurisdiction.  There are at least another half a dozen applications which are currently being processed between our Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the British Home Office.  This is a timely decision in view of the ongoing peace process in Northern Ireland.  In that context I reiterate a request I made some weeks ago that this House should, on an ongoing basis, debate issues relating to our emigrants.  Is there anything in the reform initiatives carried out by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges over the past number of years which would allow such issues to be put before this House by non-Members as we have done in the case of distinguished visitors?  Our most recent visitor was Professor Dooge who discussed EMU.  I am sure there are many Members and others who would welcome a clarification of issues affecting emigrants which do not normally enter the mainstream of Irish political life.  This is an issue which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might address.  Overall I commend the initiative and ask the Leader to convey my sentiments to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I also commend the Taoiseach's appointment of Deputy Keaveney as a Government representative on the Irish prisoners visiting panel in the UK.  It is a welcome initiative and I hope Deputy Keaveney will build on the success she has had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from the newspapers that a new Indonesian Ambassador was among four Ambassadors presenting their credentials to the Council of State yesterday.  That suggests it is opportune for this House to discuss the question of East Timor in order that this gentleman can be apprised of our views on this matter.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, has a distinguished and satisfactory record in this area and I believe he would make himself available. Therefore, this afternoon I will place a motion on the Order Paper, after consultation with the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign.  Will the Leader indicate if it would be possible to have a discussion on this matter in which the House has shown a consistent interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> Would it be possible to have a report on the functioning of the litter legislation, specifically as it affects Dublin?  There does not appear to have been any improvement.  This is something of which we should be ashamed.  A couple of days ago I stopped a young man in the street who had thrown away a lot of rubbish.  I remonstrated with him and the older person who I thought was with him said, &ldquo;I am not his father; I am German. There is nothing you can do; the Irish people are dirty and they drink too much&rdquo;.  I replied that there were some things in his background which I could draw to his attention which are slightly worse than uncleanliness.  It is a common perception that we are dirty and some people are at ease with that notion.  We should disabuse them of this as it is a serious and unpleasant idea.  It deters tourists and gives the wrong impression.</P>
    <P>On the question of the confusions in the law which have led to people being released, we might have the wrong end of the stick.  We have wasted enormous sums of money building prisons which are not needed.  If the Government could be persuaded to spend money on investment in areas such as the north inner city the crime figure could be halved.  If we are to have a debate on this subject let us also have a debate on the morality of addressing crimes simply by building prisons.</P>
    <P>I welcome that we are being treated to a programme of music in the Oireachtas.  I detect this every afternoon on the Order of Business.  This afternoon it was harmonicas.  Could I have the address to which I might reply to join the mouth organ school?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the trial of Louise Woodward it is time to have a full discussion in this House because there is concern about the employment of au pairs or nannies, particularly in the education field, where one is recommending a young girl, with post-leaving certificate, perhaps to take a year out to take up a position as an au pair or nanny.  I examined the records and it appears that Ireland has not yet signed the Council of Europe agreement which deals with pay and conditions employers would have to provide to employ a nanny.  I am concerned about this. There is a lot of sloppiness regarding this issue which makes everybody apprehensive, particularly those in the education field.  We should also examine the area of child training in regard to pay and conditions.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to give some time to have a full discussion on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's call for clarification on the pensions issue and the huge number of teachers who are confused about the announcement in the past few days.  Would it be possible for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to say when he intends to move on the long promised heart and lung transplant unit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my compliments to the Minister for Finance and the Government for addressing the issue of public service pensions that the last Government failed to address.  I also compliment the Ministers for Finance and Health and Children for addressing the issue of pay for nurses and retired nurses and to undo the wrong perpetrated on them by the former Minister for Health in these negotiations.</P>
      <P>Everyone agreed there was a need to set up a number of tribunals in recent years to establish facts and elucidate information.  In the interests of civil servants, who, regardless of the composition of successive Governments, have made an excellent contribution to the State, I suggest the establishment of a new tribunal to discover the identity of the individual who leaked documents from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This would clear the good name of civil servants and establish whether former Government advisers were involved.  We must discover who was responsible and re-establish the good name of civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food matters relating to the payment of premia and income supports to farmers?  Under a charter of rights agreed by the farming organisations and the Minister a number of years ago, such payments are meant to be paid by 31 October. However, only 33 per cent of them were made by that date.  This is critical for farmers, particularly because research carried out by the CSO, the Department, Teagasc and other bodies has shown a continuing reduction in farm incomes.  Will the Leader raise this matter with the Minister so that he might discover why the payments were not delivered on time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the issue of masts and pylons?  Concerns have been expressed about unauthorised pylons or those erected without planning permission. I raised this matter on previous occasions and I request that it be debated in the near future. Those people who erected unauthorised masts and pylons should be made comply with the law and apply, under the Planning Act, to have these structures retained.  It is impossible for a local authority to implement strict planning regulations if large pylons are being erected each day.  A number of Members represent local authorities and the House must be seen to be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review committee of the European Union will meet in the near future to discuss the funding granted to agencies under the headings of peace and reconciliation and the international fund.  The House should examine the effectiveness of the funding allocated or distributed to 74 agencies nationwide.  That money is thinly spread among many organisations and community groups and they cannot deliver anything; this leads to a lack of confidence.  Local authorities are also involved in this area and their members expect the House <Col N="562" /> to express a view on this important matter.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue in the near future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Ministers for Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs to appear before the House to discuss the issue of elderly people who are not members of the VHI or who did not take out insurance against old age?  These people have incomes ranging from £5,000 to £10,000 and if they possess a medical card they are catered for by the State.  It has been said that the State is lacking in this area but it must be pointed out that the resources are in place.  However, if a person is earning between £5,000 and £12,000 a year, which is a very small income, and living alone, they will not get any help from the social services. They are treated as if they are lepers.  If a local health nurse visits them, all they can do is recommend that they employ somebody to look after them but one cannot get anybody to look after an elderly person for sweatshop wages.</P>

      <P>We also hope that Fr. Hartford will be released.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to address an urgent debate in the House on many matters which are problematic throughout the world.  At a meeting of the UN Security Council last Thursday is was suggested that sanctions be imposed on Unita, which is one of two parties to the Lusaka agreement in Angola. People may not be interested in Angola but there are more landmines in that country than people. The most horrific civil war occurred there over a period of 12 years.  Angolan Government forces have gone into Brazzaville and areas surrounding Angola, yet no sanctions have been imposed on the MPLA which is the majority Government party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs address the problems that Unita is concerned with at present?  A Senator said they won the elections, but they won them in the same way that elections were won in various parts of the world where the government filled ballot boxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for misbehaving. Senator Lanigan has that effect on me sometimes.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I asked the Leader about landmines and on that occasion I agreed with Senator Lanigan.  The armaments industry has killed more innocent people than drugs ever will.  More innocent civilians are killed by the products of the western arms industry than by the entire Third World drugs industry.  Rich people produce arms to sell to the poor while poor people produce drugs to sell to the rich.  We disapprove of one and make money from the other.  We should debate the issue.</P>
      <P>In the same newspaper report that Senator Norris mentioned, I noticed that the Ambassador of Brunei presented his credentials yesterday. May I ask the Leader why we seem to have diplomatic relations with every country except Cuba, which would be regarded as one of the leaders of the Third World?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it because we are on the side of the United States?  Is there any other reason we have relations with much worse and with many better countries?  The only reason we do not is that one country disapproves of us having diplomatic relations with the most significant country in the developing world.  Will the Leader ask our progressive and liberal Minister for Foreign Affairs why we have not done the obvious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the continuing blockade by truck drivers in France?  As a trading nation this dispute impacts adversely on our importers and exporters and has horrendous consequences for our transport industry because domestic and international hauliers are badly affected by it.  Will the Leader raise with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the fact that those involved have been able to conduct their campaign with impunity?  It is unacceptable to have such a display of anarchy in a democracy. There should be some harmonisation at EU level of the methods by which the law is administered to ensure that this never happens again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Leader suggest to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that our <Col N="564" /> electoral system be examined?  Any electoral system which failed to elect people of the calibre of Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese to the Lower House must be in urgent need of examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I welcome the fact that expressions which conveyed a partitionist mentality during the election campaign were emphatically rejected by the electorate.  The maturity of the electorate also contrasted with the expressions of some Unionist politicians which did not display the same level of maturity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Seanad, like the Dáil, hold a debate on agriculture and the Santer proposals? It is most important to hold such a debate at this juncture.  Mr. Santer visited this country last week and there is great concern throughout rural Ireland and particularly in the agriculture sector about the proposals.  The issue should be fully debated in the Seanad.  It is even more important that the Minister for Agriculture and Food be present for the debate.  I am not casting aspersions on the Ministers of State but the debate warrants the attendance of the Minister, Deputy Walsh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly identify with the sentiments expressed by Senator Finneran about the parity of pay issue in the public service.  I also support Senator Walsh's comments about the plight of our truck drivers.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader take up with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, the fact that the name of many housing estates is in English only?  If it is not already provided for in legislation, the Minister should introduce the necessary legislation to ensure that all road signs pertaining to roads, housing estates and other such constructions are bilingual and that it be a requirement for an individual or corporate body to secure the relevant planning permission.</P>

    <P>As regards Senator Costello's point about the court clerk appointments by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he can discuss the matter with the Minister when he is in the House next week.

Senator Seán Ryan spoke of Father Des Hartford who has been a missionary for 30 years and we sympathise with his position in the Philippines.  This morning's news stated that a member of the Filipino Government has gone to see how this matter is progressing.  Deputy Wright has expressed concern on this matter in the Dáil and I share that concern as do all Members of this House.  I will pass on those concerns to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney welcomed the transfer of prisoners and the House would concur with that.  He also suggested an annual debate on emigrants and I would be pleased to accede to that request.  I will facilitate Senator Norris's call for a debate on East Timor.  I also agree with his comments on the Litter Act and the need for tighter enforcement of its provisions.  Like me, the Senator will welcome the improved proposals for O'Connell Street.  Hopefully we will see a marked improvement.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde called for a debate on the pay and conditions of <i>au pairs</i> and nannies.  This is in the context of the Louise Woodward case which has captured the world's imagination and I will facilitate this request.  Senator Jackman inquired about the heart and lung transplant unit. I will raise this matter with the Department of Health to see if I can obtain the information she requested.  Senator Finneran called for a tribunal on leaks and the protection of the good name of the Civil Service.  I will have to think about this to see how it can be progressed.</P>
      <P>Senators Connor and Hayes called for a debate on agriculture.  We will have such a debate.  I will discuss this with the Minister for Agriculture and Food to see when it can be arranged.  I hope it will be in the very near future.</P>

      <Col N="568" /> Senator McGowan called for a debate on the 74 agencies overseeing the disbursement of EU funds.  This is a very good idea and I will confer with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  He was in this House a few weeks ago and this is a timely proposal from one of the fathers of the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan made a good proposal about senior citizens who find themselves in dire need. I will contact the Departments of Health and Social, Community and Family Affairs on this matter and arrange to have a debate.  Senator Brendan Ryan asked me to inquire from the Minister for Foreign Affairs why we do not have diplomatic relations with Cuba.  I will do so and contact the Senator.</P>
    <P>The House will support Senator Walsh's point regarding the French truck drivers' strike.  This is a serious matter for our economy and that of the EU.  It must be looked at by individual member states as well as at EU level.  The Taoiseach spoke to the French Prime Minister yesterday evening in relation to this serious matter.</P>
    <P>The Senator also called for a review of the Electoral Act.  I do not envisage discussing that in this session but perhaps we can do so in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn made a good point.  I did not realise that some of the names of our towns, streets and public places were not in both languages. I will pass on his comments to the Minister and the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the important social issue of disability.  As we approach the 21st century people with disabilities are among the most isolated groups in Irish society.  The publication of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities marked a watershed in their lives.  The report deals comprehensively with the issues facing people with disabilities and their families and carers and is the cornerstone of Government policy.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates, are comprehensively addressed.  It is committed to ensuring that disability is placed where it belongs, on the agenda of every Department and public body. Government policy is based on the core principle of promoting empowerment through appropriate, accessible and responsive services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment to people with disabilities and their families and their carers is underpinned by the decision of the Government to appoint a Minister of State with special <Col N="569" /> responsibility in the area of equality and disability. I am happy to have been the person who was appointed to this role and to be assigned to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I and my colleagues in Government recognise that disability is one of the most important social issues facing Ireland today.</P>
    <P>The key priorities of the Government's programme include: the implementation of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities; an urgent review of the Supreme Court decision on the Employment Equality and Equal Status Bills as they affect people with disabilities; overhauling the means by which the State supports the incomes of people with disabilities; reducing unnecessary bureaucracy in dealing with health agencies; reviewing the operation of the disabled person's grant to meet the real needs of all applicants; provision of adequate resources for national respite care; the introduction of a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to promoting access by people with disabilities to the use of public spaces and facilities and to the whole of the transport chain; provision of adequate residential facilities for those with a mental handicap and autism; new tax allowance for carers of people with disabilities. In relation to sport and leisure, the Government programme identifies, as a key priority, the need to increase State funding for Special Olympics in Ireland.</P>
    <P>An inter-departmental task force, chaired by my Department, is drawing up a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities based on the commission's report.  The task force is also considering, in conjunction with the commission's report, the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with disabilities. The task force has also been asked for a recommendation on how the concept of &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; can be managed in the context of addressing discrimination against people with disabilities in employment equality legislation.  The issues arising from the Supreme Court finding in respect of the Equal Status Bill also require to be examined.</P>
    <P>An interim report is being finalised for presentation to Government shortly and I am committed to having the final plan of action drawn up as soon as possible thereafter.  In this connection, tenders have been sought for the costing of the commission's report to facilitate the preparation of a strategic, programmatic, cohesive and cost effective plan geared towards promoting equal opportunities for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A monitoring committee, also chaired by my Department, has been set up to oversee the implementation of the commission's recommendations. Its terms of reference are to advise the interdepartmental task force on the prioritisation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities; to provide any assistance and support required by the task force to facilitate the action plan on the rights of people with disabilities; to advise the Department <Col N="570" /> of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as required, on the drawing up of a detailed implementation strategy arising from the commission's recommendations; to make proposals to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of the commission's recommendations and to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which have been accepted by Government or by Ministers.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee has been actively working since it was established and has prepared a comprehensive paper on the issue of &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo;.  Sub-groups of the committee have been set up to advise me on topics for inclusion in a disability awareness campaign which I intend to organise this year and on devising appropriate mechanisms to monitor the implementation of the report.  I would welcome any suggestions Senators may have in relation to the disability awareness campaign.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo; makes a very strong and coherent argument for the investment of £50 million in physical and sensory disability services over a five year period.  Its publication was approved by Government in an environment where there was tremendous pressure not to enter into further commitments.  Commitments in relation to the report are contained in Partnership 2000.  The Government has indicated that resources will be allocated, within the overall expenditure parameters, for the development of services to people with disabilities in line with the report.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has incorporated the cost of implementing the report into its Estimates campaign.  This has already produced a result in the form of £2.18 million which was allocated to physical disability services in the Department's Vote for this year.  I consider that to be a good start.  Since my appointment as Minister of State on 9 July I have been working very hard in relation to the need for funding in that area.</P>
    <P>The report proposes a major development of new services.  It also recommends tackling the funding of existing services.  Clearly it would be unsustainable to develop new services when there are unresolved funding issues in the existing services.</P>
    <P>The perspective of the voluntary sector is that it has taken the initiative and developed services over the years in the absence of State funded services. In many areas voluntary agencies are the major or sole service providers.  The sector has built up these services painstakingly with the unpaid help of highly motivated volunteers and it is accepted that funding for existing services is an issue which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;listening meetings&rdquo; undertaken by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities found that one of the major problems <Col N="571" /> identified was that of access to information. People expressed a great deal of frustration with the unavailability of information.  There was a distinct lack of information in appropriate formats and an absence of a single local centre where information needs could be satisfied with a minimum of hardship.</P>
    <P>In order to address these problems, a number of pilot community services projects aimed at people with disabilities are being set up by my Department.  These projects are being undertaken in Ennis, Cork city, Tallaght/Clondalkin and Cahirciveen.  My Department is making funding available for the recruitment of project workers and to meet associated costs.  I am confident these projects will ensure access at local level by people with disabilities to all information in appropriate formats on issues affecting their lives.  I would also like to see whether a way can be found to facilitate the active participation by people with disabilities in local area partnerships and community fora, thus empowering them to influence the decision making process and to play an active part in their communities.  The pilot projects will also address these issues.</P>
    <P>The Irish Council of People with Disabilities was launched on 11 March by the former President Mary Robinson.  The Government is fully committed to the work of the council and recognises the real need for a permanent independent voice, constantly highlighting issues of concern and ensuring that the rights of people with disabilities are vigorously defended.  My Department has allocated £300,000 to the council this year and will continue to fund the council to enable it to carry out its work as the representative body of people with disabilities and their families, carers and advocates.</P>
    <P>On my appointment as Minister of State, I was assigned responsibility by the Taoiseach for monitoring the 3 per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service. Partnership 2000 contains a commitment that the quota will be met in the public service during the period of the partnership and I intend to pursue this issue with vigour and determination. I have already written to each member of the Cabinet to impress upon them my commitment to reaching the quota and to seek their support in this endeavour.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, and that of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to publish a revised Employment Equality Bill as a matter of urgency. This Bill will take account of the Supreme Court decision.  A revised Equal Status Bill will also be developed to take into account the Supreme Court decision in respect of the Equal Status Bill, 1997, and I expect this to be published during 1998.</P>
    <P>One of the most far-reaching recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was that a disabilities Bill should be introduced.  Work has recently commenced in my Department on the preparation of a disabilities <Col N="572" /> Bill which will set out the rights of people with disabilities and a means of redress where those rights are not upheld.</P>
    <P>Since taking office on 9 July, I have had numerous meetings with ministerial colleagues in an effort to develop cross-departmental working mechanisms to facilitate the effective delivery of services, minimise bureaucracy and promote equality for people with disabilities.  As a result of my commitment to cross-departmental working, it has been possible to deliver the package of measures aimed at people with disabilities which was announced last week by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, in conjunction with me.  A package of funding of £4.325 million was announced and this will directly benefit people with physical and sensory disabilities.  The funding will be provided through the voluntary agencies and will enhance the opportunities for people with disabilities to achieve independent living and community integration. It will cover a range of equipment necessary to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities.  The list of items which we announced as being suitable for this funding included accessible buses, motorised wheelchairs, training equipment, information systems, sensory aids, computers, special beds and hoists.  Senators will be familiar with a number of people who have had problems obtaining basic aids and appliances, such as a wheelchair, bed, hoist or stair lift, and this funding is for the individual needs of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A sum of £50,000 is also being made available to the Irish Council of People with Disabilities for computer equipment for the 30 county networks. The equipment will substantially improve communications between the national office and local networks and will also be used in the training programmes the council will provide under the HORIZON project for which EU funding has been secured.  Senators will be familiar with the council's county by county network and it is important that it be strengthened.  One of the means through which it can be strengthened is supporting the council in this way through the provision of funding for computer equipment. While these grants will make a difference to the position of people with disabilities and others in society, they also reflect the commitment of the Government to target the health of individuals with disabilities.  I want to stress that 11,000 people with disabilities will benefit from this package which was announced by the Minister, Deputy Ahern.  Yesterday we had a meeting with regard to all the voluntary agencies involved and the message to go out is clear &mdash; the £4.3 million is to be divided and received by individuals with disabilities who have real needs in this area.</P>
    <P>Increasing co-operation between Departments on issues that cut across departmental boundaries is essential for effective and efficient use of resources.  This is a good example of how the system works at its best and unmet needs in one area can be matched by opportunities that arise elsewhere <Col N="573" /> in the system.  I acknowledge the positive response of the Minister, Deputy Ahern, in terms of locating the funding in the Department and addressing the question I posed to him and to other Ministers.  Where there is an opportunity to help people with disabilities on a Department by Department basis, it will be done.</P>
    <P>I intend to hold a national disability information day on 24 November in Jury's Hotel, Dublin.  The theme of the day will be &ldquo;Progress through Partnership&rdquo; and the intention is to emphasise the commitment at European and national levels to involve people with disabilities and their representatives in the formation of policy and the planning and delivery of services. People with disabilities, politicians, the social partners and administrators will be told of initiatives in this area by Europe and Ireland and will be invited to buy into the process.  The day will provide an ideal forum to revisit the issues raised at the International Symposium on Disability and Human Rights, which takes place in Dublin Castle on 18 November.  The afternoon session will be devoted to an open forum discussion with a panel of experts.  The audience will include politicians at national and local levels, people with disabilities, representatives of the Irish Council for People with Disabilities, service providers, civil servants and representatives of the social partners, city and county managers and the chief executive officers of health boards.  We would be delighted to have the participation of any Senators with a special interest in the area and they will be most welcome to the open day.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that Ireland, during its EU Presidency, hosted the first ever Presidency conference on equal opportunities for people with disabilities.  It was at this conference that the report of the commission was launched. Also under the Irish Presidency, the Council of Ministers agreed the resolution on equal opportunities and freedom from discrimination for people with disabilities.  Following on from the resolution a high level group of experts on disabilities from member states has been set up.  An officer from my Department represents Ireland on the group.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform also has an important role as regards people with disabilities in the United Nations and the Council of Europe.  Of considerable significance for people with disabilities is the recently negotiated Treaty of Amsterdam which amends existing EU treaties and gives the European Community competence to take action to combat discrimination based on disability.  This means, for example, that the Council of Ministers could adopt a directive dealing with such discrimination which would be binding on member states.  Active participation at an international level is crucial if equal opportunities for people with disabilities is to become a reality.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to build on progress already made in this area.  For my part I intend to ensure that disability will never again be <Col N="574" /> viewed as a problem to be dealt with by charity or as a medical problem to be dealt with by hospitals and institutions.  As we approach the 21st century I am determined to ensure the new millennium will see people with disabilities provided with greater opportunities for pursuing fuller, more independent lives than has been the case in the past.  I ask Senators to join me in this endeavour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, especially because of her commitment to and previous involvement with disability issues.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the Government group for facilitating this debate, which provides an opportunity to speak on this most important issue.  I know that nothing but goodwill exists on all sides of this House towards any attempt to highlight the plight of the disabled in our communities.  There has been considerable debate and much highlighting of particular needs but regrettably the response from Governments has never been adequate.</P>
      <P>There will be no point scoring in this debate. As a nation we all stand indicted of sporadic lip service to meeting the just needs of the disabled. The only point scoring should be by way of declaring total support, backed with action, legislation and other immediately implementable recommendations.  For that reason I will confine my contribution to specific areas of need with suggested remedies or courses of action to meet these needs.  I thank the Minister for her invitation to put forward suggestions that arise from our encounters with disabled people.  I come from a background of teaching people with a learning disabilities.  After today's debate, I hope our combined approach will result in a quantifiable response that we could measure after an agreed length of time.  If we are not successful we will be, like the disabled, voices crying in the wilderness.</P>
      <P>The proposal to establish a non-means tested disability pension to compensate for loss of income due to incapacity to work full time is welcome and I hope it will be part of this year's budget.  At present, a single mature adult in receipt of blind persons pension receives just £70 per week if living at home &mdash; it is impossible to live on that.  The transfer of domiciliary care allowance and transport grants of cars to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is a positive step.  If one is disabled there is nothing worse than going on the dreadful bureaucratic roundabout to find out where one goes to obtain a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give an instance of the idiocy of the rules. A young woman suffering from multiple sclerosis came to me recently.  Because of her lack of physical movement she is in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  She has been in a relationship for some time and she and her boyfriend have a child.  She wants to regularise her union, in today's parlance, but the allowance is means tested so if she marries the payment will be based on her husband's income and she will lose her total allowance.  She is therefore <Col N="575" /> not able to marry because she will lose what is hers &mdash; her only allowance.  Such unthinking conditions are a disgrace and an insult to people in that position.  The suggestions I make may not provide immediate remedies but they are worthy of investigation because there must be a better way.</P>
    <P>The most ridiculous aspect of this matter, which has been in contention for many years, is the lack of adequate transport facilities.  The Minister has addressed this in her comprehensive document.  In the 1980s there was a year of the disabled.  The Dublin Bus/CIE contribution to the year was the introduction of a special low floored vehicle with a ramp.  It was a great design and a good idea but there was only one bus.  I have never discovered what happened to it but as far as the disabled are concerned it never left the terminus. It was like a mystery tour.  It was a good design concept but the level of accessibility was poor.  Bus design should include a mechanical ramp that could be used to allow wheelchair entry into a special bay.  I have seen such vehicles in use in France &mdash; the bus stops and the ramp comes down slowly; the doors are wide enough and the bay is big enough to allow wheelchair users access without assistance.  Their dignity is intact and their right to travel on the bus is ensured.</P>
    <P>An issue I have raised in other fora which further highlights the disregard for the needs of the disabled is the situation which pertains on the DART.  The voice over facility to announce the stations is not used, although it is available.  I am almost afraid to ask why it is not used.  A visually impaired passenger must count the stations from the point they enter the train to know when they reach their destination.  That is a shameful situation which could be remedied easily.</P>
    <P>The possible loss of the Luas system would create more difficulties for disabled passengers. One of the main merits of the light rail system is its accessibility.  The trams and the waiting platforms will be at the same level, the doors on the carriages will be wide and disabled people will have on-street access.  They will not have to go into tunnels or seek assistance.  The voice of the disabled has not been heard amid the demands from the car lobby and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to put the system underground.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State having read her comments on disability issues during the term of the last Government.  Another barrier which could be overcome is the separation of children with disabilities at primary school level.  For some children with multiple handicaps special schools are appropriate.  However, exclusion and loneliness are being foisted on some disabled children who are taken by car to special schools and back home again in the evening, thus not getting a chance to mix with their peers.  In the past, services for handicapped children may have been very bad but the social supports were good.  The story of Christy Brown recounts how he was supported <Col N="576" /> by his extended family, carried on people's backs or wheeled in a cart to the cinema or football matches.  He was not excluded and that is the important lesson.  With regard to the attendance and education of disabled children in the national school system, I am aware that may be expensive but given the strength of the economic growth being experienced we must be able to fund spending on the inclusion in mainstream education of those who are mentally equipped to benefit but are physically disabled.  This would be a realistic approach to combating discrimination among young people.</P>
    <P>Another of my complaints regards those able-bodied people who use car parking spaces reserved for the disabled.  There should be a heavy on the spot fine for such behaviour.  I have witnessed appallingly rude people taking parking spaces for the disabled in supermarket car parks leaving disabled people stranded.</P>
    <P>One of our third level institutions allows a blind student's guide dog to accompany the student to lectures and classes but if the student is in residence he or she is not allowed to keep the dog on site on the basis that animals are not allowed.  Such matters may appear minor but they are of great importance to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope the improvements the Minister of State has outlined will be included in the budget and will take place.  We may never be able to do enough because the problem is one of attitudes. We think in terms of hand-outs rather than rights, such as equality, perhaps because there has been such a great input into handicapped issues from charities and the families of the handicapped. However, the friends and parents of the handicapped are not a strong lobby.  At election time they quietly and courteously seek commitments, yet pre-election promises rarely become postelection realities.  The era of slightly embarrassed politicians patting somebody on the head and promising to do something for the handicapped is over.  They deserve more than to be patronised or pitied.</P>
    <P>The buoyant economy could easily accommodate the release of funds to deal with the issues I have raised.  We should legislate for equality and have a constitutional amendment to enshrine a right to equality and prohibit discrimination. While we await such an amendment we should introduce disability legislation as recommended by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  We could also fight discrimination by providing a disabled advisory body.  I suggest we examine the possibility of providing a one-stop-shop service in this regard, such as that provided by other agencies.  As 15 to 20 per cent of our population experiences disability in some form there should be a Cabinet post to deal with disability which would be an indication of budgetary commitment to the matter.  As a last resort there should be an ombudsman for the disabled.  Many options are available to us but we must do more than just consider them.  We cannot return to the circumstances which prevailed in the past where <Col N="577" /> the disabled had no votes, no voice and got no response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I work with the physically handicapped and at all the meetings I have attended and among the people I have met, the Minister of State is held in high esteem.  She has been appointed to her post recently but she has a good grasp of the needs of the handicapped.  I am sure she also has an understanding of the issues surrounding those with mental handicap.  She has graced herself and we see her as somebody who can be depended upon to deliver the services we believe are necessary for those with physical disability.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the money she made available yesterday.  The organisation with which I am associated received some of that money and is grateful for the much needed funding.  Apart from the day to day running costs of the departments, such as that in which I work, this was a much needed boost as we approach the end of the financial year.</P>
      <P>Down the centuries there have always been people labelled as having disabilities.  In preChristian Ireland, the 5th century Brehon Laws identified the following categories: idiots, fools, dotards, persons without sense and madmen. These groups were exempt from certain punishments and exploitation and it was the business of the communities in which they lived to look after them and ensure their needs were met.  In England over 1,000 years later Daniel Defoe was the first man to argue for the setting up of &ldquo;fool houses&rdquo;.  He suggested that they be financed through tax charged on the revenue of authors of books.  This was the first vision of publicly provided facilities.  Unfortunately, it was the mid-1800s before this became a reality, and some would argue that it is still not a reality.  However, the Minister is doing her best in this regard.</P>
      <P>In the mid-1800s the development of institutions was promoted, unfortunately more to protect the general public than to assist those with disability.  We are still struggling against this old Victorian style legacy, particularly with the attitudes and perceptions of the public.  The stigmatisation of people with disability is a major problem and we are probably guilty of not sufficiently educating ourselves in this regard.  Folk memories and myths which ask if these people are fully human, if they are a threat to society or if they are a curse on families are still fostered.  These myths still form part of our thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People with disability are probably the most neglected citizens in Ireland and in other countries. On the eve of the 21st century they still suffer intolerable levels of outdated social and economic policy.  We must address this issue and improve public thinking and attitudes.  Change has begun but attitudes are slowly being influenced by international intervention which suggests that disability is a social problem rather than a medical issue.  Many of the changes are piecemeal. <Col N="578" /> Public attitudes to disability are based on charity rather than rights.  The disabled are meeting this attitude at every turn and we have to change it.  The disabled are treated as second class citizens and they are justifiably angry.  There is no forum or committee where disabled people advocating their rights are not encountered.  They are becoming very vocal and this is to be welcomed. We are listening to them, as is the Minister, and they see this as a way forward.</P>
    <P>Disability has major implications for the family and those of us who are fortunate &mdash; if that is the correct word &mdash; not to have a disabled person in our house do not know the emotion and ongoing physical and mental strain that the informal carer, generally the mother, has to endure.  This is accompanied by a desperate feeling of isolation in many instances.  Many of these mothers are meeting early deaths because of the general hardship they endure in minding a disabled child or adult.</P>
    <P>The past three decades have seen a revolution in the services for people with disability, spear-headed by a professional workforce and the diversity of people's needs is recognised and attended to.  However, there has been little change in public attitudes.  The shift of services into the community was not followed or accompanied by an attempt to educate the public. Surveys reveal that people in communities where residences and day centres have been established do not become involved to any significant extent, either in a voluntary or other capacity, in the work of the centres.  Such involvement would be beneficial in educating people about disability.</P>
    <P>I have been responsible for establishing day centres throughout the city.  We try so far as possible to maximise the benefits for the recipients by locating day centres in areas we feel would be of greatest benefit to them and where they will have the greatest level of communication with the public. However, it does not happen like this.  We have even tried in some instances to organise open days where people can be brought in to see what is offered in such centres, what the recipients endure and how well they are looked after. We need to educate the public.</P>
    <P>The most important factor influencing the advocating of human rights and underpinning all the developments which have taken place is the single ordinary life model which shows that people with disability should have access to ordinary services such as health, education, housing, social welfare, employment and leisure.  The United Nations in its world programme of action in favour of disabled persons defined equal opportunity as the process through which the general system of society, such as the physical and cultural environments, housing and transportation, social and health services, educational and work opportunities, culture and social life, including sports and recreational facilities, should be available to all.  We should ensure that they are available to all and that these people are not discriminated against.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> The recommendations made to the Government by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities proved extremely good reading and I know the Minister is fully in tune with the report.  One of the recommendations concerned work and training opportunities.  The commission was crying out for more workshops.  I am associated with a workshop which employ 92 trainees who, by and large, are in sheltered employment. It is impossible to say that any more than a small percentage will ever find their way into the workforce &mdash; this saddens me &mdash; because through the years the level of training given to the disabled did not allow them challenge employers.  Consequently, they ended up in jobs that required skills, such as assembling, bookbinding or printing. Printing is one area where we could encourage employment.  Like similar organisations we have a placement officer who is beating his head against a stone wall trying to educate employers and get their assistance.  I am aware of the 3 per cent principle in the Civil Service, but I was delighted to hear the Minister say she is going to encourage and monitor this level of participation in the workforce.  This is a major step forward and if she implements it she will keep her halo.</P>
    <P>The training offered to the disabled has been basic.  The skills based programmes funded by the European Social Fund which are now coming on stream and financed through the NRB are excellent.  They allow us train adults in computer skills, shop work, including the use of cash registers, etc. Unfortunately, when a placement officer tries to find work for a handicapped person they tend to find lower skilled work, which is a pity.  There are some wonderful handicapped secretaries and I have encountered a few as I am sure have others. Fortunately for them, these secretaries have broken the mould.</P>
    <P>Handicapped people also need to be trained in the every day workings of life such as how to spend their money and get to shops.  We also need to introduce measures to provide easy access to places of employment for handicapped people.  It is ridiculous for a handicapped person to get a job if they cannot gain access to the premises.  The remit of planners or the environmental brick builders needs to be brought to book.  Legislation should be introduced to ensure architects, when planning public places, take into consideration the needs of handicapped people, particularly access.  I cannot bring people from my own establishment to a meeting in City Hall which is one of the most important hallmarks of the city.</P>
    <P>There is a stigma attached to disabled people because they are seen as being ill.  They are not ill but they get ill in the same way as able bodied people.  It is very annoying for disabled people when they become ill because all they want is to be treated in the same manner as anyone else.</P>
    <P>Disabled people are also entitled to education. Unfortunately, most disabled people leave school at 16 years of age.  In the past we tried to get <Col N="580" /> those children into second level education and, thankfully, the situation has improved in the past five years.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that children entering secondary school have to depend on their classroom colleagues to take them to the toilet or help them in other ways.  This is intolerable and a back-up service is required.  I know we cannot cure all these ills immediately and great efforts are being made. The Minister has developed many of them.  If we deal with technology, communications, housing, accommodation, transport and mobility then we will be half way there.</P>
    <P>Sport is one of the most uniting forces for disabled people.  Funding should be given to sports clubs that facilitate the participation of handicapped people.  If clubs receive funding and do not utilise it, then it should be given to another club.</P>
    <P>It would be wonderful if Ireland played host to the Special Olympics.  We have sent our special athletes all over the world and they have returned home laden with gold, silver and bronze medals. They are a credit to the organisations which sponsored them and to this country.  To host the Special Olympics would be a significant boost and major indication to people that we recognise disabled people as part of our community.  We must do all in our power to attract the games here.</P>
    <P>In September the Minister gave a commitment to do certain things and she reaffirmed that commitment today.  I thank the Minister on behalf of handicapped people.  The Minister's commitment to implement the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is a major step forward.  Her decision to review the Supreme Court decision on the Employment Equality Bill as it affects people with disabilities is also a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The disabled payment grant is a real bone of contention for people working in sheltered workshops who receive disabled payment allowances and who also receive a contribution from the organisation to which they are associated.  These people see the Minister's review of the disabled payment grant as greatly enhancing their dignity.</P>
    <P>I hope we have brought it to the Minister's attention that certain things need to be done.  I thank the Minister for her commitment.  As someone who works in this area I look forward to being in contact with her in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Minister's speech with interest.  I do not dispute the Minister's commitment to the disabled.  At various levels we have made considerable progress in our collective psyche in terms of our attitudes to disabled people. Perhaps with the exception of Members of either House who work with disabled people, all of us are on a continuous learning process to discover assumptions and prejudices in ourselves.  I will be careful not to identify people but where I work <Col N="581" /> in Cork Regional Technical College I have twice discovered the degree to which I have underestimated the capacity of people with physical disabilities to undertake courses of study leading to higher qualifications and their capacity to gain employment in the competitive mainstream of the economy.  In either case if my advice had been sought &mdash; and fortunately it was not &mdash; by the parents of the two people in question I would have probably said with my hand on my heart and full of compassion that I would advise them they would not be able to do it.  As it turned out I would have been completely wrong.  It was an education for me to discover the perceptions and presumptions I held and I would not be one of the least informed members of society about issues like this.</P>
      <P>I have learned about some of the most extraordinary prejudices, one of which concerns the difficulty of taking guide dogs into theatres.  They are refused on the grounds that if there was an emergency guide dogs would panic and be a threat to theatregoers.  This is nonsense.  The person with a guide dog is far more likely to escape since the guide dog will find its way to safety with far greater calmness than a hundred distraught humans, even if the theatre is in total darkness. Guide dogs are trained to deal with situations like this.</P>
      <P>I also remember a blind person who liked to go to the cinema, and that came as a considerable shock to me.  I discovered that the blind person's guide dog was not allowed into cinemas.  The reasons for this were fear and prejudice &mdash; fear of possible legal liability and a total misunderstanding of the capacity of people with various disabilities to look after themselves.  In fact what these people need are rights, not charity.  As long as their rights are protected and they have access and the various physical supports necessary, people with disabilities can attend to everything else themselves.</P>
      <P>I read an extraordinary letter from a major urban authority about the dangers of allowing people with disabilities access to theatres in terms of fire regulations and so on.  I then discovered that those in the local authority who were supposed to be responsible did not know who sent the letter.  However, the first the person who was supposed to have signed the letter heard of it was when I mentioned it.  That happened some years ago.  We have all moved on and learned a great deal since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a painful irony that the wife of a former Taoiseach, when attending major events in this House, had grave difficulty gaining access to the Dáil Chamber.  It was the nomination of former Senator Crowley to this House that galvanised the long overdue decision to make Leinster House &mdash; which is not friendly to people with disabilities &mdash; meet minimum standards.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, is to be complimented because I suspect, apart from his admiration for Senator Crowley, he knew that nominating somebody with a disability to this <Col N="582" /> House would produce a succession of consequences, and I am very glad it did.</P>
    <P>As anybody who has visited regional technical colleges knows, if a person sat down and decided to design buildings to make movement difficult for people in wheelchairs, he would have designed a regional technical college, with steps everywhere, unnecessary in many cases, and minimal space for lifts.  There are so many steps that even with a lift the room for manoeuvre for a person in a wheelchair is minimal.  Any student in a wheelchair who attended any of the regional technical colleges and has managed to complete a course has done so because of the good nature and kindness of classmates who spend considerable time lifting their wheelchairs up and down stairs.</P>
    <P>We are only beginning to recognise rights.  Perhaps the single biggest offence given to people with disabilities in recent years were the decisions of the Supreme Court.  They are among the most extraordinary decisions made and, most assuredly, were not the sections of Bills that motivated our former President to refer them to the Supreme Court, they were not the reasons anybody expected a constitutional problem.  The language used by the Supreme Court and the assumption that underlay the judgment suggested that whoever else in society who may have learned to move from the language of charity to the language of rights for people with disabilities, those to whom we have given the fairly awesome power of interpreting the Constitution, have a long way to go.  I found those two decisions profoundly regrettable and offensive to the standards of decency and what we understand to be social solidarity.  It was an extraordinary reactionary decision by the Supreme Court; it was extraordinarily limited and offensive and one that, as free citizens, we are entitled to criticise and make our views known.</P>
    <P>I regret that in the short term we are stuck with this and that we will have to find a way around it.  Nevertheless it does not change the fact that whatever was wrong with the two Bills in terms of understanding and perceptions of various rights, what everybody was agreed upon was the rights of people with disabilities, one of the very worthwhile things which I suspect &mdash; I was not a Member of this House when the legislation was passed &mdash; was not in the least contentious in terms of the way their lordships found it to be later.  That is profoundly regrettable.</P>
    <P>There are other areas which may be more contentious. I do not understand why we are still talking about the constraints of public expenditure and the need for prudence in public expenditure when it comes to certain categories, such as people with disabilities.  I am making a distinction between capital investment and expenditure on additional staffing because one is an eternal commitment and if we argue about increasing expenditure on staffing then we are inviting a Government to make a commitment for the indefinite future.  Surely it is possible now to provide the <Col N="583" /> capital to make sure every public building in the State is accessible; it would be a once off expenditure in many cases.  There is the idea that a frenzy of tax concessions would give money to people on large incomes while leaving people with disabilities waiting for a better time, but this will not happen because there will never be an economically better time than the present.  Society is involved now, and will be in the next couple of years, in profound choices about what to do with the fruits of economic growth.  We have two choices: either we spend it on ourselves, those of us who are at work and with largish incomes, or we may decide not to spend it all on ourselves and provide for all the things which are so obviously necessary.  It all comes down to ideology.</P>
    <P>The only reason we will not do it is an ideological belief that public expenditure is a bad thing which must, under all circumstances, be controlled and reduced.  This is a very widely held view, both by the people here and by the present Minister for Finance.  The Minister of State should dissuade the Minister for Finance from an excess of ideology and remind him that resources are and could be released to do all the things which need to be done to provide at least the physical facilities to end the scandal of mentally handicapped people being detained in psychiatric institutions which are old, decrepit and unsuitable, to end the scandal of people not being able to get access to public buildings, trains, taxis, buses, etc.  We must not let an ideological commitment to reduce public expenditure deter us. We are capable of transforming the lives of people with disabilities.  For once in our history we have the resources to do this but what we need is a willingness to make that choice.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's commitment, I have read about the Government's commitment but I await the tangible evidence which cannot be in words, writing or in legislation only, it must be manifested in resources.  The real issue is do we provide resources that can make a big difference or are we, having educated ourselves, having learned to speak the language which addresses people with disabilities as our equals and having learned to move away from our often unconscious prejudices, now prepared to take the next step which is to spend money to ensure their lives are as fulfilling as our own.  If we do not do that, all the rhetoric is meaningless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  In the Lower House I witnessed first hand her sincere commitment to disability equality.  With the Minister of State providing impetus to the Government's commitment to people with disability, I am sure all aspects of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disability will be implemented before the end of the current Administration's term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> I am glad that one of the first debates to take place in the lifetime of this Seanad involves disability equality and the Government's commitment to it.  Disability equality is an essential cornerstone of the joint programme for Government and we must be committed to it.  As a member of the Progressive Democrats, I commit myself to ensuring that disability equality comes about. There is an unfortunate tendency within the political system to depict certain people as being more caring than others.  That is insulting because no party or individual has a monopoly on social concern.</P>
    <P>The debate on the employment equality and equal status legislation in the Lower House showed a commitment on all sides to trying to get it right.  I was extremely disappointed when both Bills were struck down because of the major work carried out by the then Minister who listened to people's concerns and putting strategies in place. I welcome the Minister of State's indication that both Bills will be revisited.  It is essential that this be done and I am encouraged by her announcement that a disabilities Bill will be introduced.  I advocated such legislation for a number of years in the Lower House.  While it is necessary to revisit the employment equality and equal status legislation, it is essential that a disabilities Bill be brought forward.</P>
    <P>One bone of contention in respect of the employment equality and equal status legislation involves the definition of the word &ldquo;disability&rdquo;. Many people working in the area believe this relies heavily on medical terminology and should be re-examined.  A number of the groups that communicated with me in connection with the definition were disenchanted by the response they received, even though they understood the reasons for it.  I am sure it can be reinterpreted without undue difficulty.  This issue is marked by the degree of support and co-operation available to the Minister of State from all sides of the House and I am sure that will continue with the introduction of the disabilities Bill.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities underpins the Government's actions in this area.  As the Minister of State indicated, the commission's findings will eventually come to fruition and be prioritised.  It is important that we continue to ensure that people with disabilities participate in the process. We have moved away from having a paternalistic attitude to these people and I would not like to see that reversed.  It is indicative of attitudes in society that we have been obliged to introduce legislation to protect the rights of people with disability. However, evidence that our society is maturing is marked by the broad acceptance that such people have rights and they should not be regarded in a charitable way.</P>
    <P>There must be real integration of people with disability in society.  We must ensure that these people can reach the absolute limits of their capabilities. They should have an inalienable right to achieve this and should not be obliged to struggle. <Col N="585" /> Everyone must give a commitment to people with disability in that regard.  That is not a paternalistic attitude because these people should not be forced to make apologies or fight for their rights.  It has been appalling to see various groups protesting outside the gates of Leinster House on many occasions because they had to fight for such rights.  I hope that this will be unnecessary in the future and that the listening process to which the Minister of State referred will ensure not only that people with disability are listened to but also that their views are taken on board.</P>
    <P>We can reinforce our commitment to people with disability during this debate.  However, as other Members stated, we must ensure that action replaces rhetoric.  The Minister referred to a plan of action involving the interdepartmental task force which would lead to the establishment of a monitoring committee.  This is essential because, as in the case of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, procedures were slow until a monitoring process was put in place.  Things do not happen until someone takes responsibility to drive an issue forward.  However, with the commitment of the Minister of State, politicians on all sides in both Houses and the monitoring committee to ensure action, those things will happen.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the practical allocation of moneys towards various groups.  It is excellent that the Irish Council for People with Disability will receive a support grant of £300,000 because people with disability must be involved in progressing this issue.  Unless the council is given adequate funding, it will have to operate on a wing and a prayer and will not do a proper job. Voluntary agencies have led the way for many years and it is essential that they be provided with adequate funding because they know how to achieve things at a relatively low cost.  They need our support so that facilities, which should be in place as of right, are provided as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the 3 per cent quota for employment in the public service.  I raised this issue on many occasions in the Lower House and I wish to discover the position in respect of employing people with disabilities in the Civil Service and wider public service because obstacles are continually placed in their way.  Other Members referred to the issue of access.  If all Government buildings and offices were examined, how accessible would they be for people with disabilities?  The public service must be carefully examined because I do not believe there is a great willingness to employ people with disabilities in the service.  In that context, one of the arguments put to me involved the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo;.  Within the public service and employment in general people wanted a widening of the description of disability so that people with a relatively mild disability would be included in the quota.  We could not agree with that.</P>
    <P>As regards the private sector, in some EU countries a quota system is operated and a fine is imposed if people do not fulfil it.  Unfortunately, <Col N="586" /> in many businesses and industries the quota is not filled and the fine is paid.  Under that system, at least funding goes directly towards educating and training people with disability.  It also helps to encourage awareness which is something we are poor at doing.  With some honourable exceptions, there is little inclination or desire to employ disabled people in private industry.  That brings us back to the issue of integration in schools whereby children with disabilities can be supported in entering mainstream education so that there is an acceptance of the disabled within society.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of how people with disability have been discriminated against.  There is a pub in my constituency near a Cheshire Home which cares for quite a number of people with disabilities ranging from mild to severe.  Many of them are wheelchair bound and some like to go to the local pub for a pint on a Thursday or Friday evening.  They were discriminated against in that it was alleged that their wheelchairs constituted a fire hazard.  The real reason, however, as everybody knew, was that the pub's owners did not like the idea of people with a disability sipping their pints through a straw.  They felt this would upset the customers.  That is something we must eradicate from the mind set of society.</P>
    <P>That type of unspoken discrimination is there and it represents a frame of mind.  People would never say so publicly, although it was going through their minds and they might say it between themselves.  We all know this is true.  Just because somebody looks slightly different and they are not one of the crowd they are excluded from something as ordinary as going out for a drink at night.  Nobody could or should agree with such discrimination which should be eradicated from society.  That is why I so regret that neither the Employment Equality Act nor the Equal Status Act are on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I hope a disabilities Bill will have the effect of dealing with that type of attitude.  I welcome the cross-departmental work involved.  From time to time there may be a Minister who, with the best will in the world, will try to implement equality legislation and attitudes, but unless there is support for that Minister in Government his will be just a voice crying in the wilderness.  While that has happened, we can avoid it by having cross-departmental linking on a regular basis.  The improvement of facilities for people with disability should have support from the top and the signal should come from every Department.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has been involved in the announcement of cash investments for people with disability.  Unless as a society we ensure equality for people with disability and ensure that the type of boom we are experiencing also benefits those who are not so well able to cater for themselves, ours will be a poor society.  My party pledges itself to ensure that the commitment the Government has given will be acted upon.  I have <Col N="587" /> no doubt that with the support of the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, this will happen.</P>

In the ten minutes we have as second line speakers we cannot do justice to the enormous range of problems in the area of disability.  If we are honest we will recognise the lack of sufficient commitment that successive Governments can have laid at their door in this area.  I want to discuss the independent living movement and the Centre for Independent Living.  By getting this one right we will solve many other problems, even though we will never solve them all and will always be running hard to keep up and invest sufficiently to look after people who, through no fault of their own in many cases, find they are not as able bodied as some of the rest of us are lucky enough to be.</P>
      <P>I feel passionately about this and have spoken about it many times in the Lower House.  I have been on many deputations seeking the provision of personal assistants for wheelchair bound people with physical and sensory disability.  The pre-budget submission from the Centre for Independent Living pleads for the establishment of an independent living fund.</P>
      <P>In case Senators are not familiar with the concept the independent living movement espouses and what the Centre for Independent Living's 18 branches have been doing, I will put a few words about it on the record.  The Centre for Independent Living was established in 1992 and is funded, operated and controlled by people with disabilities.  Of its 18 branches, I am familiar with what happens in Dublin and in my own county of Wexford.  I do not pretend to be familiar with what occurs in other counties, but I understand the same excellent model operates everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIL is involved in a number of activities for people with disabilities encompassing housing, access and mobility, legislation, image perception, terminology of disability and international relations.  It is particularly involved in promoting independent living through the use of personal assistants.  The investment by the Government in providing personal assistants for wheelchair bound people can only be a winner.  It is a win <Col N="588" /> for those in wheelchairs in that it allows them to move from parental or institutional care to independent living.  For some hours a day, hopefully eight hours, someone can undertake tasks that they are unable to perform for themselves.  Many people who are wheelchair bound can do an awful lot if mobility is restored to them.</P>
    <P>Apart from the extra help the assistant gives them we can all understand what it is to become independent.  Most of us are not so old that we cannot remember the transition through our teenage years to full independence as adults.  We do not have a quality of life or determination over our lives until we are independent and need no longer defer to our parents or to whoever controls where and when we go out, what time we return, what and when we eat, what we wear, when we get up and go to bed, whether we go out and whether we have one or three pints.  We take these issues for granted and do not have to defer to parents or to an institution about every little decision.  Independent living is a huge win for those confined to wheelchairs.  The people involved in CIL have described the concept eloquently and passionately for several years and no Government has responded sufficiently.</P>
    <P>In 1994 an advisory group was set up to investigate the concept of personal assistants.  That spanned the period in which three Governments were in office.  However, we are still talking about the concept and about a submission to the Minister for Finance in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>Independent living is a win for people in wheelchairs. It gives them determination over their lives.  It is also a win economically, particularly if assistants are drawn from the local unemployed, are trained and can make an economic contribution by being gainfully employed in a worthwhile job.  There are no losers in pursuing the course proposed by CIL in relation to the provision of personal assistants.</P>
    <P>There have been pilot schemes in independent living and there are FÁS community employment schemes which provide personal assistants. However, it is a shaky situation.  There is no permanent provision of personal assistants and this causes concern.  The central monitoring group in FÁS will examine this issue in the context of community employment schemes in the next week or two with regard to next year's scheme.  The current schemes finish at the end of this calendar year.  Community employment schemes provide personal assistants for a limited number of people in each county at present.  There are 13 such assistants in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>Personal assistants were introduced in this country through the in-care programme funded by HORIZON through EU funding.  The scheme was a great success.  The independence it brought to many people with disabilities was such that they were able to leave rural areas to attend college or take up employment in Dublin and other cities.  They could come and go and order their lives.  Now the scheme is sponsored by the Irish Wheelchair Association through the FÁS community <Col N="589" /> employment scheme.  The ideal would be an independent living fund.  That is being sought from the Minister for Finance at present.  It could be introduced over a period of three or even five years.</P>
    <P>About £5 million per year would provide personal assistants for those who are in a position to make good use of them.  The figures have been submitted to the Minister.  In the context of the national budget and Exchequer returns, it is but a drop in the ocean.  From that figure could be deducted the return to the Exchequer in terms of PAYE and PRSI and the unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit payments which many personal assistants would have received before becoming assistants.  There is a huge benefit, first, to the person with the disability and, second, to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We could discuss forever what could be done to improve the quality of life for those who are so seriously disabled that a personal assistant would never even be an option.  However, there are many people with physical and sensory disabilities who are wheelchair bound and who can make a tremendous contribution to their local communities and to the economy.  They cannot do that unless they are given a personal assistant who will bring quality, independence and choice to their lives.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that many ageing parents who have valiantly cared for a disabled child are getting too old to be able to provide the same service in terms of fetching and carrying and catering for all the disabled person's physical needs.  A personal assistant who can relieve some of the burden from ageing parents or other family members increases the quality of life for all members of the family.  There is no negative aspect to establishing an independent living fund to provide personal assistants for those who can use them.  The numbers are determined and the research has been carried out.  There are a number of reports from advisory groups and there is international experience of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The independent living movement was started in the US many years ago and was introduced in Ireland in 1992.  We have been talking about the scheme for five years and there have been pilot programmes under the auspices of HORIZON, FÁS and the Eastern Health Board, which funded a number of personal assistants.  However, the scheme must be put on a permanent footing rather than having to depend on a budgetary response from year to year.  FÁS community employment schemes have worked but they are the second best option.  The Centre for Independent Living should no longer be dependent on the employment schemes because, although they are a good stopgap measure, there are disadvantages. The disadvantages are those from which many employment schemes suffer, namely, that people must be of a certain age, must be unemployed for a certain length of time and can only be employed for a year on the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> It takes most of the year to train personal assistants to the point where they are 100 per cent effective for their customer.  Sometimes such assistants might get a second year in the scheme but in most cases they are gone after a year.  That is wasteful.  The scheme must be removed from the community employment scheme because of the restrictive criteria.  The independent living fund must be established with a stand alone scheme of personal assistants for those with physical and sensory disabilities.  Everybody will be a winner but most of all the customers as they will be able to take control of their lives.  The economy will be a winner and the quality of life for all concerned, including the families of the disabled, will be enormously enhanced.</P>
    <P>I urge aggressive support for this concept on the part of all parties.  Five million pounds is but a drop in the ocean because of the current vibrancy in our economy.  The Minister of State should urge the Minister for Finance to look extremely favourably at and to deliver on this reasonable concept.</P>

      <P>This has been an interesting debate.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, on the amount of time and work she has given to this subject in the past two years.  She has sought to achieve progress through dialogue, by establishing commissions and by dealing with the implementation of a detailed programme to alleviate hardship and attain equality for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The area with which I am most familiar is education and that is where I have most experience of working with people with disabilities.  I wish to refer in particular to children who are moving from primary to second level education who discover they have a mental disability, such as a reading problem.  They might have the reading ability of a six or seven year old yet they must try to fit into an education programme which is designed for students who have the reading ability of 12 year olds.  There is a vacuum in that area.</P>
      <P>The debate about special schools as opposed to integrated education has been ongoing for some time.  I have attended many conferences and discussion groups and the consensus of parents every time is that there should be an integrated programme if at all possible.  We should try to develop the full potential of those with disabilities in terms of their mental capacity, socialisation and physical and cultural development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems in this area at the moment. Many students cannot be contained in a normal classroom because of their inability to deal with a normal educational routine, yet there are insufficient resources for one to one tuition, psychological services and remedial education to give <Col N="591" /> them the opportunity to develop and become independent.  We are lacking in this area.  The Minister has acknowledged this and the consensus is that money must be made available for more educational, psychological and remedial programmes to facilitate the transition from primary to secondary schooling.</P>
    <P>We must also address the issue of facilitating very bright, wheelchair bound students who wish to attend normal schools.  They often find they are unable to move from room to room because of the layout of the school and the inaccessibility of the classrooms.  They immediately feel stigmatised because of this and do not feel part of the group, although they are very bright students capable of tackling any choice of subjects and making a career for themselves.</P>
    <P>Parents are similarly stigmatised because they are unable to cope at home due to a lack of facilities for children who are either of a low mental or reading age or are wheelchair bound.  There are no carers or home-school links available to them.  We should be conscious of our responsibilities in this area and have closer ties between schools and communities, especially in terms of promoting equality for the disabled.  It would go a long way towards helping them participate normally in society.  There is no one here who does not have some form of disability so no one should feel smug.  There should be a local commitment to integrate disabled people and, if that is pursued nationally, this will be a fine country for caring for and promoting the equality of disabled people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report, its purpose and structure.  It is a comprehensive document and shows a firm commitment by the Minister and the Government to address this national anomaly.  The report shows the State is finally accepting its responsibility for the disabled.  For a long time, many voluntary groups accepted that responsibility and played a major part in improving the life and well-being of disabled people. This document sets out in no uncertain terms the State's commitment to addressing the situation by legislation and by establishing an interdepartmental watchdog to ensure disabled people are treated equally.  I welcome the overhauling of the State's allowances and grants for disabled people and the reduction in the number of State agencies with which people have to deal.  I also welcome the consideration of a tax incentive or tax reduction for carers of disabled people.  The 3 per cent quota of disabled people employed in the public service is necessary and something which the State must address if it is to be positive and sincere about this issue.  The disability legislation is also important as it sets out the status of disabled people within society, in that they should be treated equally and be told what are their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my dealings with disabled people in my constituency, there are certain issues which affect <Col N="592" /> their well-being and care.  People with cerebral palsy who are wheelchair bound need recreation areas and facilities for movement.  County councils should be able to pay the disabled person's grant to people who need those facilities.  The red tape should be dispensed with so that those people can avail of the opportunity of assistance in their difficult situations.  The Government should also insist by means of the planning process that county councils make public buildings accessible to disabled people.  We have come a long way in our treatment of people with disabilities. I remember some of my colleagues in school who were disabled and I pay tribute to their parents who experienced great difficulties in providing a reasonable quality of life for them. This should not go unnoticed as it took considerable physical and mental effort for families to care for such people.</P>
    <P>I support the view expressed on independent living.  The Government should address the issue of personal assistants if it is serious about improving the quality of life for disabled people.  I have met people who have been allocated those assistants under FÁS schemes and it has opened up a new quality of life for them.  It has made a huge contribution to their lives and created new interests for them.  The Government should address this issue as a modern way of dealing with personal situations.</P>
    <P>I recently spoke to a man who told me that both he and his wife have done an enormous amount of work with their child who suffers from cerebral palsy and who attends the local national school. One can see the effort made by these people.  The child has great difficulty with fundamentals such as taking books out of a school bag.  Such children are able to function and learn and the Government should look at the proposals before the health boards and Ministers on the concept of independent living.  It is an innovative idea.  In the past we looked after our pensioners and we should do so in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This debate is on &ldquo;Disability Equality &mdash; the Government's Commitment&rdquo;.  If it took place under the previous Government we would have a Minister who would have access to Cabinet presenting the debate.  The Labour Government underpinned its commitment to dealing with the problem of disability by appointing a Minister for Equality and Law Reform. Unfortunately, this Government has not met that commitment.  Deputy Wallace has responsibility for this area but she is a Minister of State without access to the Cabinet table where decisions are made and where funding can be squeezed from the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of disability has received shoestring funding and much of the work has been done by voluntary organisations.  The Government's first commitment to dealing with disability equality should have been to retain a full Minister.  It is <Col N="593" /> regrettable that this has not happened.  The European day of disabled persons is on 3 December, which is also budget day.  The real test of the Government's commitment to disability and equal opportunity will be the provision it makes in the budget to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to examine the present shortfalls in areas such as training, education and residential care facilities for the disabled.  There is an urgent need for 2,500 places for the mentally handicapped.  This does not include the large number of people inappropriately housed in psychiatric hospitals.  No one who has been to St. Ita's in Portrane could claim that it is suitable or appropriate accommodation.  Much good work was done in St. Brendan's, Grangegorman. However, this included institutional accommodation and community service was provided without the provision of the necessary community infrastructure.  There is much to be done before we will have made adequate provision for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is committed to the full implementation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  That commission was established by former Deputy Mervyn Taylor who began the work of assuring an appropriate and agreed set of priorities.  The Minister of State has announced that she is setting up a task force, a monitoring group to advise that task force and further subgroups.  I hope the implementation of the report will not be put on the long finger as a result.  The more committees, monitoring groups, subgroups and task forces involved the less that will be done in reality.  The Irish Council of People with Disabilities should be fully involved as equal partners with Government in the implementation process.</P>
    <P>We are also committed to the implementation of the report &ldquo;Towards An Independent Future&rdquo;. In particular, we believe in the concept of independent living which must be fully developed. Over the past few years we have seen a number of protests outside this House by disabled people who wished to have the means of independent living.  The review group recommends the spending of £50 million over five years and I would like to hear the Minister of State's response as to how she will implement that recommendation, whether the Government has given such a commitment and what are the stages of implementation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party shares the ultimate objective of these reports which is the provision of a high quality and fully accessible range of services from the onset of a disability.  Such services must be available on the basis of need and must facilitate the maximum degree of independence and personal autonomy.  They must be shaped and geared towards the specific needs of people with disabilities and be available as of right.  Disabled persons should not be dependent on charity.  In short, as we have argued in the past, they should be the subject of a social guarantee.  That guarantee would seek to ensure that from the moment <Col N="594" /> of birth, diagnosis or the onset of disability the following services would be guaranteed as of right: diagnosis and assessment; counselling, including for carers where necessary; a full range of medical services as required; education and training based on the right of the individual to aspire to his or her full potential and to live and work in mainstream society; open, supported or sheltered employment in an appropriate and decent environment within reasonable access of home &mdash; Partnership 2000 introduced a 3 per cent quota in the public service and I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on the implementation of that quota during the lifetime of this agreement and what steps are being taken to ensure it is fully implemented by the year 2000; six day residential care when needed; the guarantee of a home life in proper and supportive surroundings; respite care when required and accessible public transport.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Dublin Corporation is making its small contribution with the issuing of the latest tranche of 200 taxi plates, all of which must be wheelchair accessible.  However, I am unhappy that there is no specific provision for sheltered housing by Dublin Corporation where there are a large number of people anxious to be engaged in independent living.  Such an approach would be of great benefit and allow these people a better level of independence.  The corporation has no policy on people with disabilities applying for housing other than broad medical circumstances which apply across the board.  I am not sure if there is such an approach in any local authority. No local authority has addressed this issue adequately.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of millions of pounds are already invested in the provision of services for people with disabilities.  In too many cases these funds are not well enough directed and too often reflect the needs of the agencies rather than the needs of people with disabilities.  Many people with disabilities are deemed ineligible for training not because they will not benefit from the training but because their inclusion might jeopardise the attraction of matching money from European funds.  The development of one-stop-shops is envisaged as part of the disability support service proposed by the commission.  This would go some way towards closing the information gaps that are often a barrier to the supply of services.  A proper social guarantee would also require some restructuring of services, greater co-operation between agencies and a strong political commitment. Implementing the social guarantee for people with disabilities means starting from the perspective of the rights and needs of the person and adapting the service to meet those needs.  The Irish Council for People with Disabilities, launched by President Robinson in March of this year, should play a major role in advising the Government on the implementation of the report.</P>
    <P>The Government made a bad start by abolishing the Department of Equality and Law <Col N="595" /> Reform.  It is a shame that the Minister of State is not at the Cabinet table to argue her case.  That is where real funding can be secured.  Only in the last short period of Government has there been any attempt to provide substantial funding for this area.  Responsibility for law reform was removed from the Department of Justice because this area was not getting a fair crack of the whip It seems clear now that Minister O'Donoghue sees his role as a traditional Minister for Justice. Anything else is of less importance.  It has been suggested that the Department of Equality and Law Reform has fulfilled its agenda but problems thrown up this week regarding procedures in the courts, particularly the District Courts where horrendous problems are looming, suggest that there is a considerable amount of work to be done both in the criminal and civil courts as well as the areas we are talking about.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed itself to an urgent review of the Employment Equality Bill, which I welcome, but five months into its term this Bill has not been published.  I would like to know when it is likely to be published.  The Minister has indicated her intention to ensure that the Equality Bill will be passed into law next year. We hope that this will happen.  What work has been done on the promised disabilities Bill and when it is likely to be published?  Many of the Government's commitments in respect of the income of people with disabilities and of those who care for them are outlined in the Government programme.  We will have to wait until budget day before we can judge them.  I am concerned about the proposal to allocate tax allowances to carers of people with disabilities.  Will these allowances be at the standard tax rate and will we see further discrimination against those carers who are struggling on low incomes?</P>
    <P>In the course of the presidential election I again noticed that we still have many polling booths which have steps.  It should be possible to find suitable public buildings.  While there is postal voting we should, nevertheless, facilitate all sections of the community in exercising their franchise.  I welcome the Minister of State's reference to sport and leisure and the need to provide funding for the Special Olympics.  I understand that we have made an application to hold the Special Olympics in Ireland.  This area requires substantial funding and I hope the Minister of State proceeds with her proposals in this respect. The Government has made a bad start and we are waiting anxiously to see if it redeems itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">

      <P>When we consider the complex problems of disability we need to keep one sobering thought in mind &mdash; it can happen to any of us. Many who now regard people with disabilities as a class apart may, one day, join their ranks. Others may become parents of children with disabilities or, in some other capacity, may have to take on the responsibility of caring for somebody with a physical, sensory or intellectual disability. <Col N="596" /> No day passes without this possibility becoming a stark reality.  Parents suffer the emotions of shock, fear, dismay, anger and resentment when their child is born with a sensory or intellectual handicap.  It is important that parents, at this very early stage know their entitlements and their children's rights and entitlements.</P>
      <P>I listened with some amusement to Senator Costello's suggestion that we should have a Minister of State for disability affairs.  I will read into the record something that was written to me by somebody who is intellectually disabled: &ldquo;The idea of a Minister of State for Disability Affairs would be something that, although it looks logical, would offend many disabled people, me included.  People with disabilities do not want special treatment.  They want fair treatment with some common sense and an understanding of their needs&rdquo;.  In a recent column in <i>The Irish Times</i> my friend Máire Geoghegan-Quinn wrote that many of us will inevitably become disabled as we move through life and that this should make us scared because of the way that many people of disability are deprived of equality and inclusiveness in our society.  In that same column she urged Deputy Wallace, the Minister of State dealing with disability to go boldly where no-one has gone before.  It is heartening that, after only a very short time in her new ministry, Minister of State, Wallace has shown tangible evidence that this is what she intends to do.  This is good news for those with disabilities.  The Government's programme on disability, which the Minister of State will be steering towards full implementation, holds the promise of radical changes to address the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities along with their families and carers.  It is my hope that it will give vibrant reassurance to the many people working on their behalf.  I have in mind such people as Frank Mulcahy who is chairing the Irish Council for People with Disabilities who, a few months ago, made despairing utterances that disabled people are totally alienated from the political system.  Such an attitude is understandable when one considers the dereliction of responsibility towards people with disabilities that has been so shamefully evident in the past.  I am confident that the Government's detailed and comprehensive programme will go a very long way towards redressing this sad situation and open up a new optimistic scenario for people who have been treated so insensitively and unthinkingly for so long.  At the time Mr. Mulcahy made his complaint he was expressing dismay at the Supreme Court decision to declare the Employment Equality Bill unconstitutional. As we are all aware, the court ruled last May that clauses in the Bill outlawing discrimination against the disabled would interfere with the property rights of employers.  It is little wonder that Mr. Mulcahy was dismayed; as he saw it, the ruling gave employers the opportunity to openly discriminate against people with disabilities without the people directly affected having any recourse to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> One of the measures proposed by Mr. Mulcahy was that a clause banning discrimination against people with disabilities should be inserted in the Constitution.  This, of course, would require a constitutional amendment which, as we know from past experience can throw up all sorts of unexpected difficulties and anomalies.  Mr. Mulcahy is not alone in his thinking and, even before he expressed it, his idea had been given solidity by the constitutional review group.</P>
    <P>Senators may recall that last year the review group proposed an anti-discrimination clause with the suggested wording that no person shall be unfairly discriminated against directly or indirectly on any grounds such as sex, age, disability and so on.  The concept has already been given serious consideration.  Whether by constitutional amendment or legislation, the problem must be tackled and I am glad the Government is mindful of its importance.</P>
    <P>One of the key priorities in the Government's programme is an urgent review of the Supreme Court decisions on the Employment Equality and Equal Status Bills as they affect people with disabilities. This particular legal aspect highlights the fact that disability is a social issue, not a medical one.  As Mr. Mulcahy pointed out, the Supreme Court, through its ruling, has laid the blame on people with disabilities and has ignored the huge barriers which are placed in their way on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>There is one central, resonant idea at the core of all disability issues, namely, equality.  That is the ultimate aspiration of people with disabilities. Equality is a simple enough idea but it rings right through history as the driving force in revolution for the betterment of humanity.  It is memorably enshrined in the words of Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of American Independence when he said that all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  We must ensure that people with disabilities are not deprived of their right to pursue happiness in the same way as other people.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the problem of access to polling booths during the presidential election.  I agree with him on that issue; in Galway West some polling booths were inaccessible to people with disabilities.  The Minister of State was responsible for bringing into effect a Bill which gave everybody the right of access to polling booths.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities explores the many ways in which equality can be understood.  They range from formal legal equality to equality of opportunities and status at all levels of life in Ireland. While formal, legal equality is a precondition to everything, the commission declares that there must also be equality of opportunity so that people with disabilities can participate in education, employment and all other walks of life on an equal basis.  However, such an ideal would not <Col N="598" /> ensure equality of status.  The commission believes that in order to ensure people with disabilities have equal status and are widely represented at all levels of Irish life, affirmative action of the most dedicated kind is needed.  Such action must come primarily from the Government but also from other sectors of Irish life including local authorities, churches, public bodies, employers, trade unions and other organisations.</P>
    <P>The Government's new programme on disability is committed to a positive kind of action which has not been taken at official level hereto-fore and which has the potential to transform the lives of people with disabilities and those who look after them.  The outlook is very encouraging. The Government will doubtless take cognisance of the positive action or positive discrimination which the commission has in mind.  Such action could include training policies to develop senior management skills among employees with disabilities or university access programmes for students with disabilities which would enable them to participate on level terms in the university system.</P>
    <P>The commission has also drawn attention to the principle of maximising participation for people with disabilities.  This means that people with disabilities should have the right to participate in all areas of Irish life to the fullest possible extent and that, individually and collectively, they should be in a position to influence decisions which affect their lives.  This should also apply to their families and their friends.</P>
    <P>Independence and choice are other concepts highlighted by the commission which have always been dear to my heart.  This means that people with disabilities should have the right to be able to achieve their full potential.  They should have the right to make their own decisions and choices regarding the conditions of life which are best suited to their circumstances.  They should also have the right to quality services which meet their needs at all stages of life.  They must not be dependent on charity or voluntary effort.  Like all of us, they must be allowed to shape and pursue their own destiny.  They must be allowed to reach their own goals in life and to pursue happiness in their own way.</P>
    <P>Forty autistic people live on a farm in Enfield, County Kildare.  They grow organic vegetables and make and sell pottery.  This experiment has now become a way of life for these people and has been copied in Claregalway, County Galway. It is an example of how pursuing their own destiny and reaching their own goals has made life tremendously different for people with that particular type of disability.</P>

      <P>I propose to share time with Senator O'Toole.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I know she has a great commitment to this area as I have seen her put a great deal of work into it in her former capacity as chairperson of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> I am glad so many Senators are enthusiastic about people with disabilities becoming involved in every aspect of life.  Some Senators pointed out the difficulties experienced in relation to access to polling stations, something which prevents people having political equality.  Some people who applied for postal votes under the provisions of the Electoral Act 1992 experienced difficulties.  A neighbour and friend of mine who has multiple sclerosis applied for a postal vote well in advance of the end of September but received no reply. I have written to the Minister about the matter although I was too late to achieve anything in time for the presidential election.  It is extremely important that we should enforce the legislation we have and make it work.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the point was made that any of us could become disabled at any time.  It is important to remember that.  I would particularly like to address the issue of people who suffer head injuries.  We are experiencing terrible problems with traffic accidents on our roads.  Head injuries occur particularly in the 20 to 40 year old male age group.  In spite of their head injuries, some people may have very few other physical disabilities and are quite likely to have the same life span as they would have had prior to the injury.  However, they will experience behavioural, psychological, sociological and emotional problems.  Many of them, who would have been in gainful employment and now find themselves house bound and unable to return to their previous employment, have a very serious problem.  About 850 cases are recorded each year.</P>
    <P>We sometimes do not address these areas of hidden disability as much as we could.  People with serious psychiatric illness may have grave difficulties reintegrating into the workforce.  We should make sure that we address our efforts towards them too.  In such cases, marriage breakdown is very common.  For example, if the male partner is seriously injured, Canadian figures show the marriage breakdown rate is 90 per cent as against 50 per cent if it is the female partner who is injured.  This shows the serious social, behavioural and psychological consequences of accidents which may also develop and not just those related to employment and the physical aspects of dealing with life.</P>
    <P>There is little community support for people like this and the burden falls on the family and the women in the family in particular because generally it is the women who are the carers in any family.  This is not to denigrate fathers, brothers and sons who help in the care of disabled people but to highlight the fact that women are more frequently expected to give up their jobs and stay at home.  They are often left with little support trying to deal with unemployed, socially isolated people.  A similar situation exists with those who have suffered spinal injuries.  Perhaps it is because they are so much more obvious that we try to make a great effort in this area.  The lack of support can be so serious for the carers <Col N="600" /> that they have been known to be reduced to suicide or serious illness.  It is important that we remember those whose disabilities are not as obvious.  We should try to help those who are caring for them and introduce respite care where possible.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator Cox on pointing out that one could become the parents of a disabled child. This is a source of great shock and dismay for families because they realise what they must cope with.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important that we research the prevention of disabilities.  I was rather disappointed in the council's report &ldquo;A Strategy for Equality&rdquo; in that only page 281 was devoted to research.  When one considers the number of disabilities which can be prevented, it is a great pity that we do not address this in greater depth. Indeed, Senators may remember that on the Adjournment the other night I addressed the high instance of neural tube defects in children here leading to spina bifida and anencaphaly.  Because it is a genetic problem, it can be overcome to a large extent by a high intake of folic acid and folates and we should consider the possibility of putting folates into bread.  Minister Moffat said that it could be considered but there seems to be great difficulties in the way of doing something as important as this.  Hundreds of cases occur every year causing tremendous distress to families.  We need to address matters with greater urgency.</P>
    <P>The US authorities are introducing folates in bread at the beginning of 1998.  Why can Ireland not lead the way in the EU?  We know of the high instance of it here so why not lead the way and urge the rest of the member states to follow?</P>
    <P>It is also important that we should address acquired disabilities.  We should look at our accident rates, be they in the workplace, on the farms or on the roads.  Every day there are people who get up and go about their business in the morning with no disability but who may have the most shocking disabilities that night.  It would be well worth our while putting greater effort into the prevention of disability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing time with me.  In welcoming the Minister, who is my neighbour and was a colleague in this House at one stage, I wish her well in her appointment.  Her portfolio is so broad as to be almost impossible to cope with.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred earlier to the Employment Equality Bill along with the Equal Status Bill.  I welcome the commitment to reintroduce that legislation with one small caveat &mdash; the section which refers to teachers' private lives should be excised.  It is not necessary and it is creating much hurt and worry to people.  I am fully committed to that legislation for the reasons outlined by others but I ask the Minister to have a look at that matter to avoid negative reaction to the presentation of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed earlier that some visitors with mobility problems had difficulty getting into the <Col N="601" /> Visitors' Gallery.  It has long been the position of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that visitors with mobility problems may use the lift and sit in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery.  I make that point because it is unnecessary to put people through that kind of difficulty.</P>
    <P>Since the 1950s the INTO has been instrumental in bringing to the attention of the authorities various categories of disability or handicap &mdash; I hate getting involved in trying to find the most politically correct word of the moment.  Senator Cox mentioned autism.  I spent six years trying to convince the Department of Education and Science to recognise autism.  Autism is such a puzzle it is ironic that it has been so difficult to have it recognised by decision makers.  That is the kind of difficulty that every category of disability has experienced.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about how little officialdom cares for people who are different in whatever way and how slow we are to include and accommodate people with disability.  I do not know of a special school or institution which is not dependent on the support of parents and friends for its continuing existence.  There must be something very wrong in our democracy when that is happening. In effect, the parents, friends and relations of the child with a special need who must be educated, who take on this extra responsibility, share the difficulties and try to find solutions are also hit with what I call the extra taxation of having to raise additional money for the school, sheltered workshop or institution. There is something wrong with that and it should not be allowed.  This relates to a human right. There was a great phrase in the Proclamation of the Republic, that we might cherish all the children of the nation equally.  It is unfortunate that we have never inserted that phrase into any Constitution. A Minister for equality can only have one objective, that is, to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  I look forward to the day we vote on a constitutional amendment to insert those words into the Constitution but I do not expect to see it.  No Government would ever risk it but that would be the test, and I would welcome it.</P>
    <P>Siblink, the national association of the brothers and sisters of mentally handicapped, is a newly formed group.  The association has only existed for six or seven months.  Its members are important but they have always been silent.  They have coped without having a voice, worked without being recognised and been supportive without receiving fundamental support themselves.</P>
    <P>Siblink has a double agenda &mdash; it provides its members with a forum where they can share their personal experience and, more positively, it can suggest strategies to deal with circumstances.  The organisation has identified certain issues which must be addressed.  It suggests that a life plan, from birth to geriatric care, must be put into place for every handicapped person.  Such a plan was mentioned in the report and I commend the suggestion to the Minister for her consideration. <Col N="602" /> The big worry for the parents of a mentally handicapped person is what will happen to their child when they die.  This is especially so when the youngest person in the family is mentally handicapped, as is often the case.</P>
    <P>The life plan must take into account the needs of the siblings as well as of the mentally handicapped person and his or her parents, and siblings should be seen as complementary to the parents, not as an automatic replacement.  I do not have time to develop this point further but I ask the Minister when she considers carers in general to look specifically at siblings, who have an important role to play.  In her response, I ask her to give a commitment to listen to what this organisation has to say and to meet a representative group.  They do not have strong voting power but neither do most of the people she deals with in the Department and it is for that reason that their commitment should be all the more valued by democratic structures.  The test of any democracy is how well it deals with its minorities and this is a minority that needs our attention and help so that it can cope properly and with dignity with its place in society.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to the Minister.  Her record in this area is good and she will bring her experience to bear on this important portfolio.  I have no difficulty with the inclusion of the former Department of Equality and Law Reform with the former Department of Justice &mdash; as long as the job is done it does not matter what label we put on a Department.  I am confident the Minister will do the job well and will proceed to improve the lot of the disabled.</P>
      <P>An important and fundamental principle is at stake here.  Things that are required by people with disabilities are not matters of discretion for the State.  nor are they merely desirable, they are rights.  It is a right of a physically disabled person to be able to move around comfortably and easily. There is an obligation on society to provide the facilities required to ensure no one is discriminated against by virtue of physical and mental disability, but unfortunately our record as a society has not been good.  The degree to which people with disabilities are included is a mark of a civilised society but inclusion should not be by way of charity but as of right.  I applaud the Minister's intention that &ldquo;disability will never again be viewed as a problem to be dealt with by charity or as a medical problem to be dealt with by hospitals and institutions&rdquo;.  While there are cases of severe disability or mental handicap where permanent care is required, the Minister is to be congratulated for her statement and I hope she keeps it before her during her Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also recognise the talents of people with disability, which have often been undervalued or not given the expression they require. Those with sporting talents have been allowed to develop them but there are other talents which are equally manifest &mdash; in the intellectual or artistic <Col N="603" /> spheres &mdash; and they should be given the chance to develop.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Toole said, personal space is extremely important.  One example of that can be seen in Moore Abbey, Monasterevin, County Kildare, which cares for profoundly mentally handicapped people.  The residents shared accommodation but when they were provided with individual accommodation and their own rooms, their condition &mdash; if I may use that word, although I would not wish to use it &mdash; improved dramatically.  The reason for the improvement was that they had personal space, which had an effect even in cases of profound mental handicap.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was mentioned by several speakers.  I applaud the work done by the former Minister, Mr. Taylor, which was also applauded by people on all sides of this House when he spoke to us after announcing his retirement. I am glad the Government intends to act on the report, to establish priorities and to implement them.  It was a matter of some satisfaction to me that the Progressive Democrats' election manifesto contained a section on disabilities as I insisted on its inclusion.  I am also glad that the Programme for Government also referred to people with disabilities.  For far too long they have been excluded from mainstream political consideration and that was not good enough.  That resulted from an attitude we had in the past which I hope is now behind us.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to do something about respite care.  It is a capital intensive area and it is extremely desirable that people with disabilities should be cared for in the home.  It also should be a priority that families who have coped with a disabled person, particularly a person with mental handicap, have a relief system whereby if they need to go on holiday or to get some respite from their tasks, that will provided.  In Kildare there is a big shortage of adequate respite care, by which I mean a place where a person with disabilities can be cared for while their families &mdash; or siblings, as mentioned by Senator O'Toole &mdash; can have a break.  As the Minister is aware, people with disabilities who in earlier times might have died young are now, thankfully, living to a greater age.  That brings with it, however, an attendant problem.  Parents now worry about what will happen to their handicapped child after they die.  I endorse the Senator's remarks about siblings.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Employment Equality Bill and Equal Status Bill are to be revisited, so to speak.  There were long debates on both Bills in this House and it was unfortunate that they were found unconstitutional not because of the sections which were referred but because of the sections on people with disabilities.  It must be a priority to rectify this matter and to ensure people get their rights.</P>
    <P>I endorse Senator Costello's remarks on the election.  My mother, who is 90, insisted on voting <Col N="604" /> on the presidential election and referendum.  She is not particularly disabled but it is convenient that she should use a wheelchair.  In my polling station there was a magnificent metal ramp, although it might not have been required there; while in my mother's polling station, which has a nursing home adjacent to it and where many elderly people vote, there was no ramp.  Why was that the case?  Someone should attend to this matter.</P>
    <P>Another disability which is relevant to elections and also needs attention is illiteracy.  In debating the Electoral Bill dealing with presidential elections I said that photographs of candidates should appear on ballot papers.  It should not be required of somebody who is unable to read to have to avail of the so-called &ldquo;shouted vote&rdquo; at the polling station.  People must not be excluded from our democracy by reason of physical disability or illiteracy.  The argument put forward for not accepting those amendments was that it would lead to a beauty contest whereby those with better pictures might be elected.  If by the end of a presidential election campaign we do not know what the candidates look like we may give up in despair.  This matter should be examined with a view to including people in the democratic process to the extent that is necessary.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government for the provision of £2.8 million for people with physical disabilities and for the other funds announced during the week.  We must remember the contribution of the voluntary sector with regard to disability.  Without its commitment circumstances would have been much worse.  The effectiveness of the voluntary sector in the past allowed the State to stand back while the voluntary sector undertook tasks which the State should have undertaken.  I am aware of the work done by KARE in County Kildare and the Camphill communities.  Without such voluntary sector input the situation would have been far worse.  Therefore, we must underpin its work. Where that sector experiences difficulties we must ensure they are resolved.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment, I welcome the &ldquo;quota&rdquo; approach.  Many disabled people are able for full-time employment and they should have the opportunity to be so employed.  I agree with Senator O'Toole's point on the Employment Equality Bill, 1997.  That matter must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have not fulfilled their role with regard to disability.  In Newbridge the chamber of commerce had dips put in the pavements to facilitate wheelchair users.  Local authorities have not been proactive enough in this regard and in making their own buildings accessible to people with disabilities.  They should give an example in this matter.</P>
    <P>I applaud the developments taking place.  Progress is being made in a positive manner.  This progress must be governed by the notion that equality must be accorded to disabled people as <Col N="605" /> a right because they are citizens.  That is the only adequate response from Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for participating in the debate and expressing their concerns.  People with disabilities are frustrated, marginalised and denied much of the access and opportunities that people without disabilities take for granted.  They have suffered in the past from fragmented services, exclusion from planning, lack of basic information and misunderstanding. Hopefully this will change. Senators referred to the report and the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and the other work we are doing.  The listening meetings were important in allowing us to get the views of people with disabilities, their families and their carers at first hand.</P>
      <P>Disability is a social issue not a medical one. We are presented with the task of tearing down the barriers which stand in the way of those with disabilities leading full and independent lives.  We propose an equality strategy involving legislative solutions, proposals for new policy initiatives and new structures for the delivery of quality services within a framework of rights, not charity.  As Senator Dardis said, the disabled have rights and that idea must guide the direction we take.</P>
      <P>The task of implementing the report is important in improving the situation of people with disabilities, their families and carers.  Its implementation will not take place overnight nor in one fell swoop.  It must be done in a programmed way over a period of years.  This much is realised by all concerned.  It is important that a start has been made and the Government is committed to ensure that all Departments and agencies will play their part.  We are moving away from the old health model to a point where disability is an issue for all Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>I intend to press ahead with the preparation of a comprehensive plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities based on the commission's report as quickly as possible.  I am committed to continuing my Department's work on the preparation of disability and equality legislation to which many speakers referred.  My Department is giving urgent attention to the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill and, following the Government's decision, work has begun on the disability legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello expressed concern about funding and the report of the review group.  At the beginning of the year a budgetary provision of £2.18 million was made for people with disabilities. The funding was welcome but its level was disappointing because, on foot of the report of the review group, to which the Senator referred, more funding was expected.  The Government announced recently an additional £4.3 million &mdash; double the funding available earlier in the year.  We are committed to continuing <Col N="606" /> to identify funding wherever possible for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Dardis that the title of the Department does not matter.  What is important is that the work is done.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who represents the interests of the disabled at Cabinet, is committed to the area.  He is a powerful advocate for people with disabilities and has been fully supportive of my efforts in this regard. Since my appointment the Minister has been outstanding in putting forward at Cabinet the case of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about Senators' comments about the inaccessibility of some polling stations for the presidential election.  I proposed the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1996, which passed both Houses last December, to ensure that polling stations would be accessible.  The aim was to select an accessible public building for use as a polling station &mdash; a local school which is inaccessible should not be chosen in preference to an accessible community hall.  If Senators have information on inaccessible stations they should be brought to light because such inaccessibility should not be as common as has been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a national disability authority and a disability support service was recommended by the commission.  The commission's recommendations are significant and I regard the setting up of these bodies as crucial.  I am consulting with my colleagues to see what action can be taken to that end.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge and others referred to the abuse of parking spaces for the disabled.  On 1 October 1997 the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, announced that henceforth this abuse will constitute a parking offence punishable by an on the spot fine.</P>
    <P>Senators raised the issue of supporting the Special Olympics.  This afternoon while we were debating this issue the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, announced Government approval for up to £5 million in grant assistance towards the cost of a bid to host the Special Olympic summer games in Ireland in 2003.  Should the bid succeed, it will bring to our shores the biggest international sports event ever to take place in Ireland, involving 7,000 athletes and coaches from more than 160 participating countries and up to 30,000 volunteers.  Hosting the Special Olympics would provide an exceptional opportunity to promote awareness of disability as well as opportunities for North-South co-operation and the whole island would be engaged in delivering the games.  The outcome of the bid to host the games in 2003 is expected to be announced next summer.</P>
    <P>I and my colleagues in Government are determined that disability issues will become issues of mainstream political, social and economic rights. As Minister of State with special responsibility for disability I will continue to work closely with my ministerial colleagues and people with disabilities <Col N="607" /> and their families and carers in progressing disability issues.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked if I would meet the Siblink group.  I would be delighted to do so and perhaps he will ask them to contact my office.  The pilot community disability projects which I spoke about will assist in ensuring access at local level by people with disabilities to all information in appropriate formats on issues affecting their lives. Information and access to it is a very important issue and has been raised by many people in terms of the commission report.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cox said, it is important to go boldly where no one has gone before.  That is where we intend to go.  We are absolutely committed to people with disabilities.  I hope that commitment has been evident since my appointment on 9 July and that it will remain so as we go forward with further announcements.  From meetings I have had with Cabinet Ministers and Departments I can say that the Government, both individually and collectively, is committed to the issue of people with disabilities and I am delighted to say I am pushing an open door.</P>
    <P>I have taken a note of all the points raised during the debate including that of the 3 per cent quota and I will gladly follow up those issues.  I thank Senators for taking part in the debate and for putting forward their suggestions.</P>

    <Title>Commission on the Newspaper Industry: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to indicate the progress, if any, that has been made towards implementing the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry and, in particular, the recommendation in Chapter 7 that extensive changes in the law of libel be introduced as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  This is his first time in the House since his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I assure him his visit will not involve him in any controversy.  In what is a quiet week in politics I decided to table a prosaic and downbeat motion, largely with the intention of getting information.  The purpose of the debate is to get an update on the Government's intentions <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Finlay report into the newspaper industry.  This is a matter of public interest and concern.  It is a subject on which the Government had a small number of things to say in its election manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a certain extent the climate has changed since that commission was established.  In the past few years there has been an air of crisis and impending gloom over the newspaper industry. We should remember that the setting for this report was the closure of the <i>Irish Press</i> which brought the crisis to a head.  The reasons the <i>Irish</i><Col N="608" /><i>Press</i> failed are not our direct concern, though most people have very strong views on why it failed and focus on the manner in which the newspaper was managed.  We regret the passing of the <i>Irish Press</i> and we spoke about it at the time in this House.  In an earlier time some of us earned an odd shilling writing for that newspaper.</P>
    <P>The failure of the <i>Irish Press</i> was not the only focus of concern when this commission was established. Other newspapers seemed at that time to be wobbly.  There was a serious question mark over the future of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> and we were being warned about the danger of being swamped by English newspapers being dumped on the Irish market at below cost prices.  We were told our libel laws and tax regime were strangling our newspapers and we were being warned about the dominance of one newspaper group.  The picture is dramatically different today.  Virtually all newspapers are now making substantial profits. The Independent Group is set to make record profits this year while <i>The Irish Times</i> is also making substantial profits.  The success of <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> which was on a wobbly foundation at the time the commission was established, has resulted in Ireland's first newspaper millionaires since Dr. O'Reilly.  The paper is now well established.  A new arrival to the Sunday market is <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> and we all wish it well, especially as it appears to have absorbed so much of the ethos and staff of <i>The Sunday Press.</i> The Irish edition of <i>The Sunday Times</i> continues to make substantial inroads on the market since its printing moved to Cork and <i>The Examiner</i> has become a genuinely national newspaper though it keeps its distinctive southern identity.  I could go on but the basic point is that the situation in which we are examining these questions today is very different from the atmosphere that prevailed when this commission was established by the former Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.</P>
    <P>The report indicated some structural weaknesses in the newspaper industry and made specific recommendations some of which make sense and seem to be worthy of implementation.  I would like the Minister to convey the up to date thinking of the Government on these issues.  My first reference is to recommendation No. 4 in the report, a very practical recommendation which calls for the establishment by the Government of a special unit within the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission to deal with the newspaper industry and in particular to assist and work with unions and management in those companies in which its assistance is required jointly to identify changes necessary to achieve competitive efficiency in the industry.  This unit should be available exclusively for a fixed period to the industry.  The thinking behind this recommendation is worthwhile.  The industry, probably more than most because of the revolution in information technology, is going through huge changes in work practices and these changes will continue at a very rapid pace.  The increasing overseas competition is also putting huge strains on newspapers <Col N="609" /> to be more competitive.  The result is that few industries have had the shake-up in industrial relations and work practices that has happened, and continues to happen, in the newspaper and other media.  The clear intention of the report was that we are faced with neither brutal tactics nor industrial relations which would not happen anyway that would compel solutions on the industry.</P>
    <P>There is a further complication in that not all the Irish newspapers have reacted to change with the same level of preparedness or, indeed, have been prepared to invest in change and retraining on an equal basis.  The report comes down very strongly against a central printing unit somewhere close to the main centre of population, open to all papers and financed by the State.  It states there is not an industry wide solution to these massive problems of retraining and that is why the report recommended a special unit be established within the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission to deal with the newspaper industry.  The purpose of the advisory service would be &ldquo;to assist and work with the unions and management to find solutions regarding technology, staffing levels, demarcation and labour costs on an industry by industry basis&rdquo;. Has this proposal been supported by the newspaper industry and what is the Government's thinking on this issue?  Some newspapers do not have a history of good management and there have been intractable union problems within the industry.</P>
    <P>The second area concerns changes in the libel laws.  The newspapers and politicians or people in public life feel hard done by.  As politicians we are congenitally suspicious of journalists.  We frequently see conspiracies and partisanship where there is none and question the motives of journalists with whom we disagree.  It is a fact of life that all politicians have tried to use journalists to get across a particular message.  In turn, I do not think journalists see us as we see ourselves. Journalists frequently see conspiracies where there are none.  Two politicians talking in the corridor can be interpreted by a suspicious journalist as a heave against the party leader, a move in a particular direction or a cabal forming whereas all they may be talking about is a forthcoming hurling match.  There is a conspiracy among many journalists to see us all as involved in a conspiracy to keep them in the dark despite the fact that the last Government passed the most wide ranging Freedom of Information Bill in our history. Nonetheless there is a sense that politicians collectively conspire to keep journalists in the dark. They tend to lump us all into one amorphous mass seeing us all as politicians.  But it is right to see this tension between journalists and politicians. The only basis upon which a friendship can flourish between a journalist and a politician is on a clear acceptance that each party has a very different job to do.  While each party can see the view of the other, each person inevitably comes to the same problem from a different perspective and will frequently reach very different conclusions <Col N="610" /> from the same set of facts.  That is the way the political and journalist systems work.</P>
    <P>Politicians make many complaints about journalists.  The biggest complaint is the breathless tendency for the media to hunt in packs and hype up issues which on closer examination have little real substance.  After the media pack moves on real damage may have been done to people or causes.</P>
    <P>The media, no more than politicians, are not homogenous.  Many of our journalists are among the best in the world and the standard of journalism is constantly rising.  Our newspapers have points of view but are fair and open.  Some journalists or newspapers may have elements of a hidden agenda but they are in the minority.</P>
    <P>We are not here this evening to debate the merits of the media.  I wish to acknowledge the central point made in the Finlay report which is that the media play a fundamental role in the democratic process through informing, analysing, examining, probing and at times even by being downright abusive to politicians.  This is a central element in sustaining a healthy democratic process. The Finlay report makes that clear and we all know it.  Our purpose is to see if there is anything in this report which can help the media to do their job even more effectively.  Will the Minister report to us the views of the Government on the suggestions in the Finlay report or any of its own ideas on changing the libel laws to help the media do their job more effectively?</P>
    <P>I note that the report is strongly in favour of a system of self-regulation through an ombudsman appointed on the initiative of the newspapers themselves and financed by them.  I ask the newspaper industry how much progress, if any, has been made towards such a body.  I suspect that very little has been done.  This is not the responsibility of the Minister.  Does the newspaper industry believe in the concept?  Would an ombudsman be capable of policing some of the cowboy operators, especially the English based newspapers? Is the highly competitive newspaper industry capable of working in a uniform way on an issue like this?  Is there any substance in believing that an ombudsman type concept or a press council could work with the support of the newspaper industry in bringing about the reforms mentioned in the Finlay report?</P>
    <P>It is a fact that fierce competition does not make for co-operation.  It cannot.  Newspapers are in desperate competition with each other.  Is self-regulation viable as far as the newspaper industry is concerned?  It is fair to ask the industry this question before asking the Minister his intentions because I have a feeling that the hugely increased profits of recent years have dulled the desire for libel reform in sections of the media.  In some cases newspapers are prepared to live within a tolerable level of libel costs if circulation figures are boosted.  If the media and the newspaper industry are constantly calling on politicians to provide reforms there is an equal right to question their honesty.  By their honesty I mean the <Col N="611" /> clarity of their intentions and their capacity to deliver on the question of self-regulation.  It is doubtful the industry as it is structured at present &mdash; and perhaps under any type of structure &mdash; is capable of delivering upon the concept of self-regulation. In this respect, the industry's failure greatly weakens the attempt to place the onus back on politicians and Governments.</P>
    <P>I would like to put two practical considerations to the Minister.  The first is the assessment of damages, a very topical issue of late.  As I understand it, the report does not come down in favour of removing juries from this equation but leaves the matter to the judges.  The experience in the insurance industry is that damages cost little even if they are jury assessed.</P>
    <P>Inadvertent libel is a major genuine headache for newspapers.  Where a mistake is made &mdash; an incorrect name, report, address, a juxtaposition &mdash; in innocence, it is not possible for newspapers in most cases to print an honest and open apology the next day because that apology will be used in evidence against them.  This is a source of poison within the system because it encourages people who feel they have a chance to hit the jackpot by going after the newspapers on the basis of what may have been an honest mistake, often by an inexperienced journalist, where the newspapers are willing to apologise up front.  If that aspect of the libel laws could be changed it would be an earnest of the good intentions of politicians to the newspaper industry, it would remove a major headache from people working under pressure on a day-to-day basis and would also sharpen the genuine questions we have to ask.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to highlight an area of Irish life which is of increasing importance and I commend Senator Manning on tabling this motion.  The impact of the media, print and electronic, on Irish society over the past 30 years has contributed largely to the type of society that Ireland has become.  We are more tolerant, pluralist and better informed on events at home and abroad, as a result of an active, inquiring media.  The changes that technology has imposed on the manner in which the media operates has largely been beneficial.  The ending of restrictive practices in the print media has led to the more efficient use of ever-changing technology and has put the Irish media at the cutting edge of news gathering and the dissemination of information to an increasingly sophisticated market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrival of the global village has provided new challenges and difficulties for an Irish media industry operating on the periphery of Europe and adjacent to a larger and more powerful neighbour in the United Kingdom.  The continuing <Col N="612" /> existence of a monopoly in the electronic media specifically in television and, despite the best efforts of Radio Ireland, in national radio has resulted in a strained relationship between the two giants of the media.  The newspaper industry has been particularly critical of successive Governments' lack of legislative initiatives to regulate the Irish media industry although the Broadcasting Acts of 1988 and 1990 went some distance in restricting RTÉ's dominant position in the Irish market.  However, those who hoped that the creation of 20 new local radio stations and a new national station, Century Radio, would create a significant alternative advertising outlet were to be disappointed.  The demise of Century Radio and the closure of the Irish Press Newspaper Group was a severe blow to supporters of a more diversified media market.  The growing invasion of UK newspaper titles also eroded the circulation figures of Irish titles in the early nineties resulting in severe financial pressure being placed on the indigenous newspaper industry.</P>
    <P>It was in that climate of uncertainty that the national newspapers of Ireland issued a media policy document in September 1992 in which they called on the Government to address five issues demanding urgent attention.  These issues are as relevant today as they were five years ago and in view of the difficulties facing Radio Ireland in establishing a listener threshold since its arrival in the spring of this year, the issues of 1992 are perhaps even more relevant today although the economic environment is different, as Senator Manning pointed out.</P>
    <P>In an article in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 13 June 1997 it states:</P>
    <P>While the circulation of daily newspapers continued to decline in most industrialised countries last year, Ireland was among that small group to see an increase.</P>
    <P>Sales were down in 24 of the 38 countries examined..</P>
    <P>Ireland's sales increase [on a year to year basis] was 4.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>It was mainly among the Irish indigenous newspapers that this occurred because it coincided, interestingly enough, with the change in the accounting method for the British titles which resulted in a more realistic figure being attributed to the sales of UK titles in this country.  What effectively happened was the print run had traditionally been taken as a sales figure but when they extrapolated the sales for it there was a massive difference and it showed that the majority of people voted in favour of indigenous Irish newspapers, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In view of the emphasis placed on Chapter 7 of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry by Senator Manning in framing this motion, it is interesting to note that in the newspaper submission of 1992 it was listed only as number four on their list of priorities.  Their main priority then and now is the removal of VAT on newspaper prices, the tax on Irish newspapers which is the <Col N="613" /> heaviest in Europe and the previously referred to restrictions on advertising came after press freedom and libel and the question of unfair competition. I hope the Minister will address the issues of VAT and the tax regime in general on newspapers.</P>
    <P>As the motion specifically refers to libel it is perhaps relevant to quote the newspaper industries position as outlined in their 1992 document: &ldquo;the laws governing defamation are now so disastrously out of date as to constitute a very major obstacle for any media company endeavouring to honestly pursue its duty&rdquo;.  I submit that those who have had to seek redress from the courts as a result of a newspaper comment would find it difficult to agree with the stance of the newspaper industry on this matter.  I would also suggest that the experience of some candidates in the recent presidential election at the hands of some sections of the media and the public reaction to this treatment indicates that the public are in an ugly mood and did not like the tenor and, in some instances, the outright prejudice of some media commentators.  The media did not win any new friends in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>It is interesting when one looks at the results of the presidential election to note &mdash; whether it was a coincidence or not &mdash; that the voting patterns among constituencies exclusively south of the Liffey were out of kilter with the remainder of the country.  Is it purely a coincidence that the vast majority of people working in the Dublin media live and work in those constituencies south of the Liffey where they talk to each other and obviously express and exchange opinions and then use those opinions in their columns in some instances, with honourable exceptions, to lecture the rest of the country on how we should vote? That the rest of the country on this occasion obviously did not listen to this type of lecture is worthy of comment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the points I made, what has been happening in recent months is unhealthy in a democratic society.  I passionately believe in the freedom of the press and as a member of the National Union of Journalists for more than 20 years I am perhaps better placed than most in this House to appreciate the pressures and difficulties faced by a free press in attempting to convey the message objectively and without fear and favour. I also believe that some in public life particularly have hidden behind the restrictive libel laws which is not in the public interest.  I agree with the national newspaper industry that national newspapers do not seek any favoured position in law but merely the recognition by the community at large that in addition to a need to preserve balance between the individual's right to his or her good name and the media's right to freedom of expression, there exists an additional overriding public concern, the right to freedom of information.</P>
    <P>I accept many of the recommendations contained in Chapter 7 especially in relation to the lodgment of money in court by a defendant in <Col N="614" /> court to meet a claim for compensation for defamation with a denial of liability.  I also support the Commission's view that there would appear to be inconsistencies and anomalies in the present legal situation, specifically that the definition of public meetings contained in the second schedule of the Defamations Act, 1961, is insufficiently wide to cover all the appropriate public and community activities which require reporting under modern conditions such as, for example, press conferences.  In that instance, the law on defamation going back to 1961 to a different world and a different communications age, is drastically in need of being updated.</P>
    <P>I concur with the view of the commission that changes in the libel laws which would include the recommendations contained in Chapter 7 are a matter of considerable urgency.  I do not believe it is healthy to continue to have an increasing stream of people queueing up at the doors of our courts attempting to overturn, change or have retracted comments or opinions expressed in national newspapers.  It is obvious that there is right on both sides.  However, there must be something wrong with the law if people feel the need for legal redress &mdash; there are no other avenues open to them &mdash; and newspapers believe they are operating in an extremely restrictive environment which is not healthy in a democratic society.  For these reasons, I support the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Certain members of the public may believe we have a flawed, intrusive and sometimes inaccurate and insulting media.  However, a vibrant democracy thrives on a free press.  In criticising it we should also cherish it.  I welcome the motion.</P>

      <P>We are grateful to Senator Manning and Members for providing the opportunity for this debate.  In September 1995, against the background of the demise of the <i>Irish Press</i>, the former Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, established the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Thomas A. Finlay, former Chief Justice.  The commission reported in June 1996 and its findings were published on 30 July of that year.  The report made 16 wide-ranging recommendations spanning the areas of responsibility of several Government Departments, including Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment and Local Government, Public Enterprise, and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> In the light of the wide spectrum of issues covered by the commission's recommendations the previous Government decided that the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment would co-ordinate the work of the various Departments in respect of the recommendations.  The previous Minister reported to Government at the end of November 1996 in regard to his co-ordinating role and the Government approved his intention to revert to them concerning legislation in relation to his area of responsibility.  The previous Government also agreed, subject to certain reservations, that other Ministers, upon whose areas of responsibility the recommendations impacted, should also pursue the implementation of recommendations, within their respective Departments.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly outline the 16 recommendations made by the commission and the various proposals so far concerning their implementation. Recommendation 1 dealt with changes of ownership in the newspaper sector.  The commission recommended that, in the exercise of the available regulatory powers, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment should assess the implications of any proposed change of ownership in the newspaper industry on the strength and competitiveness of the indigenous industry, in relation to UK titles, the plurality of ownership, the plurality of titles, the diversity of views in Irish society and the maintenance of cultural diversity.  With the exception of the strength and competitiveness of the indigenous industry in relation to UK titles, which the former Minister felt might contravene European Union law, we have now referred these to the competition and mergers review group to advise the Tánaiste on how best they might be implemented.  The review group is equipped with wide ranging legal and economic expertise.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 2 was a majority recommendation of the commission.  It proposed that consideration should be given to amending existing mergers controls in the newspaper industry to widen the powers to regulate not only the acquisition of shares but also the acquisition of control over newspapers by other means.  In conjunction with recommendation 1 regarding regulation of ownership, merger control and concentration of media ownership, the Tánaiste also asked the review group to consider how best this recommendation might be implemented in order to be effective.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 3 called for the reduction of VAT on the sale of newspapers to a zero rate. We accept that newspapers sold in Ireland continue to attract a higher level of VAT than in other countries and that the national newspapers of Ireland continue to press for a reduction in this rate, particularly in the light of the zero per cent VAT rate applicable in the UK.  While this matter is primarily one for consideration by the Minister for Finance, we appreciate the substantial difficulties facing our colleague on this particularly sensitive issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> Recommendation 4, to which Senator Manning referred, called for the establishment of a special unit within the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission to deal with the newspaper industry and, in particular, to assist and work with unions and management in those companies, in which its assistance is jointly requested, to identify changes necessary to achieve competitive efficiency in the industry.  The prime responsibility for achieving competitive efficiency rests with the employers, trade unions and workers within the industry.  However, the former Minister requested that the Labour Relations Commission be available to all parties concerned in providing the necessary assistance in identifying the required changes to achieve the objective of this recommendation.  We reaffirm that this assistance is available to all parties.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 5 concerned the question of establishing a central shared printing facility for the industry but opposed State funding if the industry is to proceed with such a project.  Our predecessor agreed with the commission's finding on this matter and we do not consider that further action is warranted at this point.</P>
    <P>In recommendation 6, the commission called for the creation of a working group to report on the problems of training for all concerned in the newspaper industry.  The previous Minister requested that FÁS co-operate with all the parties, in addition to the various representative bodies of the newspapers, in furthering this objective, including the establishment of any appropriate structures.  We reaffirm that this co-operation is available to the relevant parties.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 7 proposed that the existing Gaming and Lotteries Acts should be amended to make them an effective deterrent against breaches by newspapers.  This recommendation was in response to sales and marketing tactics by a number of UK newspaper publishers who, from time to time, have included a &ldquo;scratch card&rdquo; form of lottery, based in and organised from outside the State.  While apparently legal under UK legislation, this form of marketing appears to contravene the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, applicable in Ireland.  I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform favours a review of the legislation before any specific legislative changes are adopted in response to this proposal.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8 called for the introduction of legislation to outlaw below average marginal cost selling of newspapers in a form similar to that proposed by the national newspapers of Ireland.  The commission was satisfied that there were considerable grounds for supporting the NNI's contention that some UK newspaper publishers are selling newspapers at prices which are less than their average marginal cost.  However, the commission also recognised that the detection and proof of such selling is complicated particularly by the difficulty of ascertaining the true extent, to which advertising revenue earned in total by such publications can, with accuracy, be <Col N="617" /> described as being derived from or targeted at the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Any legislation in this area would have to be robust and safe from legal challenge.  While proving effective and workable it would also have to comply with European Union law.  For example, it could not and should not discriminate against any newspaper based upon specific &ldquo;nationality&rdquo; criteria.  Advice received to date, legal and economic, indicates that major difficulties lie in the way of framing legislation which would meet these criteria.  Accordingly, while I am still in discussion with the Attorney General on this matter, it does not appear that it will be possible to overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 9 referred to the form of competition for advertising in the Irish newspaper market which emanates from the advertising policies and practices of RTÉ.  The commission was satisfied that television and radio, in respect of the advertising of a great number of commodities and services, represent a major competitor to the newspaper industry.  While the newspaper industry accepts this situation, it complained to the commission that RTÉ improperly avoids the cap that was imposed upon the extent of its advertising time by the system of free gifts and free services arising in TV and radio programmes where there is audience involvement. This recommendation sought the discontinuance of the avoidance of advertising time limits which, as a matter of policy, have been imposed on RTÉ by the provision of such free gifts and services.</P>
    <P>The previous Government was reluctant to pursue the implementation of this recommendation in view of the importance of securing and maintaining the ongoing viability and existence of an Irish based television channel.  Accordingly, we agree that no further action is necessary at this stage in regard to this recommendation.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 10 referred to the concentration of ownership in the media generally and recommended that this should be considered on a media-wide as well as on a single media basis. The commission found that such a concentration of ownership in the media has a similar potential for limiting or impeding diversity of views and opinions in a manner harmful to the democratic process as concentration of ownership in newspapers alone.</P>
    <P>This is a matter upon which the Tánaiste has asked the Competition and Mergers Review Group to deliberate in regard to how best it might be implemented.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 11 calls for the appointment and funding by the newspaper industry, both indigenous and imported, in Ireland of a wholly independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards not involving any possible question of defamation, provided that such a complaint has been made to the newspaper and has not been dealt with to the complainant's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> While not within our Department's area of responsibility, I would like to refer to Chapter 7 of the commission's report which recognised that:</P>
    <P>there is unanimous support for the principle that the primary mechanism for complaint must remain as one to the newspaper itself, and must involve rapid communication with the editor or readers' representative, or newspaper ombudsman by the reader who has a complaint.  Any function of an outside ombudsman or press council should therefore necessarily be confined as a further step only to be availed of if a complaint having been made to the newspaper itself has not been dealt with to the satisfaction of the complainant.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the commission then recommended the appointment and funding by the newspapers of a wholly independent ombudsman and it went on to outline a general scheme for newspapers to follow, for both the appointment and funding of such an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>When the former Minister met the industry earlier this year I understand he outlined to them his endorsement of the commission's recommendation for the appointment and funding of a wholly independent ombudsman by the industry itself.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 12 dealt with the question of legislative immunity from claims for defamation for such an ombudsman, if appointed, in respect of matters <i>bona fide</i> arising from the exercise of the function of such an ombudsman's office, while recommendation 13 called for the introduction of extensive changes in the law of libel.</P>
    <P>We would see these two recommendations being further evaluated in parallel by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in consultation with other relevant Ministers.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has informed us, however, that changes in the law on defamation were also called for in the report of the Law Reform Commission on the civil law of defamation, published in December 1991, which pointed to the need for the law in this area to be recast in a more satisfactory legislative framework.</P>
    <P>The commission's report contained over 50 recommendations, some of which were of a similar nature to those of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.</P>
    <P>Members of this House will be aware that this area of the law is very complex.  The existing law draws on influences from the common law, from statute, including the Defamation Act, 1961, and from the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution.  The purpose of any defamation law must be to protect and vindicate, as far as possible, the right of the individual to his or her good name with due regard to the right of freedom of expression of others.  Any new law cannot ignore the need to balance these rights, both of which are expressly guaranteed by our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I also understand from our colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that <Col N="619" /> he met both the National Newspapers of Ireland and the Provincial Newspapers Association of Ireland, at their request, in September, to discuss defamation law reform.</P>
    <P>Following a detailed exchange of views the Minister indicated he was not opposed to the possibility that some legislative change in this area might be brought forward which would concentrate on particular matters of concern to the newspaper industry.  Such matters might include the introduction of a declaratory action whereby a plaintiff, instead of seeking a damages award, might apply to the court for an order that a particular statement was false and defamatory. Second, clarification of the law governing the making of apologies and, third, the lodgement of money in court without the admission of liability.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the House that a defamation Bill is included in the list of proposed legislation.  That list also includes 27 other Bills which are within the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This is indicative of the strength of his commitment to balanced and wide-ranging reform in criminal, civil and equality law.  These Bills, having regard to such matters as size, complexity and the need to consult with Departments and interest groups, are at various stages of preparation.  There is no need for me to tell this House that it is inevitable in such circumstances that some Bills can be delivered and processed much quicker than others.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 14 sought procedures for making available to bona fide journalists the right to inspect court records and documents which have become part of a public hearing in court. While our predecessor accepted this recommendation in principle and brought it to the attention of the then Minister for Justice, I appreciate the detailed technical issues which are involved.  The present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may wish to review and consider the overall position before advancing on the implementation of this particular recommendation.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 15 called for the defining by statute of the circumstances and standard procedures under which a local authority or other statutory committee, which has an obligation to hold its meetings in public, can, by going into committee or otherwise, exclude the public and the press.  Again our predecessor accepted the principle that an appropriate legislative instrument should be drawn up to minimise the circumstances in which local authorities or other statutory committees can exclude both the public and the press.  In this regard, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government needs to consider whatever legislation would be appropriate to this particular situation.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 16 deals with editorial independence and proposes that where sufficient structures are not in existence to guarantee such independence, guarantees of it should be introduced. We believe that this recommendation <Col N="620" /> could impact on the employment contractual conditions of editors.</P>
    <P>While we sympathise with the thrust of the commission's recommendation in this regard, we are aware that its report also states that:</P>
    <P>the information before the commission does not suggest, to any extent, interference with editorial independence in any part of the indigenous newspaper industry at present.</P>
    <P>This having been said, however, we think it would be very desirable that all newspapers should voluntarily guarantee this independence to their editors in their various contracts to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>I have now outlined to the House the 16 recommendations of the commission.  Six of these recommendations fall within the Tánaiste's area of responsibility and four of them would have required introductory legislation.  However, as I have already stated, we may not be proceeding with the recommendation calling for a prohibition on below cost selling.  The Tánaiste has asked the Competition and Mergers Review Group to advise her on how best to implement the recommendations concerning regulation of ownership, merger control and concentration of media ownership.</P>
    <P>The two other recommendations within the Tánaiste's area of responsibility do not require legislation and relate to the need for competitive efficiency in the industry and to training matters.</P>
    <P>As I have already outlined to the House, our predecessor requested the Labour Relations Commission and FÁS to provide all the necessary assistance to help the industry in achieving the objectives envisaged by these recommendations. This still remains the position.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to point out to the House that legislation or other action by Government alone will not secure the competitive future of a vibrant indigenous newspaper industry. Charting a thriving industry for the future is, of course, primarily in the hands of the industry itself.  It has the significant task of adapting newspapers to the change in requirements of the consumer, the needs of the modern marketplace for news and views and also to the changing lifestyles and habits of our society.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Newspaper Industry identified the significant task of improving competitiveness as a key one to be addressed by the newspaper industry itself.  The competitiveness agenda is not just confined to labour costs and numbers, important as these are, but must embrace other issues, such as work practices, printing, technology, distribution and training. The Irish newspaper industry must be prepared to confront these problems and the agencies of the State are available to assist in whatever way they can to ensure a consistently competitive and vibrant newspaper industry at all levels of Irish life.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing Senators' views.  I thank Senator Manning for putting down this <Col N="621" /> important and topical motion.  It is of interest not only to politicians but also to consumers and society in addition to the newspaper industry.  I also look forward to the eventual conclusion of the final evaluation of the report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I travel a good deal and see the newspapers of many countries, principally English speaking countries.  In addition, although I do not speak Spanish or Portuguese well, a classical education has meant I can read those languages reasonably well.  There is a qualitative difference between those newspapers and ours. We are extremely lucky in the quality of our newspaper industry and, in terms of the media in general, we are privileged to have such professional people working in them.  On the whole there is balance.</P>
      <P>Newspapers are powerful instruments in a democracy and they can affect political life.  Irish newspapers have been reasonably responsible, although one must raise a query about the pay back editorial on the front page of one of our principal newspapers and the apparently vindictive way in which one newspaper chose to view political life.  However, we are well served by the newspaper industry.</P>
      <P>Newspapers are powerful and are a powerful lobby.  They have obviously been lobbying powerfully on certain aspects of the commission's recommendations.  The Fine Gael Party highlighted the issue of libel.  I would be hesitant to tinker with the libel laws at the behest of newspapers. Individuals have a right to be protected against the worst excesses of newspapers.</P>
      <P>It is a market driven industry and the Minister of State made it clear that one of the things affecting the Irish newspaper industry at present is penetration from the United Kingdom.  I hope our industry never descends to the level of Britain's gutter press.  It pains me to say as much because Britain at one time had fine newspapers.  Now, however, even <i>The Times</i> is owned by one of the most reprehensible figures in global newspaper and media technology, Rupert Murdoch.  That worries me.  Will our industry be driven down to those standards by their penetration of our market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are the newspapers so worried about libel?  There is a defence to libel &mdash; justification. If the newspapers print something however unpleasant about an individual, whether they are public or private, and if they can justify it, they do not suffer the penalties of libel.  Why should newspapers be permitted to publish lies about people?  Why should they be permitted to trot around people's private lives and publish what they like with impunity?  One of the recommendations appears to suggest as much.  I absolutely oppose it.  I oppose the concept of a declaratory statement whereby after the publication of a fulminating piece of filth about a private individual they can get away with it by saying &ldquo;I am <Col N="622" /> sorry, I now realise it was wrong; I did not mean it&rdquo; and avoid the financial penalty.</P>
    <P>The Minister must retain the financial penalty. It is the one thing that will put manners on the newspapers.  We need it, even if it is not always effective.  Look at how <i>The Sun</i> in Britain printed deliberate libels of Elton John which the publishers knew at the time of publication to be lies. They made a conscious decision to publish the libels because they knew that even if they were fined £1 million, as they were, the effect would be to increase circulation to such an extent they would recoup the damage to their investment.  Do we want that attitude in this country?  I think not.</P>
    <P>The bleating about public interest is pious, hypocritical cant.  I will not pretend I invented these <i>bon mots</i> or thought of this phrase, although its intent is one I have held dear for a long time. Somebody said on the radio recently that one should be careful to distinguish between the public interest on the one hand and what the public is interested in on the other.  The public might be interested in snuffling around the bed linen of public personalities but is it in the public interest? I do not care who pop stars sleep with or what else they do as long as it does not contravene the law.  However, the newspapers are aware that by publishing such salacious information they will increase their sales.  If they publish something defamatory or wrong or libellous, let them pay the penalty.  I do not wish to see those penalties weakened and the Minister will make a great mistake if he does so.</P>
    <P>It is already possible to libel people, particularly Members of the Oireachtas.  Many people appear to think there should be open season on professional politicians and people in public life. It is recognised in case law that people in public life are required by the courts to have a higher level of tolerance of abuse by newspapers and the media than ordinary members of the public.  The justification is that if one puts oneself forward or puts one's head above the parapet and mud is flung at it, it is one's own responsibility.</P>
    <P>I have been libelled on a number of occasions. I have never taken an action, partly because my solicitor advised against it and was reluctant to get involved.  I can offer the House a couple of examples.  In one case I laid political charges in this House against the then Cathaoirleach, Mr. Seán Doherty, which I believed I could justify.  I will not discuss the merits of it now.  The <i>Sunday Business Post</i> chose to print an alleged interview with me &mdash; it was not &mdash; by printing documents which were purloined from my office by some means, alongside a photograph taken in the street and accompanied by an editorial which said the only reason I raised the matter was that I wanted to be included in a trip to Nicaragua.  There was never a possibility that I could have been included in that trip.  I was fighting for a matter of principle.  For technical reasons I could not have participated in that trip.</P>
    <P>The second case occurred three and a half years ago.  I was taken ill while I was working for <Col N="623" /> the Department of Foreign Affairs, unpaid as usual, as a roving cultural ambassador in eastern Europe.  I came down with a severe illness and was hospitalised on my return.  It was a form of hepatitis acquired from water.  Two newspapers printed articles with headlines such as &ldquo;Norris denies AIDS rumours&rdquo;.  The story was to the effect that well known gay rights activist, David Norris, yesterday laughed off widespread suggestions that he was seriously ill with acquired immunity deficiency syndrome.  Of course they were licking their lips in the hope there might be some truth in the rumours.  I am sorry to disappoint them.  I have even put on weight.  I did my best to lose weight and confirm the rumour so they could libel me again more disastrously and, by God, I would have taken them to the cleaners. Again, I was dissuaded from taking any action.</P>
    <P>This example undermines the concept of declaratory statements.  The newspapers thought they were being clever by saying &ldquo;Norris denies AIDS rumours&rdquo;.  They thought it would get them off the libel hook.  I was cute enough to know it did not.  John Major had been awarded £75,000 for a headline in one of the British tabloids which said, in effect, Major denies screwing the cook.  I believe the cook had greater reason to take action on that occasion but the British courts held that publication of the denial of a rumour constituted publication of the libel.  I could have had the newspapers on that judgment but I did not.</P>
    <P>The effect of the story was interesting.  When I carried out some charity work which involved a trip to South America the people on the airplane contacted the organisers to find out if it was safe to travel with me.  One can expect this type of reaction when one reads articles by squalid little turds such as Des Rushe who referred in a recent article to the revolting suggestion that I might be nominated for the Presidency.  He described as disgusting the rumour that Dublin's most prominent queer should be thought of in this light.  I would not dignify him with an action but it is interesting how these things work out.  After all the bellyaching surrounding Princess Diana and the invasion of her privacy, I cannot believe we want to encourage a similar situation here.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that, because of legal technicalities involving European competition law, it is difficult to copperfasten the strength and competitiveness of the indigenous industry as against UK titles. This is most important.  If there is any way we can protect our indigenous press, for God's sake let us do it.  It may require some ingenuity to circumvent the competition laws, but one only has to look at the French lorry drivers strike to find a way.  There is supposed to be free movement of goods and services in the EU but they are not acknowledging that at the moment.  The French Government blithely says it will compensate us, but it said that the last time and it did not do so.  It is a pity the former Minister felt it might contravene European Union law.  Can we look at <Col N="624" /> that again and use a little lateral thinking because we ought to protect our indigenous papers.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about monopoly control and I have given the example of Rupert Murdoch. Similar figures in Latin America also unfortunately exercise considerable political control. Look at what happened in the last UK general election.  I like Mr. Blair but there are two big question marks hanging over him.  One is his Lord Chancellor who seems to be running the show behind the scenes.  The other is what was the agreement between Blair and Murdoch?  Why did the Murdoch group so dramatically switch sides which helped to lead to the avalanche of votes for the British Labour Party?  Look what happened when Neil Kinnock almost made it into office. Murdoch turned the heat on and affected the result of that election.  Is it democratic to allow a single person to have that degree of control?  We must guard against that here.</P>
    <P>Newspapers here should have a zero rate of VAT because it would put them on a level playing field with United Kingdom titles.  If we do not do that, we are asking our titles to operate with one hand tied behind their backs.  Tied into that is the issue of a common printing press, either with or without State funding.  It would be an excellent idea because there must be rationalisation. One of the problems is that United Kingdom titles have higher circulation figures, can print more cheaply and can engage in mass circulation tactics.  We should be aiming for a central printing facility shared by all newspapers.</P>
    <P>We must outlaw below cost or marginal cost selling because it constitutes unfair trading practice. It is largely British newspapers which indulge in this by unloading excess capacity here at below cost rates.  That is unfair dealing.  How can a local newspaper compete with papers being offered to the public at less than their production cost?  This must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 11 deals with the appointment and funding by the newspaper industry, both indigenous and imported, of a wholly independent ombudsman to investigate breaches of press standards.  That is unlikely to be of much use unless it has teeth in terms of financial penalties and there is nothing to suggest it will have them.  It needs them because, if the English experience is examined, it will be seen that there is a press council which makes reports, sometimes written in very strong terms, reprimanding the papers and demanding they change their language, but they do not do so.  Within a week they reprint the exact same material with defamatory, racist and prejudiced labelling.  The Minister will be wasting his time and public money on a press council unless he gives it teeth.  Moral exhortation does not work because it is the marketplace which is being dealt with and, in terms of the British press, the lowest possible standard.  The Commission on the Newspaper Industry reported that any function of an outside ombudsman or press council should be used as a further step only to be availed of if a complaint, having been made to <Col N="625" /> the newspaper itself, was not dealt with to the satisfaction of the complainant.  This is a watering down; it is merely window dressing produced by the newspaper industry to give it a fig leaf of respectability.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 13 might be unlucky for some but, if it is passed, it will not be unlucky for the newspaper industry.  If anything, it will be spectacularly lucky because it will weaken the libel laws.  Apart from the examples I have given &mdash; I am more or less prepared to take any punches on the chin &mdash; I have had a good ride from the newspapers.  Most journalists are my friends and I have great respect for their professionalism. Despite this, weakening the defamation and libel laws will be a retrograde step. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I also understand from our colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that he met both the National Newspapers of Ireland and the Provincial Newspapers Association of Ireland at their request in September to discuss defamation law reform.</P>
    <P>Were members of the public involved at any stage?  Has a contribution been made by the victims of libel and defamation?  I strongly recommend that, rather than just listening to newspaper proprietors, editors, journalists and others who have been lobbying extensively on this matter, the Minister should place an advertisement in the newspapers or use some other mechanism to contact people who have been victims of libel and defamation and acquire evidence from them as to the impact of it on their lives.  He should then set that against the purely commercial considerations of the newspaper industry.  I see little in its submissions about ethics, standards, decency, respect for the good name of the citizen or for the integrity of the people it impugns.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 15 deals with the issue of a local authority going into private session.  We must be very careful because people on local authorities are elected public representatives who represent us.  We must circumscribe with great care those occasions when they decide that material exists which we are not mature enough to be made aware of.  As citizens of a free, independent and democratic republic, we are entitled to the fullest possible accountability.  I would need to be very reassured that there were serious reasons for any such body to go into private, secret session and reserve its deliberations from the public gaze.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 16 deals with editorial independence and proposes to guarantee such independence where sufficient structures are nonexistent. This can be forgotten about because it cannot be done.  It means relying on people's good sense, breeding and professional standards.</P>
    <P>I have unburdened myself of a few notions regarding the newspapers.  As an Independent Member I can say what I like and, if the newspapers do not like it, they can say what they like about me.  If they go overboard in that, I will be <Col N="626" /> licking my lips.  I encourage them to do so and, if they want to libel me, I ask that they do not do it in the half-hearted way they have up to now. They should go for broke.  I want a good, red blooded, macho libel case because libel damages are not subject to tax.  It would greatly please me to take one of them so comprehensively to the cleaners that I would have a pension for life. Even if they went against me and forced a gullible public to vote against me, which is quite impossible, at least I would be able to retire in some comfort thanks to their injudicious words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this lively debate.  I applaud the Fine Gael Party for tabling this motion.  Press freedom has been a topical issue since the death of Princess Diana in Paris and it is only appropriate that this is the case.</P>
      <P>Thankfully, the Irish press has behaved in a more responsible fashion than their British counterparts.  There has been some deterioration in the privacy afforded to public individuals in recent years but we have not reached the position which pertains in Britain.  However, I have been concerned that political coverage in the press has been excessively personality based rather than issue based.  This needs to be addressed by the media.  When one is talking about the defects in the economy it is prudent to look at the various sections of the economy which are outside pressure groups and have not benefited from the Celtic tiger.  We need to get the message across that there are major problems in both rural and urban areas and the media must highlight them.  This is why the personalisation of issues needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>For some sections of the media political coverage begins and ends with the day the day dogfight. To receive coverage in either House a Member has to make an outlandish remark which will attract the media's attention.  However, the large amount of work done at various Stages of Bills can go without receiving a line of media coverage.  The Irish newspaper industry has endeavoured to highlight the work of politicians to the public.  However, this needs to be looked at rather than just looking for rows and ruaille buaille which people and television cameras wish to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish political coverage is notable for its lack of analysis of political ideas.  I am not accusing all journalists and newspapers of this but these are the ideas which most politicians believe to be the meat and drink of their trade.  It is healthy to have a certain amount of tension between politicians and journalists.  However, some sections of the media believe that politicians are hostile to measures such as relaxing the laws on defamation and libel.  The Labour Party is not hostile to such measures.  Revisiting the libel laws was a central plank of our manifesto.  I applaud journalists who uncover misdeeds in politics and business and I have no regrets about the story which brought about the end of Deputy Lowry's ministerial <Col N="627" /> career.  Investigative journalists are important for political life.  Long may they continue and they should be given the opportunity to develop this area.</P>
    <P>The key question in any debate concerning the rights of individuals and the rights of the press to report is whether the issue is central to the public interest.  Does the public's right to know override the individual's right to privacy?  If it is an issue which affects the public figure's capacity to perform their public functions then the public has a right to know.  Otherwise the public does not have that right.  Neither does it always follow that because the public wants to know it has the right to know.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the distant past the press was excessively reluctant to publish stories concerning individuals and institutions.  To some extent that reluctance reflected the press culture and the overriding political and social norms of that age. No one could argue that it was healthy for a culture to fail to reveal the level of child abuse which was a feature of this country prior to the 1980s. However, neither am I sure that the recent trend of stories concerning TDs' brothers is healthy.</P>
    <P>The most interesting aspect of the report is its suggestion that we try to find a middle ground. It rejects the notion, current in the US, that just because someone is in the public eye they are fair game for any story.  The report supports the right of public figures to have lives outside the public domain and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I have applauded the Irish print media's record over the years compared with their British counterparts.  However, I am a little concerned by some developments in recent years.  Not a Sunday passes without a retraction or apology in one or more of the newspapers.  One Sunday newspaper recently printed three retractions in the one edition. Is retraction good enough?  An individual has the right to take a case against a newspaper but, in many cases, the damage has already been done.  An apology does not repair the damage which can be done to an individual or politician. There is an expectation that politicians should be able to take more of this type of reporting but I do not agree.</P>
    <P>The report acknowledges that the existing libel laws are too restrictive and prevent the publication of stories which any reasonable person would believe to be in the public interest.  It appears to be generally accepted that the burden of proof on journalists is excessive.  At the same time there are concerns about the privacy of public individuals.  We must move on both fronts to redefine simultaneously the public and private status of public figures in a fashion that would satisfy the legitimate concerns of both public figures and the journalists who report on them.  The more I read the Government's Action Plan for the Millenium the more I am disappointed. Today's issue is yet one more that does not merit a reference in the programme.  Much of the material is so vague as to be worthless and a <Col N="628" /> further considerable portion of it has been repudiated.  The Labour Party committed itself in its manifesto at the general election to reform the laws of libel.  If the Government refuses to act on this issue we will table a Private Members' Bill to address it.  Over the years politicians and various Ministers for Finance have received submissions on the rate of VAT on newspapers.  Zero rating is required.  That would be in the interest of our newspapers who have to compete with newspapers from other countries where there is zero rating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this discussion and I recognise that an independent press is a very important and fundamental part of our democratic process.  It is the conduit through which politicians and people in public office are held accountable by the people.  It is proper that we accept the healthy tension that sometimes exists in that regard.  The newspaper industry has served us well.  We have seen examples in our neighbouring island of standards not as high as one would wish.  Checks and balances are needed in newspapers and the other media just as they are needed in the political sphere.  While, in general, there has been balance and moderation this has not always been the case.  In recent times very sensitive leaks from the Department of Foreign Affairs were published.  The national interest must predominate and people who are involved in that sort of activity must be held accountable. The media must also be held accountable for aiding and abetting what surely amounts to a criminal offence.  This brings us to the area of regulation. There has been much talk of a self-regulatory system, a press council.  This could be advanced to the advantage of the industry as well as to public life.</P>
      <P>The media took a particular interest in the recent referendum.  Their opinion, influenced a significant number of people who opposed the amendment.  It struck me as incongruous that the political parties, who were almost <i>ad idem</i> on the question, did not succeed in conveying the message despite the fact that the matter was debated in this Chamber and elsewhere.  The media were quite right to pursue their agenda with regard to that topic as they are with regard to any other topic.  There is a need to differentiate between report and comment with regard to a particular issue.  The media have a great deal of power and that must always be administered in a prudent and fair-minded way.  While the laws on defamation may be reviewed I would hate to see the balance tilted toward reporting in the media rather than toward the protection of the individual's right to his character and integrity.  Papers are free to publish anything they wish to publish so long as it is justifiable comment and reporting and so long as they can stand over it.  The People have a right to their own character in a properly regulated democracy.  The review of the law on defamation must be progressed but with a great deal of caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> A cornerstone of all our commercial activities is fair competition.  I have some sympathy for the newspaper industry here which labours under the disadvantage of having VAT charged when its competitors have an advantage over it.  It would be important, however, that any changes made in the area of VAT would be of benefit to the consumer and not be added to the profits of the newspaper industry.  Sometimes changes in the taxation system result in this outcome so a review of the taxation of newspapers would need to be carefully watched.</P>
    <P>An element of mutual suspicion exists between politicians and the newspapers.  The transparency with which we must operate is absolutely correct. The media must have the right to comment but the comment must be fair and where the media go beyond the bounds of what is fair or proper then any individual, and this includes politicians, must have the right of redress.  This will maintain a proper balance.  The public interest must be weighed against the individual's interest.  and that often produces a subjective rather than an objective view.  It is for legislators to ensure that the balance is proper and fair to both parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who participated in the debate.  We have had a useful discussion on a matter which might not otherwise have been discussed.  I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive statement.  I tabled this motion to find out what was Government thinking on these issues.  The Minister answered questions in a straightforward manner when it was possible to do so and when the issues were complex, that complexity was highlighted and the current state of thinking given in a full and fair way. The Minister's speech was useful and will contribute to the ongoing debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>The issue of apologies was central in my contribution and my views may have been misinterpreted by some Senators.  I am making a very clear distinction between apologies for inadvertent and deliberate damage.  It may happen that, in the course of a busy evening in the newsroom, somebody gets a name or address wrong.  As a result, something may be printed or published about a person and that person may feel aggrieved and defamed where clearly that was not the intention.  A journalist may be inexperienced or may be working under pressure.  Many newspapers are reluctant to provide what an aggrieved person may want, namely, a speedy, clear and prominent apology in order that any damage which may have been done can be quickly undone and the record set straight.  As politicians, that is all we want at times rather than becoming involved in a long and cumbersome process.  Politics is a roughhouse in many ways and things are often said in the heat of debate. We should be able to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that ordinary people should be fairly treated.  Because of the way the law is currently structured, newspapers may feel they cannot offer an apology without admitting liability <Col N="630" /> and making themselves vulnerable to huge costs. I would like to test the good faith of the newspapers in this area.</P>
    <P>Senators Walsh, Norris and others spoke about self-regulation within the media.  I have come to the conclusion that self-regulation or policing would be almost impossible to achieve because the media are not uniform.  We have serious and honourable journalists and newspapers but we also have the grosser elements of the industry which were outlined by Senator Norris.  I am familiar with the examples he gave and they are truly horrific.  We have all seen the British tabloids and we are justified in trying to prevent the same thing happening here.  Reforms may help serious newspapers but those reforms are likely to make life even easier for the sort of media described by Senators Norris, Walsh and others.  The fact is that, on the issue of self-regulation, the media want to face in both directions at once.</P>
    <P>Many serious journalists believe there is a conspiracy on the part of politicians to prevent them having access to information.  Last year we enacted an elaborate Freedom of Information Act and all current legislation attempts to make matters as open as possible.  Politicians are not intent on protecting themselves as most of us have very few secrets anyway, but we see the excesses of the British media and some media in this country and it frightens us.  The newspaper industry must get its act together and there is no sign of that happening.  Newspapers are often prepared to take the risk of libel to get a juicy story or headline which may be grossly untrue.  They are often willing to take their chances in court and, even if it costs them £100,000, £200,000 or £300,000, it will be deemed to be worthwhile in terms of boosting circulation.</P>
    <P>The media pressurise us to be open but they should examine their own conscience on these matters.  I suspect from the Minister's reply that we will not be seeing a great deal of progress in these areas until the media manages to make a better case.  I thank all those who participated in the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the Minister has agreed to take this matter.  He will be aware of some of the material contained in my brief because the Irish Georgian Society has been in touch with him.  I hope he will show his usual forbearance if I repeat some of this material, but I will provide him with an opportunity to reply in public.</P>
      <P>I speak with particular passion about Carton House.  It is appropriate that we should be especially sensitive to it as we approach the bicentenary of 1798 because it was the home of Lord Edward Fitzgerald and the State has made no real provision for marking the 200th anniversary of the death of that great patriot.  It would be appropriate that the State should take a particularly sensitive view of this matter in the light of that particular piece of political and historical, as well as architectural, heritage.</P>
      <P>It is important that Carton House be seen in its context.  Architecturally, it is the most significant house in this country.  There is no question or doubt about that.  It survives uniquely with its demesne intact.  There is an 18th century parkland deliberately landscaped with water courses and diverted rivers, all part of the coherent, artistic and ascetic composition.  The State should be extremely reluctant to upset this particular form of ascetic balance which exists uniquely in Carton House.</P>
      <P>One should bear in mind what has happened at Marino with the casino, which is another of Europe's great architectural gems.  It is an almost perfect architectural jewel, but a jewel shines best in its correct setting and at Marino we have the unpleasant intrusion of irrelevant housing which need not have been put there.</P>
      <P>Kenure Park, Rush, County Dublin, the home of the late Colonel Frederick Palmer, one of the most stunning houses in Ireland, has been completely demolished.  All that is left is the portico facade, which is dangerous and may be demolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carton House is unique.  It should not be just left to commercial exploitation by any international group in the interests of attracting niche market tourism.  I know the Minister's brief is tourism and of course this is what he must concentrate on.  He is a man of talent and energy.  I know of the wonderful work that people in Bord Fáilte, such as Mr. Matt McNulty, have done in rescuing the Dublin Writers' Museum, Parnell Square, Dublin, and Newbridge House, Donabate, County Dublin.  That is the kind of thing we must envisage for Carton House because it extends beyond tourism &mdash; I should not be dismissive <Col N="632" /> of tourism &mdash; into the area of architectural and cultural heritage.  If we spoil Carton House, we are less likely to attract tourists.  We must think in terms of a long-term product, not just a short term gain to the Sheraton Hotel Group, which I understand is subject to a takeover bid in the US &mdash; the future plans may, in fact, be all up in the air.</P>
    <P>It would be regrettable if we were to collaborate in the acquiring of £6 million of EU funding which would be used by a commercial operation to significantly damage the environment.  I am afraid that this is what might happen because the plans for Carton House are unpleasantly familiar. It is a little like what happened in Castletown House, that other great house which was rescued by the Honourable Desmond Guinness and his wife, Riga, 30 or 35 years ago.  Before they were able to save the whole place, parcels of land had been sold off and there is now this quite anomalous housing development all the way up the avenue.  The permission was granted in 1992 by Kildare County Council after some degree of wrangling.  We have moved on since then. Governments have moved on.  They are much more sensitive now.  I do not believe planning would have been granted now, but the permission which exists is for nine new crossings over the Rye Water and the serpentine sheet of water interrupting this carefully constructed landscape, 29 conference units which could be converted into houses, 119 golf villas &mdash; I ask the House to imagine how they would fit in to the composition of an 18th century great house and demesne &mdash; 40 demesne residences, 48 staff accommodation units, three golf courses and a 201 bedroom hotel stuck onto the main house &mdash; what is that going to do for the compositional balance of that house?  This is all in the light of a report which was undertaken on the royal golf club at St. Andrew's in Britain which is for rich people, but the market has changed since then, particularly in Ireland which is a more democratic country. What the public seem to want is pay-as-you-play golf and we should not spoil our heritage just for the rich niche market.  There are to be maintenance buildings, an indoor riding school, equestrian centre and car park, conference and executive facilities and a country club.  The permission was given on the old grounds that jobs would be created and secured in the tourism industry but what is the point in destroying one amenity in order to create another?</P>
    <P>The strongly held view of the Irish Georgian Society and the Honourable Desmond Guinness, who advised me, is that this money should be secured and used by the State to acquire Carton House as a heritage item for the State rather than for this commercial exploitation which will destroy it.</P>
    <P>I remember visiting the city of Jerash, Jordan, which does not have all these facilities.  They have carefully controlled, maintained and preserved the great Roman city of Jerash, not because they like it or have any feeling of sympathy for this <Col N="633" /> particular form of architecture or culture but because they know that, preserved in its purity, it will bring tourists to that country.  If Carton House is left more or less as it is and develops sensitively, it is capable of bringing tourists to this country.</P>
    <P>Carton Demesne has been recognised by the International Council of Monuments and Sites, or ICOMOS.  The current development will essentially alter the demesne landscape and irreversibly change the house and its heritage value.  Since the original permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála the appreciation of the value of our built heritage has greatly changed.  Previous Governments have proposed and participated in numerous activities relating to the protection and preservation of our built heritage, ranging from participation in conferences like &ldquo;The Future of the Country House&rdquo; to the production of important documents like the series of conservation guidelines produced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and two recent reports on &ldquo;Developing a Government Policy on Architecture&rdquo; and &ldquo;Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The greatest fear of those concerned with this area is the possible inability of the local authority adequately to monitor and police those requirements sewn into the planning permission and to secure compliance with the conditions attached to the granting of permission by An Bord Pleanála. One only has to look at similar developments such as Powerscourt, County Wicklow, where compliance with the original permission was not adhered to.  The Georgian Society has expressed its concern about a number of the conditions attached to An Bord Pleanála's decision.  The validity of section 38 agreements, mentioned in the fourth condition, has not been adequately legally tried, therefore the validity of securing their stated objective is unsure.</P>
    <P>The sixth condition relates to the phasing of the development but in other cases it is clear there have been breaches of phasing plans.  Many local authorities are unwilling to enforce conditions attached to planning permission, either due to the lack of adequate staffing or finances within the authority to ensure proper policing of planning permissions or from the fear of possible legal action due to the lack of either legal precedent or clarity in the existing legislation.  The 11th condition of An Bord Pleanála's decision requires the submission of a construction procedures plan.</P>
    <P>The Georgian Society has communicated its concern that the local authority may not have sufficient suitably qualified personnel adequately to assess the important nature of the proposed conservation works due to the scale of the development, which would probably require a full-time effort to ensure that the works would be carried out correctly and in accordance with the permission. Would it not be better to recommend that this plan be submitted either to the conservation <Col N="634" /> advisory panel of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Heritage Council, or the heritage service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands?  The society is aware that a cost benefit analysis for the proposed development has been requested but it is extremely sceptical about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been to Carton House and I am sure he will agree it is remarkable.  It is regarded as the most important of such houses on this island and this importance relies not just on its unique architectural beauty but on its setting. If a large modern Sheraton hotel is jammed onto one part of the house and several hundred golf chalets and nine bridges are built, the demesne will look like a Monopoly board.  We will have destroyed the aesthetic integrity of the house and this cannot subsequently be recovered.  What I am suggesting may be awkward for the Minister but we should be careful before doing irreparable damage.  We should take the courageous step of bringing this wonderful house into public ownership on behalf of the people, making it available to them in consultation with the architectural archive, the Georgian Society and An Taisce, so that generations of Irish people may continue to enjoy its beauty.  Bearing in mind that we are close to the bicentenary of the death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, does the Minister not agree that this would be a fitting memorial to that remarkable patriot?</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Norris for giving me the opportunity to address this historic House for the first time and for enabling me to reply to this Adjournment.  I am fully aware of the Senator's deep interest in our architectural heritage and I trust that the explanation I give will be satisfactory.  I doubt it will meet all his concerns but we will have to agree to disagree.</P>
      <P>The matter refers to an application for EU assistance under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999, towards the development cost of a major tourism project at Carton, Maynooth. The programme, which was agreed between the Irish Government and the European Commission in 1993, specifically identifies the small scale of many of our tourism enterprises and the relative absence from Ireland of the more prominent international players in the industry. Accordingly it provides for EU assistance towards the development of a limited number of larger scale national projects.  The intention is that such projects will serve to add a new product dimension to the Irish tourism sector while remaining consistent with the nature and character of the Irish tourism product.  They are also expected to be capable of generating extra tourism business for Ireland by virtue of their presence here, as well as contributing to the further extension of our tourism season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions on grant applications under the programme are made by autonomous management boards which include not only the State sector but <Col N="635" /> also independent professionals.  For projects such as that proposed for Carton, costing in excess of 15 million ECUs, the agreement of the Government and the European Commission is also required on foot of a cost/benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law.  The application is currently going through this process and the Government has recently decided to forward the management board's decision on the application to the European Commission for its agreement to proceed.  The matter is being considered at present in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Carton House development involves the provision of an international destination resort at the Carton Demesne, County Kildare.  Its overall aim is to create Ireland's foremost luxury resort with global recognition.  The Carton House project will be owned, developed and operated by Carton Sheraton Limited, an Irish company 75 per cent owned by ITT Sheraton.  The estimated total cost of the project is £52 million.  It is expected to generate more than 300 direct jobs, over 150 indirect jobs and some 1,220 man years spent on construction.</P>
    <P>As the Senator said, when completed Carton House will be the 50th resort contained in the ITT Sheraton luxury collection and will involve the following developments: a five star 140 bed hotel, including 12 suites; 76 residential conference lodges in 13 units; conference and executive meeting facilities; a Gleneagles golf and country club comprising two 18 hole championship golf courses and a spa leisure centre; a boathouse adapted as a bar facility and shell cottage used as a bar/dining facility; a car park and a new entrance on Dunboyne Road.  Most importantly, the project will result in an extension of public access to the historic building at the demesne beyond what has been traditionally available.</P>
    <P>Full planning permission for the development has been granted following the completion of a comprehensive environmental impact assessment. The project will ensure the restoration of the existing Carton House to produce world class facilities while preserving the culture and heritage of the demesne.  It will provide for maintenance of the historic landscape, formal vistas and visual interrelationships which contribute to the character of the demesne, and of the profile of the existing woodlands.</P>
    <P>The design concept embodies a number of principles to ensure that new developments are in sympathy with the planning principles and architectural expressions of the existing house. These principles will also ensure that the development is accommodated in such a manner as to maintain the visual primacy and the dominance of the house, its relationship with its associated outbuildings and park land and to deflect the pressures of the new development away from sensitive interiors.  Internally, sensitive or vulnerable visual elements or interiors of architectural significance are to be protected as a design priority.</P>
    <P>The key point to be borne in mind in relation <Col N="636" /> to the heritage preservation aspects of this project is that the proposal to provide European Regional Development Fund grant assistance does not override the original stringent planning permission requirement.  I passed on specific concerns expressed to me by the Irish Georgian Society and An Taisce about underlining the importance of the heritage dimension of this project to the director general of Bord Fáilte, who was directly involved in the assessment of this project.  He subsequently informed me that he would be glad to meet with concerned groups and take them through these aspects of the project and the steps being taken to address them.  Furthermore, although the granting of that permission is a matter for the relevant planning authorities, the independent management board for product development in Bord Fáilte in assessing this project retained independent architectural advice in relation to the heritage dimension.</P>
    <P>The question of State acquisition of Carton House and the demesne was considered in the mid-1980s but was ruled out on the grounds of the major Exchequer funding which would be required to acquire, refurbish and maintain the house and the estate in the absence of a definable use for it.  To paraphrase Tennyson, author of the other Ulysses, the proposed development will ensure that Carton House is not &ldquo;.left to rust unburnished, but to shine in its use&rdquo;.  Cynics might say that the Duke of Leinster's country house, Carton House, has been put to better use than his town house.</P>

      <P>If I was remiss in welcoming the Minister to the House I do so now.  I am glad to see him here.  I wish the Hilton Hotel in Dublin had gone ahead rather than the Sheraton hotel at Carton House.  I am concerned when I hear phrases such as &ldquo;in sympathy with the architectural fabric&rdquo;.  I have heard it so many times and it is almost always rubbish.  It invariably means something which clashes with what exists already. The Minister indicated that the director general of Bord Fáilte will meet with concerned groups and &ldquo;. take them through . the steps taken .&rdquo; but that does not sound like listening to them.  Perhaps the Minister would consider, with the director general of Bord Fáilte, meeting with the groups to see if an accommodation can be reached.  It would be most desirable if we can collaborate on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I wish to raise on the Adjournment the need to ensure that people on community employment schemes get their full entitlement to secondary benefits and have those benefits for the duration of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serious anomaly has come to my attention with regard to this matter.  It seems that the officials in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are being devilishly clever in <Col N="637" /> the operation of the community employment scheme.  In the 1996 budget the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, extended medical card benefits to all who had been unemployed for a period of 12 months for a period of three years on taking up employment.  Anybody on the live register was entitled to hold on to their medical card and that applied to people coming on FÁS community employment schemes.  It was a welcome development in terms of encouraging people to come from the ranks of the long-term unemployed into the workforce.  Many people availed of it, particularly lone parents.</P>
    <P>However, it transpires that there is an interpretation of the provision whereby anybody who was on a scheme at the time of its introduction, when the social employment schemes only extended for two years, should not now be considered for medical cards for the third year because they were contracted into a two year scheme.  This is a mean and petty interpretation of the budgetary provision.  It was meant to extend the community employment schemes to three years and that the benefits would extend to cover its duration.  I do not know who is responsible for this bureaucratic interpretation which will bring about minimal savings.</P>
    <P>The promotional material put abroad by FÁS is contrary to the Department's interpretation. People on schemes have been told by the supervisors that for the three years of the scheme they are entitled to the medical card.  The Department's interpretation means that people who might be anxious to take the third year will have to forego it because of the importance of the medical card to families with young children.  This interpretation is counterproductive and I cannot understand why the Department has gone back on what appeared at the time to be a straightforward commitment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other secondary benefits, including supplementary welfare allowance, rent allowance, back to school clothing allowance, footwear and fuel allowances, they apply for the duration of the scheme regardless of whether it is for one, two or three years.  However, because they are means tested they effectively rule out any head of a household involved in a community employment scheme.  Effectively, the medical card and the other secondary benefits are lost and this discourages people from continuing on the schemes.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has indicated that it has established an independent review body to look into the effects of secondary benefits on the labour market and people coming on to it.  The operation of the scheme at present is a disincentive to people coming from the live register on to the labour market.  It is a petty interpretation of the rules which will save very little money because it only covers about a year.  There are large numbers of long-term unemployed and it has proved one of the most stubborn categories to tackle. Even with a booming economy the numbers of <Col N="638" /> long-term unemployed are being reduced at a dismally slow rate.</P>
    <P>The matter should be clarified with a positive interpretation as intended in January 1996 when the budgetary provision extended the secondary benefits, particularly the medical card, to the participants of community employment schemes and that all participants on the live register for 12 months could have benefits for three years so that they might get established in employment and develop a future for themselves and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Family and Community Affairs, that secondary benefits operated by his Department such as supplementary welfare allowance, rent supplements and back to school clothing and footwear allowance continue to be payable to people on community employment schemes regardless of the duration of the scheme provided the income of the person is no more than £250 per week.  However, a maximum of £250 per month is payable in either rent supplement or mortgage interest supplement in such cases.</P>
      <P>I understand that one of the main points at issue is the retention of the medical card by people on community employment schemes.  The medical card is not a secondary benefit as the phrase is understood in social welfare terms.  The medical card scheme derives from a distinct legal framework.  Its administration is carried out separately from the social welfare system and its sole criteria for eligibility is one of hardship.</P>
      <P>The 1996 budget made provision whereby persons who had been unemployed for at least one year could retain their medical cards for a period of three years after entering employment.  The budget provision covers medical card holders who have been unemployed for at least one year, i.e., persons on the live register who take up paid insurable employment.  These persons are deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical card for a period of three years.  The measure is effective from the date of the 1996 budget, namely, 23 January 1996.  The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long term unemployed including community employment.</P>
      <P>Arrangements which were in place prior to 23 January 1996 provided for persons who held medical cards while on the live register to retain the medical card for a period of two years after securing a placement on any of the schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed.  Since these persons were already on schemes prior to the budget of January 1996, they are not covered by the budget provisions allowing for the retention of a medical card for three years.  However, after the expiry of the two year period of their entitlement such persons have their community employment income disregarded when their eligibility for a medical card is being assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> The Department of Health and Children and the health board chief executive officers who have statutory responsibility for administration of the medical card scheme have shown considerable flexibility in the implementation of the 1996 budget provision relating to the long-term unemployed. Shortly after the provision was announced, they agreed at the request of FÁS, to extend the entitlement to participants in the three new schemes, namely, Jobstart, Workplace and Job Initiative, for some of which the qualifying period of unemployment was less than 12 months. In addition, the chief executive officers are implementing the provision in the 1997 budget which permits people who take up temporary employment to have the option of having their income assessed on an annual basis, that is, based on 52 times the weekly income guideline for entitlement to a medical card.</P>
    <P>Aside from these provisions which relate to the unemployed, the chief executive officers annually revise, in line with changes in the consumer price index, the income guidelines which are applied in the assessment of applicants for medical cards in general.  These guidelines have no statutory effect &mdash; they are only guidelines &mdash; and a medical card may be awarded to a person whose income exceeds the relevant guidelines, if in the opinion of the chief executive officer, undue hardship would otherwise result.  Similarly, a medical card <Col N="640" /> may be awarded to an individual in a family even when the family itself would not qualify for the card.</P>
    <P>In addition, the following income sources are not taken into account in assessing the applicant's income: back to work allowance, blind welfare allowance, carer's allowance, child benefit, Department of Defence service pensions 1916-21, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement, foster care allowance, mobility allowance, supplementary welfare allowance and weekly payments under the community employment scheme programme.</P>
    <P>The Government programme has set as a priority a review of the eligibility of medical cards for the elderly and large families.  The Department of Health and Children is currently progressing this matter with health board chief executive officers.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs has commissioned an independent review of secondary and other benefits such as the medical card in relation to their effect on labour market participation. This review will examine, <i>inter alia,</i> any anomalies in the operation of the provisions relating to retention of medical cards by persons participating in community employment schemes.</P>
