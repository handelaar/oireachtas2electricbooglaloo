      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to honour the existing agreement in which school transport is provided for post primary pupils from Dysart, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the extension to Illistrin national school, Letterkenny, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's business will be items Nos. 1 and 2.  Item No. 1 will be taken until 4.30 p.m.  Is 30 minutes per speaker sufficient or do colleagues with a great deal to say on the matter require more time?  Thirty minutes is agreeable to Senator Ormonde and myself.</P>

      <P>Has it been put on the shelf? Letters concerning the urgency of getting the Bill passed are pouring into my office.  The Leader probably gets the same letters himself.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for a debate on agriculture.  Irish agriculture could fall between two stools, given its current state, with bad reports, EU agreements with countries outside the EU, etc.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a debate on fishing &mdash; my hobby horse.  This does not arise simply because of the accident in Cork but we need to clarify the matter, have it aired properly and put new safety regulations in motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we have been given 30 minutes to speak on the Universities Bill, but I wish the Committee on Procedures and Privileges would look again at the matter of allowing people to share time in the first speaking slot.  It is a good idea and I have never understood why it was ruled out.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make provision for a debate on the Middle East?  It is important that we have one, particularly in view of developments there. The Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, seems bent on creating as many difficulties for the peace process as possible.  This debate should also include an opportunity to deal with a matter that continually resurfaces.  Last night's headline in the <i>Evening Herald</i> read &ldquo;Fury as Israeli general says Irish back terrorists&rdquo;.  This referred to a statement made by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Barrett, who was not at the meeting with the Israeli general.  A similar statement was made previously by a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs who, also, was not present at the meeting with Brigadier General Tzur.  I was and a completely wrong slant is being given.  This type of sensationalised reporting will only ensure when we travel abroad for sensitive meetings with military personnel, we will simply not have a useful exchange of views, which is the purpose of such meetings.  I regret it and would welcome an opportunity for the record to be set straight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted Senator Magner's assurance that we will back after Easter, but in what incarnation will we back?  Does he expect to be in the same position as he is at present?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when the Credit Union Bill, 1996, will be taken?  When do we propose to rise for Easter?  On item 2, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Bill, 1996, is it proposed to take all Stages today?  I noted on the Order Paper that only Report Stage is listed.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald's call for a debate on agriculture, which we have asked for almost weekly since Christmas, particularly in view of the changes taking place in the green currency and the consequences it will have for the industry. It appears cereal growers and milk producers will suffer in order to pay compensation to beef producers. I have no objection to compensation being paid to beef producers but we appear to be robbing one sector to meet the needs of another, which is not desirable.  That is another reason this matter should be debated.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when it is proposed to debate the hepatitis C tribunal report?  Will he clarify this morning's reports indicating that the Government is prepared to pay additional special damages?  Is that exemplary and aggravated damages or is it something different?  If it is something different, it would not be good.  We would welcome, however belatedly, exemplary and aggravated damages.</P>

      <P>All I know is that after the general election most of my colleagues will be in the other House.  The only difficulty I will have will be getting used to many new faces on this side.  I wish to support the employees of Dunnes Stores which threatens to open on Easter Sunday.  This has gone beyond a joke.  Employees are press-ganged into working St. Stephen's Day, up to midnight on Christmas Eve and on St. Patrick's Day.  Such employees comprise the most vulnerable sector of our society.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald has spoken on many occasions about Sunday being a family day and one to attend matches and so on.  I have no objection in principle to Sunday trading in a controlled way.  However, I resent the fact these people are forced to work in shops on public holidays.  The same level of cash is in circulation and takings are not improved.  Threats that Tesco will do this is no excuse.  Dunnes Stores has a lousy record with employees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Leader will be aware the Refugee Bill has been passed.  The Minister intimated at the time she was in a hurry to pass this legislation.  Will this Dáil bring the Bill into law? Will the Leader clarify the position as regards the prisons authority and the legislation promised by the Taoiseach last December?  We should be told whether this legislation will be introduced before this Dáil is dissolved.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement on the recruitment of 1,000 extra gardaí.  However, the number of gardaí is still short of the 12,000 my party believes necessary.  It is important to mention that gardaí intend to march to the Dáil on 16 April.  I understand their frustration and it is essential we support them when appropriate.  I am afraid the Government is heading straight for confrontation with gardaí over pay.  If that is the case, this matter should be discussed by the House.  If gardaí converge on the House on 16 April, what will happen to law and order in the city?  Has the Government put its mind to resolving this issue? This is a serious situation and the Minister for Justice should come to the House as soon as possible to say if a head to head confrontation with the gardaí is imminent and to outline her policing proposals on the day gardaí descend on Leinster House.</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions we have raised the question of notification by the Minister for Education of the commencement of new primary schools, in particular.  We had a long debate on underfunding of primary education and a resolution was unanimously passed by the House in that regard.  The situation in our primary schools, in particular, is still unsatisfactory and many are in a dilapidated and run down condition.  Last week young people from Ennis protested outside the gates of the House about the fact that up to 200 young students are accommodated in prefabricated and dangerous buildings.</P>

      <P>A question to the Leader. This matter might be more appropriate to the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is inaction in the Department of Education in relation to investment in primary education.  Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister for Education if she proposes to release <Col N="981" /> further projects to tender in the coming months? Yesterday nearly all the matters Members endeavoured to raise on the Adjournment related to problems in the education area.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education indicated some time ago that she had a procedure for placing schools on a priority list for remedial action, new buildings, extensions, etc.  She seems to be departing from the list and picking and choosing particular projects to go ahead to the detriment of others.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled a motion on the Adjournment on several occasions and other Members tabled similar motions.  It is a fundamental issue with which the Minister must get to grips.  I am alarmed that schools such as Tulla and Kilkee national schools in my area, which were included in the 1994 capital list of projects to proceed, are still on the list.</P>
      <P>Secondary schools which have been on the list for two or three years have been passed out by projects which were not on the list.  The Minister, despite assurances given in the House that she would set down clear procedures on how these project would be to dealt with on a priority basis, seems to be picking and choosing projects to proceed to the detriment of ones which have been on the list for years.  The Minister will not give us a clear indication of her priorities or how the matter is being dealt with.  Parents are angry and frustrated and children are being accommodated in dilapidated and inferior conditions.</P>

I have asked the Leader about this issue and I am not <Col N="982" /> the only one.  Senator O'Toole had a comprehensive motion on the lack of financing for primary education, the consequent frustration for teachers and parents and the danger for children as well.</P>

      <P>I raised the matter yesterday of the coming marching season in Northern Ireland. I welcome the decisions taken yesterday by the Orange Order in Dromore and in the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast not to route their next march through the Lower Ormeau area.  It was a wise, courageous and welcome decision by members of the Order in Dromore and in the Lower Ormeau Road and I congratulate them for it.</P>
      <P>A report by Paul Reynolds on the 6 p.m. and the 9 p.m. news yesterday on the drug situation in Dublin was one of the most striking and chilling reports I have seen in a long time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>

      <P>Last week, a judge sentenced a person to three years and had to say he would review the sentence in July 1998 because he wanted to ensure the person was still in jail then.  Until we do something about the prison situation, I do not see much point in recruiting an extra 1,000 gardaí. Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Justice the necessity for more prison places?</P>

      <P>I must respond to Senator Daly.  I agree with him that schools are in a bad condition but they did not become so overnight.  Primary schools have suffered generations of neglect.  It is not the first time there has been a Labour Minister for Education and more money than ever has been spent on education by this Minister.</P>

I support Senators Mulcahy and Bohan and I ask the Leader for a short debate next week with the Minister for Justice.  The Department of Justice now seems to be acting in a reactionary manner.  It took two young people in Cork to lose their lives before the issue of gardaí using spikes arose.</P>

      <P>If I may make my point, I will ask the question.  I am concerned about this.  We were told in this morning's newspapers that the provision of an extra 1,000 gardaí was rushed onto the Cabinet agenda.  Can we have a debate next week with the Minister for Justice when I hope she will agree to change the law on people being held in prison for non-payment of fines and debts so as to put behind bars people like Paul McDonagh, who is terrorising the people of Galway?</P>

The newspapers this morning reported that gardaí in Cork are saying it is pointless arresting joyriders because there is no place to put them.  I ask for a short debate next week with the Minister for Justice so as to hear some response from her to the specific issues of a number of habitual criminals who are at liberty and about whom nothing can be done.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the exchanges on law and order and it is right and proper that a House such as this should debate this topic in a civilised manner.  As someone from the North, I ask Senators and Deputies to remember that they live in a country where the police force has the support of the population. They should enjoy that luxury.  Some months ago I was distressed on entering the Border at seeing a huge poster from one side of the House which sought to use law and order as a political issue.  I appeal to it now to consider and reflect on the good fortune of living in a country where the police have the full support of both sides of the political divide.  I implore it not to endanger that by bringing it into an election campaign.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzgerald asked about the Merchant Shipping Bill.  I thank him for his co-operation as it is an important Bill and we will complete the remaining Stages when we return after Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will rise next Wednesday and will return on Wednesday, 9 April at 2.30 p.m.  There is a full programme of legislation planned for the following weeks.  I have asked the Minister about a debate on fishing and he will come before the <Col N="985" /> House for that.  We will also have a debate on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked for a debate on the Middle East and he put the record straight in an important way.  I have no plans in the immediate future for a debate, but I know there is interest and perhaps we can arrange for one.  Senator Dardis raised the credit union legislation.  It completed Second Stage in the Dáil last night and is now going to Committee Stage.  I spoke with the Minister last night and he indicated that he sees the passage of the Bill as a matter of urgency.  He hopes the legislation will be passed by the Dáil within a couple of weeks at which stage it will come before this House without delay.  It is proposed to complete the docklands legislation today.  The debate on hepatitis C will take place next Wednesday from 2 o'clock to 6 o'clock.  Further time will be made available if necessary.  I am sure the Minister will address the issue of damages in his contribution to the Dáil today.</P>
    <P>I share the sentiments expressed by Senator Magner regarding Dunnes Stores.  Senator Mulcahy raised the refugees legislation.  My understanding is that it is being implemented on a phased basis because there are new structures to be put in place.  Quite a portion of the legislation has already been implemented, but I will get a detailed statement for the Senator regarding it.</P>
    <P>I am astounded by the hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil Party on the question of prisons.  The biggest programme of prison building in the history of the State is taking place to make up for the years of neglect by Fianna Fáil Governments.  Senator McAughtry struck a salutary note when he said there are no simplistic answers to questions of law and order.  The Government has shown a resolution which few previous Government's have shown.  It has put resources at the disposal of the Minister and it ill behoves Fianna Fáil Senators to speak of the absence of prison spaces.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross raised the matter of time on the Universities Bill.  When I spoke to him yesterday he indicated that he needed an hour and a half for his contribution.  I thought he was joking, because I know Senator Ross is skilled at making his point in short, economical sentences which strike home.  Most Sundays he can say all that has to be said in 1,200 words.  For the moment there is agreement on half an hour per speaker, but if Senator Ross needs more time I am sure the Chair will facilitate him if the collected thoughts of Senator Ross have not been fully shared with the House in the half an hour.  Half an hour is adequate.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised at great length the matter of education.  The Minister heard his comments and I am sure she will respond in due course.  I agree with Senator Maloney about Paul Reynold's report on RTÉ yesterday.  It was a superb piece of journalism and it should be used as a deterrent in the programme against drugs. Senator Bohan raised the issue of prisons.  I compliment Senator Kelly on her spirited performance <Col N="986" /> and I endorse everything she said.  Senator Fahey called for a debate on crime.  There will not be a debate next week but the criminal law legislation will come before the House within two weeks of the House returning after Easter.  It will provide full scope for a long debate on the issues raised by the Senator.</P>

    <Title>Universities Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1995 I addressed this House on my proposals for university legislation.  Today, 16 months later, it gives me great pleasure to propose the Universities Bill, 1996, to the House. The importance and historic nature of the process we were then engaged in was fully appreciated by the House in the debate which then occurred and Senators will be aware that the debate extended from this House to the university community, the wider community and ultimately to Dáil Éireann, which passed the Bill after lengthy discussions.</P>
      <P>The debate around my proposals and later the legislation itself has had a considerable influence on the content of the Bill before the House.  That is as it should be.  Real dialogue and debate means responding constructively to genuine concerns and proposals put forward.  The Bill before the House gives effect to my central aims for university legislation in a manner which is broadly acceptable to the university community and the wider society.</P>
      <P>The three main strands of the Bill are: the restructuring of the National University of Ireland, provision of revised governance structures and provision of a framework for interaction between the universities and central government and for accountability to society generally.</P>
      <P>Legislating for the university sector calls for a particularly sensitive approach.  The traditions, ethos and legal basis of the institutions themselves vary greatly, with one dating from 1592 and others from as recently as 1989.  In addition, the balance between institutional autonomy and public accountability is a sensitive and delicate one. Yet a framework of legislation which would be more compatible with the role, function and operation of the universities in modern society was the objective from the beginning.  The Universities Bill which we are now debating achieves that objective in a balanced and reasonable set of provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in what has been called a knowledge society.  The possession, transmission and utilisation of knowledge in all its many forms is essential to the success and welfare of individuals, communities and society.  For centuries universities, at the apex of the formal education system, have had a significant influence on the socio-economic order of their times.  Their potential importance <Col N="987" /> and influence is now even greater.  Centuries ago the universities were the preserve of a small male elite.  Today, they are open to all on the basis of ability.</P>
    <P>An independent university sector is a guarantor of freedom in our democratic society. Through their teaching, research and constructive criticism, the staff in our universities contribute in a very vital way to maintaining a mature democratic society, a society confronted with increasingly complex social and political challenges.</P>
    <P>This Bill will underpin these vital academic and institutional freedoms and will facilitate the universities to continue to serve individual and social needs in the changed circumstances of contemporary and evolving society.  Discussion of the provisions of the Bill have brought into sharp focus the issue of the proper role for the State in respect of universities.  As institutions of higher learning and research, universities have rightly guarded their academic freedom and independence since their foundation.  The level of autonomy enjoyed by our universities has served the universities, the education system and the State well.</P>
    <P>Academic freedom lies at the heart of the concept of a university in this State.  The Universities Bill contains a strong endorsement of academic freedom and the full expression of that freedom by, and in, our universities.  Indeed, the Bill, in many respects gives pre-eminence to the principles of academic freedom.  Section 13(3) provides that where there is a doubt about the interpretation of a provision, an interpretation which will promote academic freedom is to be preferred to one which would not.</P>
    <P>The Bill also underpins institutional freedom, which is the capacity of the universities to conduct their affairs in a manner which they, as responsible institutions, consider to be in their best interests and in accordance with their ethos and traditions.  I believe that by underpinning these freedoms, the provisions of this Bill will enhance the capacity of the universities to serve the cause of scholarship and the pursuit of knowledge and, in so doing, will advance the welfare of our society.</P>
    <P>Autonomy and freedom cannot mean isolation. The Government, exercising its constitutional role as guardian of the common good, must have an interest in ensuring that there is a university system which operates to high standards, which is accessible to all who have the necessary intellectual capacity to make the experience worthwhile and which provides fields of study necessary for the national interest and for the full development of the individual.</P>
    <P>However, these concerns, as well as the large amount of public funding which is allocated to the universities, do not give the State an unfettered licence to become involved in the affairs of the university.  As I said in paragraph 22 of my position paper last November&rdquo; ... while the universities are institutions which are an important <Col N="988" /> concern for public policy, they cannot be regarded simply as instruments of that policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In pursuing its legitimate interests the State and its agents must be constantly alert that their involvement is measured and proportionate. They must ensure that the extent to which they become engaged in university affairs is sufficient only to ensure the continuance of a strong and vibrant university sector which supports the development of society, which is accountable to society for its activities and which operates in a manner consistent with the effective, efficient and transparent use of publicly provided resources.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the National University of Ireland in this Bill is a major milestone in the development of the university.  In the last century and the earlier part of this century there was a major educational and political debate which resulted, in 1908, in the setting up of a university which would reflect and promote the values and traditions of the majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The success of the NUI and the constituent colleges and their contribution to the progress of Irish society and education is widely recognised. My proposals mark another phase in the development of these institutions which have played such a major role in shaping our country and giving it its distinct identity.</P>
    <P>My proposals for the reconstitution of the NUI derive from proposals made by the senate of the university.  Each of the present constituent colleges will become universities, with all the powers and characteristics of universities.  These universities, successors to their respective constituent colleges, will be constituent universities of the National University.  In this way the reputation of the National University will be retained for the benefit of the reconstituted universities.  In addition, the retention of the NUI as an umbrella body will provide the constituent universities with a forum for co-ordinating their activities and overseeing the effectiveness of these newly independent institutions.</P>
    <P>The Bill also marks the coming of age of the recognised college of the NUI at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, by establishing it as a constituent university within the new structure of the National University of Ireland.  Although it is the newest university in the State, Maynooth will bring a long and distinguished history of academic achievement and distinction with it. This is directly attributable to the trustees of St. Patrick's College, to whose foresight and commitment I pay tribute.  I am sure that all Members of this House will join with me in wishing the new university continued success.</P>
    <P>An important objective of the provisions in the Bill is to place all universities on a common footing in respect of their relationship with central Government.  A situation has developed where the State has much stronger regulatory and controlling powers in regard to the newer universities, Dublin City University and the University of Limerick.  This situation has arisen due to the particular way in which these universities were formed, <Col N="989" /> starting life as National Institutes of Higher Education.  The legislation in 1989 was at the time intended as a temporary measure to bring the institutes into the university fold.  These universities have now sought to be placed on a statutory basis similar to the older universities.  I am glad to state that their impressive success and existing circumstances have convinced me that this should be so.</P>
    <P>Turning from some of the youngest of our universities to the oldest &mdash; Trinity College &mdash; which has for over 400 years provided a home in the heart of Dublin for distinguished academic endeavour and internationally renowned scholarship. The Universities Bill will ensure that its long tradition of independent academic achievement can continue and prosper.</P>
    <P>Trinity College is an integral part of our university sector.  As such, the objectives of this Bill are as relevant for it as for the other university institutions. Therefore, the provisions of the Bill will, in general, apply to the college.  However, in consultations with the college, and generally, I have been convinced of the desirability of retaining the legal position of the college, as far as practicable. The Universities Bill, therefore, will not of itself amend the charter of Trinity College.  Those provisions which would amend the charter will not immediately apply to the college and may not apply at all where a private Act, sponsored by the college, is enacted.  This Act would make the appropriate amendments to the charter in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Bill.  The board of the college support this approach.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline the provisions relating to the second objective of the Bill &mdash; the setting up of revised governance structures.  The principle underlying these provisions is that the major stakeholders in a university should, as of right, be represented on its governing authority. In this way the university can benefit from a range of experiences and perspectives, while stakeholders can be confident that the actions and decisions of the governing authority are taken in the knowledge of their needs and concerns.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out a flexible framework which will allow each university to devise governing authorities which best suit their interests.  That framework includes a meaningful presence on the governing authorities of the various stakeholders in the universities.  These include academic and non-academic staff and students, who, representing the university community, have the strongest presence.  This is the first time that all such groups of the university community will have a statutory right to democratic representation on university governing authorities.  The wider community is represented through nominees of relevant organisations and the Education Board, when established, while the State, as the major source of funding, is represented by nominees of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> The provisions of section 15 of the Bill also allow the universities to respond to their internal and external environment and reflect their unique traditions and values.  Provision is also made for representation from particular constituencies which have a special significance for individual universities, for graduates and for the cooption of members, especially members representative of artistic and cultural interests.  The provisions allow for flexibility, autonomy, democracy and broadening of representation and as such should greatly enhance the governance of the universities.</P>
    <P>The third objective of this Bill is the provision of a framework for interaction between the universities and central government and for accountability to society generally.  I outlined earlier the balance which I believe should operate between institutional autonomy and the needs of public policy and accountability and which should have due regard to the respective rights and responsibilities of the university institutions and the State. One of the principal objectives of this Bill is to provide reasonable and proportionate provisions which will facilitate the accountability of the universities to the communities they serve.</P>
    <P>The rationale for appropriate accountability derives fundamentally from the pervasive, integral and crucially important role of universities in contemporary society.  The need for new forms of accountability by universities to update and modernise existing practice in line with best practice is not unique to Ireland.  All over the developed world this complex question is being addressed.</P>
    <P>Accountability does not mean control and my approach to the accountability and transparency provisions in this Bill is informed by the view that external controls which require advance approval for detailed decisions of universities are not appropriate because of the importance of autonomy for universities.  The general approach of the Bill to accountability is that universities will have freedom to make operational decisions as they consider best, within a budget agreed with the Higher Education Authority.  To balance that, the Higher Education Authority will have a central role in ensuring that there is appropriate accountability to the wider community for the expenditure of public moneys.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority has a statutory function to co-ordinate State investment in higher education and to advise the Minister on general policy issues.  It has, therefore, developmental and funding roles.  While the funding role is provided for in some detail in the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, the developmental and support functions are expressed in a more general way.  This Bill redresses the balance by setting out a number of areas where the authority and the universities may work together in the interests of the university sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides certainty for all concerned and an opportunity to allow the universities and the Higher Education Authority to develop their partnership.  The Higher Education Authority <Col N="991" /> will now have a statutory requirement to assist the universities in achieving the objectives of Chapters IV, V and VIII of the Bill.  As part of its support and developmental role, the Higher Education Authority may also issue guidelines to universities on staffing and the distribution of budgets.  These guidelines will provide the Higher Education Authority and the universities with a formal opportunity for dialogue on important issues relating to the management of a university. They also allow the HEA, in a formal, statutory way and from their sector wide perspective, to inform a university of best practice nationally and internationally.  These guidelines will not be binding on a university which will retain autonomy to act as it considered best.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides a statutory framework for borrowing by universities.  The objectives in this regard are to provide a statutory underpinning of existing practices while at the same time ensuring that there are no additional unplanned calls on public finances as a result of activities by universities.</P>
    <P>In my speech to this House in November, 1995, I outlined how I wished to strike a balance between the requirements of institutional autonomy and public policy and accountability.  I believe that in these provisions the Bill achieves that balance.</P>
    <P>Turning to issues of quality in education, there is agreement in the university community on the need for quality assurance and for appropriate procedures for measuring and ensuring quality. The approach in this Bill places the primary responsibility on the universities for putting such procedures in place.  The procedures must include evaluation of all departments and faculties of the university not less than once every ten years.</P>
    <P>Evaluation will be by university staff in the first instance.  This will be enhanced by evaluation by people from outside the university, including people who are competent to make national and international comparisons on quality issues at university level.  In addition, there will be an assessment by those, including students, availing of the teaching, research and other services provided by the university.  The universities will implement the findings of evaluations where it is practical to do so.  The Higher Education Authority will have a review and reporting role.</P>
    <P>The role played by education in improving the life chances of its recipients is acknowledged the world over.  At one time the completion of primary education was regarded as a sufficient preparation for working life for many people.  That is no longer the case.  Technological advances generally and in information systems have removed from the workforce many of the opportunities for unskilled labour.  A third level education is now a prerequisite for many of the best paid and most secure employments.</P>
    <P>While education is acknowledged as improving life chances, lack of education is equally acknowledged as reinforcing disadvantage and marginalisation. <Col N="992" /> Because of their key role in society, universities have a very significant role to play in redressing the imbalances in our education system, particularly at third level, as a prerequisite to redressing inequality in society.  Universities are in a key position to improve the lot of the disadvantaged and many already have programmes in place.  Under the Bill all universities will now have a statutory duty to devise and implement appropriate equality policies.</P>
    <P>Each university will set out its policies on access and equality in its activities.  Universities shall implement the policies set out in their policy statement and the Higher Education Authority will review the implementation by the universities of these policies and may publish reports of any review.</P>
    <P>Tá sé an-tabhachtach dom go mbeidh sé mar chuspóir do gach ollscoil an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé seo a dhéanamh ag ollscoileanna éagsúla cheana féin, ach anois, beidh sé mar phríomhchuspóir acu uilig é seo a dhéanamh.  Níor cuireadh faoi bhráid an tSeanaid Bille ar bith a léirigh cuspóir mar seo do na hollscoileanna.  Tá mé sásta go bhfuil an Bille fiúntach agus éifeachtach faoi cheist na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>I consider the promotion of the Irish language by universities to be a worthwhile and necessary part of their mission.  The Bill imposes on the universities a statutory obligation to promote and preserve the Irish language.  This is the first time such a statutory requirement will be imposed on the universities generally and will I believe give a significant impetus to this important area of university activities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, in section 9, for the development of the university sector with the possibility for the establishment of future universities.  The provisions provide a careful balance between flexibility in the development of the university sector and safeguards for the quality and effectiveness of the sector.  This will benefit the development of the university sector in the future.</P>
    <P>In establishing an educational institution as a university it is essential that the process involves a rigorous and objective appraisal of any such proposal and the Bill provides for this.  Otherwise, the high reputation enjoyed by the universities as a whole could be damaged.  Of primary importance in such a process is the evaluation of the capacity of the educational institution to provide the kind and level of education appropriate to a university.  It is also essential that the new university would receive widespread recognition as a university, at home and abroad.  A further guarantee of quality and accountability is that the order establishing a university must be made by the Government and must be ratified by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it becomes effective. This will allow for an open and public discussion of the merits of the proposal before any action can be taken.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill will provide a mechanism by which an institution can attain university <Col N="993" /> status.  If, in the future, moving to university status enhances the mission of the Dublin Institute of Technology, I am pleased that section 9 of the Bill provides an appropriate mechanism.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is growing as a distinct and distinguished institution in its own right.  Building on its legislative base, put in place in 1993, it has made major strides with the active support of my Department.  I stress my commitment in my time as Minister to the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology. Staffing and student numbers in the Dublin Institute of Technology have increased substantially. Many new courses at certificate, diploma, degree and post-graduate level have been developed.  There is now recurrent funding of over £50 million in this academic year.  In addition, since 1993 over £18.5 million of capital funding has been invested.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Dublin Institute of Technology on the progress it has made since 1992 in building a single integrated institute.  The Dublin Institute of Technology has a vital role in higher education in providing qualifications at certificate, diploma and degree levels.  The successful completion of the review group process on degree awarding status is another step in the history of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I put in place the formal mechanism to evaluate the institute for degree awarding powers.  In line with the recommendations of the international review team, my announced intention to grant degree awarding powers from 1998 onwards is the next stage in the successful process of development of the institute.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am sure we all share a common objective.  We want to protect institutional autonomy and preserve academic freedom.  We also want to maintain an effective and accountable university system capable of delivering the highest academic standards and the highest standards of research and intellectual inquiry to its students and to society generally.  We are debating this Bill at a time when the excellence of our universities is widely recognised, nationally and internationally. Now is the time to build on that reputation and provide the university sector with a framework for development into the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to this Chamber to discuss an important Bill which has already come through the other House at such speed that when I read the original Bill and then looked at the new Bill, which only came into circulation the day before yesterday, I was amazed that there was no comparison between the two. This shocked me because all my homework indicated that we were now talking about a totally new Bill.  While I accept the Bill has three functions &mdash; that is, to reform and restructure universities, to revise the governance structure and provide for a framework for interaction between the universities, central Government and the broader community &mdash; nobody would dispute them and <Col N="994" /> all of us see that is how it should be.  No fewer than 315 amendments were tabled on Committee Stage in the Dáil, 125 from Fianna Fáil.  I have heard the Minister suggest that her self-criticisms do not really reflect on the Bill.  Instead, she would have us believe that they are a tribute to her ability to listen, consult and encourage debate.  Not only did the Minister refuse to personally and formally meet the university heads but as each of them was met by officials it was pointed out that the negotiations on the proposed Bill were confidential, each university head was being met as an individual and, consequently, neither the governing bodies of the universities nor, in the case of Trinity College, the Fellows were deemed by the Minister to be relevant to the discussions on the future of their colleges and universities.  When I read this and listened to the submissions by the university heads, it astounded me that this seemed to be the perception &mdash; maybe that was not the case but it was the perception. I wondered why there was such secrecy, that negotiations on the proposed Bill would have to be confidential and they could be met only as individuals and not as representatives of their colleges.</P>

      <P>We talk about transparency but this was a clear example of pulling the shutters down over the pane of glass.  The perception was that they were not listened to as university heads but as individuals.</P>
      <P>This also shows the Government's contempt for the role of the Seanad as a partner in the legislative process.  Despite the fact that this Bill is unrecognisable from the one published last July and it was rushed to this House in a very short time, there has been little time to assimilate the amendments, some of which I welcome as many of them were tabled by the Opposition.  It would have been much better had we had at least another week to think about them so that this Chamber would reflect on it in a knowledgeable and thoughtful way rather than rush through it, as we had to do in the past day or so.</P>

      <P>There was very little time to look at the new Bill and that is the truth.  Whatever we do, it is important that all the legislation coming through the House is well thought out so that the future of universities and third level education is worked out in a way with which everybody would be happy.  That is not the case at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Areas of the Bill are not specific.  It should not intrude on existing legal and common rights or reduce the universities to a ministerial fiefdom or semi-State body.  As the Bill stands, the Trinity College charter will be reduced from &mdash; and I use this phrase advisedly &mdash; a world of academic freedom to the realisation of national, economic and <Col N="995" /> social development, to use the words of section 12, a section in which the Minister curiously ignored Fianna Fáil's attempt to include reference to the concept of academic freedom.</P>
    <P>I need not remind this House that the universities do not shirk a wider role in the development of modern Ireland.  However, no Government should expect them to do this at the expense of their freedom of movement or expression.  The Minister may say she does not want to circumscribe the universities in this way.  To this I say that the concept of academic freedom and respect for the cultural diversity of each of the universities must be specifically mentioned in the Bill.  As I mentioned, the Minister rejected the arguments on these points in the Dáil.  I appeal to her to include the concept of academic freedom in the Bill and, by extension, to formally recognise the individual ethos of each university.</P>
    <P>Senators know that Fianna Fáil has unsuccessfully argued these points in the Dáil.  On a number of other points we were more successful and the Bill is the better for it.  However, there are still a number of proposals which we consider to be unacceptable.  First, it provides for unacceptable powers for the suspension of a governing authority.  As stated in a submission from one of our universities, which was made after Committee Stage in the Dáil:</P>
    <P>The relevant section is absolutely unacceptable in that it proposes a fundamental change in the nature of the relationship between the State and the university by establishing a nominative process for the breaching by the Government of the critical space between them and thereby directly threatening the intellectually independent voice for which society looks to the university.</P>
    <P>Second, the Bill provides for guidelines from the Higher Education Authority that could have the effect of curtailing a university's freedom of action.</P>
    <P>Third, it suggests that the designated powers of the visitation systems are limited in that they do not provide for any specified access by officers, employees and-or other staff of the university.  On the visitation section the submission stated:</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter would be that what is contemplated in this Bill is a procedure for the appointment of a government inspector akin to the appointment in recent times of an inspector in the case of a regional technical college. While avoiding the use of the term 'inspector', the proposal however to describe that inspector as a visitor and to stretch the historical role of the visitor to cover this radically new inspectorial function of prosecuting a claim by the Minister of illegal behaviour, does violence to that judicial role.</P>
    <P>I am not sure about the composition of the governing body.  Reading the old Bill, as I understood it the academic staff's representation would be <Col N="996" /> less than half what it was previously.  The representation from various bodies would reflect the kind of university it is.  I welcome the fact that our county council representation will still be maintained but the question is how many?  I refer in particular to the General Council of County Councils which has sent in a submission.  The wording in the Bill &ldquo;not less than two and not more than five&rdquo; is unclear.  I understand that this is a reduction in the General Council of County Councils' membership on UCD's governing authority. I hope there will be no change in that because we are talking about a big university that has a wide diversity of views in relation to the community, the number of people it represents and the diverse interests of the college.  I am anxious that the existing number will be retained in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the gender section and women's equality on the governing body. How many new women professors are there?  Will the Minister use her nominee inside or outside when it comes to dealing with gender balance?  It seems vague so perhaps the Minister will highlight that point in her reply.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House, we do not accept that the Minister should allocate to herself the power to suspend the university authority for stated reasons.  What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;stated reasons&rdquo;; it is a loaded term.  This kind of unspecified reasoning may explain why the Minister refused to accept our view of a university's mission statement.  We believe that the integrity of both the individual academic and the university at large are inextricably linked.  To intimidate the one is to intimidate the other and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>There is also an implication that the university is not doing its job properly.  I am a UCD graduate, as are many Members of the House, who can stand up and say that the university has served me well.  The implication is that the university has to be monitored and supervised and must be accountable to the public, yet it has always had good management practice in its internal workings. To suggest that State control is now called for is to stifle academic freedom.  I resent the idea that freedom of creativity, research and output will be taken from our university lecturers and professors.  It concerns me very much.  Compared to other universities UCD has surpassed itself over many years, long before we were Members of this Chamber.  The contribution of our university graduates, not alone to this country but to other parts of the world, stands on its own.  To suggest, by implication, that universities need monitoring and supervision to the extent that they may not be doing their job properly is stifling and I resent it.</P>
    <P>A similar kind of intimidation is implied in sections 48 and 49.  Here the universities are told that the Higher Education Authority &ldquo;may, following consultation with all or any of the chief officers, issue guidelines&rdquo;.  What is the point of this section?  Are the so called &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; meant to be advisory or are they meant to be <Col N="997" /> binding?  If they are meant to be advisory, why is the Minister including them in the Bill?  Given the role of the Higher Education Authority in higher education we all know there is no such thing as a guideline from the Higher Education Authority that, in effect, will not assume the role of a directive. It is difficult for any university head to ignore the HEA.  As such, these sections of the Bill constitute another example of the Minister's desire to continue a binding role by central Government.</P>
    <P>What must be central is the undoubted authority of a governing body to order its own affairs, although I recognise, in conformity with one of our amendments, that every university must be answerable for all public money that is spent. However, in this connection, the Oireachtas and Oireachtas committees are the appropriate reference.</P>
    <P>This Bill also downgrades the role of the Oireachtas.  Where new universities are to be created, for example, the Minister suggests that an order laid before the Oireachtas is enough, but in my opinion it is not.  The creation of a new university should be determined by an Act of the Oireachtas, not by ministerial order.  Oireachtas Éireann is the place to designate the present Dublin Institute of Technology as a university.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for the Minister to ignore Dublin Institute of Technology's case, especially as the report of the international review team suggested, on page 24, &ldquo;that the relevant authorities should consider whether the key features of the proposed legislation should be extended to the Dublin Institute of Technology and its legislation be amended in the light of such analysis&rdquo;. I ask the Minister to agree with this new designation and, if not, to spell out her objections.  I suspect she will not be able to do so because she is more concerned with designating our third level colleges and universities as semi-State companies. These companies should not be models for university institutions.  The model must be an integrated mission statement of what all our universities stand for.  I appeal to the Minister to specifically protect the concepts of academic freedom, as well as the ethos and diversity of our universities, which the Minister has refused to acknowledge in her stated understanding of a university's function.</P>
    <P>The Minister must ensure that existing rights, charters and conditions are recognised.  This Bill is a catalogue of ministerial intrusions in our third level colleges and universities.  As a result, we will oppose this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, ba mhaith, liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill and to criticise some of the functions of a university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The universities have done excellent work for the past 30 years.  They are involved in every type of research and are turning out quality graduates in every discipline.  Our graduates are sought after across the globe, but it is a source of regret that <Col N="998" /> we do not have adequate opportunities to allow many of them to use their skills here.  Our brightest and best tend to leave this country because of better opportunities and greater financial rewards abroad.  However, that is changing rapidly.  There are now more opportunities and better employment for third level graduates in this country.</P>
    <P>The colleges were content to fulfil a teaching role until the late 1960s.  Historians would point out that this acted as a brake on our economic and social development until the interests of the universities were broadened in the 1960s.  We inherited that ethos with the foundation of the State.  The social sciences, for example, were not part of the curriculum and social research was non-existent.  The college population grew from 10,000 to 50,000 during the 1960s.  This provided the colleges with resources which allowed them to be innovative and creative.  This has made a huge impact on all aspects of our development.</P>
    <P>The role of the universities has changed since the State was founded.  It is appropriate, therefore, that the framework within which they work should be examined and, if necessary, modified to suit the needs of modern Irish society.  We have debated this issue on numerous occasions.  This Bill is a culmination of previous Government Green Papers.  It is of the utmost importance that any changes in structure or governance should enhance and support the teaching and research activities of the colleges.  I am convinced that the changes proposed in this legislation will have that effect.  The inclusion of the community and other strands of opinion will not only enrich the governing authority, but will infiltrate and improve the system.</P>
    <P>This legislation is the product of long, arduous and sometimes acrimonious consultation and debate.  A number of position papers were sent to the universities for discussion.  The Minister responded positively to the debate in an effort to get the balance right between academic freedom, the need to introduce wider community interests on the governing bodies and the need to ensure accountability.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed to the governing authorities are appropriate.  It is necessary to represent the rights of lecturers, non-academic staff and students.  The colleges provide a service to society, so the composition of their governing bodies should reflect its various strands.  One could put forward an argument for the inclusion of a variety of other representatives on the governing authorities.  The Minister adopted a flexible approach to this issue during the consultations because she wanted here proposals accepted.  It would be good to include representatives from primary and post-primary teaching bodies and parents' associations, trade unions, chambers of commerce and other community interests on the governing authorities because the universities dominate the way the post-primary system operates.</P>
    <P>Since the 1960s pressure has been applied to post-primary schools and this has had a negative <Col N="999" /> impact on the way they operate.  We all know the points system used by the universities to gain entry to the faculties is based on the results of the leaving certificate.  The universities have created a post-primary system which is out of balance. The need to achieve high points in the leaving certificate is dictating the pace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We need more places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the solution either.</P>
      <P>The basic ideals of a good education have been perverted at post-primary level for the past 30 years.  Disciplines such as physical, social and moral education have been pushed to the periphery. The balance is wrong.  Post-primary education is incomplete and narrow in its focus as a result of this pressure.  It is elitist in so far as the pressure from parents and students to get results forces schools to put an inappropriate amount of their resources into that area.  Such pressure is thwarting the system's operation.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the legislation does not tackle this problem by setting out a modern framework for selection at university level.  We have discussed this issue on a number of occasions over the past decade but it was not referred to during the debate on this Bill in the other House.  Many people do not realise this has been happening and that it is doing terrible damage to the post-primary system.  Why is a modern society willing to allow it to continue? It underlines the absolute necessity of broadening the composition of governing authorities.  There is need for a change of attitude at that level.  I hope the new governing authorities will debate this issue and put forward a solution.  Who better than the cream of academia in Ireland to put forward solutions?</P>
      <P>The universities should strive to enhance the quality of post-primary education rather than to pervert it.  If asked, the universities would claim the enhancement of post-primary education is a priority.  It should be relatively simple to introduce a set of tests to be used with the leaving certificate to select university candidates.  I previously proposed the use of a vocational suitability test, an IQ test and a school certificate, which would give details of the programmes undertaken by the student in physical and social education.  Under such a system the leaving certificate could account for about 25 per cent of the total requirement.  That would remove a great deal of stress from students and facilitate the development of the student's personality in a better way.  The universities would not be given a huge workload under the changes I envisage because the IQ and vocational tests could be carried out by the second level schools.  As a result, the post-primary system could set about achieving its basic aims and objectives in a calm and less crowded manner.  In addition, the universities would secure better students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> I am sure the Minister continues to be amused by the hysterical response of the Opposition. Fianna Fáil has promised that if it is returned to Government it will repeal this legislation.  I wonder if the party will deliver on that promise.</P>

      <P>It might not have the opportunity because recent opinions polls appear to suggest it will not be elected to Government.  Even if it is, it will not do something foolish.  Words such as &ldquo;farcical&rdquo; were used during the debate in the Lower House.  Senator Ormonde's reaction was not too bad.  She said she was shocked about a few matters, but she went no further.  She was probably most shocked by the amount of consultation that took place.  &ldquo;Consultation&rdquo; is a bad word.  There was too much consultation.  Position papers were regularly put forward to the universities. They were able to discuss those papers and refer back to the Department for an exchange of views.  It was an ongoing process.  From Fianna Fáil's point of view, consultation is not a good thing.</P>

      <P>I was amused by Senator Ormonde's reference to the Minister's authority <Col N="1001" /> under the Bill to intervene if something strange happens in the university system.  The Senator believes the Minister should not have that power. She suggests that professors and lecturers will be operating in a state of chaos, wondering when the Minister will intervene.  On a previous occasion the Minister was obliged to introduce hasty legislation to give her the power to intervene in an educational institution.  This measure will not create the type of terror Senator Ormonde expects.</P>

      <P>The Opposition has been grasping at straws and trying to stoke up the natural worries of certain people.  After all, there are traditional power bases in the universities; certain people are members of the governing authorities and expect to continue as such.  Power bases are being attacked to some degree and many people believe their positions will be different in future.  There is a degree of fear because people like to maintain their power bases.  Broadening the membership of governing authorities will shift the power base&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, the more positive view is that appointing people from the non-professorial sector, such as lecturers, students and non-academic staff, is good and desirable.  In my view the Minister did not go far enough, but she had to try to achieve an objective and if she had gone further she probably would have had difficulty doing so.</P>

      <P>There was also a suggestion by the Opposition that the pay and conditions of staff would be reduced under this legislation.  That rumour gained strong currency.  That is farcical and it is not the intention of the Bill.  To suggest otherwise indicates that the debate is not going in the right direction.  Pay and conditions will not be reduced and most people involved in the universities agree that the rumour had no foundation.</P>
      <P>This legislation will enhance and support the work of the universities.  The governing authorities will facilitate the introduction of new ideas and will be a breath of fresh air at that level. Eventually the universities will discover that the authorities are more effective, will introduce new ideas from outside the university sector and will provide better understanding both within and outside the universities.  It has been accepted for years that there is a need for change.</P>
      <P>I hope we continue to have an interesting debate.  Senator Ormonde said she was worried that she did not have time to read or discuss the Bill.  It does not take a week to read and she should not make such a suggestion.  We will have further opportunity to examine all aspects of the Bill and establish if the concerns expressed about certain elements of it are well founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the enormous amount of work done by the Minister and her officials to get the Bill this far.  The consultation process has been incredible and has taken place over a number of years. This Bill will be good and sound when it is <Col N="1003" /> eventually passed and will support university life rather than detract from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Senator Cotter the Bill is not yet passed; we are still discussing it and is not beyond the bounds of possibility that it will be amended further.  As a matter of fact, it is inevitable that it will be.</P>
      <P>I am in a good position to speak on this Bill as I have a number of qualifications.  I am a graduate of the University of Dublin, Trinity College; I taught for almost 30 years; I was also a member of staff in the college and I am totally independent of any party affiliation.  I am not a member of the Opposition and if I choose to oppose the Bill it will not be for partisan party ideological reasons.  If I so choose, it will be because it needs to be opposed.  I have not yet made up my mind and that will depend, in some degree, on the Minister's response to the various amendments that will be tabled.  Some already have been tabled, and, for tactical reasons, I deliberately flagged a number of them earlier than normal to give the Minister and her advisers the courtesy of an opportunity to consider them and see if any or, all of them will be accepted.  Some will have to be accepted.</P>
      <P>This is a technical Bill but it is not well drafted. However, I do not want to embarrass the Minister or her officials.  It could not possibly have been well drafted.  The Minister presented a very unusual Bill, with over 100 Government amendments. That suggests the original conception was, to be charitable, hazy.  One can look at it two ways.  One can take the view, as did Senator Cotter, that this indicated an exhaustive and highly democratic process of consultation.  That argument is in some degree sustainable and I welcome the fact that the Minister had meetings with university Senators and others and made herself available to senior members of college administrations. However, it is also tenable to suggest that, because there are so many Government amendments, there was a lack of careful and precise thought in the overall conception of the Bill. For that reason one would suppose it might have been withdrawn.  The Minister may even consider the possibility at this stage.</P>
      <P>I tabled a number of drafting amendments.  For example, the Title of the Bill is cumbrous.  Is it a legal title in terms of the University of Dublin with its long and antique formulation about the college of &ldquo;the Sacred and Undivided Trinity&rdquo; of Queen Elizabeth near Dublin?  The phrase &ldquo;of Queen Elizabeth&rdquo; was omitted and that is a significant flaw in the Bill.  I assume that at least this technical amendment will be accepted by the Minister.  I would appreciate an indication from the Minister which amendments she is likely to accept.  I am concerned about the vagueness of the conception of the Bill, although in general terms I agree with a certain amount in the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> The vital element in the Bill is the guarantee of independence and autonomy of the university, even though the Exchequer has been required to make a contribution increasingly in recent years. One of my amendments looks at a remote possibility in the future.  University of Dublin, Trinity College, might decide to become independent and finance itself separately as the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has already done.  There is no provision for that eventuality in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to finance, I was astonished to hear Senator Cotter say this Bill would introduce accountability, as if it was for the first time.  I am sure the Minister, who on occasion has good relations with universities, would accept they have been responsible.  There is no evidence of peculation or of gross misuse of funds in any of our great universities.  Universities' accounts have always been made available to the public through the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Office.  I am surprised the Senator thinks this Bill introduces any notion of accountability because behind that suggestion is the notion that universities are irresponsible institutions that waste public money.  It is very easy and popular to float these ideas and to suggest there is a lack of accountability.</P>
    <P>It may well be popular but it is a very dangerous statement to make, particularly when one looks at the notion of academic freedom.  This notion involves the recognition that knowledge is good and that the pursuit of it in all its forms is a form of excellence and entails intellectual freedom. Therefore, if one attempts to put a public and fashionable price on, for example, where research and investigation in education should go, then one will automatically narrow the confines of that autonomy and independence.  I am very concerned about that.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned by the fact that, although the power of the Minister to dismiss the board of the university has been controlled, it is now being done by a type of remote control through a report of the visitor.  The Minister is skilful in concealing some of her moves in the Bill.  I do not consider it appropriate that the Minister for Education should have the capacity to remove the board of a university.  I cannot envisage any circumstances in which it is an appropriate right for a political figure to take unto his or herself.  I oppose that in all its forms.</P>
    <P>I was also interested to hear Senator Cotter support the notion of introducing outside elements on university boards.  There is an arguments to be made for that but very few of the councillors appointed to such boards have made the significant contribution he said.  If the Minister wants a positive engagement from outside interests, such as business, trade unions, etc., she should retain the element of choice.  For that reason, she should find her own form of words to create the substance of an amendment which I would like to put before the House.  Instead of having the power to nominate representatives which shall be appointed &mdash; it is a direct power <Col N="1005" /> and the board does not have the right to refuse to appoint &mdash; the Minister should find a form of words along the lines that the Minister may nominate from nought to four &mdash; in terms of membership of the board from outside &mdash; and the college &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; appoint these members.</P>
    <P>At perhaps a slightly lower level of life, I have occasionally been asked to serve on boards.  I am rarely flattered when it is a statutory requirement to include a public representative or some other functionary.  I am much more flattered if I know there is no such statutory requirement and I have been deliberately selected for a specific task.  I imagine the Minister would agree with me philosophically that by leaving the universities with the right to choose somebody for a specific task because of their expertise or talent, we are including fresh blood from outside and not fossilising it in this statutory requirement, which is a bad idea and cannot be welcomed.</P>
    <P>While one should not be over defensive, I am old enough to remember the merger in Trinity and the heat and emotion it generated.  I remember the late Donogh O'Malley of Fianna Fáil escaping through a lavatory window in the GMB because of the heat generated by a student debate.  We have moved on from that and Trinity has sought to play its full role as a representative element in university life for many years.  Reference was made in the Minister's historical survey to the institution of the other university systems. It was indicated that the 1908 Act resulted in the establishment of a university which would reflect and promote the values and traditions of the majority of the people.  I am sure the Minister would agree &mdash; perhaps she might be gracious enough to refer to it in her reply &mdash; that the University of Dublin not only reflects the values of the majority of the people but also the pluralist elements in that community, which is extremely important.</P>
    <P>The university system should not be a bland homogenised one, reflecting what a political party or dominant interest at a particular time sees as the values and traditions of the people; but it should reflect the diversity of opinion and intellectual inquiry taking place in our society.  I hope these values and ideas and the ethos of the universities are fully respected.</P>
    <P>We had a debate last week on the protection of the religious ethos and its insulation from certain equality provisions.  If this is appropriate when dealing with equality legislation, it is certainly appropriate that such values &mdash; the autonomy and independence of the universities and their special ethos &mdash; should be properly and fully taken into account in any legislation brought before the House.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about some of the tone of the Minister's speech.  She quoted from her position paper of last November and said: &ldquo;While the universities are institutions which are an important concern for public policy, they cannot be regarded simply as instruments of that policy.&rdquo;<Col N="1006" /> Of course they cannot, that is blindingly obvious. I am a little worried about the notion of public policy in that this may have a tendency to become political policy.  It would be wrong for the universities to be seen by any Government or party as an instrument of political policy, whatever about public policy.</P>
    <P>This seems to have infected the Minister's speech.  She spoke, for example, about the Irish language and said: &ldquo;I consider the promotion of the Irish language by universities to be a worthwhile and necessary part of their mission.  The Bill imposes on the universities a statutory obligation to promote and preserve the Irish language.  This is the first time such a statutory requirement will be imposed on the universities generally and will, I believe, give a significant impetus to this important area of university activities.&rdquo;  I would not like the House to be under the impression that I am antagonistic to the Irish language, far from it.  I occasionally make halting attempts to speak Irish in the House and have a love for the language and use it frequently when speaking abroad.  I was in Oslo last Saturday leading the first St. Patrick's Day procession and the first part of my speech was in Irish, which drew substantial cheers from a section of the crowd.  It made them feel at home in that our cultural independence and integrity was being given public recognition.</P>
    <P>I am, however, worried by the language used by the Minister.  Of course, the promotion of the Irish language is worthwhile, but I am not sure it is necessary.  The university whose graduates I have the honour to represent has played a full and leading part in the advancement of that subject. We had the first chair of Irish and were involved in the first printing of Irish.  We have a remarkably strong Irish department and a unique collection of Irish manuscripts and materials.  I am not antagonistic to the idea of cherishing the Irish language, but I am worried by the language used, that is, that it is a necessary part of the mission of the universities.  It imposes a statutory obligation on the universities.  As if that was not enough, within four sentences the word &ldquo;imposed&rdquo; is used again.  It is dangerous to seek to impose things on the universities.  It is much better to encourage people to continue the excellence which exists rather than use the language of imposition and coercion, which is a pity.  The Minister's objectives could have been achieved in a different way, and I look forward to her comments on this matter.</P>
    <P>Universities must develop; they cannot stagnate. I would like to cherrypick from an excellent article by the Provost of Trinity College, Dr. Tom Mitchell, in <i>Trinity Today,</i> which I received yesterday. He said university education is at a crossroads. We must ensure, through the passage, defeat or further amendment of this Bill, that the correct road is taken at this important crossroads. He also said we need to redefine the vision of a university education and what it can contribute to our society.  A university education must contribute to our society and we must facilitate it <Col N="1007" /> in doing so.  However, it is already doing so, even in the marketplace.  I made the point that universities have been accountable, so let us scotch the idea that they are not.  They secure advances not only in research and design but also through university companies and campus developments in relation to technology and industry.  Such companies are in the marketplace earning money for this country, and I applaud them for doing so.  It is important that money generated by these activities is not subject to the control of the HEA. There is far too much interventionism in the Bill and there is a feeling that at the end of the day, the Minister for Education may come to regard herself as a nanny to the university system, rebuking it, telling it when it is wrong and instructing civil servants to dictate to it in terms of budget. It is with the use of terms such as &ldquo;impose&rdquo; that the Bill becomes political.  Education is costly and Irish taxpayers make a significant contribution to it, and it is appropriate they should.  The factors which make major multinational companies invest here are the already existing excellence of graduates and the degree system.  Hence, the taxpayer is being accounted to already, although that might need to be tightened up.  The excellence is returned to the investors.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about some other elements of language employed by the Minister in the Bill. For example, she refers to the major stakeholders in a university as having a natural right to be involved.  This is the language one sees in a business report.  I am not sure it is appropriate to this debate and it worries me when taken in conjunction with the idea of academic freedom.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the article by the Provost of Trinity College and place what I see as the most significant paragraph on the record of the House. He states:</P>
    <P>A final basic principle to be reaffirmed is the vital need for universities to remain autonomous.  Universities must never allow the state to dominate their decision-making or to usurp their responsibility to determine their philosophy, ethos and ideals and the nature of their curriculum and the balances within it.  Universities must preserve independent thought by scholars who are genuinely free to pursue truth, to criticise established orthodoxies, to create and express ideas, and to communicate knowledge.  They must still serve the public good, be responsive to public needs and be accountable for the efficient use of public funds.  But they must be shielded from political pressures and from transient or ill-considered perceptions of relevance or utility, so that the constant values of education and of learning can be preserved and that all decision-making is based on stable, objective academic criteria. This is the essence of the autonomy that universities have traditionally enjoyed and it is the guarantee that their intellectual vitality and value to society will be maintained.  Trinity <Col N="1008" /> is committed to defending these four principles.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can persuade me that the values flagged by the Provost of Trinity College in that paragraph are met by her Bill, I will either support it or abstain on it; but I have not yet made a decision.  It lies in the Minister's hands and in her response to this debate and to the various amendments tabled.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to raise, which has already been raised by my colleague from Fianna Fáil, Senator Ormonde, is the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The Minister has missed an opportunity to create a separate university.  I say this with a degree of sadness because the Dublin Institute of Technology is a fine institution which, over the past years, has had an association with Trinity College under which the University of Dublin, the degree awarding body, awarded the degrees of the Dublin Institute of Technology. That was useful for it in validating its degrees and also interesting to me and my colleagues because it provided a slightly different form of graduate and, therefore, voter.</P>
    <P>I would have liked the historical development of Trinity College to have continued because, as the Minister knows, it was founded within the framework of the University of Dublin.  The original intention was to develop further colleges.  For various reasons the university still comprises only Trinity College, Dublin, with the University of Dublin being the degree awarding body.  It would have been a natural, organic and welcome development of Trinity College to go the direction of Oxford and Cambridge and, even after a gap of 400 years since its inception, create other colleges within the university.  However, I understand the decision not to proceed with this has been amicably arrived at on both sides.</P>
    <P>For that reason I support the desire of the Dublin Institute of Technology to be recognised as a university.  It is worth placing on the record of the House that the Dublin Institute of Technology has already met the requirements necessary to be considered a university, so I have tabled an amendment granting it such status.  This is supported by Fianna Fáil and I will press the amendment vigorously on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will accede to my wishes and those of a combined opposition and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Although I cannot give an unqualified welcome to the Bill, I hope my qualifications have not been as shrill as Senator Cotter imagined.  It is important to maintain a balance and to continue the negotiation and discussion process to the end and I hope the Minister has some positive things to say on this in her reply.  I have kept general what I have had to say, basing it on the philosophy of the university rather than dealing in any minute detail with the various sections of the Bill. The time for that is on Committee Stage when the amendments tabled are dealt with.  It is important the debate be kept at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> I am reminded of how the debate started in this House some years ago.  One of my former colleagues in the University of Dublin and a Member of this House wrote a strongly worded letter to my distinguished colleague, Senator Henry.  His writing was so illegible, the letter was sent to Deputy Harney, the leader of the Progressive Democrats, who took this as manna from heaven, spoke to the representatives in this House and got a major and very valuable debate on the issue.  I made the point then that I would not vote against the Government because I understood the practicalities of politics.  There was no earthly point in tactically voting against the Government then because all that would happen would be that it might be defeated and be mildly irritated for half an hour but that nothing would change.  A motion would have been passed but we might as well have done nothing.</P>
    <P>The time to push the pistol to the head of the Minister is in this House on the legislation if sufficient numbers can be garnered.  Whatever about Second Stage, the outcome of which it would be foolish of me to speculate upon, the numbers are very tight and may become considerably tighter when we reach Committee Stage.  For that reason, in addition to respecting her intellectual freedom, I urge the Minister to consider carefully the principal amendments tabled and to give an indication of her response.</P>
    <P>I would not be likely to vote against a Bill of this nature for a numbers of reasons.  I recognise the time spent on it by the Minister, by her advisers and by the universities; and it is a natural human reaction, having undergone this exhaustive and exhausting process, to hope the process will not be derailed at the last minute.</P>
    <P>The signals I am receiving from the University of Dublin are mixed.  I am decoding them at present.  I am a practical politician and am not merely a minion of the board of Trinity College. I represent the 30,000 graduates and not the board or the University of Dublin.  I am responsible to that electorate and their concerns and wishes as well as the concerns of the provost, board and the fellows all which I have to consider in making my decision regarding which way to vote on Second Stage.  I have not made a decision yet and I have no knowledge that a vote will be called.  Neither have I decided how far and which of my numerous amendments or those of my colleagues in Fianna Fáil I will push to a vote or support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  It has three core objectives, namely, the restructuring of the National University of Ireland, broadening the composition of the governing authorities of the seven universities and providing a modern framework for general provisions of accountability and transparency between the universities and the wider community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for this legislation has been recognised for a number of years.  Legislation was <Col N="1010" /> proposed in the 1992 Green Paper on education produced by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government.  The White Paper which followed was based on extensive consultation with all the interests in education including the universities.  This consultative process included the national education convention held in Dublin Castle in October 1993.  The Bill has been framed in the context of continuing consultation and dialogue with the seven diverse university communities.</P>
    <P>The concerns of one university are not necessarily the prime concerns of another.  Yet there is a need for omnibus legislation to govern all the universities in an equal fashion.  The divergence of views within the universities has led to many of the difficulties encountered in framing this legislation.</P>
    <P>We must ask what defines a university.  Tracing the history of the university to Plato's time, we see that it was the preserve of a very small, male elite.  It has come a long distance from that privileged position.  Is university the training ground for gentlemen, as Cardinal Newman suggested, or is it the centre for advanced knowledge, technology and research?  The two roles need not be exclusive.  We have a tradition where universities have tended to merge the traditional, old-fashioned role with that of being to the forefront of modern scientific and technological advance. This conflict is at the heart of the Bill.  There are questions to be asked about each role.  If a university spends too much time and resources pursuing the traditional route of academic research it tends to lose contact with what is happening in the wider world.  It is necessary that universities feed into society.</P>
    <P>Not everybody has praised the role our universities have played in the foundation of the State. Professor Lee, in his book on modern Ireland, questions the lack of critical analysis in the universities in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  We were left with traditional universities in the 1960s and an Irish academic life that was ill-equipped for modern advances in science and technology. It is only when one sees the new courses that have come on stream over the past few years that one thinks they should have been offered years ago to suit the type of society that has emerged.  For example, it is only in the past three or four years that equine science has become a subject of study at a major third level institute, namely, the University of Limerick.  This is amazing in the context of the importance of the bloodstock and horse racing industries which are a major preoccupation with a large section of society.</P>
    <P>I went to UCC in the early 1970s when dairy science was only a very small part of the programme offered.  At that time UCC was the only university in Munster.  The principal livelihood of the majority of Munster people was food processing and yet it encompassed only a very small part of the university course.  It was totally under funded.  It is only in recent years that the university has started to look at the study of food science <Col N="1011" /> and technology.  I cannot say, therefore, that the universities have pushed out the boundaries of Irish academic life to the extent they ought to. Sometimes I feel universities are being dragged into the 20th century rather than dragging the rest of us there.  The call and desire for study at university often comes from the community and not from within the universities.</P>
    <P>Great fear is being expressed by Senator Norris that the State, because it funds the universities, will limit their freedom.  However, there is another question to be asked of the academic world.  Institutions such as UCC and UL have done well in going outside the university and the country to get funding for research.  Does it curtail the academic freedom of a university when research is tied to a particular company?  It is a question often asked of American universities which are heavily dependent on huge multinational companies for research funding.  The research is tied to what the multinational company wants.  What will happen to research which is contrary to the wishes of the multinational?</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the State controlling the academic freedom of the university. Concern has also been expressed to me by the staff of the University of Limerick about internal freedom; if there is a particular ethos in a university &mdash; the University of Limerick has a strong entrepreneurial ethos &mdash; what will happen if a staff member feels that such ethos is not a particularly good idea?  What protection is there for such a person?  Internal academic freedom is a very important factor which must be considered. One might see a complete contrast between the concerns of Trinity College, as expressed by Senator Norris, and the fear of external control on its academic freedom.  Yet members of staff are concerned that there would be internal pressures put on them to stay quiet on particular issues.</P>
    <P>In the past month we have seen breakthroughs in genetic engineering in Scotland.  There is nothing to prevent something like that happening in an Irish university.  Such an occurrence would go strongly against the ethos of many individuals within our universities.  What would happen in such a situation?</P>
    <P>Parts of the Bill need consideration, particularly the one with regard to internal freedom within a university.  Concern has been expressed to me by the University of Limerick on the Third Schedule, page 37, 8 (3) that: &ldquo;a member of a governing body of a university shall at all times act, as a member, in the best interests of the university and shall not act as a representative of any special interest&rdquo;.  I can understand that somebody on a university board, who happens to be an IBEC nominee, for example, would not like to see the university promoting the view of any particular sector of industry.  However, when it comes to members of the staff or students of the university who will, after all, be elected as representatives, it is important that they would be <Col N="1012" /> allowed to speak out on the particular interests of their group.  There may be an issue about which students are unhappy and which they want rectified. If they are unable to express that concern within the board they should have the freedom to go outside of it and express the fears of the people who have elected them.  Whatever about those who have been selected, those who have been elected to the board are duty bound to reflect the views of those who elected them.</P>
    <P>As a member of the council of the administrative county of Limerick, I welcome the provision in page 15, which states that &ldquo;in the case of the University of Limerick &mdash; (i) the chairperson of the council of the administrative county of Limerick or a person nominated by him or her...&rdquo;. This is a new provision and I feel strongly that a university should reflect not only the views of the university city but also those of the county if it is to be in tune with the community in which it resides.</P>
    <P>There are also some small technical points which I would like the Minister to address.  In page 13, with regard to line 38 that &ldquo;at least one shall be chosen from those nominated by organisations representative of business or industry,&rdquo;, I think that to give such an emphasis to business or industry and not to the wider community may be detrimental to the overall development of the university giving it too much of an entrepreneurial slant.</P>
    <P>Section 17(6)(b), in contrast to section 34(1)(a), makes no mention of people with a physical disability.  They should also be included under section 17 which states that there shall be &ldquo;... equality of opportunity among the students and employees of the university and shall, in particular, promote access to the university and to university education by economically or socially disadvantaged people...&rdquo;.  The section makes little reference to those who might be physically disadvantaged particularly those in wheelchairs who might feel that the layout of a university is counterproductive to their full utilisation of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has worked on the Bill for quite a long time.  The Bill is welcomed by many people in the universities.  I quote from a letter which I received:</P>
    <P>We welcome the provisions in the Bill which will provide for transparency and accountability. It is proper that universities be held accountable for large sums of public money which they expend.  In doing this, the Oireachtas must ensure that academic freedom and independence essential to a healthy university is defended.  This can best be done by providing, in the legislation, for a strong governing authority, independent both of management of the universities and of Government.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of university education, we must look at society and at what happened in education in the past.  We have created a stratified <Col N="1013" /> scheme of university education which is not conducive to the broadening of education in this, or any other, country.  There will be an educational loss the more stratified education becomes.  The Minister is attempting to bring further control of university education within the remit of the Department of Education and to ensure that we have a stratified educational system. That is ludicrous.  Education should be all-embracing; unfortunately, this Bill does not give access to education to the people who need and demand it.  The concept of confining third level education to huge campuses is outdated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a person who has been through an education system, which included part-time university education, and having seen six of my children go through university, academically I might not be the person to speak, but from the point of view of a person who has seen what universities have done, and are trying to do in the future, I believe I might be qualified to say a few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I left school a person had honours leaving certificate, and made a choice as to what he decided to do.  I remember listening to Deputy Séamus Brennan speak about sitting on a wall in Salthill, discussing whether to do Commerce or Arts, and the rationale behind this was if their parents could afford to send them to university. At that stage the only people who could go to university were those who could afford it.  There have been changes since the 1950s in the sense that university education has been opened up to a huge number of people.  The country, and the world, has benefited from the changes, which allowed more and more pupils to get a university education, irrespective of their parents' financial background, or of the people who were providing the funds.  Over the years there has been an increased involvement of the State in the provision of funding for students attending university. The unfortunate part of this is that, across the board, the funding has not gone to the people who would most benefit from third level education. At present the fees are subsidised, but in many cases the fees are only a minor part of the overall cost of sending a person to university.  The <Col N="1014" /> loss of potential earnings for a person between 18 and 25, who entered university rather than taking up a career or apprenticeship, is huge.</P>
    <P>I am not sure why this Bill is being introduced. I cannot see any demand for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not 1992.  We are lucky; we have a university system which has worked well for those who have been privileged to go through it.  The universities have controlled their own institutions well and I do not see the need to transfer this power to the Minister, or anybody else.  Over the years we have had various changes to the third level education system, for example, the Outreach and other programmes, which are developing the status of off campus projects, where the work being done is of tremendous value to the country.  The day of the huge campus is gone.  The idea of investing in huge campuses is a concept of the past; there is no sense building campuses and forcing people from various disciplines into them and saying this is a university, a place of excellence.  That is not the way to go. In the future we will have off campus learning, as in many other countries, where there will be specific courses taught in small areas and in small groups.  The first registered university in Ireland was in Kilkenny; unfortunately it collapsed with the defeat of the Jacobites.  In September, Maynooth College is starting the first degree course to be offered through St. Ciarán's College.</P>
      <P>The collapse of the seminaries, or &ldquo;the far side&rdquo; as we used to call them, has meant that there are huge numbers of places available throughout the country.  We do not have to build in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, or Waterford.  If you go to Carlow, Kilkenny, or Thurles, there is space available in the diocesan colleges, places of academic excellence for the past 200 years.  I am delighted Maynooth College has decided to offer degree courses on the ecclesiastical side of what was St. Ciarán's College.  I sincerely hope that is the way university education can go.</P>
      <P>All the old boarding schools still exist in the surrounding areas of Limerick, Cork or Kerry. There is an academic aura about the buildings in these small villages, where one can bring in up to 50 people to undertake an academic course which has university status.  That, rather than the way the Minister intends, is the way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my children went through the Dublin Institute of Technology and Trinity College and attained a master's degree, another went to UCD and the Smurfit Graduate School of Business and a third went to the LSB and went on to do various courses.  I cannot say that any one of those institutions was better than the others, but each was controlled by a governing body which seemed to do the job well.  Each had funding problems &mdash; and they will continue &mdash; but they were put aside by the academic and management staff.  Over the years these institutions have served this country <Col N="1015" /> well and I am not sure what the Minister is trying to achieve with the Bill.</P>
    <P>A blatant problem with the Bill concerns the situation of the Dublin Institute of Technology. It is not only a Dublin problem because it affects the whole country.  Of the 25,000 Dublin Institute of Technology students, 5,000 students from the south-east attend Carlow Regional Technical College under the aegis of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Lack of university status means nothing if the academic qualities are not comparable with those of a university.  Status is one thing, but the quality of education is another.  The quality of education provided by the Dublin Institute of Technology is exceptional.  One hundred per cent of the students graduating from the Dublin Institute of Technology get jobs.  We cannot say that of other institutions which the Minister is trying to collate into this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology has moved from a college to a faculty-based structure which has allowed for greater cohesion in the educational services offered to the community.  The Dublin Institute of Technology is a unique multilevel institution offering courses from apprenticeship to middle-level technician, degree and post-graduate study.  This is extremely important when we cannot find enough trained people.  It is extremely difficult to find a mechanic or a tradesman of any description at present because in-work training is not available.  Such training has been made available only by the Dublin Institute of Technology and I am sure technicians will be more valuable in the future than academic graduates with a BA in the liberal arts or applied sciences.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is actively seeking inclusion in the Universities Bill and I ask the Minister to look at this carefully.  Through the cohesive efforts of parents, students, staff and the members of the business community, the majority of political parties in the Dáil have given their support.  This applies across the political spectrum. It is not just that Fianna Fáil in Opposition is suggesting this; many Government Members of the Dáil and Seanad, including Deputies Crawford, Currie, Durkan, Frances Fitzgerald, Flanagan, McGinley, Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i>, Owen, Timmons, Burton, Kavanagh, Kemmy, Ruairí Quinn, Stagg, Éamon Walsh, Eric Byrne, Gilmore, Rabbitte, Gallagher <i>(Laoighis-Offaly)</i>, Jim O'Keeffe, Ahearn, McManus, Connaughton, McCormack, Howlin, Proinsias De Rossa, Yates, Doyle and Enda Kenny, have backed the demands to include Dublin Institute of Technology in the Bill.  The Minister's name is not on that list.  If that list, which includes a number of Cabinet Ministers, is to be believed, I cannot see how the Minister cannot give the Dublin Institute of Technology the status it seeks.</P>
    <P>If a student fails one or all of his or her examinations at UCD, a fee of £103 is imposed.  No fee is imposed in such circumstances in the case of Trinity College.  In the Dublin Institute of Technology, <Col N="1016" /> there is a £24 charge and the relevant charge in an regional technical college is £25.  If a student defers one or a number of exams in UCD, a fee of £103 is imposed and if one defers all one's exams, the fee is £50.  There is no mention of these fees when we talk about free university education.</P>

      <P>The Minister announced that she intends to make an order to confer degree-awarding powers to the Dublin Institute of Technology from the 1998-99 academic year, the earliest possible date due to CAO procedures.  However, the Minister has not moved the order for degree-awarding powers to date; and, while this is urgently needed, it would not lead to the same status and would be conferred by inclusion under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to make the case for the Dublin Institute of Technology because there is no point in me getting involved in the arguments which can be put forward by the University Senators.  The Dublin Institute of Technology cannot appoint staff as it deems necessary within budgetary guidelines or utilise normal educational procedures.  It cannot appoint research fellows, research assistants and other support staff without the concurrence of the Minister.  It cannot purchase or dispose of land without the Minister's approval.  It must submit its annual budget and educational programme to the local vocational education committee.  It may charge fees for courses, lectures, examinations, exhibitions and research consultancy and development, subject to such conditions as may be specified by the Minister.  The Minister is involved in every area of control over the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act permits the Minister to make such regulations with regard to the operation of the institute as she sees fit.  At the request of a Minister for Education, the Higher Education Authority appointed an international review group in 1995 to review the quality assurance procedures in the institute.  The review group recommended that the relevant authority should consider whether key features of the Universities Bill be extended to the Dublin Institute of Technology in the light of such analysis.  In accordance with the Government's White Paper <i>Charting our Education Future</i> in 1995, the funding and oversight of the Dublin Institute of Technology should be transferred from the Department of <Col N="1017" /> Education to the HEA.  The HEA, rather than the Minister, should control the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to constitute or establish certain colleges of the universities as universities under this Act and the Dublin Institute of Technology should be included in that section of the Bill.  One can complete a BSc in marketing through the Dublin Institute of Technology and claim a master's degree from Trinity College without attending that university.  If TCD acknowledges that Dublin Institute of Technology courses are sufficient to allow people to go further, then Dublin Institute of Technology should be acknowledged as a university, which it is in everything but name.  The Dublin Institute of Technology has an annual budget of £59 million, a full-time academic staff of 850, some 550 full-time non-academic staff, and about 1,000 part-time employees.  The student population is 22,000 comprising full-time, part-time and apprentices.  Some 6,500 are involved in postgraduate level studies. This shows the level of activity in Dublin Institute of Technology.  It also shows, in a practical way, that Dublin Institute of Technology should be granted university status.</P>
    <P>What is university status?  In the old days universities were small colleges set up in rooms. When Cardinal Newman set up UCD it was not a massive campus but a small college on the site now occupied by CUS.  It then moved to St.  Stephen's Green and to Earlsfort Terrace.  The level of education available in those days in small institutions with highly motivated people was just as good as that provided on the huge campuses we have now.</P>
    <P>The idea of a huge campus is an anomaly and there is no place for it.  In Cork a whole area of the city around UCC is flatland.  Nobody except students live in the area.  They have no real appreciation for the place or what they are getting from UCC.  They go home at weekends to places such as Kilmallock or Rathkeale.</P>

      <P>People should realise that ambience is a necessary element of university education. The Minister should ensure that university status is applied to Dublin Institute of Technology but only on the basis of the quality of education provided and not just because it is an institute of technology.  No institution should receive university status unless it can maintain the required standards.  In foreign countries, university degrees are awarded to people who have not attained the standards that historically one would expect from university graduates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1956 I earned a scholarship to study in the United States and I could have skipped first year in any college there.  The scholarship I received was for Notre Dame which is supposed to be a good university.  I came from De La Salle in Waterford which had a reasonable standard of education and an excellent one by current standards. <Col N="1018" /> At that stage, university standards in America were lower than the entry standards here and that is still the case.  One of the problems with educational standards throughout the world is that universities have gone for numbers rather than quality of education.  It is easy to generalise in these matters but there is no doubt that we have a good university ambience and committed teachers who sometimes have to work in bad conditions.</P>
    <P>There have been 315 amendments to this Bill since it was first introduced and it is about time for the Minister to abandon the legislation.  She should return with a Bill which would be relevant to the needs of education, including universities, parents, teachers and students.</P>
    <P>Section 15(5)(b) states:</P>
    <P>In the case of the National University of Ireland, Cork&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the Lord Mayor of Cork,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the Mayor of Waterford,</P>
    <P>(iii)  two persons nominated by the National University of Ireland, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  not less than two or more than five persons elected by the councils of the administrative Counties of Cork, Waterford, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary (North Riding) and Tipperary (South Riding).</P>
    <P>No matter what way you work that out the minimum would be two as Cork is already represented by its Lord Mayor and the Mayor of Waterford would be there also.  From where does one choose the others?  It is a nonsense to put such a clause into the Bill because it reduces the influence of people who are elected at local level and who have as good an attitude towards university education as the academics or the two persons nominated by the National University.</P>
    <P>Section 15(5)(c) states:</P>
    <P>In the case of the National University of Ireland, Dublin&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the Lord Mayor of Dublin,</P>
    <P>(ii)  two persons nominated by the National University of Ireland, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  not less than two or more than five persons elected by the members of the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    <P>At present there are eight members.  Each of those are people of standing in the community. They have all been elected and, in fact, a number of them have third level education, which might surprise certain people who denigrate the role of councillors.  However, councillors represent a broad spectrum of interests.  I have seen councillors who are millionaires and others who have nothing.  I have seen councillors with the best academic brains in the world and others with no academic qualifications.  They bring to academia, however, a grassroots element.  They are able to express what people in their areas want.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> The Bill gives everybody an opportunity to discuss what is happening in third level education, although it will not improve its status.  I am speaking as someone who has just had to pay fees for children going through university.  I have no doubt that unless Dublin Institute of Technology is covered there will be a big gap in what the Bill is trying to achieve.  The fact that the Minister is reducing the number of councillors does nothing for the standards she is trying to achieve in universities.</P>
    <P>Instead of having ministerial power, as the Dublin Institute of Technology said, it is time to have people power, which works.</P>

      <P>Over the years people power has produced an educational system without too much interference from central Government. Changes can be made which would be beneficial in the educational sphere but vesting power in any Minister will not achieve the status, standing or educational advancement we want.  We must pay tribute to everybody involved in the educational system for the advances that have been made and for our standing in the world as a place of excellence for producing educated people.  Our educational system has been exceptionally efficient.</P>
      <P>About five minutes ago I was speaking in the hallway to a parish priest from Oughterard; he was formerly a De La Salle Brother.  He said the education system almost broke him physically and mentally.  He is now working with a community in Oughterard instead of standing in for retired teachers.  We should be thankful for people like him.  We should not try to concentrate power in the Minister's office.</P>

      <P>A number of colleges are being established as universities under this Bill yet they are not represented by the University Senators. This issue must be addressed, although it is not the Minister's responsibility.  We have an obligation to ensure that graduates from these universities are also represented in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It is important in this time of great change to define in law the role of universities.  Senator Lanigan said universities had served well those who were honoured and privileged to attend them.  It is important to remember that people were privileged to go to university.  However, that is no longer the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went to university in 1968 when the entry requirement was two honours in the leaving certificate. One important change in education that year was the introduction of the third level grant scheme.  If a student got four honours in the leaving certificate, they could get a grant to go to university. This was in addition to free second level education and free school transport, which was introduced by Mr. Donogh O'Malley.  Those changes opened up university education to wider <Col N="1020" /> sectors of society.  Many changes have taken place since then which have ensured that more people aspire to third level education.  The Minister made an important contribution to that by abolishing third level fees.</P>
    <P>This Bill places a statutory duty on universities to devise and implement appropriate equality policies to consolidate the changes in society.  As the Minister said, education can be a positive force in getting rid of inequalities in society but it can also reinforce disadvantage if it is elitist. I welcome the Minister's commitment to making education a proactive and positive force in getting rid of disadvantage rather than reinforcing it which happened in the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 12(i) which states that one of the duties of a university is &ldquo;to facilitate lifelong learning through the provision of adult and continuing education&rdquo;.  This will help to open up university education to a wider society.  I read recently that over 40 per cent of new students in Britain's new universities are mature students. Many of these people are updating skills.  It is right to define in law how universities should respond to these changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take on board the traditions and organisational structures of universities.  I welcome the balance she has struck in this regard. I commend her for taking on board some of the points made before and during the Bill's passage through the other House.  I have no doubt she will be equally receptive to the points made here.</P>
    <P>It is important that public money is properly spent.  The State has an obligation to ensure public money is not wasted in universities and that it is put to good use.  This legislation has struck a balance between the freedom of universities and the necessity for public accountability.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes made during the Bill's passage through the Dáil, particularly in relation to solidifying the rights of university staff.  The Minister accepted that some members of staff were concerned that the terms of the Bill might not be strong enough to ensure their rights were protected and she amended the Bill accordingly. I welcome the fact that student and staff representatives will be elected rather than selected.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly mentioned the concerns expressed by staff and students at the University of Limerick, particularly in relation to academic freedom.  I ask the Minister to re-examine section 33(3).  The Minister said it would safeguard academic freedom within the university and its general ethos.  However, it could mean it will protect individual freedom as well as the freedom of the institution to preserve its ethos.  A university must push out the boundaries of knowledge and research.  Staff and students may want to question issues which go beyond the establishment of the university.  I do not know if Gallileo, for example, went to university, but I am sure the academic establishment of his time thought he was crazy. A university must bring different ideas together, so we should not go overboard in preserving its ethos.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> Senator Kelly also referred to section 8(3) of the Third Schedule which requires that members of the governing body act in the best interests of the university and not as a representative of any special interest.  Students are concerned they may not be able to represent students' interests on the governing body.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this and allay their fears.</P>
    <P>The third problem is the definition of an officer in section 3.  That definition was inserted during deliberations on the Bill in the Dáil.  Concern has been expressed that it is unduly weighted in favour of academic staff as opposed to non-academic staff.  However, there is provision whereby the university can designate people to be officers and that should alleviate the concern.  I am not suggesting that the wording should be changed but I wish to draw the concern to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>Section 15(5)(g)(iii) refers to the representation of the University of Limerick Foundation on the governing body.  Other outside bodies who are represented on the body are subject to subsection (7) which provides that representatives of business and so forth cannot be staff or students of the university.  Perhaps the Minister would consider imposing the same conditions on representatives of the foundation, in so far as they are also outside the functioning of the university.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the concerns that have been expressed about this legislation.  I hope the Minister will look at the wording with a view to clarifying those concerns or taking them on board. Like Senator Lanigan, I received correspondence from Dublin Institute of Technology and the students in UCD.  As the Minister said this morning, section 9 facilitates Dublin Institute of Technology becoming a university and I assume that section can be implemented immediately.  Therefore, I see no need to change the Bill.  I also have a child attending Dublin Institute of Technology and I am aware of the good work that institution does.  Dublin Institute of Technology has made a good case but the ultimate decision is the responsibility of the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>The representative of UCD Students' Union wrote to all Senators about charges levied on students by UCD.  Section 38 of the Bill refers to charges and fees.  Under that section An tÚdarás can make recommendations to the university in that regard to meet what appear to be genuine concerns on the part of students.  There appears to be a large discrepancy between charges that must be paid in UCD for deferring exams and other services relating to the library and so forth, and charges in other universities.  Can the Minister confirm that the students would be in a stronger position under section 38 of the Bill when enacted?</P>
    <P>There are strong and important provisions in the Bill in terms of how universities relate to the State.  The State has not only a right but a duty to ensure that universities are accountable for the proper expenditure of public moneys and to <Col N="1022" /> ensure the highest possible standards in them. University standards in Ireland are high and we wish to maintain them.  I also welcome the fact that stakeholders, such as students, staff and others will, for the first time, have a statutory right to democratic representation on the governing authorities of universities.  It is a most important development.  Universities cannot be ivory towers.  They must include representation from the various interests involved in that sector, particularly the students who are the backbone of such institutions.</P>
    <P>Aside from the few matters I raised, to which I hope the Minister will respond, I welcome the many other features of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris was acting the maggot a little this morning when he spoke about an intemperate letter which was sent to me but unfortunately was received by a Member of the Lower House whose name is similar to mine.  I would not like the impression to be given that the motion regarding the Universities Bill, brought forward by the Progressive Democrats in November 1995, had been influenced in any way by this letter, which was extremely unflattering to me as well as to the Minister.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to whether it is legally necessary to add &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth&rdquo; to the name of Trinity College.  The name of the college is &ldquo;The Holy and Undivided Trinity&rdquo; and I do not know why Senator Norris referred to it as the &ldquo;Sacred Trinity&rdquo; this morning.  &ldquo;Sacred&rdquo; is different from &ldquo;holy&rdquo;, but I presume it was a slip of the tongue on his part.  I put those two points on record for the information of the House.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the major alterations she has made to the Bill since its publication last year.  At that time I expressed grave reservations about certain provisions.  The changes the Minister has made have greatly improved the Bill.  The fact that the Minister is allowing a Private Members' Bill to be introduced which will facilitate changes on the board of Dublin University to ensure that the charter and statutes remain undamaged is of great importance to all those associated with the college.  Like Senator Norris, I am conscious of the fact that I do not represent the board or the fellows of Trinity College.  I represent my constitutuents.  However, I must take into account the representations made to me by the board, the chancellor and the fellows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Provost, in a long letter to members of the college in January 1997, pointed out that while the college had strongly opposed the Bill initially, the board, at a special meeting in December 1996, decided it was acceptable, provided the amendments which the college had put forward were implemented.  It was anticipated that the Bill would become law within a few months.  As far as I am aware, the vast majority of the fellows support the board's decision, as was made clear in a meeting they held subsequently.  Trinity College is not being opportunistic about this legislation. People in Trinity College, while voicing the concerns <Col N="1023" /> of the college, have also based a considerable number of their objections on their determination that this Bill should be to the advantage of university education throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the discussion that took place within the college and with those associated with it dealt with changes in the board.  The board of Trinity College is different from the boards of other universities because it is an executive board.  In the 400 years of the college's history, the board has undergone considerable changes.  It is composed mainly of fellows and for nearly 300 years it was composed of celibate Anglican men, the majority of whom were in holy orders.  This policy was strictly enforced at times, especially in the early 17th century and again in the 19th century. This did not change until Fawcetts Act, which is over 120 years old.  The Minister will be aware that his legislation caused 30 years of turmoil, as opposed to the few months of turmoil she has endured.</P>
    <P>This Act permitted Dissenters and Roman Catholics to be admitted to fellowship.  However, it was nearly 50 years before a Roman Catholic, Professor R.A.Q. O'Meara, a pathologist whose lectures I had the honour to attend, became the first senior fellow member of the board.  It is only 30 years since women were admitted to fellowship and only six women have been voting members of the board to date, and two of those were non-fellow professors.  They were Professors Moran and Otway-Ruthven from the law school. It was 20 years ago before any female fellow professors were elected.  Trinity College has not had a favourable view of women, it being the last university on this island to admit women as students, not to mind giving them a say in its governance. The board has been aware of my beef for many years, but changing those restrictions in the last 120 years has been beneficial to college when one looks at the way in which college had flourished despite incredible bans on those attending college by people outside college who did not speak on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to have outsiders on the board who will be appointed by the Provost.  Senator Norris quite rightly said they will be nominated by the Minister but will be appointed by the Provost. This is not a novel idea.  In 1966 the board of college petitioned the Commission on Higher Education to allow this to happen.  The second report of the commission states that the representatives of the board of Trinity College made three main submissions in oral evidence regarding the composition of the board.  The board was &ldquo;not, perhaps, as representative as it might ideally be.&rdquo; From about 20 years ago, &ldquo;there has been a very radical change in the government of the College&rdquo;, which had the effect of introducing younger people into the board; it was hoped to increase the representation of the younger people on the board.  At stages in the college's history most of the members on its board were over 70 years old. I understand why it was enthusiastic about getting <Col N="1024" /> a younger representation on the board.  It also stated &ldquo;The College would like a limited number of outside representatives on the Board, although this could not be effected without legislation, and in a relevant Board minute the Provost had been requested to bring this to the notice of the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is only infrequently that legislation is introduced regarding universities, as should be the case.  Autonomy from the State is vital in any country for any university; and in a country such as this, where universities have such a diverse history and mission and the number of institutions which are in a position to challenge the State are limited, even greater care must be taken that while universities explain what has happened to State investment the direction of that investment must not be circumscribed.  This is the most important element in the legislation.  We have very few think tanks or independent institutions here which have any hope of challenging Government policy.  Most European countries have such institutions and that is why it is vital that universities or faculties within them should not feel that if they challenge the paymaster they will be put down.  On innumerable occasions university representatives have come before Oireachtas committees to give expert advice; and if they felt their freedom to express an opinion of various Government policies was curtailed by the fact they were being paid by the State, it would be a serious day. The Government does not intend this to be the case, but it must be emphasised constantly.</P>
    <P>Universities must be free to work within their budgets and, as the Minister said, the Higher Education Authority has a statutory function to co-ordinate State investment in higher education and advise the Minister on general policy issues. It is important that we take note of what the Minister said in regard to the HEA.  When the Bill was initially published the Higher Education Authority had been given too much of a dead hand about regarding the diversity of courses and the aspirations of universities.  I was delighted to hear the Higher Education Authority state it was not seeking more power, although it was a most unusual occurrence when the Higher Education Authority publicly stated in newspaper advertisements that it was not seeking more power.  If it had been, it would just have been suggesting that what it was attempting to do at present was insufficient and ineffective.  I was delighted the Higher Education Authority had the courage of its convictions to say it needed no more that it had.</P>
    <P>It is vital that universities be independent not just for themselves, but also for the Government and the country.  When President Robinson received an honorary degree from the Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, she discussed the relationship between the university and society and the relevance of what is taught within universities to society.  She stated:</P>
    <P>There are constant calls for relevance, for the provision of marketable skills for our young people, for greater respect for market forces.  I <Col N="1025" /> do not deny that the university curriculum must be relevant to the needs of society but let us be quite clear what those needs are.  We live in a time of unprecedented change; we are witnessing a very revolution in the way we communicate and process information.  What our society will need are balanced, rounded individuals who can think for themselves and who have strong analytical skills.</P>
    <P>We have to guard against the constant emphasis on the need for everything taught to be immediately relevant in favour of producing versatile graduates.  The President continued:</P>
    <P>It is right that we should take account of market forces but in our marketplace our primary concern must always be the competition of ideas.  Our medium of exchange is more valuable than silver for it is an alloy of all the subtle forms of argument and communication that we have devised.  Our capital is more precious than gold because it is human capital and is beyond price.  We have not striven to defeat the manifestation of one form of barbarism in our continent for it to be replaced by another.</P>
    <P>It is right that our universities should seek to be relevant to the needs of society.  But what society most needs, whether it realises it or not, is a continuous constructive but critical judgment from within.  So the University and the writer will have to continue to assert the right to stand at a tangent to the rest of society, to take an oblique but engaged view.  In society's own interest we ask for the freedom to be critical in analysis; dispassionate in the search for knowledge but passionate in its defence.</P>
    <P>This is the kernel of the situation regarding universities and society and the relationship between universities and Government.</P>
    <P>Academic freedom must be preserved, especially between universities and Government and for individuals within institutions.  I am sure this is desired by the Minister.  We have to ensure this section of the Bill is explicit because one cannot have autocratic administrations or heads of departments who may seriously stifle the academic freedom of those in a lesser position either within a department or within a university. This is terribly important when one considers the turmoil that can be created within the department on which way to progress.  Academic freedom is not ephemeral or nebulous; it is a concrete concept which should be enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the influence of universities on the socio-economic order.  I challenge the Minister when she said people get into universities solely on the basis of ability.  We are not quite at that stage yet and have a long way to go. When one examines the cross section of society who reach third level education we have a long way to go before we have equality of access to higher level education, despite the Minister's effort to promote it at primary level which is the right area in which to begin such promotion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> We must make sure our versatile graduates are able to move in the direction required by society when they emerge from university. How great are our efforts in this regard?  The section dealing with the objects and function of a university has been much improved.  Reading the Bill as originally published, one could have been forgiven for thinking universities were obliged to support the economic policies of the Government no matter how misguided they believed them to be.</P>
    <P>While I applaud some of the functions and objectives, I do not know if universities are in the best position to promote them.  I agree with the Minister on the promotion of gender balance and equity of opportunity among students.  However, this needs more recognition at second level. There are too few career guidance teachers in our secondary schools and many receive inadequate training.  Some appear to rely on reading articles in newspapers and magazines to advise students on courses which seem to be flavour of the month.  It is obvious that many of those who obtain university places have not received sufficient help in understanding the content of the courses for which they apply or the careers to which these courses may lead.</P>
    <P>The reason I feel strongly about this is that many first year students find themselves in disciplines for which they are ill-suited and then make great efforts to change courses.  This shows that CAO forms are ill-thought out and that not enough guidance is given to students at this level. A student said to me they thought psychology was about children, which is not the case.  That was the student's interpretation of psychology, which is a much sought after course.  We could move towards the American system which provides more general degrees.  We are, however, preserving our system of education.  If we want to promote gender balance and equality of opportunity, we must look the guidance given to students in secondary school seeking places on university courses.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise universities are not competing with each other.  The fact that they are diverse is good.  We are competing internationally with the best in the world.  For us to retain our competitive position, better funding for capital purposes is essential.  I thank the Minister, the Government and the previous one for funds given to Trinity College over the past four years. Although I do not know what other universities received, I will not mention the sum in case it causes jealousy.  Trinity has raised privately two and a half times the amount given.  It is terrific to get this money because without domestic funding we cannot ask private investors for money.  I know from raising money for research in medicine that if one cannot say one has backing at home, one is sunk.  While the Minister has recognised this and has provided capital funding, we are running to keep up.  Ten years ago Trinity College had 10,000 undergraduates and graduates but today it has nearly 12,000.  We are desperately <Col N="1027" /> trying to keep up and we are in dire need of library places, laboratory facilities and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes the Bill will provide a framework for interaction between the universities and central Government and accountability to society.  Of course, this is what we want.  Senator Norris was right to point out that there has not been a lack of accountability, and I do not believe the Minister suggested that.  The Comptroller and Auditor General goes through the books of the universities and if he does not know what he is doing, what can I do about it?  For us to give our best to Government and society, we must also address the lack of funding for postgraduates, which is a serious problem.  More graduates are going on to do postgraduate degrees because this is the norm internationally.  Ireland, however, spends only one tenth of the OECD norm on research.</P>
    <P>I support the need to provide money for basic research.  I often get the feeling I must apologise if I start to talk about basic research, but all applied research centres on basic research.  I ask the Minister to address this serious issue.  I am sure she has seen the magazine, <i>The Irish Scientist</i>, edited by Dr. Charles Mollam, which shows the extraordinary diversity of research taking place in the universities, but funds must be provided to maintain this research.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking the universities for too much by requesting them to provide employers with the graduates they need.  How good are employers at giving work placement to students during the summer?  Irish industry invests very little in research and development and is not good at engaging with the universities.  It is no wonder so many of our best graduates are snapped up by firms abroad.  Irish firms should show initiative by giving them summer job placements.  Has the Minister considered the effect of unit cost funding on the universities?  The concept of unit cost funding is the antithesis to what a university education should be because it promotes the production of quantity rather quality, and this is not a good move.</P>
    <P>On the question of relevant graduates, more strategic planning is needed if that is what is desired in the Bill.  The IDA and Forbairt should be able to help forecast the type of graduates the country will need.  The IDA's job is to market Ireland, but let us be sure it does not set up companies for which we must import employees.  It is extraordinary what has been happening in the computer industry recently.  We must also be sure we do not only produce computer graduates because in ten years time, these multinationals could depart to India, which has excellent computer graduates at present but not as good an infrastructure.  We do not want to end up with graduates who are not suitable for employment elsewhere.  The IDA, which targets inward investment, should look at what our education system is producing.  Sometimes there appears to be mismatching and a lack of communication.  Often <Col N="1028" /> there is not enough money to update equipment. While a faculty may produce good graduates, technology may have changed so they may need to be updated.  The Department and the universities must work more closely to make the Minister's wishes come true.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking the universities to promote lifelong education, and I am sure they will. We have a pathetic number of mature students at present and little funding is provided for them. Only 5 per cent of our students are over 23 years of age.  When at a conferring at the University of Ulster last year, I was astonished to see that a large number of graduates were mature students. Mature students, however, need independent sources and do not need impediments put in their way.  If a student is on the books of a university before they are 23 years of age and leave without completing their degree, they cannot be reclassified as a mature student when they are over 23 years.  That is nonsense and I do not understand why that impediment exists.</P>
    <P>The Minister must address a number of problems before many of the desires of the Bill may be fulfilled.  Who decides on advanced technology skills courses?  What criteria are used to decide which courses should be funded?  Brussels should not be made pay all the time because it does not always dictate what happens and sometimes it is the will of the Department of Education.  Conversion courses, which were introduced to increase the number of computer graduates, are not well supported.  It is essential that we act immediately to a demand for a certain type of graduate.</P>
    <P>Dublin Institute of Technology graduates now receive their degrees from Dublin University and many of them are associated with the science and medical services.  I am honoured and delighted to represent them.  If it was not for the excellence of their courses they would not be getting degrees from Trinity College.  The Dublin Institute of Technology must be regarded as one of the recent educational triumphs of this State because it has been extraordinarily successful in increasing the participation of those from the more disadvantaged section of our society in higher education.</P>
    <P>The Minister's committee of international experts, which reviewed the Dublin Institute of Technology quality assurance system in early 1996, has said it should become a degree awarding body.  However, some confusion has entered the discussion because, as the Minister is aware, a degree awarding body is not necessarily a university and it is this status the institute seeks. Those in the institute were very flattered when the Minister compared it with MIT and Cal Tech but these, of course, as the Minister is aware, are universities.  MIT under its charter since 1961 has the traditional autonomy associated with universities. The president of the Dublin Institute of Technology at a graduation ceremony recently said:</P>
    <P>Unlike the universities, the Dublin Institute of Technology cannot, for example, appoint staff as it deems necessary within budgetary <Col N="1029" /> guidelines; it cannot utilise normal educational selection processes; it cannot purchase or dispose of land, and must submit its annual budget and educational programme to the local vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology Act permits the Minister to make such regulations with regard to the operation of the institute as she sees fit &mdash; we may not always have as enlightened and benign a Minister.  It is also important to recognise that the title of &ldquo;university&rdquo; has benefits, particularly in the European context as was recognised by the Government when it gave the title &ldquo;university&rdquo; to the National Institutes for Higher Education in Dublin and Limerick.  The title &ldquo;university&rdquo; has a protected legal status unlike the word &ldquo;institute&rdquo; which does not confer or imply a particular educational status.  The current telephone directory lists some 40 institutes within the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been greatly improved.  We have received many representations, as the Minister is aware, from various institutions; in Limerick they have been particularly assiduous in their representation regarding academic freedom.  The section of the Bill which says that those represented on the board cannot put forward the interests of the group they represent needs to be changed in so far as they relate to students, graduates and alumni.  Why are students on the board if they cannot represent those who elect them?  I am delighted people are to be elected now rather than selected.</P>
    <P>The changes as regards visitation to the various universities are good.  Representations have been received from many universities saying they envy the visitation rights held by Trinity College.  I suggest to the Minister that perhaps we could go a little further and ensure that all universities have as strong visitation rights as Trinity College.  The Chancellor of Trinity College who is an extraordinarily nice man and a very good friend of mine seems to have been overlooked.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been greatly improved.  I hope that, on Committee Stage, the Minister will look favourably at the modest amendments I have tabled and that she will be able to encompass them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I support Senator O'Sullivan's call that other universities be represented in the Seanad; I know that is not within the Minister's remit.  Whatever criticisms are levelled at us as Senators, it cannot be said that we are not here to participate in debates.  We could not but gain by having representatives from other universities in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the changes she has made to the Bill.  I hope my points may be taken on board on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to take issue with the concept that this Bill has been much improved. In my view, this Bill has been the subject of the most heated debate outside this and the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> On reading the Bill again today it struck me that if falls into the category of one of those things that seemed like a good idea at the time. The Minister must now be asking herself why she ventured down this road.  In particular, the Bill in its original format illustrated, to my mind, all that is negative, centralist, almost Stalinist, in the Department of Education.  Over the years the Department of Education has been singularly centralist in its ethos, its thinking and its entire operations.</P>
    <P>The Bill also illustrates that we have a weak Minister for Education who has not been able to resist the Department's excesses.  As I said, the Bill is almost Stalinist in its propensity to centralise. It was in my view at the outset and it remains in my view, an attempt by the Department to effectively reduce all third level institutions in the State to the status of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  It represents a classic example where the Mandarins of Marlborough Street have been able to call all the shots.  Senator Ross memorably described the original draft of this Bill as a crude attempt to expand ministerial patronage. I think he was right.</P>
    <P>Universities have served this country well in their diversity and in the fact that they are different. Their diversity is not just part of their charm but is, I believe, essential to their character.  To attempt to crudely cram or reshape all the universities in a single grey mould or to reform them as some sort of quango is not just mean-spirited but it is a wrong direction for us to take with third level education.  The diversity which is the universities should be celebrated; the freedom of thought is a very precious gem.  It is at the core of what a university should be aimed at, expanding the capacity to think, expanding the boundaries of knowledge, expanding the right of an individual to stand against the tide of orthodoxy and to challenge the tyranny of received wisdom and cut through the straitjacket of convention and be different, be free to argue a different case.  That essential ingredient of our third level education is not understood by those who drafted this legislation.  Even in its now emasculated form this is still bad legislation.</P>
    <P>I fear the Minister does not understand these essential ingredients about our third level education. I am sorry that is the case because I believe that in many cases the Minister has been driven by a desire to leave a very strong mark on education at all levels.  What the Minister's agenda in this matter has been is now one of speculation.  In spite of months of debate the Minister's agenda on this issue remains a mystery. Was this Bill the reflection of some spite which the Minister or her Department wanted to visit on the academic freedom of the universities or was it introduced because there had been some serious wrong done by the universities or because there was a deficiency there?  Was it because the Minister, having announced the &ldquo;free&rdquo; third level fees initiative was living up to the old, tired adage that the piper must always call the tune?  We will <Col N="1031" /> never really know.  However, knowing the Departments of Education and Finance, knowing the machinations and distrust at central Government level, at the mandarin level, about third level education and third level freedoms, my view is that the desire to control purse strings remains the most suspect of all aspects behind this Bill.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Bill has been quite extraordinary. We have had the spectacle of the Fellows of Trinity College being stirred to near revolution. They reached the point of being virtually revolting &mdash; a comment made by Senator Ross. One of the more mild mannered institutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with which I am associated was also stirred to quite extraordinary degrees of agitation by the Bill as were other colleges associated with the NUI although I acknowledge that a number of the NUI affiliated colleges have done rather well from some of the changes in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority took the unprecedented step of stating in advertisements in the national newspapers its opposition to the Bill on the day the Second Stage of the Bill commenced in Dáil Éireann.  That debate took place in the Lower House because the Minister and the Government parties acknowledged that, had it taken place in this House at that time, the Bill would have been rejected.  All six university Senators would have had no option but to have registered their opposition to it.  We were promised that this Bill would be initiated in this House because it is a good one in which to debate the matter.  That our university colleagues became bolshie on the matter meant we had to wait until today to receive the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been changed so dramatically that, as someone in one of the third level institutions said today, only the title remains the same. Section 11 sets out the objects of a university. Universities survived before this Bill but this is an attempt to establish some form of conformity and rigid rule.  While there have been changes to the sections on governance &mdash; I admit the Minister has backed down on a number of issues &mdash; some weaknesses still remain.  Section 13(7) represents the ministerial climbdown.  One of the fundamental weaknesses of the Bill is illustrated in the arrangements for the appointment of a visitor. It would have been more prudent to appoint a board of visitors.  The appointment of a single visitor means Ministers and the Department of Education will have too great an opportunity to influence the visitor's thinking.</P>

      <P>Staff issues are dealt with in chapter IV which has also been changed.  Why is this section necessary?  Was there some problem?  I carefully read the Minister's Second Stage speech in the Dáil.  Was there some problem which had <Col N="1032" /> to be addressed?  If things are not broken, you do not try to fix them.  I am interested in the Minister's response and we will return to the issue on Committee Stage.  Perhaps Senator Kelly, who is knowledgeable in this area, is aware of the problems which exist and will tell us what they are.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry said another issue had arisen in recent times which is the status of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The situation of the Dublin Institute of Technology is indefensible.  It has produced extraordinary results over the years and, being based in Dublin, the Minister is aware of its contribution.  In a document called &ldquo;A Case for University Status for the Dublin Institute of Technology&rdquo; which was circulated to Members, the case made was unanswerable.  I cannot understand why the Minister has not recognised the significant contribution that institution has made from its early days.  The Dublin Institute of Technology still suffers from the sad reality that it is treated like an extension of the vocational education committee system by the Department of Education.  Notwithstanding the fact that I am critical of the Bill, it gives the Minister the opportunity to address this issue and to move in the direction of recognising the role played by the Dublin Institute of Technology by granting it university status.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry and Deputy Martin in the other House, raised the question of funding.  Whatever the Bill's intention, funding is critical to the development of third level education.  I acknowledge it is a difficult issue and that the Minister has allocated a considerable amount of money from her departmental budget to abolishing third level fees because of a Government decision which I question.  Had I been advising the Minister, I would have suggested to her that the moneys could have been spent elsewhere with better results.  There is a growing and evident problem with funding, especially at capital development level in some third level institutions. The decision the Minister has made on third level fees will exacerbate an existing problem.  There is a capital funding deficiency in many third level colleges and universities.  There are serious problems with library facilities and the Minister will be aware of this from protests by third level students.  From talking to colleagues in UCD and other universities, it is clear there is a crisis in this area.  The Minister is conscious of that and has tried to provide some additional funding but the difficulty remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue dealt with by Senator Henry, which was also mentioned in the other House, was the question of postgraduate funding.  Post-graduate facilities are still deficient in many ways. There has been considerable investment and improvement in facilities in a number of universities but it seems there is a perilous dependence on primed infusions of funds for the expansion and elaboration of postgraduate facilities in a number of colleges.  It is wrong to depend on private charity to expand postgraduate facilities. There is a problem because postgraduate education <Col N="1033" /> is becoming the norm, partly because of the deficiencies in the job market which still exist despite the expansion of the economy.  Third level education is not the last stop for many people. The increasing propensity in all disciplines is to proceed to fourth level where there is a problem which will move through the system over the next few years causing the gravest difficulties.  We have a rich resource in third level institutions at all levels. The Minister has recognised this and I would be less than generous if I did not recognise the positive things she has done in that regard.  There is a problem at the fourth level with facilities and places.  The distinction between those who have and those who have not will be further exacerbated by the difficulties people will have in affording the move from third to fourth level. Fourth level postgraduate resources are critical. A previous speaker also specifically mentioned postgraduate research.  There is a fundamental problem in funding a variety of research.  The existing base must be built upon.  The graduate population is a tremendously rich resource and it is clear that the resources which have been put into the area heretofore have been deficient.</P>
    <P>There are fundamental flaws in this Bill.  The right to suspend governing bodies which is not specifically enumerated in the Bill is questionable. Perhaps the Minister will introduce some changes as the Bill progresses.  I am conscious that this draft of the Bill has only been available recently so I do not wish to do the Minister an injustice in this regard.</P>
    <P>The second fundamental flaw which remains is the apparent wish to produce a depressing conformity and to destroy a degree of academic autonomy and freedom.  This is evident in the guidelines to be enforced by the HEA.  We should be celebrating diversity and not conformity.  I am not suggesting that we should have <i>avant garde</i> operations but it is important that we celebrate and encourage academic freedom.</P>
    <P>The third flaw is the almost dictatorial powers of the visitor.  I do not see the need for this.  It is a residual element from the original Bill and the Minister should seriously consider softening or removing it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an assault from Marlboro Street on academic freedom.  I am not saying this because of my vested interest in the concept of academic freedom, but there has been a negative attitude in the Department of Education since the foundation of the State towards the third level sector and academic freedom.  The final weakness is that the Bill is destructive of the independence of the university.  We are creating a dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>The General Council of County Councils have circulated Members over the past few days on another matter.  It seems that there will be between two and five members of the council on the new governing body of, for example, UCD. They are gravely concerned about what they regard as a downgrading of their representative status.  There are mixed feelings among academics about having people from the General Council of <Col N="1034" /> County Councils on university governing bodies. However, their participation is very good.  It is no harm to have academics exposed to the reality of county councillors.  County councillors may not win Nobel prizes for literature or for any other area of human activity, but they have one common feature, namely, an extraordinary degree of common sense.  This is not always present in academic discourse.  It is important that the representative status of the county councils be continued and protected by the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this matter.  This may be a misreading of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this Bill undermines the academic freedoms which we regarded over the years as important.  While the Bill has been dramatically changed, it is still a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation.  I will be opposing it when it comes to a vote.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  Níl a fhios agam go gcuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille, ach gheobhaimid amach de réir a chéile.  There are many things in the Minister's speech and in the Bill which I agree with but there are some assertions which are highly aspirational and which should not be allowed pass without comment.</P>
      <P>In her speech the Minister said that in contrast to an earlier situation where universities were bastions of privilege, &ldquo;Today, they are open to all on the basis of ability&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister does not need me to point out to her that the inequity and inequality of access makes that a very aspirational statement rather than a reflection of reality.  There has been some small improvement in access among the poorer sectors of society, but we still have a very heavily stratified admission and access route and we are nowhere near achieving the objective of universities being open to all on the basis of ability. While I endorse the aspiration, we must not cod ourselves that we are remotely near achieving it. We are simply not at the stage of having a university system accessible to all who have the necessary intellectual capacity.  We are nowhere near there.  We have a huge distance to go and I know the Minister accepts that.  There is no justification for having that in the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>The Bill and the speech speak of universities as being obliged to devise policies to ensure greater access for the disadvantaged sectors of society. That is rhetorical unless resources are provided. Resources are a key factor in achieving the admirable aspirations expressed in the speech. The gap between the aspirations and resources is one of the more depressing aspects of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship between the Higher Education Authority and the universities as presented in the Minister's speech requires considerable clarification.  The Minister said that: &ldquo;The Higher Education Authority will now have a statutory requirement to assist the universities in achieving the objectives of Chapters IV, VII and VIII of the Bill.&rdquo;  If I wished to be adversarial, which I <Col N="1035" /> do not, I would say that &ldquo;assist&rdquo; is used almost in the sense of assisting the police with their inquiries. The context in which it occurs leaves it open to the suspicion that universities are the suspect or potentially guilty parties in some way.  I know that thought was as far from the Minister's mind as it is from reality, but that is the way in which it comes across.  I do not wish to emulate Senator Norris excavating the number of layers of potential meaning of a word, but words are part of the lifestyle of those of us who have nothing better to concern ourselves with.</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;They also allow the HEA, in a formal and statutory way, and from their sector wide perspective to inform a university of best practice nationally and internationally&rdquo;.  What impression does that convey of the image the Minister has of a university's capacity to understand what is going on in the university world both nationally and internationally?  Saying that the Higher Education Authority &ldquo;will inform a university of best practice&rdquo; implies that universities, which we are told elsewhere are excellent institutions which have made wonderful contributions, are apparently so ignorant of what is happening in the wider university world that they have to be informed of it.  If this choice of words was intentional, then it is unfortunate, and if it was unintentional it is even more revealing.</P>
    <P>I have very high regard for the current officers of the HEA.  They are gentlemen and alert to and concerned with achieving the highest possible educational standards.  However, this Bill does not simply concern the people there now.  This is long-term legislation and we have to keep in mind how the Bill might be used or misused later on. The impression of the relationship between the Higher Education Authority and universities in terms of their alertness to, knowledge of and understanding of activities in the wider university world is most unfortunate and most misleading. Words do matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of &ldquo;evaluation of all departments and faculties of the university&rdquo;. What is a faculty except a collection of departments? How can the faculty be evaluated independently of the departments within them?  There can be different relationships between faculties and departments.  The terms are only used towards the end of the Bill.  If it is intentional, it is a most unfortunate choice and, if it is unintentional, it is even more revealing.  I have very high regard for the current officers of the Higher Education Authority whom I have found gentlemanly, alert to and concerned about achieving the highest possible educational standards.  With regard to this Bill, we must bear in mind that we are not dealing simply with the people who are there at the moment; this is long-term legislation and we must bear in mind how the Bill might be used or misused by later generations.  The impression of the relationship between the Higher Education Authority and universities, in terms of their alertness to and their knowledge <Col N="1036" /> and understanding of activities in the wider university world as intimated by that choice of language is unfortunate and misleading.  Words do matter.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech, she refers to the evaluation of all departments and faculties of the university. What is a faculty but a collection of departments and how does one evaluate faculties independently from their constituent departments? There can be different relationships between faculties and departments but the words &ldquo;departments and faculties&rdquo; are used for the first time well into the Bill.  The bulk of real university life, as distinct from structures and so on, occurs in departments.  That is where most people spend much of their active university life.  To use the word &ldquo;department&rdquo;, undefined, at such a late stage in the Bill seems to suggest a certain distance from the reality of day to day life in universities.</P>
    <P>The core of any legislation on universities is objects and functions.  There is relatively little in this Bill about education although there is a great deal about power in education.  I do not think one can have any quarrel with the list of objects and functions listed in the Bill; they seem to be very sensible and, though I may table some amendments on Committee Stage, I do not question their substance.  I want to stress two things.  First, the phrase &ldquo;having regard to the resources available&rdquo; is used very late in the Bill.  This is something which might well be considered in connection with the objectives and functions also.  One can have any list of aspirations but their achievement will be determined, in large measure, by having regard to the available resources.  I will linger longer on the phrase in due course.  There is one point which I would regard as crucial to objects and which I would wish to see added.  I do not think the Minister should have any difficulty in adding it, given the strength of the excellent paragraph on academic freedom in her speech which is admirably conceived and expressed.  In the Bill, academic freedom is referred to in section 13(3) which states that a university shall be entitled to regulate its affairs in accordance with its independent ethos and traditions and the traditional principles of academic freedom.  That is well intentioned.  However, I do not like the use of the word &ldquo;entitled&rdquo;; it is a permissive word which gives the impression that this is a benevolent State which is permitting a university to behave in this way even though there is no obligation on it to do so.  The word &ldquo;required&rdquo; should have been used.</P>
    <P>The principle of academic freedom should be included among the objects of a university.  It is not simply a means to an end, it is an end in itself. It should be a function of a university to preserve, support and sustain the principles of academic freedom.  I ask the Minister to give her explicit commitment that the preservation and support of academic freedom should be included among the objects of a university.  It is entirely compatible with, and in the spirit of, the excellent paragraph <Col N="1037" /> in the Minister's speech and I would like to see it incorporated into the objects.  One may well preserve section 13 (3) but the commitment to the principle of academic freedom should be an integral part of university life and the relationship between a university and society.  That would be a major concern of mine in terms of determining my final position on the Bill.</P>
    <P>One might query much of the phraseology in the Bill but I will not linger on that at the moment.  When we move on to the issue of governance, it seems we are moving away from what should be the core of a university Bill which only takes up a page and a half compared with 10-12 pages on governance, most of which leaves me singularly cold.  There should be a reasonably wide representation of &ldquo;stakholders&rdquo; on governing bodies.  However, the precise way in which these pages were drafted must have taken considerable time and consultation.</P>
    <P>I am looking at the implications of this Bill for the time budgets of those responsible for its implementation, not least those of university presidents, provosts or whatever they are known as. &ldquo;Chief officer&rdquo; seems to be the current phrase &mdash;in a different context, I might query the hierarchical implications of &ldquo;officer&rdquo;.  The assumption that time seems to be virtually infinite in universities is one which I know is popularly shared. For those of us who actually do something, time is the most scarce resource of all.  It is not often factored in as a resource in the thought processes when education is being considered in this country.</P>
    <P>With reference to the composition of governing authorities in section 15(1) they are to consist of no fewer than 20 or no more than 38 members. What is sacrosanct about these figures?  If a governing authority were to have 19 members, could it not be a university?  If there were 39 members, would that transgress the definition of &ldquo;university&rdquo;? I appreciate the pressures to have various interests represented but I would prefer to see a more emphatic emphasis on the purpose of a university and what these interests can contribute towards achieving the qualities of excellence in teaching and research that universities and the public service are supposed to embody, as opposed to this calibrated, infinitely complex and elaborate structure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the terms of appointment or election to the governing bodies, those of us who are familiar with the way universities currently operate and with the personalities involved, might see no particular problem here.  However, we have to bear in mind that the people in office now will not be there forever and there may be a potential misuse of these possible constituencies in the hands of somebody who was not as committed to university values as are current presidents are.</P>
    <P>In the worst case scenario, the degree of academic representation on governing authorities could be sharply reduced in practice from what it is currently.  According to section 26, the majority <Col N="1038" /> of members of the academic council shall be members of the academic staff of the university. This is appropriate as it is difficult to have an academic council if the majority of members are not academic staff.  Apparently, this academic council is no longer to contain representatives of all departments or even heads of all departments, but is to consist of an appropriate range of academic disciplines as determined by the governing authority, whose composition could be heavily non-academic.</P>
    <P>I have no hang-ups about the superiority of academic thinking.  This legislation offers the potential of significantly greater presidential authority.  I am not saying this will happen in practice, but the potential is there.  I can envisage situations in which under the driving of a determined president, an academic council could be packed in a manner which is more conducive to the political interests of a president rather than concerned with the criteria of adequate representation or academic values.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live in these systems can see a worst case scenario, which may never happen. However, the legislation should not permit the possibility of it happening.  The thinking has been so concerned with accommodating various interests that it may have overlooked possible implications for relatively arbitrary activity in the internal organisation of universities as well as the potential for divisiveness, factionism and a whole range of qualities which would act against the interests the Bill is intended to promote.  This is from the perspective of the real world of academe as distinct from academic concepts of academe.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the provision which potentially restricts membership of the academic council to a smaller number of people. Professors and associate professors, whatever one may think of one's dearly beloved colleagues, ought to be in principle members of the academic council.  It is a strange definition of an academic council of a university if those who are presumed to be the leading academics in the institution&mdash; which is what professors and associate professors are supposed to be, although the choice may not be infallible&mdash;are not <i>ex officio</i> members of the academic council, which is the main representative of academic interest and values in universities. I ask the Minister to look at the implications of this because they may not have been thought through from this perspective.</P>
    <P>The details of the composition of various bodies have knock-on effects in terms of the quality of governance of universities that have not been adequately taken care of in this Bill.  The question of gender balance is an important one which the Minister is committed to.  Section 15 (10) states:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions under this section a governing authority shall ensure that each sex is represented on the governing authority in accordance with such gender balance as may from time to time be determined or approved by the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> There is a genuine problem as to how gender balance is achieved in as optimum and rapid a manner as possible.  I ask the Minister to look at this again.  I am opposed in principle to ministerial involvement except where it is absolutely necessary in the general function of universities.  A clause such as &ldquo;as may from time to time be determined or approved by the Minister&rdquo; is a potential temptation to the Minister and a potential threat to others.  It conveys the idea of an axe hovering all the time, which creates the wrong atmosphere for the proper relationship between universities, the Department of Education and the State in general.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see a simple statement to the effect that the normal gender balance provisions which now apply to membership of every public body shall apply and be achieved over a particular period.  I would prefer a shorter rather than longer period.  Much of this issue is about will. Many of the arguments advanced against gender balance are opportunistic, short term and self-serving. I would prefer a relatively short deadline where gender balance would be achieved on pain of whatever &mdash; I am not opposed to that.  I do not want hovering for an undefined period with Ministers of different dispositions and different ideological impulses fouling the relationship between the university sector and the Department of Education.  It is better to have a clean cut time limit which seems reasonable and realistic in the circumstances rather than it dragging on.  The potential for ill will and irritation on both sides does not do service to either at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>There is a huge amount of negative undergone, which I hoped was not necessary, in much of the phraseology in this Bill.  The Minister's attention has been drawn to the question of a visitor.  There is a strong case for a standing visitorial arrangement with the National University and other universities, perhaps similar to that of Trinity and Queens.  Universities are huge and complex institutions and matters cannot be conducted on a personal basis, as was done until relatively recently.  There is potential for the paralysing of institutions when serious conflict breaks out between senior officers.  The Minister knows as well as I that we do not have to go outside my own institution to see a recent example of that.</P>
    <P>The visitorial principle should not be implemented retrospectively to try to resolve problems which have exploded but should head off problems.  A visitor should keep tabs on what is happening and be alert to the potential for internal conflict which does serious damage to institutions, the consequences of which can linger for a long time even when they are no longer visible to the wider public.  Visitation should be a constructive managerial component of universities rather than an emergency retrospective measure which tries to sort out a serious situation which may not have arisen if provisions had existed for taking action at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> I was involved in the latter stages of trying to find a resolution to problems in my own institution. I know the problems involved. and the damage that can be done to institutions.  I know the Minister has the good of the institutions at heart.  I am not threatening to vote against the Minister on this matter.  It is a question of trying to work out the problems.  There are no simple solutions. However, I am convinced it will add greatly to the quality of this Bill if the Minister and here officials are able to find a way which can conceive of the visitation functions as a normal part of the total structure of management rather than as an emergency provision to be activated once in the blue moon when things have become so impossible that it is beyond reason for them to be resolved internally.  That is not the way universities ought to operate ideally and this is one place where the State can make a positive contribution by thinking through those implications.</P>
    <P>On sections 24 (5) (a) and 24 (5) (b), which relate to remuneration, there is a basic contradiction between the approach of two mindsets to universities. One is that universities ought to be engines of dynamic change, centres of innovation, taking risks or inculcating enterprise culture in society, while the other still involves a mentality of control over universities, that is, they shall not be permitted to diverge from guidelines or principles. Section 24 (5) (a) states:</P>
    <P>A university may depart from levels of remuneration, fees, allowances and expenses ... where the governing authority is satisfied that it is necessary to meet the objects of the university, but may do so only in accordance with a framework which shall be agreed between the universities and An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>Section 24 (5) (b) states:</P>
    <P>A corporation referred to in ... may pay to employees of a university remuneration, ... only in accordance with the framework which shall be agreed between the universities and An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>We are entering an age where there will, and ought to, be more competition between Irish universities and between Irish universities and other universities.  An uncompetitive situation has existed in Irish universities.  I am not suggesting that it will reach the American stage, but it will go in the direction of some competition.  It is essential that university managements have the authority to recruit the best people for a particular job if they are convinced that this is a top policy priority.  Suppose one wants to bring back a first class Irish mind from America who is already in a good position and who is willing to return to Ireland but is not in a position to accept a sharply reducted standard of living.  Are universities to be trapped within the rigid, fixed salary scales which pertain to the generality?</P>
    <P>If we want universities to be at the cutting edge of change in a number of areas and be able to <Col N="1041" /> recruit competitively internationally&mdash;this Bill is full of references to the international context and I am, like the Minister is, a great believe in that &mdash;we must be able to offer competitive rates to the highest calibre recruits.  How long will mechanisms or frameworks of agreement take in practice? It is often the case that such decisions must be made rapidly?  It can be a matter of a telephone call.  The mindest behind this is utterly incompatible with the idea of a cutting, thrusting, competitive institution trying to get the best people in a specific situation and being able to offer a package which will make it worth a person's while not just to come back for one year but which will give the person an idea of what he or she is being let in for over the medium to long-term period.</P>
    <P>There is no point talking, however sincerely, about the need to make universities more competitive, quality assured and all these wonderful phrases which trip off our tongues if we are not prepared to put our money where our mouth is and make sure we are in a position to get the best when they are available and we want them.  That is high quality management.  I find it incongruous that there should be the intimation running through the Bill that university management is somehow defective unless all these various bits and pieces are added and at the same time its freedom of manoeuvre shall be contained and confined within frameworks agreed in a bureaucratic manner over time.</P>
    <P>The State must be clear about what it wants from its universities.  If it wants the sort of universities it is talking about in a new millennium, it must adapt its concept of university management accordingly.  I believe in strong universities.  I do not believe in arbitrary leadership but in strong leadership.  One of the essentials for strong leadership is the availability of resources to make one's mark, and there is little evidence of that here.  In fact, in so far as there is express reference, it is going entirely in the opposite direction, as in the clauses which I quoted.</P>
    <P>I am baffled at what is envisaged with regard to planning and evaluation in the Bill.  I should say that I am generalising widely from my experience of universities.  I have taught in nine universities in five countries, I have examined in 14 universities in several countries in 11 subjects and I have sat on governing bodies in various universities in various countries.  That is not an ego trip, or at least it is not only an ego trip; it is simply that I come with some experience of which I speak.  I find that much of what is contained in the Bill on planning and evaluation is academic, in the most derogatory sense possible.  It bears little relation to how decisions are made.  Section 32 (1) states:</P>
    <P>A governing authority shall, ... require the chief officer to prepare a plan which shall set out the aims of the governing authority for the operation ... and its strategy for achieving those aims, and for carrying out the functions ... <Col N="1042" /> during the period, being not less than three years, to which the plan relates.</P>
    <P>Who could be against a three year plan as it is a pretty good strategy?  However, one cannot plan without some idea of budget.  Section 32 (2) states that &ldquo;A governing authority may, having regard to the resources available to the university, either approve a strategic development plan... &ldquo;or approve it with modifications.  Therefore, as the Bill is phrased, the chief officer has no regard to resources available to the university.  The governing authority is the first to be charged with &ldquo;having regard to the resources available to the university&rdquo; and that is the first hint of realism in much of what is contained in the Bill because the previous 27 pages do not contain a solitary reference to resources available to universities.  The implication is that a chief officer will draw up a three year strategic plan without reference and the governing authority will note it, taking account of the available resources.  That is not the way it operates.  Why is it only in section 32 (2) that the first reference to resources appears?</P>
    <P>The same thing occurs with quality assurance procedures, and this sticks in an academic's craws &mdash;we have craws; some may even have claws, but that is a different matter.  We all want quality assurance.  Did the strategic management initiative say something about quality assurance in Departments, the HEA, agencies, etc?  I would like to see some of its results carried out by international experts.  Section 33 (1) states that there will be quality assurance &ldquo;aimed at improving the quality of education... &ldquo;every ten years.  These seem to be permissive in many respects, but let us leave that aside.  Section 33 (2) goes on to state that quality of teaching will be assessed by people &ldquo;who are competent to make national and international comparisons&rdquo; and these will be published. Section 33 (2) states that the governing authority will implement the findings &ldquo;having regard to the resources available to the university&rdquo;. Is the evaluation to be carried out without reference to the resources available?</P>
    <P>To take a simple example, the quality of teaching nowadays depends at least partly on information technology.  We are all talking about information technology until it comes out of our ears.  Senator O'Toole very properly spoke about computers in primary schools but I know university departments, although I will not mention the institutions, whose entire annual equipment budget would not purchase one PC.  We are in cloud cuckoo land when we speak of evaluating independently of resources.  It is as if the interrogation is to be conducted against some abstract perfect criteria by the best international standards without reference to the resources available to the people doing the job.  Then when it comes to the governing authority it says &ldquo;Yes, that is not very good but the poor devil had nothing to start with in the first place&rdquo;.  We cannot plan or evaluate seriously unless resources are at the centre. Everything must be evaluated in the light of the resources and opportunities that are available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> There are exceptions but by and large when one looks at the research or teaching resources available to Irish universities it is remarkable what has been achieved in terms of university performance, however we choose to evaluate it.</P>
    <P>There is something missing from the Bill but it would have been difficult to include it, so I am not being unduly querulous about it.  There is a sweeping reference to excellent universities, but how good are they?  If you want to argue that they are excellent or awful, what criterion is used?</P>
    <P>We ask our young people to enter third level education at the youngest age in Europe.  The Minister is well aware of this.  We give them the shortest degree courses in many areas.  We produce the youngest graduates, in many cases by several years, compared to any other EU country. We expect them to be internationally competitive on the basis of that education.  While it is not a scientific observation, I suggest the number of them that is internationally competitive is remarkable.  From that crude but not irrelevant observation, universities must be doing something right despite all the criticisms that may be made of them.</P>
    <P>The section on planning and evaluation refers to annual budgets under the heading of finance, property and reporting.  The Minister for Finance has begun introducing three year rolling budgets, so why are universities to have three year plans and one year budgets?  You cannot effectively plan or budget for an institution such as a university, which is concerned with the medium and longer term, simply on a one year basis.  The lack of compatibility in the planning and evaluation section as well as in the finance, property and reporting section again points up one of the internal contradictions of the Bill which is that one wants to be expansive and at the same time one does not want to let go of control.</P>
    <P>Whatever we might say, when we look at the detailed provisions there is an internal contradiction between many of these conditions that badly needs to be teased out on Committee Stage.  This is not contrary to the principle of the Bill, but as it is, many of these provisions hamstring ones that could be changed without subverting the principles at all and in a way which would lead to much more potentially effective management.</P>
    <P>I could linger over many other aspects of the Bill but I will not do so because some of them will arise on Committee Stage.  I will return to the central inadequacy &mdash; I am not using the word &ldquo;inadequacy&rdquo; in too querulous a manner &mdash; which is the disjunction between aspirations and resources.  That was the point I began with.</P>
    <P>I am emphatically committed to equality policy as I know the Minister is also.  On this issue, section 34 (1) states:</P>
    <P>A governing authority shall, as soon as practicable but not later than 12 months after it is established under this Act and at such other times as it thinks fit, require the chief officer <Col N="1044" /> to prepare a statement of the policies of the university in respect of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) access to the university and to university education by economically or socially disadvantaged people, by people who have a disability and by people who have a society significantly under represented in the student body, and</P>
    <P>(b) equality, including gender equality, in all activities of the university,</P>
    <P>and the chief officer, in preparing the statement, shall have regard to such policies on those matters as may from time to time be determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a potential cause of tension there but that is not my main concern.  After that has all been done in exactly the same way as planning the strategy, what happens?  Section 34 (2) states that &ldquo;A governing authority may... either approve the statement prepared under subsection (1) without modification or, after consultation with the chief officer, approve the statement with such modifications as it thinks fit&rdquo;.  How?  &ldquo;Having regard to the resources available to the university&rdquo;. So, the chief officer is required to prepare a plan of access for people who have a disability, etc.  I am emphatically in favour of improving access, as we all are, but the universities' own resources will not make much difference there because those resources come ultimately from the State in large measure.</P>
    <P>I have given consistent examples of the way the words &ldquo;having regard to resources&rdquo; occur in the Bill, but why are those words only used after the chief officer has submitted the plan without any reference to resources at all?  Loath though I am to criticise, it seems there is much in this Bill which can and ought to be refined in terms of having a managerially effective Bill as distinct from one which is still far stronger on the aspirational side.  For all the criticisms that can legitimately be made of them, our universities have an enormous amount to contribute.</P>
    <P>I reject with the same contumely with which others have done, the implication that universities have somehow been evading some sort of responsibility and accountability.  On the accountability side there is scope for requiring the plans to be not simply aspirational statements but specific plans about developments in every area, sectors and department of the university, and that budgets allocated are for the achievement of those plans.  We are talking about openness and transparency, but as regards accountability at present is very unclear to many people within universities how precisely resources are allocated.  It seems to me that is a right which people within and outside universities ought to have.  In other words, part of the problem with interventionism is that it is much too restrictive where it need not be and it is not precise enough in those areas where precision would be in the interests of the institution and of the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> Perhaps I have given too negative an impression of the Bill because I have had to concentrate on aspects of it that I find inadequate. There is much of value in the Bill but it would be much better, without subverting the principles upon which it is based, if some of the concerns I have expressed can be attended to between now and the later stages, if there are later stages.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt as well.  I thank Senator Lee for curtailing his remarks.  I want to take up one of the points he made.  He said the Bill is about power.  I would put it more emphatically than that.  When I look at the Bill I wonder why it is necessary at all.  When I first heard that the Bill was to be introduced I wondered what it was all about.  It is quite obvious from the Minister's speech this morning when she used unacceptable words like &ldquo;impose&rdquo;, that this Bill was about power when it was first published and it is about power now.  It is about who runs the universities.  Even with the changes made in the Bill, the power finally rests with the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>One has only to look at the history of this Bill to realise the thinking behind it.  This Bill has been mooted for as long as the Minister has been in power.  It was the subject of much negotiation with the universities.  It was understood by Dublin University, which had rooted objections to much of the thinking behind the Bill, that an acceptable Bill would be published with the most objectionable parts removed.  To its amazement, an unacceptable Bill was published last summer.  It was not amazing that it was unacceptable but that someone did not have the political acumen to realise this Bill would have to be changed to get through the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>After it was published, the authorities in Dublin University were staggered and were prepared to make a public stand against it.  The Minister and the Department suddenly realised they were up against a problem.  They would either be in direct confrontation with the university or the Bill would not get through the House, both of which were politically unacceptable.  After years of negotiations, when people thought their objections has been taken on board, they went back to renegotiate the Bill, which was an unusual step and a glorious retreat for the Minister.  I do not want to underestimate the achievement of all those from the universities who got this Bill changed with the acceptance of 104 amendments on Committee Stage, which is close to a record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> I told the Minister I would not be able to vote for it in that form.  I ask myself if I can vote for it in its present form.  My decision and that of many Senators will depend on what the Minister says in her reply next week.  It seems the ideology behind the Bill is still there and that the balance of power has moved more towards the State than the universities.</P>
    <P>My principal objection to the Bill is not unpredictable in that it relates to the issue of political nominees.  The language in section 15 and the verbiage about consultation by the Minister with the chief officer, which means nothing, and about political nominees being appointed by the governing authority on the nomination of the Minister mean that the Minister of the day will be entitled to put a party nominee on the board. That is an innovation and a backward step for Dublin University.</P>
    <P>I do not just object to a Labour Party nomination; I would have equal objections to Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or any party nominations to the board of Trinity College.  However, the record of the Labour Party in Government in nominating people to boards has been disgraceful.  I foresee the day when this Minister or another Minister will put members of their party on the boards of universities because they are members of their party and their loyalty is to it.  I base my concerns not on a hysterical fear of political nominees but on the evidence I have seen in the past few years of Labour Party patronage, which has been ruthless and unacceptable.  I do not see why I should accept any assurances that this Minister or a future Minister will not do this in the case of the universities because the record shows that all parties in this Government appoint their friends, relations and Party political hacks to boards, State agencies and semi-State boards.</P>
    <P>The Government parties will say they are not appointed for that reason but for reasons of accountability.  That is nonsense.  There have been political nominees on the boards of semi-State bodies for years but they did not stop what happened in Greencore, which was then called the Irish Sugar Company, or in Telecom Éireann. What is the need for political watchdogs on the boards of universities answerable to the Minister? Unless this issue is clarified satisfactorily by the Minister, I will have no hesitation in voting against the Bill.  Political nominees from the Labour Party or any other party are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee referred to section 34 (1).  I welcome equality policy but I have a problem with the language which symbolises the Bill.  It talks about equal entry to university from sections of society which are under-represented.  Nobody would disagree with that because that is what we want.  However, it also states it should be done after the chief officer has prepared a statement which &ldquo;shall have regard to such policies on those matters as may from time to time be determined by the Minister&rdquo;.  In other words, equality means what the Minister says it means.  Does &ldquo;sections of society significantly under-represented&rdquo; mean <Col N="1047" /> what the Minister says it means?  Does it mean that if the Minister decides there are not enough prisoners in the universities and they do not have equal representation there, they should be allowed out for the day?  Does it mean there are not enough people from certain geographic areas &mdash;for example, from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown &mdash;who must be admitted?  Equality, according to this clause, means what the Minister says it means.  The meaning of &ldquo;significantly under-represented&rdquo; is a political decision.  They are only two of the areas which must be satisfactorily dealt with if I am to vote for this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) a nominee of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister heard my views on this matter on Committee Stage.  I am excited about the Dublin docklands development and I congratulate the Minister on the concept behind it.  Our amendments simply seek to improve the legislation.</P>
      <P>The success of the scheme will depend on something different from the traditional solid, secure but unenterprising traditions associated with some local development authorities in the past.  I am pleased there has been a strong response to many of the developments which were proposed in the Lower House and in the Seanad in order to ensure that the council which runs the development will have economic regeneration at the top of its priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On previous occasions I have criticised the composition of the council.  It appears to be composed largely of those who represent the past rather than the future.  On Committee Stage I said the interest of Bord Gáis results from the fact that it owns the gasometers and the surrounding land.  That body will not be among the movers and shakers of the development.  I had a similar view about the involvement of the ESB. <Col N="1048" /> Both are major landowners in the area and it is important that they get the best value for their land.  However, they will not represent the people who will make this development happen.  If there are to be tourism and leisure activities, small enterprises and other developments, they will not be generated from the past but from the future. We are seeking to secure the economic regeneration of Dublin's docklands.  It would be ridiculous to appoint a board that did not include the type of people who will make these developments occur, and the activities and enterprises we hope to generate are not those we expect Bord Gáis or the ESB to provide.  Such developments will be generated by people who already concentrate on and have experience in creating tourism, leisure and enterprise activities.</P>
    <P>I tried to think about the type of person who would fit that description and Harry Crosbie came to mind.  Harry Crosbie came from and owned land in the area.  His development of the Point Depot has been a marvellous success in creating tourism and leisure activity.  He did that because of the type of person he is.  He is the typical example of the type of person we want to get involved in the docklands development.  If we do not guarantee a space for the many Harry Crosbies of this world, by including people who generate their own businesses and remain in the area, there is a danger of a future Government appointing people to those positions who are not of the same calibre.</P>
    <P>When the Chamber of Commerce proposed that it should nominate at least one person to the council, it appeared to be an ideal arrangement. IBEC would be an equally suitable nominating body.  There are 25 members of the council and places have been guaranteed for Bord Gáis, CIE, the ESB and two civil servants, one of whom will represent the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  A place is not guaranteed for a civil servant to represent the Department of Enterprise and Employment, a most important Department in this regard.  There are also no guaranteed places for other State agencies such as Forbairt or IDA Ireland.  Most importantly, there is no guaranteed place for enterprise or business, and this amendment seeks to guarantee such a place.</P>
    <P>Much of the property in the area is privately owned.  The majority of the money that will be invested in the development will come from the business sector.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce is by far the most broadly based and respected business organisation in Dublin.  It has been claimed that if Dublin Chamber of Commerce is given a place on the authority, there would be multiple demands from other organisations.  That is not plausible.  There is no business organisation in Dublin that is comparable in size to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  If it is proposed to widen private sector representation, other organisations can be considered.  However, at the minimum, a permanent place for Dublin Chamber of Commerce is essential.  The case is so strong I urge the <Col N="1049" /> Minister of State to give it serious consideration. It would not set a precedent.  The Dublin Docklands development will achieve a great deal more with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce represented on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The case was adequately put but special pleading is special pleading, however eloquently it is put.  If one follows the debate on this issue the entrepreneurial spirit to which Senator Quinn referred is a prerequisite to the successful development of the Dublin Docklands but to put forward a case that Dublin Chamber of Commerce, however worthy a body it may be, has such special expertise that it should have a reserved place on the council rather than be one of the nominating bodies, is going too far.  Chambers of commerce around the country differ enormously by reputation and their contributions to the local economy.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn is fortunate he is an Independent Member but those of us involved in politics and looking at interaction between groups know that business politics is alive and well in such bodies. It does not automatically follow that, because one reserves a place on an authority for the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, one will necessarily get the person best equipped to deliver the package the Government wants.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned 25 places but there were many groups who felt they should as a right have a designated seat on the council.  I respect the fact Senator Quinn is openly promoting the case of one specific body; it is part and parcel of why we are here.  However, I urge the Minister of State not to accept this amendment.  I accept the Senator's point in regard to the State but I said previously the State is a major player and the inclusion of the Civil Service is stretching it too far.  The Government has a strong claim to its representation on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>During the debate on this Bill in the Dáil and <Col N="1050" /> in the course of earlier debate in this House, I explained that with so many organisations concerned with the economic development of the docklands area it would be impossible to provide each with a place on the council.  However, provision is made in section 16 (5) (a) for organisations of this nature to be prescribed for the purpose of selecting candidates for appointment to the council.  The Minister has previously undertaken to include the Dublin Chamber of Commerce when regulations for the purpose of that section are being made.  I reiterate that undertaking. On the basis of the Minister's undertaking, Fianna Fáil withdrew a similar amendment in the Dáil.  I respectfully ask Senators opposite to do likewise with this amendment.</P>
      <P>None of that will exclude people, such as Harry Crosbie, from the membership of this council. There will be several opportunities for such people to be represented on the council.</P>

Senator Magner has just referred to them and I fully support them.  Departments and other State bodies should be represented. However, they are not the bodies to represent the State.  It does not make sense to exclude the business world, the sector which will make this area work.</P>

      <P>It may well be that this Government will make sure the business community is represented on it but are we sure a Government of the future will do likewise?  We do not have that guarantee.  If the Minister of State is going to guarantee some places, the business community which will make this area work should be guaranteed a place.  The original plans for the Custom House Docks were grandiose and were not carried out.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt that tourism and leisure will make this area successful.  If one looks back at the plans in existence ten years ago for the Custom House one will find they worked very well but not in the way that had been initially thought.  It will come about through small active businesses.  If we are to have fixed places for the State there must be at least one guaranteed fixed place for the business entrepreneurial area.  I urge the Minister of State to accept that.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to delete section 39. We have strong objections to the bias in the section against members of local authorities.

In the last debate on the Universities Bill, I took great exception to a point made by Senator Ross when he in effect said that to be involved in political life is to find oneself excluded from public office or holding office on bodies of this sort.  All this amendment does is to state that those involved in public life, with the expertise, experience and commitment that involves, will not be excluded from serving on an authority of this sort.</P>

For too long we have accepted that it is par for the course to exclude public representatives when, as the Leader said, it is wrong in principle. That they are public representatives sets them apart in terms of their contribution to their local areas, regions and nation.  If people are fit and the public sees them as fit to be elected, they ought to be fit to serve on boards in that capacity or any other they choose.  I support the amendment.  As I said last night to Senator Daly, it is valuable and has cross party support.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment.  I welcome the deletion from the Bill of the section which excluded public representatives from the board.  I am delighted there was no division on it because, very soon, we will all have to knock on the doors of local authority members seeking their support for re-election, which is one important issue which should be thought of.  As well as that, it is ludicrous to exclude them.  I do not know why these sections are included in legislation. It has happened on several occasions and we have called a combined halt today.

That a person has the courage to go before the public to be elected should stop them <Col N="1053" /> being a member of an authority such as the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is ludicrous. No section of Society should be excluded from being appointed to a board, especially a person who has the courage to go before the people and be successfully elected.

      <P>On the basis of the case made by Senators on both sides of the House on section 39, which this amendment seeks to delete, I have discussed it with the Minister; he has reconsidered the provision and will accept the amendment. I was in favour of the case made by Senators last night.  As a councillor for 14 years on a voluntary and unpaid basis &mdash; I am excluded from being one now by virtue of the office I hold &mdash; it was a source of constant anger and frustration among councillors that legislation was regularly passed by the House of the Oireachtas which excluded them from positions.  The rot set in with the Planning Appeals Board.  That was understandable because it should not have members of the planning authorities on it where there is a conflict of interest.  But that standard section was included in other legislation and went unnoticed by either House or the Minister's office and did much damage.</P>
      <P>The discussion last night and tonight demonstrates there is value in the debate in this House, where legislation is examined in a detailed way and valuable contributions are made.  It has had the effect in this case of having three or four amendments made to the Bill during the debate. I welcome the proposal from Senator Daly and Senator Fitzgerald and I am glad to accept it. There are consequential numbering amendments made to it by the draftsman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Education to honour an agreement between the people of Dysart and her Department to provide transport for post-primary pupils, particularly to Athlone. This agreement was reached in the late 1960s because of a decision not to build a post-primary school at Dysart and it was to provide transport to Athlone, Ballinasloe, Roscommon and Ballygar.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks the Department of Education indicated through Westmeath vocational education committee that it no longer intends to implement that agreement and that the arrangements will discontinue from the start of the 1998 academic year.  It came as a major shock to the people in that area that an arrangement they had for years was going to be ended.</P>
      <P>I attended a public meeting in the community and sport centre in Dysart some weeks ago where a large number of parents expressed their total opposition to the move.  Many people from the community felt that, while it may not be of direct concern to them now, it could be their problem in the future.  There is great anger regarding the proposal to remove a service that was agreed many years ago.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that this proposal should be made now, because on 27 May 1996 a representative from the Department of Education wrote to the principal of St. Mary's school in Ballygar confirming the existence of the agreement and indicating that pupils from the Dysart area &ldquo;were allowed transport to the neighbouring centres of Athlone, Ballinasloe, Ballygar and Roscommon&rdquo;. There is no reference on file that only pupils attending Athlone community college would be picked up in Dysart.  This effectively means that if students wished to go to the other towns they would be entitled to do so, but they have opted for Athlone because of the extensive range of schools available there.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Education to honour the agreement between the people in Dysart and the Department of Education which dates from 1968. There is a full record of this agreement in the Department; I have written confirmation of it in a letter of May 1996.  I hope the Minister can tell the people that the arrangement will be honoured and will continue to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When questioned Westmeath vocational education committee, effectively the transport authority, said they understood that there might be some encroachment of the catchment area of St. Mary's in Ballygar.  That would be nothing new to the people of Dysart because that was in place <Col N="1055" /> 27 years before.  We do not understand why it arises now.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great public concern.  Forty three families were represented at the meeting I attended in Dysart.  The Minister can understand how upset these people and the hundreds of other families who have sent their children to schools in Athlone under a fully recognised agreement are at the new proposal.  I hope the Minister will confirm to the House that the agreement between the people of Dysart, their public representatives and the Department will continue.  It has been fully availed of by the people of Dysart.  The arrangement could be questioned if it was only used on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and did not receive the full support of the community.  However, the transport arrangement has been used to its full extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising this matter.  It gives me an opportunity to outline the position in relation to school transport for post-primary pupils from Dysart, County Roscommon.  I understand that Dysart is in the Ballygar catchment area and that the pupils in question are attending schools in the Athlone catchment area.</P>
      <P>By way of general comment, I should explain some basic facts about the school transport scheme.  Bus Éireann, as agents of the Department of Education, has a responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 160,000 primary and post-primary pupils to schools throughout the country.  The Department has responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best value for the money spent on this service.  It does not come cheaply.  In 1996 the net cost to the State was £40 million.</P>
      <P>One of the main objects of the schools transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from schools and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.  For the purpose of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre.  Recognised post-primary pupils who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they live are eligible for transport under the school transport scheme to that centre.</P>
      <P>At all times, it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice. However, it is not the object of the school transport scheme to facilitate parents in exercising that choice.  In such instances, eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one, may be allowed transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended.  This is subject to there being accommodation available on the existing service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred.  Pupils availing of this concession are known as catchment boundary pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> The Department of Education may not sanction an extension of a service into any adjoining catchment area as an encroachment would constitute an infringement of the terms of the post-primary transport scheme.  In such circumstances, the school authorities in that area would be quite entitled to seek restraint.  Schools are sensitive to the loss of pupils from their area and the consequent loss of teaching posts.</P>
    <P>The case referred to by the Senator is that pupils from the Dysart area live in the Ballygar post-primary centre catchment area.  The most they may be granted in respect of attendance at adjoining post-primary centres is catchment boundary transport subject to the normal conditions of the transport scheme.  The arrangement referred to by the Senator whereby pupils from the Dysart area are transported from the Ballygar catchment area arose from an application for a new school in Dysart which was refused by the Department of Education in 1967.  The children of the Dysart area were then allowed transport to Athlone, Ballinasloe, Ballygar and Roscommon post-primary centres.</P>
    <P>In November 1968, an extension of the service to Athlone post-primary centre was granted.  The service in question was extended from Cam Cross, which is within the Athlone catchment area to Thomas Street in the Ballygar catchment area.  This extension was allowed to facilitate a small number of families at a time when the Dysart school had been refused and post-primary facilities in the Ballygar catchment area were not considered to be fully adequate.</P>
    <P>The Ballygar school authority has complained to the Department of Education and to the transport liaison officer for County Westmeath about the continued encroachment of the Athlone service into the Ballygar catchment area.  They want this encroachment to cease under the terms of the school transport scheme.</P>
    <P>St Mary's College, Ballygar is now a fully developed post-primary centre with a full curriculum available to junior and senior cycle pupils. The basis for the previous arrangement whereby pupils from the Dysart area were allowed transport from within the Ballygar catchment area no longer exists.  The anomaly which has existed in this area in respect of an encroachment of a transport service from one catchment area to an adjoining one is now being addressed by the transport liaison officer for County Westmeath with the support of the Department.  Accordingly, from 1 September 1998, pupils from the Dysart area who wish to avail of transport facilities to post-primary schools in Athlone may be facilitated from the nearest pick-up point inside the Athlone catchment area.  The availability of such transport will be subject to the normal conditions of the transport scheme.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the case made by Senator Finneran.  On the basis of what he has said, there is a valuable case for continuing this service.  I will bring the details of what he has said to the attention of the Minister and I will ask her <Col N="1057" /> to re-examine the decision that has been made by her Department.  St. Mary's School, Ballygar has not suffered arising from the transport of children to the Athlone schools.  It has, in fact, thrived in the interim.  I will refer back to the Senator at a later date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response which, to some extent, is in conflict with the official line from the Department of Education. He has obviously considered the case from a public and personal point of view and I am very pleased about that.  Hopefully, the Minister for Education will sanction the continuation of the arrangement which was in place for 30 years.  It would be unfortunate if the service was withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking my question which calls on the Minister for Education to provide an extension to Illistrim national school outside Letterkenny.  Naomh Fiachra national school, roll no. 12077, has been seeking the provision of additional accommodation to accommodate the possible appointment of a fourth assistant teacher to the school.  At present, the school houses 128 pupils in a four teacher school.  Over the past eight years, the school has seen a steady increase in pupil numbers from just over 70 in 1989 to the present figure of 128; the figure is expected to rise in the coming years.  The school was bitterly disappointed with the letter it received recently from the primary school building section of the Department of Education on 14 February which stated that there was no commitment to improve the educational facilities at Illistrim national school.  The department planning section recently advised that, although the enrolment in the school has risen over the past eight years, long-term accommodation requirements at the school will be four permanent classrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this is acceptable for a school which is making the effort to look after the interests of its pupils.  I am annoyed to note that, in the letter from the primary building section, it indicated to the school that if there was a shortage of space a GP room could be used in an emergency to house the additional teacher.  However, the school was not interested in losing its GP room for any length of time.  When I visited the school recently, the use being made of the GP room would not allow this to happen, nor do I believe it should be allowed to happen.  The room is currently being used for physical education, music, drama and concerts.  The school has a strong musical tradition; the fifth and sixth classes recently competed in the Le Crunch national final in the Olympia theatre in Dublin.  It would be very difficult to promote drama and all the other activities provided in the GP room if it were to be used as another classroom.  The school is committed <Col N="1058" /> to providing the highest level of education facilities in order that children can develop to their full potential.  In the light of the present situation, it feels that an extension to the school is the proper way forward.  It has a site for an extra classroom to be added to the school and we would definitely get value for the money spent on an extra classroom if this matter were addressed in this year's capital programme.</P>
    <P>Over the past eight years the numbers at the school have continued to grow steadily.  Letterkenny has been described as being one of the fastest growing towns in Europe.  Planning permission has been granted for in the region of 200 houses in the catchment area of Illistrim national school so the numbers will continue to grow in that area.  The board of management of the school are not interested in allowing the PE hall to be used as a classroom and they feel that the long-term accommodation should be at least six permanent classrooms.  People are interested in keeping their children in their own area.  It is a growing area and I ask the Minister to include Naomh Fiachra national school in this year's capital programme.</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator Maloney has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education's current position regarding the provision of an extension to Illistrim national school in Donegal.  The Minister for Education is aware that the school has a staffing level of four teachers consisting of a principal and three assistants. The current enrolment at the school is 128 pupils.  Based on this enrolment, it is likely that a fourth assistant teacher will be appointed to the school this September.  The accommodation in the school consists of four permanent classrooms, a general purpose room along with appropriate ancillary.</P>
      <P>Following a recent review of the accommodation needs of the school the Department's planning section has advised that, although the enrolment in the school has risen over the past number of years, the long-term accommodation requirements of the school will be four permanent classrooms.  The Department is, however, aware that with the possible appointment of an additional teacher this September there may be some short term accommodation difficulties at the school.  The next step is to determine how these accommodation difficulties can be overcome having regard to current budgetary constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for any proposed building project must be looked at in the light of existing contractual commitments and other priority projects.  At present, all available finance is committed on major capital projects and grants already sanctioned. The Minister will however be keeping expenditure on the primary school building programme under review during the year.  Funding to assist with the provision of additional accommodation <Col N="1059" /> at Illistrim will be considered again in the context of the review.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that the needs of the school will receive every consideration by the Department of Education at that time.  I thank <Col N="1060" /> him again for the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 March 1997.</P>
