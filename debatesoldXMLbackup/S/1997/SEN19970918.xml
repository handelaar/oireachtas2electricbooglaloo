      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline his plans to prevent the continued eutrophication of rivers and lakes in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have also had notice from Senator O'Dowd of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline his Department's response to the significantly high death rates from heart disease in females, respiratory disease in males and females, and cancer of the trachea bronchus lung in males in County Louth as evidenced by the mortality profile for County Louth 1991-5 as published by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Items 2 and 3 will be taken together for the purpose of discussion.  I propose to allocate 20 minutes for spokespersons and 15 minutes for other speakers.  Senators may share time.</P>

      <P>As far as Fine Gael is concerned, the Order of Business is agreed.  Yesterday, many long-serving Members were pleased to see Ms Mary Cummins of <i>The Irish Times</i> return to the Press Gallery.  She has covered the deliberations of this House for many years and everyone was pleased to see her back here.  The House should wish her a speedy and full recovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for agreeing to take item 1, the election of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, today.  I also thank him for agreeing to the long-standing tradition of office-sharing across the political divide in the House.  This encourages co-operation and greatly enhances the atmosphere in the Chamber.  I am glad the Leader moved with dispatch on this matter.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make available to the leaders of each group the programme of proposed legislation for the coming session during the next number of days?  It would be helpful if Members had advance knowledge of the legislation the Government proposes to introduce in order that they might do their homework.</P>
      <P>Commitments were given before the end of the previous Seanad's term of office that a certain number of items would be speedily restored to the Order Paper at the stage they had reached.  I refer specifically to the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, dealing with foreign adoptions, which reached Report Stage.  Will the Leader confirm that the commitments given last June by all parties will be honoured?  I am also interested in the future of the Shannon River Council Bill which was introduced during Private Members' Time by two Fianna Fáil Senators and received support from all sides of the House.  The Bill passed Second Stage and Members on this side of the House would gladly facilitate the Government parties in its restoration to the Order Paper.  I am sure the Leader will be able to facilitate us in that regard.  The third piece of legislation outstanding from the previous Seanad is the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill which was left in a state of suspension.  What is the Government's position in connection with this Bill?</P>
      <P>My final point relates to a matter of concern to all Members, namely, the way offices and secretarial staff are being allocated.  What we are experiencing at present is little short of scandalous. People on all sides, regardless of the parties to which they belong, have been left without offices.  I understand there has been an attempt by the Department of Finance to reduce the secretarial allocation agreed during the lifetime of the previous Seanad.  The allocation remains inadequate.  I do not believe the public is aware that office conditions do not, in a number of cases, meet the Department of Enterprise and Employment specifications.  The nub of the problem seems to be that the Seanad does not have control of basic matters of administration.  The House should have sole responsibility in this regard within the parameters of a budget allocated for that purpose.  The problems Members encounter in obtaining answers and having basic needs satisfied must be tackled immediately.  Will the Leader inform the House regarding his views on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the final sitting day last June I received a commitment from the then Leader of the House, Senator Manning, and the former <Col N="67" /> Leader of the Opposition, Senator Wright, to use their influence with the new Government in connection with the question of foreign adoptions, particularly the hardship suffered by those who adopted children born in South America.  I would like this matter to be dealt with as soon as possible and I support Senator Manning's comments in this regard.  During the last session the importance of the Seanad running its business on the basis of a budget was raised by Senator Manning. Yesterday I raised the issue of resources for Members.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should meet not just to consider the narrow question of secretarial help and office space but also to provide a brief report on the resources required by Members in order to discharge their functions as required under the Constitution, having regard also to the constitutional imperative that the House determines whether the level of support is adequate.  I want that to be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business. I also agree with the remarks of Senators Manning and O'Toole in terms of the organisation of business for the House.  There should be an early meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to look into the matter.  I welcome Mary Cummins back to the House, who I hope is in good health.  She has a long track record of providing good coverage on the proceedings of the House.  She is a model of such coverage and other media should pay attention.</P>
      <P>Has the Leader been successful in inviting the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as he agreed yesterday, to make a personal statement to the House today?  It is a pertinent matter as we will be discussing an amendment to the motion on the tribunal of inquiry that could have considerable relevance to the manner of our discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Leader of the House agreed yesterday that there should be an early debate on landmines.  This has become more imperative as it emerged last night that the Americans have decided they do not want to sign the international covenant on landmines.  They looked for a nine year derogation so that they can continue to place landmines along the borders of North Korea.  It is a country with which we may not agree politically, but landmines are anti-personnel weapons and to think that any civilised country would look for a nine year derogation from an international convention is a nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers on the facilities and conditions for Members.  The operation of the House must be dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition as well as the Leader of the House.  It is a nonsense that the Leader of the Opposition of a House of the Oireachtas does not receive an allowance other than that given to a Member on his or her first day to carry out the job necessary for the proper working of the House.  No money is provided for secretarial support. <Col N="68" /> We have been fighting against the lack of facilities in our offices for a long time.  It was only during the last session that the Leader of the House began to receive an allowance.  We should fight for an allowance for the Leader of the Opposition similar to that given to his equivalentin the Dáil.  If we look for telephones they will be provided because that is not a problem. Will the Leader approach the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Finance and the gurus in his Department who earn twenty times more than the Leader of the Opposition and who do not have as much work to do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan's comments regarding the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader raise the matter of the live export trade with the Minister for Agriculture, and Food?  It has been raised by a number of Senators in the past.  It is important that the live cattle export trade be opened up as a matter of urgency.  I ask the Leader to do whatever possible and to convey the message to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Lanigan on the debate on landmines and I look forward to a motion on this important issue being tabled by the Government.  I am sure Members on all sides will want to contribute and underline Senator Lanigan's trenchant comments about the astonishing attitude of the American Government, which is not justified militarily.  A number of its own military tacticians have indicated that landmines are not even a military advantage.  It is extraordinary that it sought a nine year derogation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the sharing of time, which also applies to the first speaker, throughout today's debate.  Does the Government propose bringing forward the Electoral Bill, which would provide for some degree of payment of electoral expenses to politicians and aspirant candidates on the basis of the number of votes cast?  This is important and when the Bill is brought forward it must be ensured that all Members of the House are included, not just Members of political parties.</P>
      <P>It is absurd that, unlike most European countries, we do not provide for electoral funding. When one spends considerable amounts of money on an election, one is not even allowed to write it off as a legitimate business expense.  This is the one profession which is penalised for making a contribution to Irish public life.  I hope the Government will have the resolution and nerve to bring the Bill forward early in the session.  I do not doubt it will be supported by all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Burke that the beef trade has been slow to reopen.  I ask the Leader to convey our concern to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  It is autumn and a large supply of cattle will be in the marts and provided for slaughter.  The prices are depressed at the <Col N="69" /> moment.  I know the Minister, Deputy Walsh, is doing everything in his power to reopen the Egyptian market.  However, he should go to Egypt to try to restore the market as the live cattle trade is very important to farmers.  They have taken a hammering in the past 12 months and this is continuing in the beef sector.  The sooner we open the live cattle trade and introduce some competition in the market, the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we wish to share offices, I remind the Leader that there are more than two groups in the House and I do not think that in the history of the Oireachtas anyone other than a Member of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael has held the position of Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach. The spirit of office sharing should be extended to all groups on a proportional basis and not confined to the two biggest parties in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It should also extend to idealists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise it is not office sharing but sharing between two parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with all my colleagues on a debate on landmines but we should push it further.  The arms trade kills more innocent people every year than the drugs trade, but there is only one difference between the two trades. Drugs are produced by poor people and sold to rich people while arms are produced by rich people and sold to poor people.  Therefore, we disapprove of one and approve of the other.  The debate should focus on the arms trade in general. The United States, Russia and China are refusing to subscribe to the convention on the ban of landmines because it will set a precedent for curbing the arms trade, one of the most lucrative industries in those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment.</P>
      <P>Members of the Seanad should know the percentage of secretarial support they will have.  The uncertainty in this regard is a bad reflection on public acknowledgement of its representatives. At a time when there appear to be substantial moneys available in every other aspect of public life, this uncertainty and lack of support for the elected representatives reflects a serious weakness in the structure of the Seanad.  The matter should be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support my colleagues regarding the importance of the live cattle trade.  As the Dáil is not in session, we should indicate the response of the Department of Agriculture and Food in conjunction with the farming organisations in organising support for the live cattle industry.  As outlined by previous speakers, this important sector operates from September until December each year and the public in general, particularly the farming community, want the Minister and farming <Col N="70" /> groups to make every effort to resolve this problem which is not in the interests of the agriculture sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments of previous speakers regarding the live cattle trade. It is vital for agriculture and the farming sector that the Minister travels as soon as possible to the countries involved in an effort to reopen those markets.  Earlier this year people believed the markets could be opened if the Minister travelled to the countries in question.</P>
      <P>Large numbers of cattle will be sold in the next couple of months.  The number of cattle being sold at marts is increasing steadily and factories will lower their prices once again if the live export market is not reopened.  Competition is the life of trade.  It is essential that no stone is left unturned by the farming organisations, the Government and everyone involved to reopen the live cattle market.  It is essential for life in rural Ireland and the agriculture industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Dr. Haughey Dr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the live cattle trade should include dead animals and their parts. The House may not be aware that the Department of Agriculture and Food recently banned the export of animal heads and a court case ensued.  The ban resulted in a small business in Northern Ireland going into liquidation and another is about to do likewise.  The ban on the export of animal heads indicates that we agree there is a problem with BSE here.  During the court case the judge stated that there appeared to have been undue pressure from the UK Government to impose such a ban.  It is a serious matter if we were pressurised into imposing a ban on the export of cattle heads.  That is significant to the livestock industry.  I ask the Leader of the House to raise this matter with the Minister with a view to including it in a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pleasure for me to exercise my vocal chords for the first time in the Seanad.  I support Senator Lanigan's comments on the landmines issue.  I join in the remarks expressed by my esteemed colleague, Senator Norris, who is a fellow &ldquo;Dub&rdquo;.  I approve of his comments on the Electoral Bill.  I am known for my brevity and I will conclude at that.</P>

      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House to reply I wish to point out that I was very tolerant this morning because I did not wish to dispel the perception of sweetness with which I was portrayed.  The Order of Business, however, is not an occasion for long contributions; it is an opportunity for Members to raise matters relevant to the business of the day.  I intend to be a little more strict in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the remarks of Senator Manning, as I am sure do all Members, in welcoming back Ms Mary Cummins.  She has been a <Col N="71" /> great supporter of Seanad business down the years.  On Senator Manning's proposal for a programme of legislation, it will be produced at the earliest opportunity, possibly in the first two weeks after we resume.  On the Senator's point about restoring items to the Order Paper, I will consider the possibility of doing that.  I will communicate with the Leader of the Opposition later in the day on the Shannon River Council Bill and the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill.</P>
      <P>Many speakers voiced concern about inadequate facilities.  I propose to hold a meeting of leaders of the groups at 12.30 p.m. in my office to discuss this urgent problem.  If necessary, we will come back to the House at a later stage on the matter.  I have been in this House for 15 years and the problem of lack of facilities is unprecedented. I support the comments in this regard and I am aware that other Members would have voiced their concern were it not for the time limit.</P>
      <P>I will communicate with Senator O'Toole on his comments about the Adoption Bill.  On Senator Costello's point about the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I tried to contact the Minister up to 12.30 a.m. this morning.  I understand the Minister attended the Northern Ireland talks until a very late hour.  I communicated with his office this morning by fax and await a reply.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Brien, Burke, Hayes and Chambers highlighted the grave concern, which is widespread, about the farming community.  Many farmers find themselves in unbelievable circumstances. While the Celtic tiger is alive and well in most industries, that is not the case in the farming industry.  The farming community is looking to the Minister to ensure the foreign trade is opened up again and he is doing everything in his power to help.  I will convey to him the concerns expressed, which he shares as he lives in a rural community.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan and other Senators expressed concern about the landmines issue.  As I said yesterday, we will try to have a debate on that issue at the earliest opportunity on our return.</P>
      <P>In regard to an item raised on yesterday's Order of Business, some Members have requested me to consider deferring the debate on the European currency for a week.  I have acceded to their request and that debate will take place on 15, 16 or 17 October.  That will allow Members time to prepare for one of the most serious debates we will have on the country's future.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised the matter of the Electoral Bill.  We all share his concerns in this regard. I will discuss with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, on his return from Cairo, the possibility of having it included in the autumn programme of debates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That Senator Liam T. Cosgrave be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>As I said on the Order of Business, all Members appreciate the continuation of the long-standing tradition that the two major constitutional offices of this House are shared between the Government and Opposition.</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure in moving this motion. Members of the last Seanad will not be surprised that Senator Cosgrave was the choice of our group.  He was a first class Cathaoirleach who inherited the office under tragic circumstances at a very difficult time for all Members.  As Cathaoirleach he was fair, approachable, in possession of a sense of humour and available to all Members.  Most of all, he has an understanding of politics and is perceived as being fair by all Members.  We will be very lucky if Senator Cosgrave is elected Leas-Chathaoirleach because we will have in him and the Cathaoirleach two people who are utterly respected by both sides of the House and who are first-class ambassadors for this House.  It gives me great pleasure to propose Senator Cosgrave as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to second the motion.  As Senator Manning said, those of us who have served with Senator Cosgrave over the years know his very fine qualities.  In the last Seanad he served as Opposition Whip, Government Whip and, in the last year, as Cathaoirleach. He was very courteous and impartial to all Members of that Seanad.  We all know his fine qualities and it gives me great pleasure to second his nomination.</P>

      <P>Since 1937 Fianna Fáil has honoured a tradition in this House which was only broken on one occasion, and not by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have great pleasure in supporting the nomination of Senator Cosgrave.  We had the experience of working under his stewardship as your predecessor, Sir.  He was very fair and impartial and, as the Leader of the Opposition said, he has a great sense of humour.  He has been a great friend of all Senators and I have great pleasure in supporting, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, his nomination as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>The Independent group has considered the position, as we do after every election. We wish to restate the position articulated by Senator Brendan Ryan this morning &mdash; we agree with the sharing of office between both sides of the House and we do not believe it should be in the gift of parties which happen to have larger numbers than other groups.  We had a number of chats with members of Fine Gael, the largest party on this side of the House, and it is not our intention to put forward a candidate on this occasion.  However, that does not mean anything in the context of future occasions.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I wish to support the nomination of Senator Cosgrave to the office of Leas-Chathaoirleach. He is well qualified for the office having been an excellent Cathaoirleach.  His family credentials were mentioned when he was elected to the office of Cathaoirleach and I will not reiterate them.  It is a good convention that the offices are shared by the opposite sides of the House and it reflects well on the Seanad.  I am happy to support Senator Cosgrave's nomination.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be back in the Seanad this morning.  I will not be able to stay all day as I have to meet with a number of parties from the North but I will be present for the opening speeches.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to again compliment Mr. Justice McCracken on his excellent report and on the manner in which he executed his difficult task.  The tribunal into certain allegations of payments by Dunnes Stores to politicians was established last February, consequent on resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  I welcomed its establishment, indeed I had long sought it.  I also welcomed the appointment of Mr. Justice McCracken as chairman in view of his expertise in commercial law, and in unravelling complex accounts, as well as his reputation for getting to the bottom of such matters quickly.  Mr. Justice McCracken brought all these attributes to bear on his task over the last number of months, and a debt of gratitude is owed to him by all of us. Indeed, it is also appropriate that we commend, as he does himself in his report, the work of the team, both legal and administrative, which assisted him so efficiently in his work.</P>
      <P>The report of the tribunal is a model of clarity and precision, and we have to face up to the severity of its judgment on what it has discovered. The findings of the tribunal in relation to Mr. Charles Haughey and Deputy Lowry are of the gravest concern to us all.  The tribunal found the behaviour of both to be unacceptable.  This is a finding with which I am sure we all agree.  Let me outline in particular what I, and I believe all of us, find unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unacceptable that people who have held high office and enjoyed a high degree of public trust should give evidence that is, in the words of the tribunal, unacceptable and untrue or deliberately conceal vital information from this House, or from a tribunal set up by this House.  There is no excuse for this.  It is also unacceptable, that in the case of Mr. Haughey, full co-operation was withheld from the tribunal, forcing the tribunal to <Col N="75" /> undertake lengthy, painstaking and costly research to establish facts which could have been established almost at once with his full co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that in a manner hitherto concealed from the public, a Taoiseach should be personally supported to the tune of £1.3 million. It is appalling that any businessman should be able to believe, even if wrongly, that he could in any sense buy the Taoiseach, or that he might have him in his pocket, if he ever needed him.  By accepting such favours, Mr. Haughey thereby laid himself open to the possibility &ldquo;that political or financial favours could be sought in return for such gifts, or even be given without being sought&rdquo;, even though thankfully this did not occur.  As the tribunal has said, &ldquo;if such gifts were to be permissible the potential for bribery and corruption would be enormous&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that Deputy Lowry, by receiving several hundred thousand pounds in cash or in kind, should have, in the words of the tribunal, &ldquo;made himself vulnerable to all kinds of pressures from Dunnes Stores, had they chosen to apply those pressures&rdquo;, and that he could be open to blackmail from other sources.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable in terms of equity of access to politicians that, as the tribunal puts it, &ldquo;to give an effective service to all their constituents, or to all the citizens of the State, they, i.e. politicians, must not be under a financial obligation to some constituents or some citizens only&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that a former Taoiseach and a former Minister, as former makers of law themselves, should so blatantly flout the laws of this land in relation to both tax and exchange control. It is all the more galling that this deceit was carried out while these men sought to lecture others on moral values and restraint.</P>
    <P>In light of these trenchant criticisms of former holders of high public office, I was greatly relieved to read in the report that the tribunal had concluded that &ldquo;no political impropriety&rdquo;, or in other words no actual corruption, had been shown to have occurred within its terms of reference. Nonetheless this does not mean that there is any room for complacency in dealing with the findings of the report.</P>
    <P>We have to make it clear in this House by our actions, that we are going to insist on the highest standards in our public life.  There must not be the slightest suggestion that public life in this country is conducted in accordance with anything other than the highest standards.</P>
    <P>While the report is rightly critical of these individuals, I think we must look also at the culture which allowed this situation to come about, particularly over the past 30 years or so.  In this regard we must all share the responsibility, just as now we must all share the task of ensuring that such a situation can never arise again.  Legislation we passed in the Parliament went a considerable distance towards closing off possible avenues of <Col N="76" /> abuse.  We have to find new more transparent and acceptable ways of raising necessary political funding from our supporters and well wishers, without making further calls on the taxpayer, and without allowing a privileged few to create a sense of obligation.</P>
    <P>I regret the damage to the reputations of those most directly concerned.  Deputy Lowry did some good work as an officeholder and worked extremely hard for his constituency, who, in spite of all that has been revealed, remain grateful. However, he was, to quote his own words, &ldquo;the author of his own misfortune&rdquo; and a once promising career now lies in ruins.</P>
    <P>The record of Charles Haughey is well known. Parts of it, independent of anything related to this report, will always be controversial.  But in many important areas, valuable service by someone of immense ability will be recalled.  For the positive things he did, he will always be held in high regard by very many people.  But none of us will disagree with the verdict of the tribunal that &ldquo;by allowing himself to be put in a position of dependency,&rdquo; Mr. Haughey &ldquo;has devalued some of the undoubtedly valuable work which he did when in office&rdquo;.  It is inevitable, unfortunately, that his real achievements will now be seen or set off against what we have learned from the tribunal. I find that very sad for an individual that many of us know well, and have honoured and admired. Not only is it sad for the party he led, or for his former colleagues in Government, who sought to serve the public under his leadership, it is sad for our democracy and our nation, that a leader who, after Lemass, put more of his stamp on the Ireland of the second half of the 20th century than possibly anyone else, should have demeaned himself and political life by accepting such huge sums of money for his personal benefit from Ben Dunne.</P>
    <P>There are those who would seek to attach blame for the actions of Mr. Haughey to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am no more responsible for the misdemeanours of Charles Haughey than Deputies John Bruton, Dick Spring or Proinsias De Rossa are responsible for the misdemeanours of their colleague in Government, Deputy Michael Lowry.  All of us took Government decisions on the basis of the best information available at the time and the political judgment of colleagues we trusted, and on our view of the country's best interest.  If there was covert manipulation from ulterior motives, and I reiterate that the tribunal found no evidence of political impropriety, then none of us was aware of it at the time.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we in Fianna Fáil should have been more inquisitive as to how Mr. Haughey's lifestyle was maintained.  It may well be that we should have been more questioning, although it is hardly the norm to assume that wealth must always have been improperly acquired.  I note this suggestion has been made by, among others, persons who not only supported Mr. Haughey in Government, but also by <Col N="77" /> some who served with him in Government. Charles Haughey's leadership of Fianna Fáil, in Government and in Opposition, was more contested than any other leader, and people made their choices and took decisions on the facts as then known.  It is easy after the McCracken Report to say &ldquo;it should have been obvious&rdquo; but then the gift of 20/20 hindsight brings with it great wisdom.  It is only fair to ask: did Deputy Lowry's senior colleagues in Fine Gael, or his &ldquo;leader and best friend forever&rdquo;, never wonder at his facility in procuring substantial contributions both for the party and themselves individually from Ben Dunne?</P>
    <P>It is right to acknowledge the role of the media who exposed the state of affairs brought before the tribunal or who previously questioned it.  The fourth estate &mdash; freedom of the press &mdash; is vital to democracy.</P>
    <P>It is now our job to do everything in our power to restore public confidence in the political system. However, before looking forward it is necessary to clear up the past.  We need to get answers on essential points without engaging in witch-hunts or in scapegoating one or two individuals for faults in society as a whole.  To the extent that the tribunal and related matters are impediments to concentrating on the central business of Government, we need to sort out these matters expeditiously, without recourse to endless tribunals. We need to do the job properly and not have to keep coming back to it.</P>
    <P>The report of the Dunnes Payments Tribunal, and the evidence which was given before it, would suggest there are reasonable grounds to investigate whether other payments were made which fell outside its terms of reference.  Accordingly, there is a motion before the House today seeking the establishment of a new tribunal to carry out these further investigations and other related matters.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference before this House are the result of careful consideration by the Government as well as extensive, and I believe unprecedented, consultation with the Opposition. While it has not been possible for the Government to accept all points made by the Opposition, I believe that the terms, as they stand, reflect the will of all Members and, at the same time, are sufficiently focused to enable the tribunal to carry out its work efficiently and in a reasonable timeframe.</P>
    <P>I will now comment on the terms of reference, not in a strict legal way but in a way which I hope will satisfy Members that the new tribunal can address adequately their concerns and those of the public.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference provide principally that the tribunal investigate:</P>
    <P>(i) whether any payments were made to Mr. Haughey in the period from 1 January 1979 to 31 December 1996, when he held public office, and whether such payments were connected with any public office held by him, or had the <Col N="78" /> potential to influence his discharge of any such office.</P>
    <P>This will require the tribunal to follow the so-called &ldquo;money trail&rdquo;.  It will be required to ascertain whether there were substantial payments, who were the donors, how much was involved, when they were made, whether any of the controversial decisions were made at the time involving that donor and, whether, as a consequence, the tribunal believes Mr. Haughey did any act or made any decision to confer any benefit on that specific donor in respect of the transaction.</P>
    <P>This approach is infinitely better than examining allegations concerning specific public, ministerial or Government decisions.  The tribunal will be more focused in its work and will not unnecessarily drag in innocent third parties, or, on the other hand, be precluded from examining any decision.  The Government considers that following the money trail is the most efficient and effective way to progress this type of inquiry, as witnessed by the great success of the Dunnes Payments Tribunal, which adopted this approach.</P>
    <P>Second, the so-called Ansbacher accounts will be examined to ascertain if there were any sources other than Mr. Ben Dunne who lodged money to those accounts for the benefit of Mr. Haughey and, if so, to investigate the circumstances of such payments in the way I have referred to.  The accounts will also be investigated to determine if any payments were made from money held in any of the Ansbacher accounts to any person who holds or has held public office.</P>
    <P>It may be appropriate to remind the House that Mr. Justice McCracken has yet to decide whether the Dunnes Payments Tribunal should proceed with its appeal against the ruling of the Grand Court in the Cayman Islands concerning these accounts.  It is the Government's desire that the appeal should proceed but I acknowledge this is a decision solely for the tribunal.  I assure the House that any resources required by the tribunal to proceed with the appeal, should it decide to do so, will be made available.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Ansbacher accounts relate to private citizens, the Revenue Commissioners are empowered to seek access through the courts to the bank accounts of named individuals resident in the State, and will no doubt take into account, in a more general way, the picture presented and the lessons learnt as a result of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>There are similar provisions in the terms of reference to those relating to Mr. Haughey, concerning payments to Deputy Michael Lowry, in respect of any period when he held public office. The tribunal is also required to examine the bank accounts listed at (f) in the terms of reference, in the same way as it is required to examine the Ansbacher accounts in relation to Mr. Haughey and in relation to any other holder of public office.</P>
    <P>Third, the tribunal is also being asked to investigate whether the Revenue Commissioners availed fully, properly and in a timely manner in collecting or seeking to collect tax due by Mr. <Col N="79" /> Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  It is important that compliant taxpayers are reassured that the Revenue law, as with all law of this land, is applied equally without fear or favour.</P>
    <P>With a view to the future, and ensuring, in so far as is possible, that this situation cannot arise again, the tribunal is being requested to make recommendations in a number of areas, which give cause for concern arising from the McCracken report.  These include reform of company law, increasing accountability while maintaining the independence of the Revenue Commissioners, the role of the Central Bank as regulator of the financial services sector generally, regulation of their members by professional accountancy and other bodies, and changes in tax law to protect the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and the maintenance of offshore accounts.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference go on to describe the proposed <i>modus operandi</i> of the tribunal, with a view to ensuring the tribunal will be efficient in its operation and merely reflects what has become the practice of tribunals of inquiry, in that before taking oral evidence a degree of preliminary investigation is undertaken.  That it is being formally stated in the terms of reference, merely reflects the desire of the Oireachtas, that the tribunal undertakes the groundwork before proceeding to a full blown inquiry involving taking oral evidence, cross examination and the normal procedures.  It allows the tribunal to assess the result of its preliminary groundwork to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a full blown inquiry.  It also protects the good name of innocent third parties.  The terms of reference provide that the tribunal shall submit reports to the Clerk of the Dáil on all matters, including those where the tribunal considers there is insufficient evidence to warrant a full public inquiry and those reports will indicate the steps taken by the tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed.</P>
    <P>Though the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921, and 1979 are silent as to this two-tier procedure for an inquiry, I have been advised it is both within the scope of the Acts and constitutionally permissible.  It is simply the <i>prima facie</i> evidence principle in practice.  The tribunal is also being informed that it is the desire of the Oireachtas that, in so far as is consistent with the interests of justice, the costs of persons who fail to co-operate with the tribunal should be borne by those persons.  I hope Members will agree these terms of reference represent a solid basis for a focused tribunal which will be able to go about its work in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
    <P>A new tribunal is but one of many steps necessary to dispel the atmosphere of cynicism and suspicion which hangs over public life.  We must address the recommendations of Mr. Justice McCracken and strengthen our laws to restore public confidence and guarantee the highest standards <Col N="80" /> in public office.  Neither I nor the Government I lead will shirk from taking any decisions necessary on foot of the tribunal report.  The aim must be to ensure that mechanisms and structures are put in place so that the public can have full confidence in the manner in which the public affairs are conducted from now on.  The undertaking contained in &ldquo;An Action Programme for the New Millennium&rdquo;, published by the two parties in Government, to implement the recommendations of the McCracken tribunal will be honoured quickly.  We may indeed go beyond them.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific recommendations made by Mr. Justice McCracken, on further consideration I agree with the tribunal that it would be impractical and ineffective to seek to impose an obligation on accountants, bankers and other professionals in certain transactions concerning politicians.</P>
    <P>The Government will consider the recommendations concerning extension of the powers of the Ombudsman to investigate breaches of ethics in public office.  The Government will also consider the implementation of the recommendation in the Report of the Constitution Review Group of May 1996 and endorsed by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in its First Report, that a new Article should be inserted in the Constitution on the Office of the Ombudsman.  Such a constitutional provision would confirm the establishment of the office, providing for the independent exercise of such investigative and other functions of the office, as may be determined by law.  A referendum on such a provision could best be held in conjunction with the referendum which will be necessary on the Treaty of Amsterdam.  The Ombudsman, however, has much other work to attend to relating to the vindication of the rights of the individual citizen <i>vis-à-vis</i> the State, and more debate is needed before we would decide to shift radically the public focus of his work.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that it should be mandatory for any candidate for either House of the Oireachtas to produce a certificate that his or her tax affairs are in order, accompanied by a statutory declaration to that effect.  As promised in the Government's action programme, we had been examining such a proposal, which we strongly support in principle.</P>
    <P>Government consideration will include reconciling the tribunal recommendation with the recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, in relation to the establishment of an electoral and ethics commission.  As that committee states in its first report, a single commission, incorporating the Public Offices Commission, the Constituency Commission and a proposed independent referendum commission, under the Constitution would guarantee the independence and impartiality of the commission; generate greater confidence in public life; create greater transparency in public institutions; and provide an independent source of advice and <Col N="81" /> information in the areas of ethics in public life and electoral law reform.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee's report also makes the point that provision in the Constitution for such a commission would provide a powerful constitutional mechanism, to guarantee the probity of public life.  Such a body is the best option for us to take so that we have a permanent watchdog in place, with the necessary powers, and which will develop a special expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate on the tribunal's report will provide an opportunity for these options to be discussed.  Subject to the outcome of the Attorney General's examination of all these issues, the system which will be put in place will mean that all allegations of impropriety by politicians or public servants will now be dealt with in a comprehensive and transparent manner.</P>
    <P>Pending the introduction of substantive measures by the Government, I have instructed that the necessary amendments to the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, be prepared for introduction in the next session to implement with immediate effect the tribunal's recommendation on the creation of a criminal offence for breaches of the legislation, and the consequent barring of a convicted person from standing for subsequent election.</P>
    <P>Any decisions which will arise from Government consideration of the report will not prevent existing authorities such as the Offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Revenue Commissioners and the Comptroller and Auditor General from exercising their statutory powers, as they deem necessary.  I remind the House that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has stated publicly that the proceedings of the tribunal have been monitored closely by Revenue, and all appropriate action will be taken.  The Minister for Finance has also indicated that any additional investigative powers required by the Revenue Commissioners can be introduced.  It is appropriate at this time to refer to the Government proposals for legislation on Cabinet confidentiality which were put to the House yesterday and which will be the subject of a referendum on 30 October.  These include relaxation of the rule of absolute confidentiality of Cabinet discussions where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in the interests of the administration of justice or by virtue of an overriding public interest pursuant to an application by a tribunal appointed to inquire into a matter of public importance.</P>
    <P>The initiatives envisaged are a painful necessity for our democracy.  It is essential that we show we are capable of acting resolutely to defend it.  Our aim is to have a Republic, free of any taint or abuse of power, which is honoured and respected at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I thank the Seanad for dealing with this matter in order that, following today's debate, we can move in conjunction with the Attorney General and in consultation with Opposition leaders to <Col N="82" /> appoint a judge to this tribunal.  From an administrative point of view, the registrar and staff of the recent McCracken tribunal are still in place tidying up the proceedings.  It is my intention to avoid delay in this matter and, following consultation with Mr. Justice McCracken, it has been agreed that his staff will be retained.  Mr. Justice McCracken has ruled himself out of participation in the new tribunal but strongly supports keeping the former tribunal staff together.  That would save time recruiting appropriately qualified people to undertake the work.  It will only remain to appoint a judge to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Government's and my views, as stated in the Action Programme for the Millennium, are that a watchdog commission should be established in this House.  The only way we can move forward is if we have a body to which Members of the House, people in the media and the public could send their reports.  The commission would perhaps be presided over by a High Court judge who would have a permanent staff on a selected basis as happened in the Broadcasting Commission. The commission could examine cases and those which contained vexatious claims could be discussed while necessary investigations could be carried out.  If an investigation should then proceed into a more public domain &mdash; and I hope it will not happen &mdash; that would automatically follow.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for anyone to break the law and allegations must be investigated.  However, it is also wrong when the rumour machine gives rise to vexatious allegations about Members of either House.  People should either &ldquo;put up or shut up&rdquo;; matters should not be allowed to drift and all allegations vexatious or otherwise should be dealt with seriously.  That would require us to draft a Bill which would serve as a watchdog for us. Before doing that, I would like to hear Members' views on such legislation and I would like party whips and leaders to work together on it.  It behoves us to ensure that proposed legislation will address the issues the people want addressed and that it will be a sensible mechanism for the proper working of this House.</P>
    <P>We are here to deal with and serve the public in relation to issues such as health, education, employment, protection of the aged, the homeless and the disadvantaged and to seek to run the country in a proper manner.  It would be sad if, like other jurisdictions, we were continuously involved in issues such as this.  A tribunal is necessary in this instance but it should not have to happen in the future.  The public perception is that we are not monitored.  We must have a mechanism which would assure the public that a fair system exists.  The onus is on us to enact such legislation and I would welcome individual or collective views from Members of this House. Work began on this legislation in late June as soon as I took up office but it will take some months for us to refine it.  It is unique for us to be in a situation where we can draft legislation which affects us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> I thank the Seanad again for taking the time to deal with this issue today in order that the tribunal can be set up without undue delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware a number of important amendments to the motion have been tabled, the first of which is No. 3 on the agenda.  In the absence of the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mullooly, I take this opportunity to offer him my warmest congratulations on his appointment as Cathaoirleach.  I do not intend to be parochial when I say that Senator Mullooly is a constituency colleague and we served together in this House in the 1980s and on Roscommon County Council.  We have been Members of the Oireachtas almost continuously since 1981.  I also congratulate Senator Liam T. Cosgrave on his appointment to the position of Leas-Cathaoirleach. I have no doubt that, in the same way as he discharged his duties as Cathaoirleach, he will discharge his duties as Leas-Cathaoirleach with competence and aplomb.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House, it is a privilege to have him here today.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House is of paramount importance.  I thank Mr. Justice McCracken for the work he has done in this tribunal and the clarity with which he presented this report.  There is a direct relationship between the outcome of any report and the terms of reference given to the tribunal and the presiding judge.  The previous Government gave very clear terms of reference and instructions to Mr. Justice McCracken in this tribunal and he fulfilled them to the letter.  He gave us a document which is absolute in its clarity and which gets to the point.  There is no wandering from the main point as, I am sorry to say, there was in the beef tribunal.  Perhaps the fault there lay in the fact that Mr. Justice Hamilton did not have clear terms of reference.  Mr. Justice McCracken performed his duty on the basis of having been given very clear terms of reference.</P>
      <P>This report uncovers an appalling vista.  It formally reveals that holders of the highest office in the land covertly received large sums of money from businesses which were salted away surreptitiously and not declared to the Revenue authorities. These sums of money were kept to finance a lavish lifestyle.</P>
      <P>A popular jibe about holders of public office is that they engage in this type of activity.  The majority of us in this House know that is not the truth, but the information contained in this report confirms for those who want to believe it and for the commentators who commentate so often on these matters that it is the truth.  The revelations contained in this report greatly damage the body politic.  I am not exonerating in any way Deputy Lowry, who belonged to my party, but the greater sin was committed by a former Taoiseach, as revealed in this report.  That is appalling and it will cause lasting damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People serving in public life will find it extremely difficult to maintain their reputations. <Col N="84" /> Those of us in public life serve with integrity and our only purpose is to serve the public interest. Most of us are badly rewarded for that service but, leaving that aside, we have to defend the reputation of public service.  It is difficult to defend it given the revelations in this report.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the presence of the Taoiseach, it is regrettable that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is not here.  He has come into this controversy because since the McCracken report was commissioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>He is working on behalf of the Government in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it has been revealed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was the recipient of a substantial sum of money in 1989.  The Minister went before the Dáil last week and gave, according to every objective Member and commentator in the print and visual media, an inadequate explanation as to the reason he received that substantial sum of money.  It is regrettable that there was no mention of the Minister or this contribution in the Taoiseach's address to the House this morning.</P>
      <P>The source of these funds should be part of this debate.  I do not believe the Minister, Deputy Burke, when he states that a stranger, accompanied by an acquaintance of his, walked in off the street, gave him £30,000 in cash and walked away.  Does any Member in this House believe him?  Does any ordinary member of the public believe that kind of story?  They do not.</P>
      <P>The most important question that must be answered is whether the Minister asked the benefactor about the business account from which this money came.  Did he ask if it was part of the normal declared accounts of that person's company? Did he ask if the money was personal funding or funding generated out of business and whether the contribution would be declared to the appropriate authorities for tax purposes?  Did the Minister's colleagues in Government ask him those questions when no doubt he gave his explanation in Cabinet before the Dáil debate?  That fundamental question has not been answered by the Minister and it has not been adequately addressed by his Cabinet colleagues.  It is the duty of all the Members of this House to inquire into it and to ask further questions.</P>
      <P>The new tribunal should have a role in investigating the contribution to the Minister, Deputy Burke.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, one of the most senior posts in Cabinet, he should not resist that proposal.  He should make available to Mr. Justice McCracken, assuming he will be the chairman of the new tribunal, all information and documents in his possession.  The two people who visited the Minister's house on that day should be invited to give oral or written evidence to the tribunal as to the origin and nature of the donation.  That is vitally important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us have been in public life for years and we know that people do not walk in off the <Col N="85" /> street and deposit a five or six figure sum of money without some strings being attached.  It is incredible to ask people to believe that.  We all know that does not happen, and if it did we would ask questions as to the reason somebody would be such a good benefactor.  This issue has been left out of the remit of the new inquiry but it must be inquired into because the public are asking questions and they must be answered.  The problems of the Minister, Deputy Burke, are now very much part of this whole public controversy.  For that reason the Government and the Minister should accept that the part of the controversy he has generated should be inquired into by a new tribunal.</P>
    <P>We have, by amendment, requested that the new tribunal examine the way in which a parliamentary allowance, the leader's allowance, paid to Mr. Haughey over several years when he was Leader of the Opposition in the 1980s, was disbursed by him.  That matter is not within the remit of the new inquiry but it should be.  That sum of money, approximately £1 million in total, has not been fully accounted for either by Mr. Haughey, who has said nothing about it, or the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Taoiseach might have made reference to it in his address to the House this morning but he did not.  He could have laid our fears to rest by simply stating that these funds were properly disbursed by Mr. Haughey as Leader of the Opposition and that the party's accounts indicate that.  He did not do so, however, and the question remains.  That is the reason for our amendment.</P>
    <P>This substantial sum of money should be inquired into by the new tribunal.  There is clear evidence that during those years that funding was not disbursed in the way it ought to have been by the then Leader of the Opposition.  The current Leader of Fianna Fáil and the other members of the Cabinet should not resist such an inquiry.  I appeal in particular to the Progressive Democrats Cabinet members &mdash; Senator Dardis might take this message back to his colleagues in Cabinet &mdash; to insist even at this late stage that our amendment be accepted.</P>
    <P>The public has many questions about this matter. It is a great pity that in examining the Ansbacher account the tribunal will look only at donations to Mr. Haughey.  I find it strange that £38 million could be deposited in an account in a relatively small bank managed by a few people for, it appears, the benefit of a small number of people in a certain golden circle.  Mr. Justice McCracken identified the portion of the Ansbacher account from which Mr. Haughey benefited.  However, there are other people involved and it is absolutely imperative that the tribunal examines the entire account.  The confidentiality of funds which are legally held can be protected under the terms laid down but if we want to follow the money trail &mdash; and a large amount of money seems to be in this account &mdash; then the tribunal of inquiry constituted by the Houses of the Oireachtas must have access to it. I do not understand the resistance of the Government <Col N="86" /> to this proposal or why the Taoiseach did not refer to it.  This merely serves to increase the level of suspicion.  I will deal with the matter in detail on Committee Stage.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to accept our amendment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that neither he nor his colleagues are responsible for the actions of Mr. Haughey, any more than Deputy John Bruton or his colleagues are responsible for Deputy Lowry's unacceptable actions.  I do not accept that statement. Mr. Haughey's most controversial Ministry was from 1989-92.  To put it mildly, that Government made some very weird decisions.  Under the Constitution the Government makes decisions on the basis of collegiate or collective responsibility. In other words, all Government decisions are made collectively.  Ministers are responsible for their own areas but they bring their decisions to Cabinet so that members can question certain aspects of them before they become Government policy.</P>
    <P>The Ministers who served under Mr. Haughey, including the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, cannot absolve themselves from part of the blame for the Masri affair, the strange goings on in relation to the sale of Carysfort or the many other controversies, one of which led to the tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry.  The report of that tribunal may have been faulty in terms of laying the blame firmly on certain people but it gave a clear picture of what had taken place in the beef industry.  One of Mr. Haughey's first acts on taking office in 1989 was to hand most of the responsibility for the beef industry to one company.  I do not wish to impugn Deputy Reynolds but he also has questions to answer about some of his actions as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Some of his actions were weird and clearly contravened decisions taken by the Cabinet.  For example, questions arise about the way he distributed export credit insurance to companies which were either owned by or associated with Mr. Goodman. These matters must be inquired into to a greater degree.  It is only then that we will be able to accept the Taoiseach's statement that neither he nor his colleagues are responsible for certain actions taken by the then Government.</P>
    <P>The members of a Cabinet share collective responsibility for the decisions of their colleagues. This applies to decisions taken not only by the Taoiseach but also by Ministers.  One is supposed to know what is going on at Cabinet and one cannot absolve oneself by saying, &ldquo;I did not know what was going on&rdquo;.  At that time questions were raised by the media and Opposition about what was occurring.  Members of that Cabinet are now trying to absolve themselves from any blame for wrong actions.  However, the only way they can do this is by showing us that they questioned these actions at the time and believed what they were told.</P>
    <P>The tribunal of inquiry has revealed that the highest officeholders in the land acted wrongly and in a way the rumourmongers often said they acted.  I sincerely hope we learn lessons from this <Col N="87" /> so that we do not have to debate a similar motion in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter which has been the subject of public attention for some time.  The tribunal states:</P>
      <P>If politicians are to give an effective service to all their constituents or to all citizens of the State they must not be under any financial obligation to some constituents or to some citizens only.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that this is the way the system operates.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice McCracken did an excellent job in obtaining the information sought by the public. While his report is conclusive in many respects there are some unanswered questions.  The new tribunal is being set up to establish further facts.  If the people referred to in the report had co-operated more fully with the tribunal and the other House then a tribunal might not have been necessary. That applies to Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  Mr. Haughey failed to comply fully with the tribunal and Deputy Lowry failed to give the full information to his colleagues in the other House.  He had to address the House at a later stage, admit he was brief in the information he gave and correct the inaccurate statement he gave earlier.  Those two actions alone give further credence to the public cynicism and suspicion that exists.  It is unfortunate that those two people gave information only when they were forced to do so.</P>
      <P>Apart from obtaining the information it is necessary to establish, let us hope the new tribunal will give back to the public a sense of trust and belief in the political system.  That is important.  As the Taoiseach rightly put it, we do not want to spend the next three, five, ten or 20 years dealing with a series of tribunals covering scandals or financial irregularities.  We want to deal with this matter and get on with running the country and providing for our citizens.</P>
      <P>There are a number of inaccuracies in what the Senator across the floor said.  He indicated the Taoiseach did not address the Fianna Fáil leader's allowance, but the Taoiseach dealt with that extensively in the Dáil.  At that time the matter was accepted by the Senator's leader and dealt with.  I am not sure it was dealt with by the Taoiseach today, but it was dealt with in the debate in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The matter concerning the Minister, Deputy Burke, was also dealt with in the Dáil.  There was an opportunity to debate it and the Senator's party accepted the outcome.  Unless there is some conflict on this between the Senator and his leader and Front Bench on the matter, there appears to be some conflict between the spokesperson who spoke on behalf of his party and himself.</P>

      <P>There are two aspects to this tribunal to which this House is giving breath today. An important one is to clear up what happened in the past which requires a number of steps to be taken.  The new tribunal must establish whether money was given to Mr. Haughey for the purposes of calling in a political favour at a later stage.  It must also investigate if payments made to Deputy Lowry interfered with decisions he made at Cabinet.  To all intents and purposes he was only a front for the Dunnes Stores operation. That was an inappropriate way for a Minister to act and that matter must be cleared up.  It is hoped that the tribunal will establish for the public that the political system is beyond reproach.  If that is not the result, further steps will have to be taken.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary and unacceptable that any account, such as the Ansbacher account, should be in place and that any persons, particularly those in public life, should have an opportunity to lodge money in a tax haven outside this country and fail to comply with our tax laws.  The Senator opposite indicated that the Taoiseach had not covered that matter, but he covered it extensively this morning.  The Senator must not have been listening.  The Taoiseach said that not alone did he and the Government support the full investigation and a legal process to establish the information but that the Government would also provide the necessary resources to do that.  Those matters need to be cleared up.  This debate is taking the form of a house tribunal and we might now move to deal with the nitty-gritty of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal should make recommendations on a number of issues, some of which were referred to by the Taoiseach this morning.  Recommendations are needed on company law.  It is a grey area that lacks transparency.  For its own good the accountancy profession needs to address some of the public's concerns about it.  It is unfortunate <Col N="89" /> that to some extent a tinge of compliance with irregularity has been linked to that wonderful profession.  It is important it should maintain high standards.  That might apply also to certain areas in the legal profession.  Some support and assistance from one or both of those professions was required in what happened.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank needs to take a stronger hand in dealing with any irregularities surrounding the transfer of moneys, offshore accounts, tax law and other areas.  There is a big web and the public believe that matters in the financial services area can be swept under the carpet.  There must be transparency in that area and I hope the new tribunal will make recommendations to cover that.</P>
    <P>People in public life need to re-establish our good standing with the public.  The majority of people in public life are there to help their community, county and country to change society; they have a goal and are dedicated.  The activities of a small number who have stepped outside the line, cut corners, been involved in deals, accepted donations and allowed themselves to be bought have blighted the political system.  That is a matter that needs to be cleared up and let us hope the tribunal of inquiry will do that.</P>
    <P>The press did a good job in its exposure of what took place and ought to be complimented on its investigations and the matters it brought to public attention.  It is important that the press is prepared to work on behalf of the public.  It did so on this occasion and I compliment it.</P>
    <P>The funding of political parties is a problem which, while it has been talked about and attempts have been made to address it, has not been addressed fully.  It is a two-sided coin and one that needs to be addressed.  If political parties cannot accept donations from individuals, companies or whatever they must be funded from the public purse.  Then there would then be a public outcry that taxpayers' money should not be given to political parties.  We are in a dilemma.  This is an area that has not yet been dealt with.  In the past various Governments and parties produced proposals but still the issue has not been resolved.</P>
    <P>This tribunal has the support of all the parties. All parties agree this tribunal is necessary and there was extensive consultation between the Government and Opposition parties on the terms of reference.  If anything the Taoiseach went beyond the call of duty in trying to establish exactly what would satisfy the Opposition and agreement was reached to a great extent.</P>
    <P>I hope the tribunal is as successful as the McCracken Tribunal into the Dunnes payments to politicians.  If so, it will send out the message that nobody is above the law.  If it establishes, irrespective of one's position, wealth or connections, that one is not above the law in the public mind it will have done a good day's work, apart from its investigations into individuals.</P>
    <P>I am tired of the constant barrage of &ldquo;they are all in it for what they can get&rdquo;.  I listened to a television programme the other night and the first <Col N="90" /> question from the interviewer was: &ldquo;How do you think you will do, considering the low standing of politicians at this time?&rdquo;.  What about the low position of journalists?  It is like the old story &mdash; if you got the name of getting up early in the morning, you could stay in bed until dinner time. It seems the same applies to the political system. If a politician is involved, it is automatically assumed there is something shady or something to be questioned.  If this tribunal can readdress that impression it will have done an excellent day's work.  I do not know which judge will be in charge of this tribunal but I hope he or she will do as good a job as that done by Justice McCracken.  I hope the money trail, which is the agreed method of moving forward, will establish the facts, who gave what and if any decisions of the Governments involved were clouded on account of payments made.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach when he said Cabinet members make decisions on the basis of information available to them.  Irrespective of what Government was in office, whether a Government of which Deputy Lowry or Mr. Haughey was a member, the Ministers who sat around that Cabinet table made decisions on matters brought to them on the basis of information provided by civil servants in Government Departments.  Those decisions were made in good faith and on the basis of the information available.  It is wrong to suggest that people who sat down with Deputy Lowry or Mr. Haughey are part and parcel of the wrongs that either of those individuals did, not at the Cabinet table, so far as we are aware, but what they might have done outside.  It is obvious that neither of the gentlemen involved came with that information to the Cabinet table.  It does none of us any favour to make those allegations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of this tribunal and hope it will establish the truth of the whole matter and bring the political system back into good standing with the public.  I commend the tribunal to the House.</P>

I am restricting myself partly because I realise so much has been said but also because I have an urgent appointment later.  I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the tribunal has played one very significant role in Irish public life.  Because of the surgical and precise skills of Mr. Justice McCracken, the whole reputation of tribunals has been rehabilitated after the fiasco of the beef tribunal which was expensive and ultimately inconclusive. We have here a clear forensic examination of some very troubling facts.  These facts are <Col N="91" /> troubling.  They bring no joy to anybody.  I, least of all, would gloat in the downfall and misery of distinguished public figures in our land.  There is something shaming about being named so publicly in the terms of this resolution and Mr. Haughey must, regrettably, suffer that shame, as does Mr. Lowry.</P>
    <P>Personal bank accounts are being trawled through.  This, unfortunately, has been invited by the lifestyle of the people involved.  We should be grateful to that most dysfunctional of families, the Dunne family, because without the row that broke out among their ranks we probably would never have got to the bottom of this material. However, that is a backhanded compliment.  I notice that the concentration of all these reports is on the political ramifications, ethics in political life, and that is appropriate and proper; but when are we going to have some sort of inquiry into the ethics of business life here, because it seems that one of the sources of all this squalor is the inappropriate methods by which certain businesses run their operations?  When one looks at the payments handed out by Mr. Ben Dunne, one has to wonder at the scale of his generosity, coming from sources which were so extraordinarily ruthless in their business practices, who screwed small suppliers to the wall with exclusive contracts, who hounded the courageous women who went out on strike over the question of South African imports. One wonders and one worries.  There is no question of doubt in my mind that corruption and questionable behaviour is spread very wide in the business community.</P>
    <P>Many years ago, after I had sold a house I was living in, I had a small amount of capital.  I was advised to put it into Ansbacher's Bank, of which I had then not heard.  I was immensely impressed and rather flattered to be accepted into the august ranks of subscribers to that bank.  It was in a private house in Fitzwilliam Square and the board of directors read like Burke's Peerage or the Almanac de Gotha.  It included people like Lord Talbot de Malahide and Viscount Powers-court. It was the very soul of probity, discretion and honour.  So was the Guinness Mahon Bank.  I remember old Sir George Mahon, who had been the British Consul in Berlin during the Weimar Republic, again a byword for probity in Irish business life.  What do we find now?  Banks with the same names which have apparently changed their character and are involved in these extraordinary transactions with paper companies &mdash; £38 million being held in secret accounts with methods so labrynthine that not even the Society of Actuaries could penetrate through the wall of secrecy surrounding accounts in the Cayman Islands, mysterious figures lurking in the background. It is for that reason that it is most important that the Fine Gael and Labour amendments should be listened to and acted upon in this House, because it is not appropriate that the Ansbacher accounts should be excluded from the scope of this inquiry in the manner proposed.  Nor <Col N="92" /> is it appropriate that this be left simply in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not wish to tempt providence by attacking the Revenue Commissioners because one never knows what nasty consequences might flow.  I might, as a mere pimple on the backside of Irish political life, attract their wrath and ire in a way that other people might not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, I have to ask questions about where the Revenue Commissioners were during this period when questions were being asked about the lifestyle of people in public life.  This is exactly the same question that is being raised by people like myself and Deputy Tony Gregory with regard to the drug barons, who are people living quite spectacularly beyond their means, people whom the ordinary public have no method of attacking or investigating.  The Revenue Commissioners were charged with that responsibility.  They apparently, unlike almost everybody else in the country, failed to notice the discrepancy between Mr. Haughey's lavish lifestyle and the apparent sources of his income.  For that reason among others, it would not be appropriate to leave it merely in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Another point I wish to make is that we need further information &mdash; I say this with great regret &mdash; in the case of Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke.  As an ordinary Independent Member of this House, it seems extraordinary that one contribution of £30,000 should be made for an election.  That should be far more than the cost of the entire election.  One wonders about furtive contributions in brown paper bags.  There may be nothing wrong in it, but it does, as the McCracken tribunal very significantly indicates, create a climate in which the possibility for favours, for an atmosphere of bribery and corruption, quite clearly exists.</P>
      <P>On this, I would like to return to what I said on the Order of Business.  It is time order was put into the financing of political life here.  I hope the Government will have the guts to introduce the Electoral Bill which will give funding on a <i>pro rata</i> basis and which will fund not only Members of the Dáil, not only members of political parties, but also Members of this House and Independents because it is wrong that, almost uniquely in Europe, political people running for election should be placed in a situation of having to raise all the finance themselves which sometimes apparently leads to dubious practices.  It is quite outrageous that when individuals do raise money from their own personal finances in order to fund an election they are not even then allowed to discount it as a legitimate business expense against their income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for allowing me to share time with him.  I welcome the Minister back to this House in a new position.  As Senator Connor said earlier, we are privileged that the Taoiseach allocated time yesterday and today to come here and give us his thoughts on this.  I will come back to that later.</P>
      <P>We have had many surprises in the past year, most of which have been unpleasant.  One of the few that has bean pleasant was the speed, efficiency and fruitfulness of the inquiry by Mr. Justice McCracken.  That tribunal succeeded against all the odds in uncovering what most people believed would never be uncovered.  Up to this year people had come to regard tribunals as nothing more than a horrendously expensive way of sweeping potential problems under the carpet.  Now we have had two tribunals and they have, in a matter of months, totally vindicated the tribunal system as a valuable part of our Government system.  The Taoiseach's words today to the effect that the staff backing Mr. Justice McCracken are still in operation and still available and that it was the intention to use that staff for the new tribunal are welcome.</P>
      <P>The McCracken report itself does us a further service beyond the uncovering of what had already taken place over the previous months. The report, in quite uncompromising language, forces us to face the implications of the evidence. It calls a spade a spade.  When it considers evidence to be incredible, it says so clearly and baldly.  It refuses to let people talk their way out of uncompromising situations with explanations that simply do not stand up to rational scrutiny. The whole affair puts politicians in the dock, and it puts business people in the dock.  I am wearing both those hats.  As a business person I want first of all to say something about these events from the perspective of business.</P>
      <P>Most people in business are honest, just as are most politicians.  It has always been my belief, a belief that is widely shared in business circles, that in this country one could not buy Government decisions with bribes.  Most companies give donations to political parties, but they do so grudgingly.  They give in response to persistent badgering by the political parties.  However, they give modestly, and they give mainly in order to be free of soliciting.  In many cases they give something to all the parties that ask and, very often, the contribution takes the form of buying a table at a fund raising dinner or something similar. Most companies who made such donations in the past would not have expected anything in return other than, perhaps, access, in order to have their viewpoint heard.  In good faith they believed that they could not buy Government decisions.  One of the spectres that has been raised over the past year is whether this assumption is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are asking if, under the surface, there is a pattern of bribery, whether Government decisions have been improperly influenced.  If such were the case, it would be very bad for business <Col N="94" /> and for Ireland's reputation abroad.  Governments must take many decisions that impact on businesses such as how to regulate their sector, award contracts and regulate planning matters, etc.  The best scenario for business and the economy as a whole is that such decisions are taken impartially in the national interest.  If even a minority of business or Government decisions are affected by bribery, the vast majority of businesses are treated unfairly.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside all questions of morality, bribery is a distortion of competition.  The playing field is no longer level for all participants.  This is not only unfair, it is inefficient in a market economy. If Government decisions can be bought, then smaller businesses will suffer most; they cannot afford to be in that league even if they wished. Corruption is an act of discrimination against small and medium sized businesses on whom we depend to create future employment.</P>
    <P>Businesses should try to influence Government decisions.  They are as entitled to lobby as other groups and their voices deserve to be heard.  The majority of business people would not ask for more than that.  They want to be able to compete fairly in the marketplace.  It is in the interest of business and the political process that corruption be exposed, punished and rooted out.  I do not belong to the little army of cynics who argue that politics and business are inherently corrupt.  That is simply untrue and Members know that most politicians and business people are honest.</P>
    <P>However, it is not enough to be honest.  There is also a responsibility to be vigilant against corruption and to root it out wherever it occurs.  If corruption is allowed to gain a hold in even a small way it will rapidly infect the whole institution. Government must not only be free of corruption, it must be clearly seen and believed to be so.</P>
    <P>That leads to the nub of the problem facing us in deciding the form and terms of reference of the tribunal which must be appointed to follow up on the McCracken report.  The events of the past year have changed public opinion in a profound way.  Senator Finneran referred to the need to re-establish our good names because up until that time most people believed Government was clean.  There were always a few cynics who said the opposite but most people did not believe them.  However, now their belief has been shaken, it is as if an earthquake has rocked their beliefs. They do not know what to think.  What they will end up believing depends critically on what happens next and that is in our hands.  Their future belief in the system depends on the readiness it shows to pursue those problems to the end.  Citizens will make up their minds according to whether they believe the system will lead to greater openness.  The Taoiseach stated it is our job to do everything in our power to restore public confidence in the political system.  That is the objective.  We need to get answers on essential points without engaging in witch-hunts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> While I welcome this statement of the objective, I question whether it will be achieved through the steps being taken.  The proposed terms of reference for the new tribunal are probably the first act in a national tragedy.  They will confirm the worst suspicions of people that there is something which the system or the establishment does not want revealed.  It is incredible that this is happening at a time when everyone says the main task is to rebuild public confidence in our political institutions.  How can the Taoiseach say that, when at the same time the Government's proposal will most likely further undermine these institutions?</P>
    <P>The people expect a new tribunal to examine the Ansbacher accounts without any artificial time limits being set and that other matters should be further scrutinised.  Someone has made the disastrous mistake of thinking that such restrictive terms of reference are a form of damage limitation.  Time will show them to be a form of damage escalation.  I am concerned that the Government which holds the promise of being a new broom will begin to look like a moth eaten one.  I say that in spite of the Taoiseach's intention to set up a commission on the House when he spoke of the future.</P>
    <P>However, by refusing to meet people's expectations the proposed terms of reference will push public opinion in a direction which no Member of the Oireachtas wants it to go.  By assenting to them a further nail is being put in the coffin of public credibility in the political process, which is not what we want.  I was impressed by the Taoiseach's demonstration of his wish to avoid such scandals in future.  While I congratulate him, I urge him to go one step further and show more determination in clearing up the scandals of the past.  The McCracken tribunal has not gone far enough.  We can and should go further.  Attention should be given to those who urge that there should be wider scope in the new tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, on your election and wish you a long and successful term of office.  In congratulating Deputy Kitt on his appointment, I wish him the same good wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Taoiseach's speech which was comprehensive and highlighted certain important points.  It is not unique that the actions of a number of individuals in any profession can sully the names of the majority but those uncovered by the McCracken tribunal have cast a long shadow on many decent people.  They are just as appalled as I am at the departure from acceptable political standards which the report of the tribunal revealed.  It did not just shine a light on the reprehensible practices of a number of individuals.  It put the spotlight on very important people such as a former Taoiseach and a former occupant of one of our more senior and sensitive ministries. One is reminded of the famous words of the late <Col N="96" /> George Colley who referred to low standards in high places.</P>
    <P>A different emphasis may be put on certain aspects of this matter but there is no fundamental disagreement among Members about the lessons which must be learned and what must happen. The establishment of a new tribunal will allow us to delve deeper into the affairs of Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry and to establish whether there were strings attached to the extraordinary payments and financial gifts they received.  That is the fundamental nub of the issue.</P>
    <P>We all know the direction we must take.  From now on there needs to be strict self-regulation to ensure that grubby dealings have no place in politics or business and that those who seek to abuse their positions for personal gain and pure greed are exposed and banished from public office.</P>
    <P>Anyone who doubts that Mr. Lowry and Mr. Haughey acted irresponsibly and unacceptably in carrying out their functions as public office holders has only to read the report.  The report is a damning indictment in which one repeatedly finds phrases like &ldquo;we find the evidence unacceptable&rdquo; or &ldquo;untrue&rdquo;.  The report provides a litany of offences from beginning to end, including tax evasion.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to Judge McCracken's skills that the report is so explicit and concise.  No one can be left in any doubt as to his findings.  It contrasts with the beef tribunal report of which I understand only 360 copies were sold.  It was quite a task for anyone to wade through the beef tribunal report to try and discover the nuggets of sense that were found by Mr. Justice Hamilton.  It is not true to say the beef tribunal report did not make any findings, it did.  In several respects it was quite damning in terms of tax evasion and those who were a party to that as well as some of the practices that took place in the beef industry.  It was, however, a difficult report to go through.</P>
    <P>Having read the report of the McCracken tribunal a defence cannot be made for the two people who are the subject of it.  They breached the trust of ordinary people by treating the taxation laws with disdain and that was not all.  They left themselves open, as Mr. Justice McCracken says, to blackmail and bribery.  As regards the taxation laws the report makes the point in respect of Streamline, one of Deputy Lowry's companies, that one of the transactions carried on was a &ldquo;scam&rdquo;.  That is a strong word for a judge to use in a report.</P>
    <P>The two people involved used every trick in the banking book to ensure that huge payments to them could be hidden.  The complex web of financial transactions put in place to hide the enormous financial gifts and payments to two holders of the highest offices can only be fully understood when one reads the lucid comments of Judge McCracken.</P>
    <P>One significant point in the introduction to the McCracken report is where it says that &ldquo;the greater part of the tribunal's work was investigative work behind the scenes&rdquo;.  The team that <Col N="97" /> conducted that work is to be applauded.  I was pleased to hear the Taoiseach say the staff is being maintained to help with the new tribunal. That is a positive step.</P>
    <P>The selection of the judge will obviously be a matter of some importance.  I realise many current members of the judiciary who acted for one or other of the parties over the years will have to disqualify themselves from dealing with the matter. However, I am sure a suitable person can be found and we wish him or her well.</P>
    <P>One could be forgiven for not understanding all the intricate details of the money trail.  One could not but come to the conclusion, however, that what we were being treated to was a grand exercise in deception and concealment.  That point is emphasised by Judge McCracken.</P>
    <P>Since its foundation the State has been served by many distinguished Taoisigh.  That one of them should have taken it upon himself to use one of the most exalted positions in our society for personal gain is despicable and can only serve to have damaged the office he occupied as well all of us in public life.  Mr. Charles Haughey was no bit player. He was one of the central figures in political life for a quarter of a century until his resignation as Taoiseach in 1992.  We know that one leading businessman was a generous donor but we must now find out whether there were other generous donors and what motives they had.</P>
    <P>It is implausible to believe the statement by Mr. Dunne to the effect that since Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot it would be better for one person to be the Taoiseach's donor when he was in financial trouble.  I suspect the people who were trawling for money would have gone to the other 11 apostles in addition to that person.  That will be part of the trail which must be investigated by the incoming tribunal.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCracken leaves us in no doubt about the implications of a holder of high office being beholden to businessmen or others.  On page 73 of his report he states quite succinctly:</P>
    <P>The possibility that political or financial favours could be sought in return for such gifts, or even be given without being sought, is very high and if such gifts are permissible they would inevitably lead in some cases to bribery and corruption.</P>
    <P>It is clear that at any stage Ben Dunne could have used the threat of disclosure to secure favours from Mr. Haughey.  No evidence has emerged of any such favours being sought or given but that does not take away from the fact that Mr. Haughey left himself wide open to the possibility of blackmail or bribery.  He compromised himself to such an extent that if pressure had been applied he would have found himself in an extremely weak position.</P>
    <P>It is inconceivable that Mr. Haughey would not escape the full rigours of the law.  Mr. Justice McCracken makes that point saying that it is not for the tribunal to impose sanctions.  However, he <Col N="98" /> did refer matters to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>If Mr. Haughey pays no penalty for his transgressions it will truly be a travesty of justice.  It will be seized upon by those who already suspect that the law is just for little people.  How can we convince somebody who steals a motorcar or is otherwise involved in larceny or vandalism, and who is convicted of such crimes and sent to jail, that they should be subject to the rigour of the law when people who are presumed to be their betters get away scot free?</P>
    <P>In the film &ldquo;The Field&rdquo; it was the Bull McCabe who said that there is one law for the rich and one law for the poor, one law for solicitors, accountants and doctors, and one law for us. However, the same law must be applied for everybody from the highest citizen in the State to the lowest.</P>
    <P>There is an equally strong case to made for action to be taken against Deputy Lowry.  I welcome the decision by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, to delegate an officer in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to examine the books of Deputy Lowry's company Garuda Ltd. The apparent breaches of company law brought to light by the McCracken tribunal have to be investigated and company law must be applied and implemented where possible.  I hope the relevant authorities will pursue Deputy Lowry for tax evasion.</P>
    <P>As for the impact of his tax dodging on his capacity to fulfil duties as a holder of public office, page 32 of the McCracken tribunal report provides us with as much enlightenment as we could possibly need.  Judge McCracken finds Deputy Lowry's relationship with Dunnes Stores extremely disturbing in at least three aspects.  The third aspect touched on by Mr. Justice McCracken is probably the most disturbing of all. The report states:</P>
    <P>The most damaging aspect of this relationship is that there could be a public perception that a person in a position of a Government Minister and a member of the Cabinet was able to ignore and indeed cynically evade both the taxation and exchange control laws of the State with impunity.  Loss of revenue to the black economy is a serious matter for the State and it is an appalling situation that a Government Minister and a chairman of a parliamentary party can be seen to have consistently benefited from the black economy from shortly after he was first elected to Dáil Éireann.  If such a person can behave in this way without serious sanctions being imposed it becomes very difficult to condemn others who similarly flout the law.</P>
    <P>On foot of that and the tribunal's other findings Deputy Lowry should resign his Dáil seat.  It is unfortunate that the Houses of the Oireachtas do not have the power to expel Members who behave in such a way or, indeed, Members who deliberately mislead the Houses of the <Col N="99" /> Oireachtas.  He has done us a huge disservice in public life, especially in his attempts to explain away his conduct in his personal statement to the Dáil last December.  His feeble attempt last week to apologise for misleading the Dáil goes nowhere near repairing the damage done by his statement of last December.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges must review the sanctions it can impose upon Members.  It is evident we are quite powerless to act in cases of impropriety.  Matters like criminal conviction and bankruptcy exclude people from membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If there is a requirement for a law to ensure that people who should be excluded from the Houses are excluded, that is what must be done within the constraints of the Constitution.  One of the most serious things that can be done in a parliamentary democracy is to deliberately mislead the Houses.  One of the foundations of our parliamentary democracy is that the truth will be told in the Houses of the Oireachtas and that no deliberate attempt will be made to mislead them.  It is important to maintain that and the Houses and the committees responsible to them have an obligation in that regard.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has raised as many questions as it has answered.  There is every reason to believe that Mr. Dunne was just one of a number of financial donors to Mr. Haughey.  I spoke previously of the so-called 12 apostles.  It is estimated that the payments uncovered by the tribunal could have sustained Mr. Haughey in his lifestyle for no more than two or three years.  That begs the question as to who else made financial contributions and how his lavish lifestyle was maintained for 20 years or more.</P>
    <P>No political impropriety has been uncovered but it would be naive in the extreme to think that the receipt of donations of this magnitude did not colour every task performed by Mr. Haughey and Mr. Lowry in the service of the State.  They showed utter contempt for the normal rules which apply to all holders of public office and their pathetic attempts to explain away such behaviour during the tribunal proceedings suggest they had little remorse for their conduct. Some of the submissions made by Mr. Haughey to the tribunal, which are appended to the end of the report, are also a damning indictment.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the McCracken tribunal were narrow by necessity but they were sufficient to suggest that further inquiries would be merited.  It is clear Mr. Haughey enjoyed a remarkably lavish lifestyle for more than 20 years. Mr. Ben Dunne's largesse accounts for two or three years, so we must ask if there were other benefactors over the years.  If so, the public is entitled to know their motives.  If Mr. Haughey was prepared to countenance the approach by Mr. Traynor and Mr. Fox on his behalf to a number of businessmen for money, as suggested by Mr. Dunne and apparently accepted by the tribunal, the question immediately arises as to <Col N="100" /> which other businessmen were approached and how often.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the probability of a multiplicity of such payments nor can a blind eye be turned to the possible motives of such donors. The public must wonder if it is possible to have confidence in the integrity of a number of policy decisions made during Mr. Haughey's tenure as Taoiseach.  This raises the question of golden circles and the beef tribunal.  We must also establish if Mr. Lowry's bizarre way of doing business influenced any decisions he made during his term as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference given to the tribunal strike the right balance.  On the one hand, we cannot have an inquiry which is open-ended and broadly based and, on the other hand, a tribunal which has such a narrow focus on a few specific areas that it leaves unfinished business and we are faced with yet another inquiry.  If Senator Connor seeks to include a range of other items, such as the Ansbacher accounts, which were held by private individuals and which the Cayman Islands courts ruled would not be accessible, or the Masri passport incident, and Senator Norris seeks to include the business community, it will lead to another beef tribunal.  We will then be back here in 12 months' time complaining about the cost and the fact it achieved nothing.  The Government has sought the middle ground in drafting these terms of reference, which are appropriate and correct.</P>
    <P>It makes sense that the first task of the tribunal should be the identification of donors.  As the Taoiseach said, we must follow the trail of donors so we can quickly establish if it leads to policy decisions made in the 18 year period covered by the terms of reference.  I share the distaste expressed by Senator Connor and others about the £38 million in the Ansbacher accounts and the convoluted ways of avoiding tax obligations. However, I wonder how the tribunal can get to the bottom of it, particularly in respect of accounts held by private individuals which have nothing to do with the two people who are the subject of this tribunal.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State we are fortunate to have experienced acceptable and, in many instances, high standards in the conduct of public affairs.  It is important to remind ourselves that the record is good.  A genuine wish to serve the country and the public good motivated earlier generations of politicians and it should be no different for us as we move into the next century. The pursuit of power for its own sake and in the interests of self-aggrandisement has no place in our political system.  We do not need people in politics whose sole interest is to get something out of it for themselves.  We need public service, not self-service, or a culture of greed fostered by people who are the most important people in the State.  It is a disappointment when one is canvassing in general elections to be repeatedly asked what we can do for them.  I have yet to <Col N="101" /> encounter someone who asked what we can do for the country.  We must look after our citizens and do what we can for individuals in our society, but the greater good of the country &mdash;<i>pro bono publico</i>&mdash; must be before us at all times.</P>
    <P>The question of remuneration is relevant in terms of being able to ensure we are not subjected to outside pressures which might make our conduct less than becoming.  That is not to say the people who hold senior ministerial office and the Taoiseach are not well paid; they are by the people's standards.  However, we should not be so defensive as to say that the remuneration of Members of the Dáil and Seanad should not be sufficient to ensure they are not exposed to outside influences.</P>
    <P>The McCracken report's recommendations on the Ombudsman and the powers he might have are relevant.  I agree with the Taoiseach that we should debate this issue.  While the extension of his powers might be beneficial, I am not convinced this is the best way, given the other duties with which he is faced.  It might be better to have a separate entity.  I am also pleased to note the Taoiseach's remarks that persons who fail to co-operate with the tribunal should bear their own costs.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendations are explicit. They state that the sanctions for failure to make disclosures should be strengthened in two ways. First, the making of a false declaration of interest should be a criminal offence and should not merely be dealt with internally by the House of the Oireachtas concerned.  Secondly, consideration should be given to introducing legislation to provide that the person found guilty of an offence under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1994, would be ineligible to become a Member of the House in future either for a limited period or permanently. That is relevant to us but it has not received much attention.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the House should examine it.</P>
    <P>Most of us who enter these doors are motivated by public service.  It is an old-fashioned idea, but a good one and it is part of the Republic we hope to defend and the people we hope to serve. People who conduct themselves in any other way deserve sanctions to be imposed on them by this House, the courts or the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 reads:</P>
      <P>After the first paragraph, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Bearing also in mind serious public concern that certain decisions (including as examples those relating to the sale of lands at Carysfort and Glending Woods, the rezonings of land in the greater Dublin area, issues <Col N="102" /> arising from the sale of the Johnson Mooney and O'Brien site in Ballsbridge, Export Credit Insurance, the grant of the ESAT Digifone licence, and the grant of citizenship under the Business Migration Scheme) made by holders of public office may have been improperly influenced or obtained.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This year has been a poor one for politics and politicians; our stock has never been so low.  The revelations about the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, and the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, have confirmed the worst suspicions of the public and sections of the media about our profession.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a new tribunal. Of late, tribunals have undergone a rehabilitation. Justice McCracken deserves our deepest gratitude.  His report is thorough and clear; it lays blame where blame is to be found and does so using the same moral criteria and, more importantly, the same language as the man in the street.  The latter is essential because people should read the report.  Gone is the confusion and obfuscation of the beef tribunal report.  My party Leader has already called for the referral of the full report to the DPP.  While I am reluctant to involve myself in decisions for which others are responsible, in this case the DPP, it is essential that prosecutions follow from Justice McCracken's report.</P>
    <P>We cannot underestimate the damage done to our political and administrative system in the perception of compliant taxpayers, ordinary people, PAYE workers and citizens when they see that system abused by those who put it in place.  This is no &ldquo;animal farm&rdquo; democracy and certain people cannot be seen to be more equal than others.  At one level I feel a personal sense of gratitude to Justice McCracken.  I have been involved in politics since the age of 18, when I joined the Labour Party and had visions of changing the world.  I may be wiser now but my fundamental values &mdash; honesty, integrity and decency &mdash; have not changed.  However, like other Members, I am under a cloud of suspicion. Thankfully, it is within our power to change that.</P>
    <P>The new tribunal represents the best opportunity yet to get to the bottom of the allegations which have dogged Irish politics and politicians for many years.  As such, the terms of reference should be as broad as possible.  Unfortunately, the Government has chosen not to take that road and despite a lengthy debate in the Lower House the terms of reference for the new tribunal remain unduly restrictive.  For this reason the Labour group has tabled a series of amendments which it hopes the Government will consider favourably. The key problem is that the terms of reference as currently framed approach the problem almost entirely from the wrong direction.  Money is the key.</P>
    <P>The money trails leading from the Ansbacher accounts should be pursued with ruthlessness. Not all of these trails will lead to politicians such as Mr. Haughey, Deputy Lowry or other figures <Col N="103" /> in public life, but they will reveal illegalities on the part of the individuals involved.  This process will throw light not only on illegalities which should be pursued in their own right but also on those which may lead, during the course of further investigation, to other potential abuses and abusers of the political and taxation systems.</P>
    <P>From my reading of it, the terms of reference proposed by the Government seem to preclude the pursuit of these money trails unless the investigators have reason to believe that they lead directly &mdash; the key word &mdash; to Ministers or political figures.  Private individuals, therefore, will be <i>de facto</i> immune to the tribunal's investigations. Crucially, other potential political figures whose links to the business world fall outside the scope of the Ansbacher accounts &mdash; they may include relations with people involved with those accounts &mdash; may escape punishment.  It seems that if a matter is not starting directly out of the Ansbacher accounts, the Government does not want to know about it.  The Ansbacher accounts are no longer a starting point for cleaning up the political system to the satisfaction of the general public, they represent the end in themselves.</P>
    <P>It is beyond me how the Government believes that this will satisfy the public.  The Government is aware of the issues which concern the public and these are cited in amendment No. 1 to the terms of reference which was tabled by my party. These issues are worth repeating and include: the sale of lands at Carysfort and Glending Woods; issues arising from the sale of the Johnson, Mooney and O'Brien site in Ballsbridge; the allocation of export credit insurance; the granting of the Esat Digifone licence; the operation of the business migration scheme and the alleged rezoning scandals in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the alleged rezoning scandals have been a matter of great concern to myself, the Labour Party and the public. As far as I am concerned, builders and developers have taken over the planning process particularly during the period during which development plans are framed and discussed.  The sight of builders and developers crowding the foyer and public galleries of Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council will always remain with me.  It gives me no joy to state that these people make major financial contributions to political parties and politicians during local and general election campaigns.  Why do I say this?</P>
    <P>Since 1985, I have received a number of unsolicited cheques from builders and developers towards my election campaigns.  I want to place it on record that I never cashed these cheques, which remain in my possession.  However, if Councillor Seán Ryan and members of the Labour Party who have opposed indiscriminate rezonings on a regular basis receive such <i>largesse</i> from builders and developers, it does not stretch the imagination to assume that those more favourably disposed to rezonings, such as Fianna Fáil councillors and the majority of their Fine <Col N="104" /> Gael counterparts, are or would be in receipt of substantially larger amounts, particularly because their votes have made millionaires of a number of these builders and developers.</P>
    <P>Politicians, whether they are engaged in national or local politics, should not place themselves in a position which could leave them open to charges of being under an obligation to any individual or business in any way.  I believe that the Electoral Bill must also include people who put themselves forward as candidates in local elections.  Until that happens, there will always be questions about contributions and the effect these have on the decision-making process.  Rather than addressing the issue head-on, it seems the Government is content that the cloud which hangs over politicians and politics will remain.</P>
    <P>My party has also called for an investigation into the use by Mr. Haughey, as leader of Fianna Fáil, of moneys paid to him through the party leaders allowance system from 1983 to 1992.  As other Members pointed out, the Taoiseach conducted an examination within Fianna Fáil and declared himself satisfied with the position.  The Taoiseach has been asked to do far too much, he has been asked to perform other people's functions. The moneys in question fall into a separate category from the ones which are subject to other lines of inquiry.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, was right when he said last week that in perpetrating tax fraud one was stealing from the public purse; but this question is more complex, it raises the possibility that a man who has not paid the due amount to the public purse has been availing of its benefits, a form of double theft which warrants a full and independent investigation by the new tribunal.</P>
    <P>Last week in the other House, after the amendment we had tabled was rejected by the Government, my party supported an amendment tabled by Democratic Left to have the donation of £30,000 in cash received by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, included in the terms of reference of the new tribunal.  In the intervening days the statement made by the Minister has been the subject of many analyses in the newspapers, including the Minister's local newspaper, <i>The Fingal Independent.</i>  There is consensus that the response given by him was unsatisfactory.  I share this view.  In accepting an unsolicited contribution of £30,000 from a business person he had not met previously or since, the Minister, an experienced politician, displayed a serious lack of judgment.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have accused our colleagues in the other House of failing in their duty to tackle the Minister to a greater degree.  Like the Minister, I was born and reared in Portrane. We went to the same school and played football together and my grandfather was the Minister's father's director of elections.  I caution the said commentators that an individual is innocent until proven guilty, regardless of the number of accusations made against him or her.  They should direct their ire at the Government which has <Col N="105" /> refused to have the matter cleared up at the appropriate place, the new tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the attitude of the Government on this issue.  It has done the Minister no favours.  His name will not be cleared until the matter has been investigated by an independent body such as the new tribunal of inquiry.  The proposed terms of reference condemn him to continue to live under a cloud of suspicion.  He does not deserve this.  I hope the Government will take this into consideration in looking at the amendments we have tabled.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed &mdash; this has been repeated by other Fianna Fáil figures since &mdash; that his actions in 1989 were being judged under a moral code put in place in 1997.  I take exception to this. I remind him and others in Fianna Fáil that Members of this House had to fight long and hard, in the face of opposition from the major parties and the Progressive Democrats, to secure agreement to the changes proposed in the recent electoral and ethics legislation.  What was the reason for the delay in enacting that legislation, which does not go far enough?  My attitude to political donations of the kind received by the Minister has not changed since 1989.  No politician should put himself or herself in a position where he or she can be compromised.</P>
    <P>This motion, properly amended, presents us with the best opportunity to rehabilitate the reputation of politicians which has been tarnished by recent scandals.  The Government should forego any short-term political advantage it sees in pursuing these limited terms of reference and accept the amendments we have tabled.  The issue at stake is an important one.  Politics is too important to be subject to public contempt.  Each time I knock on someone's door I am told, &ldquo;you are all the same&rdquo;.  I resent this.  This motion presents us with the best opportunity to convince the public that we are serious about cleaning up our act.  If we are not prepared to defend the integrity of politicians we have no business complaining when others, particularly in the media, fail to do so either.</P>
    <P>We complain when 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the electorate do not exercise their franchise in general elections.  Up to 60 per cent fail to do so in local elections.  They are disillusioned because of recent scandals.  We should stand up and say that we want to clean up the system.  So far as the Labour Party is concerned, the way to do it is to accept the amendments we have tabled.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Mr. Justice McCracken on producing what is an excellent and professional report.  It is both thorough and explicit.  It is sad that we are discussing terms of reference for what is the third tribunal to be established within a short time.  We can take a degree of comfort that <Col N="106" /> the system works.  Our democracy is a good one and a great example of what a young democracy can do.  We are a fledgling democracy &mdash; only 70 or 80 years old.  We have had problems but we are respected throughout the world and our system works well.  It is for that reason that we must compliment the Taoiseach on his statement this morning and support him in the actions he is proposing to take.  We must support the new tribunal and its terms of reference, which I agree with.</P>
    <P>The truth must prevail and be brought to the surface.  It is dreadful when it is suggested that a person holding the highest office in this land accepted a bribe of £1.3 million &mdash; perhaps more &mdash; or that one of our Ministers has accepted a bribe.  There is no suggestion in the report that anyone involved gave favours.  We have a democracy and a system of justice so we should accept that someone is innocent until proven guilty.  This tribunal has all the facilities to demonstrate whether there was any misbehaviour and its extent.</P>
    <P>Some of my colleagues referred to the business community.  I am a member of that community and I wish to defend it.  The business community is the backbone of the country.  I remind Senator Norris that it makes substantial contributions to academic and other institutions.  I do not agree with the suggestion that banks need to be investigated. Banks behave in a proper manner and work within the law.  Some use the system cleverly but they are within the law and have every right to do so.  Banks offer an important facility.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have many laws at their disposal and, as Senator Norris said, we should not tempt providence.  They have authority which they have not utilised to date.  If people are apparently living beyond their means, why do the Revenue Commissioners not take action to investigate?  They have access to all the information, much of which is confidential, although some occasionally appears in publications. There has to be some degree of confidentiality. One does not know what information Revenue has at their disposal although I have no doubt they made decisions in the best of faith. Thankfully, the terms of reference of the new tribunal will discover whether they did or not.  This tribunal and the last one are deterrents to misbehaviour in the future.</P>
    <P>The business community have to make money, which is not easy to do in these competitive times. We are more regulated now than ever before, for indigenous and parochial reasons and also to conform to EU legislation.  We should not jump to conclusions and tar everyone with the same brush.  As a businessman, I sometimes feel that if I am in a certain place, I must be corrupt.  There are many businesses which have done well and are held in high esteem nationally and internationally. I do not want anyone to have the misconception that any of these businesses behave improperly or that there is any impropriety on their part.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> I welcome the Taoiseach's statement and this tribunal and I compliment him on his prompt and thorough action.  I also compliment all parties for their accord in establishing what I hope will be the last tribunal of this kind for a long time.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I welcome your elevation.  I welcome and support the establishment of this tribunal, which is in the best interests of the political system and the people.</P>
      <P>In the past, some people in rural Ireland supported political parties on the basis of their strong ideology and the principled ideas of the people who led them, who still play an important part in the political development of the State.  While their position might be diminishing because of changes taking place, these people still look to political parties for credence, ideology, honesty and righteousness.</P>
      <P>The essence of the last tribunal diminished the views of many Irish people as regards the political structure and changed their thinking on national politics.  It behoves the Oireachtas, the Seanad and the elected representatives to put the State in order and restore the basic ideology of righteousness and ethics to the Irish people.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's introduction of a second tribunal.  In his visit to this House yesterday, he showed himself to be open, straightforward and anxious to deal with the situation in a fair and democratic manner.  Everyone will receive their rights within the law and people will not be found guilty until it is proven they have done something wrong.  It is right and proper that their legitimate rights are upheld.</P>
      <P>There is a public perception that there is a twotiered society, with different laws for those of high and low status.  The tribunal must allay that public misconception.  If it follows the line of the McCracken tribunal it may be successful.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated the Ethics Bill will be amended to deal with politicians and people in public life.  Money and power is at the base of this matter.  Politicians must be protected by law and the structures within political parties.  Money is corrupting although it is beneficial and a status symbol.  To a large extent, people in financial institutions are protected by the structures of those organisations.  Because of the new found wealth and the changes in society, political parties must put in place structures that will protect the interests of their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Goodman, who was at the centre of a tribunal that cost the State a great deal of money, was mentioned during the debate.  It is easy to bandy about the names of people in business and discuss their contributions to the State.  During Mr. Haughey's period in office Mr. Goodman was not given recognition at the tribunal for his contribution to the development of the agriculture industry and the State.  He was treated unfairly even though he is a businessman who has made a major contribution to the State.  While I accept there may be certain misgivings in this regard, <Col N="108" /> people who should have stood by him hung him out to dry.  I support the setting up of the new tribunal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Mr. Justice McCracken and his team on their superb handling of the tribunal of inquiry and their expeditious and welcome report and recommendations.  I also welcome the <Col N="109" /> Government's proposal to establish a further tribunal of inquiry, in particular the invitation to it to make whatever broad recommendations it considers necessary or expedient in light of its findings and conclusions about ensuring the integrity of public administration, compliance with company law, maintaining the independence of the Revenue, enhancing the role of the Central Bank, effective regulation of professional bodies and protection of the State's tax base.  I am pleased the Taoiseach spent a great deal of time yesterday and today speaking on this matter and on an equally important matter yesterday.  I was also pleased to hear him state that evidence of political impropriety was not discovered.  He said it is essential that we proceed to deal with the matter without engaging in witch hunts or scapegoating one or two individuals.  He also stated it is important these matters are sorted out expeditiously without having recourse to endless tribunals.  I subscribe to those views.</P>
    <P>I am pleased there was widespread consultation with the Opposition regarding the terms of reference for the new tribunal.  Those terms are welcome with the exception of the matters we have put before the House by way of amendment. The matter must be dealt with by following the so-called money trail.  The Taoiseach said the Ansbacher accounts will be examined, but the terms of reference in that regard are narrow.  He also referred to the need to dispel the atmosphere of cynicism which exists.  He said we must address the recommendations of Mr. Justice McCracken. The report states the tribunal considers it should be mandatory for any candidate for either House of the Oireachtas to produce to the Clerk of the Dáil or the Seanad, as the case may be, a certificate from such person's tax inspector that his or her tax affairs are in order and this should be accompanied by a statutory declaration to that effect from the person concerned.  That is a particularly welcome recommendation.</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment which is necessary for a number of reasons.  The McCracken tribunal established that money was held on deposit in certain Irish banks by offshore banks in memorandum accounts, namely Ansbacher accounts, for the benefit of Irish residents.  Only £1.3 million has been accounted for out of a total of approximately £40 million.  It gives rise to serious public concern that such a large amount of money is unaccounted for, particularly when the nature of the accounts and the way they were set up were commented on unfavourably by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Order Paper, in three separate paragraphs, referring to the terms of reference states: &ldquo;bearing in mind the serious public concern arising from the report of the tribunal&rdquo;, &ldquo;the fact that these accounts were for the benefit of Irish residents&rdquo; and &ldquo;noting further that the Dunnes Payments Tribunal was unable, by reason of its terms of reference, to investigate the source of the Ansbacher accounts other than in respect of sums paid by certain persons referred to in the said terms of reference&rdquo;.  Despite those three statements, <Col N="110" /> the terms of reference restrict the investigation and the proposed further inquiries to two named individuals.  There is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case to include all the memorandum accounts in the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>From Mr. Justice McCracken's excellent report it appears there was breach of all exchange control regulations.  The Constitution expressly states in Article 40.1 that all citizens shall be held equal before the law.  In view of the McCracken findings, the magnitude of irregular sums is incredible. We are not talking about payments of £10,000, £20,000 or £30,000.  One aspect of the equality principle enshrined in the Constitution is that the Legislature should not be discriminatory between classes of people.  In that regard I refer the House to the statement of the former President and Taoiseach, Mr. Eamon de Valera in the Official Report of 1937.</P>
    <P>To uphold the equality principle it strikes me that we need a rational basis to underpin the distinction between focusing on two individuals and neglecting to look at the remaining unaccounted for £38.7 million.  It appears once a <i>prima facie</i> case can be established it is unconstitutional in light of Article 40.1 to single out two individuals, necessary as that may be.  Do the new terms violate Article 40.1 of the Constitution?  The application of the principle of equality to the Legislature is clear.  It is, therefore, the duty of the Legislature, when setting up such an inquiry, to treat all citizens equally.  I can only presume discrimination in this instance is based on the fact of political involvement.  Is that legitimate discrimination?</P>
    <P>The honourable Mrs. Justice Denham held in the Supreme Court in the case of Howard <i>v.</i> the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland:</P>
    <P>In addition to recognising the rights to equality of citizens, the concept of equality includes the concept that in the execution of their power the organs of Government shall act with due regard to the concept of equality. Thus, while accepting there might be specific exceptions, in general the position of a citizen as a person should not be lesser than a person in the form of a body corporate of whatever status.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing a case for the two individuals concerned, as the tribunal of inquiry indicates that further inquiries are necessary.  However, the affairs of people other than the two individuals involved should be inquired into because of the known existence and irregularity of the so-called Ansbacher accounts.  I see no justification for a distinction regarding the remaining unaccounted for money in those accounts.  I strongly urge the Government to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach on their appointments.  As a person whose granduncle was Cathaoirleach in the 1930s and 1940s, I have some appreciation of the <Col N="111" /> honour bestowed on them.  I am a member of a family that has had great involvement in political life for many years, starting with my granduncle, then my father who served in Dáil Éireann for many years during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and latterly my brother who served for a number of years in the Dáil in the 1980s.  I am humbled to be appointed by the Taoiseach to this House.  In my tenure here I will strive in so far as I can to bring integrity, honesty and decency to my contribution. It is particularly important that those criteria be emphasised in today's discussion.</P>
      <P>I compliment Mr. Justice McCracken and his staff on the expedient way in which they took on this enormous task and on publishing a very valuable report.  It is particularly important that it is written in a language everybody can read.  We had experience in the past of tribunals which, having cost enormous amounts of money, produced vast volumes that basically amounted to very little.  We now have a succinct report which gives damning information on events that happened in the recent past.  It is worth bearing in mind that this information came to light only as a result of a family dispute.  We should be able to investigate any matter relating to Members of either House, and the same should apply to members of the public service.  It is extremely important that there is a system to investigate quickly a suggested impropriety on the part of a person in a position of authority and power.  Over the years in public life a rotten apple got into the pack and festered, leading to an extremely serious position.  The wrongdoings highlighted by the McCracken tribunal were alluded to earlier.</P>
      <P>It is sad the public, who have always suspected that politicians, whether local authority representatives, Ministers or Members of the Oireachtas, are all the same, all on the make and that you could not believe a word out of them, seem to be vindicated.  It is very sad that the public, whom we are supposed to be serving, feel that way about us.  It is incumbent on us to do everything in our power to change that.  We must bring about a situation whereby the public feel they are being represented by people whom they trust and that honesty, decency and integrity exist.</P>
      <P>Earlier contributors made many suggestions about the tribunal which it is unnecessary to go over again.  It is important we move forward and learn from the past.  However, in order to do so we must learn exactly what happened in the past, which is why I welcome the establishment of this tribunal.  It is extremely important we get detailed answers to some of the questions which have been asked over the years.  This is particularly important in terms of the public's perception of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that the full rigour of the law is brought to bear in relation to any impropriety which is shown to have taken place.  I read recently in the newspaper about an unmarried mother who failed to pay her television licence and was unceremoniously hauled off to jail in <Col N="112" /> front of her children.  Do we want to build a society which allows that to happen while at the same time not taking action on these other matters? We must take full action and anybody who commits a crime must be punished accordingly.</P>
    <P>We must move forward and give the public the perception that we are acting properly.  The terms of reference of this tribunal do a great deal in that direction.  People have suggested the lengthy investigation of many matters.  However, the terms of reference strike a good balance in terms of following the money trail and allowing us to investigate who provided money, how it was provided and where it went.  It is important this be done so that any impropriety can be identified and dealt with at a later stage.</P>
    <P>That balance is particularly important in view of our past experience with tribunals.  The beef tribunal sat over a very extended period of time. Unfortunately, its only result was the charging of a journalist, while many members of the legal profession made vast amounts of money.  That is not what a tribunal should be about; its purpose is to identify what actually happened.  The terms of reference put forward in this case will go a long way towards that aim.  I recommend the tribunal to the House.</P>

      <P>These Houses are awash with people from families rooted deeply in Fianna Fáil but who, like Senator Gibbons and I, felt driven out of Fianna Fáil by the spectacle of what that party had become.  We are beginning to see the resurrection of that party in terms of some form of re-engagement with what it used to stand for. Anybody who frequented Leinster House during the period I was a Member, from 1981 until my little accident in 1993&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think somebody else used that phrase about the Senator's party.  People should be wary of using these throwaway phrases because they come back to haunt them.</P>
      <P>There was something wrong with Fianna Fáil during that period.  I was amazed by the number of people in Fianna Fáil, particularly in social contexts, who could not understand why somebody like me, who had a commitment to the Irish language and who was, as one person who is now a junior Minister described it, &ldquo;sound on the national question&rdquo;&mdash; I never got a precise definition of that phrase &mdash; was not in Fianna Fáil.  The real shock was that I could never explain to that man, who is now a junior Minister, why I was not because my reasons were utterly incomprehensible to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observed these events as a total non-participant in the political process: I was not a member of a local authority and I am not a member of a political party.  I observed these events from the position of someone with considerable experience and with, despite what I might say from time to <Col N="113" /> time, considerable loyalty to the political process. I believe passionately in party politics.  Unlike some of my colleagues on the backbenches, I have never attempted to claim a moral superiority because I am an Independent.  I claim the privilege of independence to say different things, but I have never claimed a moral superiority because I am not constrained by party loyalties.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for party politics but I have no respect for people who use the excuse of party loyalty to ignore the reality staring them in the face.  That reality was a party leader who was extraordinarily rich without any visible means of support.  A considerable proportion of society chose to blink in front of that.  One journalist, who many Members regarded &mdash; sometimes with justification &mdash; as a nuisance in the political process, asked the question over and over again but most people chose to ignore it.</P>
    <P>We have now had revealed to us a spectacle which ought to make all of us involved in politics remember forever that what politics needs first is the trust of the people.  That seems a cliché or an old hat expression but we have all lost that trust. Anybody who has contested any election &mdash; even one as ephemeral and intangible as the postal ballot for the university panel &mdash; will realise that most intelligent young people regard it as an entirely sordid operation.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency on all our parts, because of this belief that we are all corrupt, to claim sanctity for ourselves which is beyond the norm.  We are not saints or any better than the rest of humanity. Our biggest problem, as I have often said in public, is that politicians must make their compromises in public while other people manage to do it privately.  However, that is not the problem.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the two biggest parties in this House would have the world believe they are more saintly than many of the rest of us.  They do not think they are doing that but they believe &mdash; and I think the Progressive Democrats would be at one with them &mdash; it is possible to receive large donations from business without being influenced in any way in their conduct of public business.</P>
    <P>I cannot claim that level of sanctity.  I know I will always give a better hearing to people who help me in elections and I will always respond more quickly to their telephone calls and letters because they have a particular value for me.  I would love to spend an hour &mdash; although the House would not thank me for it &mdash; analysing the complex motives behind that but it is the reality. I defy any Member to say it does not matter who telephones them in the morning, whether they are a supporter or whether they made a contribution.</P>
    <P>Those who do not understand how the public see us have, in the immortal words of Jethro Tull, &ldquo;got the whole damn thing all wrong&rdquo;.  The public sees us as being in the pocket of business.  It may see my friends in the Labour Party as being in the pocket of the trade union movement and see me as being in the pocket of Fidel Castro or some negative force.  Unfortunately, the terms of reference <Col N="114" /> of this tribunal will not eliminate that view. We will thoroughly investigate the misbehaviour of two people who brought the profession of politics into profound disrepute in a particular way. However, there cannot be corruption on one side only.  Corruption requires somebody to accept payment, somebody who is prepared to give corrupt payments and somebody who is prepared to use the system corruptly.</P>
    <P>In his column in <i>The Irish Times</i> Mr. Vincent Browne referred to a horrifying comment from a senior Government member that the reason the terms of reference of the tribunal could not be extended to investigate all the Ansbacher accounts was that so much hot money would leave the country on the spot that there would be a minor financial crisis.  Mr. Browne has emerged from this scandal with his reputation enhanced considerably because he focused on the issue when others chose not to do so.  I do not believe he is making up the quotation; somebody made that remark to him.  It implies that the country's financial foundations are hot money illegally acquired, illegally banked and which cannot be accounted for in tax terms.  That is a scandal and provides no basis for future development.</P>
    <P>There are two main issues involved.  First, I do not believe Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael when they maintain that donors do not influence them.  They are no more saintly than the rest of us.  I do not say, imply or hint that they act corruptly. However, their thought processes will be affected.  An example is the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to investigate tax evasion. As the Taoiseach said, the Revenue Commissioners are empowered to seek access through the courts to the bank accounts of named individuals resident in the State.  In other words, if they know who is fiddling and who they suspect of tax evasion they can look for their bank accounts. They cannot look for bank accounts in order to find out who is evading tax, which is how it should be.</P>
    <P>There is a simple solution which is applied in Denmark.  Every bank account should indicate the RSI number of the beneficial owner of the account, save for the accounts of plcs.  This practice should apply as a matter of law.  I challenge Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to agree to that proposal which would do no more than ensure that the owners of all bank accounts were identifiable and ensure that fair treatment applied.</P>
    <P>The second issue is why banks advertise profound levels of confidentiality with their accounts. From whom are the accounts confidential?  Why is there such an emphasis on confidentiality?  Is it for commercial reasons?  No. Confidentiality is a signal for tax evasion.  It should not be appropriate for a bank to hint at tax evasion in its advertising. We have found corrupt people in the political system, yet we have only begun to look at the corrupt people who hand out the money.  We are unwilling apparently to really pursue them in other than a couple of named cases.  I invite the Government to indicate what it intends to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> I agree with the amendments.  At least the Ansbacher accounts should be investigated. Nobody has given a good reason for not doing so, other than the one given to Mr. Browne, the implications of which are mind boggling in terms of the way our society operates.</P>
    <P>If at the next annual general meeting of AIB bank a shareholder attempts to ask why Mr. Haughey had a large debt wiped out, the shareholder will be told by the chairman of the board that he does not discuss individual clients' business. We will be left with the spectacle of one of the country's two biggest banks operating the standards which Mr. Justice McCracken attacked &mdash; a different law for the rich and the poor. Judgments against people for debts appear in newspapers for amounts between £1,000 and £5,000, yet a large multiple of such sums was wiped out for one individual.  Will the shareholders of that bank be able to question the bank's behaviour?</P>
    <P>The said bank has a dodgy ethical reputation. It was involved in the dodgy attempts to undermine the co-operative bank and stores in Britain. Did it use information made available to it illegally by disloyal servants of those companies? It never apologised for its behaviour.  Incidentally, the same bank now maintains that there was no crisis involving the Insurance Corporation of Ireland some years ago.  It has adopted the &ldquo;What crisis?  There's no crisis&rdquo; approach which we used to associate with Fianna Fáil.  Ethics have not taken deep root in many business sectors.  Cute ways of avoiding tax are part and parcel of business. We must deal with that aspect if we are to make progress.</P>
    <P>The proposed tribunal will do good work.  The McCracken tribunal was a success.  It was a model of how such matters should be tackled.  His team of investigators did a wonderful job in unearthing information which had been tied up in a convoluted series of bank accounts.  They did a great service to the country in what was not a pleasant story but an important one nonetheless.  This tribunal brings that phase of the story to an end. However, we have not even begun to eliminate the culture which underlies the story.  Unless we consider the areas of company law, corporate donations and transparency of bank accounts for the Revenue Commissioners, we will leave the fundamental problem untackled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion for the establishment of a new tribunal in so far as it goes.  I would prefer its terms were broader, in line with the amendments we have tabled.  It is unfortunate that the first tasks of the new Seanad have been to agree legislation for an amendment to the Constitution which will facilitate the work of a tribunal of inquiry and to agree to the establishment of such a tribunal.  The work of the tribunal will be almost entirely directed at the perceived wrongdoings of politicians.  We have to examine scandals and allegations of politicians <Col N="116" /> feathering their own nests.  We are collectively being tarred with the one brush and accused of being in a corrupt profession.  The perception in the public mind that politics is corrupt is serious and alarming.  One hears it said that people always knew this was going on and now there is evidence of it.  Politics is at a very low ebb and we must take all appropriate measures to investigate wrongdoing where it occurs and to ensure that procedures are put in place to make it difficult to happen again.  If this should happen again, we must ensure there is a mechanism whereby there is an expedient and speedy investigation into it.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the allegations we are dealing with relate to politicians at the highest level: a former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, who has been Minister at various important Departments from Finance to Justice and a senior Minister, Deputy Lowry.  In the newspapers today and yesterday there are reports of the Garda arresting a former Deputy and Minister on allegations of money laundering.  That file has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  These matters, when combined, cast a very dark shadow over proceedings here and in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We have a glimmer of hope in the report of the McCracken Tribunal that allegations of payments will be dealt with.  Judge McCracken has done a wonderful service for the State, producing a report of marvellous clarity and brevity.  No tribunal report should exceed 100 pages.  I remember trying to wade through the report of the beef tribunal.  That was a colossal tome of almost 1,000 pages which did not reach any substantial conclusions. Judge McCracken's report makes recommendations and it calls a spade a spade. The report recommends that the DPP should consider whether Mr. Haughey should be prosecuted for lying to the tribunal.  The Government should go a step further and send the report to the DPP formally, with a view to the entire report being examined to see if there are grounds for further action to be taken in relation to deceit, tax evasion, company law and the various elements of criminality the judge detected.</P>
      <P>We in the Oireachtas have a responsibility to look at the McCracken report's recommendations on our own affairs.  The report makes recommendations relating to Members of the Oireachtas and a special committee of the Houses should be set up to see how that matter can progress.</P>
      <P>The new tribunal has &ldquo;following the money trail&rdquo; as its central theme.  That is the most effective way for it to go about its business as it keeps a focus on the issues to be investigated.  The various sources &mdash; banks, building societies, offshore accounts, specifically the Ansbacher accounts &mdash; are specified.  Those who benefited from these sources are specified: Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry, as well as any Minister in the designated period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal is also to make recommendations relating to the Revenue Commissioners and how they exercise their powers, in particular with reference <Col N="117" /> to why they seemed so lackadaisical in looking into instances of taxation not being an issue with regard to obvious assets and wealth.  It is important to see how they have performed in the past with a view to future recommendations.</P>
    <P>There are recommendations on how political parties have received donations, how company law has operated in the State, how the Central Bank monitors matters, on the various accountancy bodies &mdash; and I would like the legal profession to be included &mdash; and how offshore accounts operate.  The terms of the tribunal are excellent and I have no complaints about them. However, there is scope, as there is with all legislation, to look at areas of either greater flexibility or specific issues.  We are addressing some of these in our amendments.</P>
    <P>The first amendment relates to certain controversial decisions about which there is an enormous amount of public disquiet.  There may be areas that other Members wish to specify but these need to be brought into the open in order that, by doing so, we show we are not hiding any area of controversy where political decisions may have had a bearing.</P>
    <P>We have specified the sale of lands at Carysfort, about which there was huge controversy. Questions arose as to the beneficiary and to how decisions were made about it.  Glending Woods mushroomed in value as an asset from £2 million to £50 million and various decisions were taken in relation to the rezoning of that area.  Senator Seán Ryan referred to the questions raised about rezoning of land in the greater Dublin area which were recently featured in &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; on RTÉ. Issues arising out of the sale of the Johnson, Mooney and O'Brien site in Ballsbridge were also the subject of considerable controversy.  Export credit insurance, the grant of the mobile telephone licence and the grant of citizenship under the business migration scheme are all matters that deserve at least a preliminary investigation by the tribunal to see if there are grounds for a full public investigation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Ansbacher accounts, it seems absolutely incredible that we have limited the terms of reference of the tribunal to examine only Mr. Haughey's account or the sources of money of which he is a beneficiary, as well as those of other Ministers at the time.  These are the two areas in which the £38 million which has been identified will be examined.  No extra work would be involved in determining what the other sources or who the other beneficiaries of such money were.  The account has been identified and is no longer an anonymous one.  It is simply a matter of investigating what other politicians or members of the public might hold accounts in the Ansbacher accounts.  We can be sure that such a secret account is for no good.  It is just possible that there may be some legal intention on the part of some of the account holders but the likelihood is that this account is a tax scam and a slush fund, as the indications to date would seem to imply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> To say that, having the account before us, we are not going to probe into it seems to me to be absolutely astounding when no extra time would be required to determine who the beneficiaries and what the sources of the money were.  That could be achieved in ten minutes.</P>
    <P>I requested yesterday on the Order of Business that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, would grace this House with his presence to make a personal statement and answer questions as he did in the other House.  That would be quite in keeping with Deputy Burke's remarks in the other House when he said that his intention was to make a personal statement to his colleagues and clear his name.  Arising out of his personal statement in the other House the general opinion of all commentators is that Deputy Burke has not cleared his name in a satisfactory fashion. The matter boils down to one particular point, which is that the incredible situation has arisen where a member of the public, whom Deputy Burke had never previously met and was never to meet again, handed him £30,000 in cash in two brown envelopes for his own personal use.  While there may be a plausible explanation, such an explanation was not provided to the other House, and we in this House would certainly welcome the opportunity to question the Minister here. The least we could expect from the tribunal is that it would seek to establish whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case to be answered in relation to that money and carry out a preliminary examination to determine that.  That is the gist of the amendment which the Labour Party has tabled.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the motion which is before us.  I am not happy that this is the type of business the House must deal with during its first sitting but it is necessary to seek, in so far as it is possible, to establish further information in relation to matters arising from the previous Dunnes payments tribunal.  Hopefully, we will begin the process of clearing the names of politicians which have been sullied over a period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to forget why we are here and what the initial reasons were for this entire situation arising.  There was some friction in the Dunne family and, as a result of that friction, the family decided to have an internal investigation of their business and a private investigation of their accounts carried out.  As a result of the report which was carried out privately for them, confidential information emerged which was subsequently leaked.  From that, it emerged that particular payments were made to two politicians in a very irregular and highly questionable fashion.  We are specifically dealing here today with payments made by one particular company to two specific politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The larger questions which must be asked are how many and what other politicians received money and what other companies and organisations have paid senior and junior politicians throughout the years.  That is an issue which has <Col N="119" /> not been addressed either privately or publicly. Until all political parties and both Houses of the Oireachtas carry out a much broader examination of the entire situation in relation to payments to politicians we will not restore the public confidence which is required at this time.</P>
    <P>This issue only came to light by sheer chance; one could say it was a freak accident.  As a result of what emerged from the Dunnes Stores internal examination of accounts, it was decided that a tribunal should be set up specifically to investigate these matters.</P>
    <P>The previous Government established that tribunal and must be complimented for the terms of reference which were put in place.  The result was that the tribunal operated very specifically and clearly and within a very specific time frame.  The cost to the taxpayer and the time limit involved was very tight and, as a result, we have a very fine tribunal report here today which makes very specific recommendations.  Mr. Justice McCracken, his legal team and staff must be complimented on a very fine job carried out within the terms of reference presented to them.</P>
    <P>As a member of a political party and the Oireachtas for some time, I resent the fact that all politicians are being tarred with the same brush and are being viewed by the public in a similar manner.  We are all aware that 90 to 95 per cent of Members of the Oireachtas are extremely hardworking, reliable, genuine and decent people who lose more through their involvement in politics than they gain.  That is a recognised fact. Unfortunately, a minority are doing the majority a grave injustice and until the majority of politicians in both Houses address the wider issue I raised here today none of us will have our names cleared.  The onus lies on both Houses of the Oireachtas and on the various political parties to address that issue.</P>
    <P>Individual political parties cannot stand apart from this.  They have their own rules, regulations, constitutions and their own party pledges which candidates sign at various times, particularly when they are selected as candidates.  Political parties must take a much stronger hands-on approach in relation to their candidates, their selection procedures and the general performance of potential candidates prior to their becoming candidates.  There is an onus on political parties to exercise greater scrutiny in the interests of the majority of candidates.</P>
    <P>We cannot have a two-tier situation in this country where some candidates in political parties gain very handsomely, in a financial sense, from donations made by individuals.  One could say that the Ethics in Public Office Act prevents that from happening; it may do so up to a point, but if a person is of the mentality that they want to deceive they will do so.  There is an onus on us, as politicians, to take action within our parties and within the Oireachtas to ensure this does not happen.  We must seek fair play for everybody within the political system.  That does not mean <Col N="120" /> that some candidates within parties should have a massive slush fund to spend at election time while others go to their bank manager and go into the red to fight an election.  This has happened but has not been publicly addressed.  If we do not, as politicians, address that issue it will be the sword on which we will fall.  There is a temerity and fear abroad in so far as we are very specifically focused on two specific cases here.  While that is highly commendable and necessary, let us deal with the broader issue.  Until we do that, we as politicians will not restore confidence in public life.  There is an onus on all of us.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to rehash the details of this report; they are on the record of both Houses.  It is shocking that people in senior political office, who had the trust of the people, were so disingenuous in their behaviour in accepting massive sums of money which left them open to bribery or blackmail.  Judge McCracken clearly reinforced that view in his report.  He made a number of recommendations but it is not necessary to set up committees to examine them.  The position is clear.  Matters are either right or wrong and they can be easily addressed without a great deal of bureaucracy.  Ninety five per cent of all decent politicians know what should be done.  The report's recommendations should be unanimously accepted and implemented, and we do not need to set up a committee to do that.  Initially, political parties could adopt the recommendations for future candidates.</P>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas should introduce legislation to copperfasten recommendations. They are highly commendable and we should not be afraid to implement them.  One recommendation is that a tax clearance certificate be provided by individuals prior to their selection as candidates in an election.  That should not pose any difficulty.  We introduced legislation which demanded that tax clearance certificates be provided by licensed vintners before their licences could be renewed in the courts.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander; if we can introduce that type of legislation for one sector of the community, surely we can apply it to ourselves. That should be done immediately.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation is that the powers and jurisdiction of the Ombudsman should be extended to deal with the Ethics in Public Office Act.  That is commendable, and I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say this morning that a referendum along those lines might be held in conjunction with the Treaty of Amsterdam referendum.  I hope legislation to that effect will come before this House shortly and the powers of the Ombudsman will be extended to ensure he can take action on the Ethics in Public Office Act.</P>
    <P>Another of the report's recommendations is that greater sanctions are needed in the Ethics in Public Office Act.  To date only a cursory examination has been made by a committee of the House but it was not in a position to impose serious sanctions.  That matter should be seriously examined <Col N="121" /> and taken on board by both Houses of the Oireachtas and by the various political parties.</P>
    <P>Although it was not in the terms of reference, Judge McCracken referred in his report to the funding of politicians and political parties.  He stated it was not satisfactory for the taxpayer to totally fund political parties.  Over the past 25 years a culture has developed in the political system concerning the funding of politicians.  As a politician I do not understand the term &ldquo;funding politicians&rdquo;.  I understand the term &ldquo;funding political parties&rdquo; but as a politician who has always funded my own political campaign I question the culture that has developed.  As every politician knows, if their paws are greased by any individual, regardless of the amount, he will never again be in a position to speak freely as a public representative. There is always the inherent danger that the funded politician will be beholden to a person who can call on him at any time to do or not do something.  He may even be threatened about becoming involved in an issue.  Political parties must be obliged to address this problem within their own structures.</P>
    <P>This report is to be commended.  It is a job well done.  I am pleased the Government has now agreed to set up a new tribunal, the terms of reference of which were outlined in the House today.  In view of the debate that has taken place here and the analysis of Members of the Lower House, I hope the Government will see fit to accept the amendments tabled by the Opposition. The more detailed the terms of reference, the better, and it is extremely important that the Government recognises that.</P>
    <P>I hope the new tribunal will be chaired by a person of equal competence, ability and efficiency to Judge McCracken.  I commend the Taoiseach for referring this morning to the appeal to the High Court in the Cayman Islands in relation to the Ansbacher account.  That is important to enable Judge McCracken further examine that account.  I welcome the statement by the Government that it will place all the resources necessary at the disposal of Judge McCracken to allow that appeal proceed.</P>
    <P>I hope when we discuss the report of the new tribunal, we will have much greater detail.  I hope also that we will have taken on board the recommendations made in the report of Judge McCracken.</P>

      <P>In the few years I have worked in the precincts of Leinster House, this is the third debate on a report of a tribunal of inquiry in which I have participated.  I too compliment Judge McCracken on the clarity of his report.  The main elements of it were covered in detail by the national newspapers at the time of its publication. It was considered to be a report which the ordinary citizen could read and comprehend.  I read half of the beef tribunal report but have yet to read the remainder; I do not think I ever will.  The hepatitis C tribunal report was clear in one sense but it was a little overloaded with legal jargon best understood by members of the legal profession. This report is distinguished by its clarity and the clarity of its recommendations.  There can be no doubt in anybody's mind about the conclusions reached and the recommendations made. I hope action will be taken in respect of the two main findings, the first of which concerns matters that may be followed up by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of both Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  I hope the Director of Public Prosecutions takes speedy action in regard to the papers and information sent to him by Mr. McCracken which deal with the alleged contempt and disrespect shown to the tribunal by Mr. Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators have articulated the view of the man and woman on the street on this matter.  We could have a lofty debate but we are only part of the way through a process which we must see through to its logical conclusion.  A recent poll in the <i>Irish Independent</i> shows that two-thirds of people believe politicians are involved in corruption. Instead of complaining about this attitude we must show that it is wrong and that we are capable of following through on the recommendations made in the report.  In particular, we must give early consideration to Mr. Justice McCracken's recommendation that we amend the Ethics in Public Office Act and change the way we respond to gross wrongdoing by Members of <Col N="123" /> either House.  It will not be easy to deal with such matters from a legal point of view but the public expects us to take action.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that during debates in this and the other House Members are on the side of the angels.  I participated in the debate in the Dáil on the Ethics in Public Office Act and remember the scorn heaped on the head of the then Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald.  The comments made at that time warrant rereading.  I believe many of the people who poured scorn on her would now readily admit that what she said was correct.  No proponent of that legislation ever accused a majority of Members of wrongdoing. However, we needed to put in place a system whereby allegations could be dealt with. Rumours feed rumours and newspapers never refuse ink, and if these matters cannot be properly investigated then the public will continue to believe that we are all involved in corruption.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government gives early consideration to introducing the type of amendment suggested by Mr. Justice McCracken so that there is some policing of sanctions by the criminal justice system.  The public is not confident that the sanctions and methods of investigation provided for in legislation are adequate.  We know that everything is done in as fair a manner as possible but the public regards the Houses of the Oireachtas as an exclusive club.  If the policing of the Houses of the Oireachtas is left in the hands of its Members it will do nothing to allay the public's concern or restore confidence in them.  The Government responded to the tribunal report by tabling this motion.  We must ensure that the new tribunal does its utmost to allay the concern among members of the public.  This objective can only be achieved if our amendments are accepted by the Government and included in the tribunal's terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the report many of the issues which gave rise to public concern in the 1980s and early 1990s have been reopened.  It is important for the tribunal to bear these matters in mind.  I am referring to issues such as the sale of land at Carysfort and Glending Woods.  It is interesting to note that while some public representatives who were on one side of the argument are now trying to put forward the other side of it they are still not prepared to have the matter investigated by the tribunal.  Other issues include the sale of the Johnson Mooney and O'Brien site, the rezoning of land in the Dublin area, the export credit insurance scheme, the ESAT Digifone licence, about which many members of the Government raised questions at the time it was granted, and the passports for sale, an issue which has never been cleared up and about which the public expects us to do something.  It is important for the tribunal to bear these matters in mind when applying itself to the task given to it.</P>
    <P>We must look at this matter from the point of view of what the man and woman on the street want.  The ordinary compliant taxpayer, the person <Col N="124" /> who has no option but to take his cheque with the various deductions at the end of the week, expects us to ensure that the tribunal examines the Ansbacher account in detail and not in the limited way proposed in the motion.  We need to ascertain what private account holders are engaged in tax evasion.  The public expects action to be taken when that information is obtained. There is a high level of disgust at the way in which the system allows, either implicitly or explicitly, rich people who can afford the right advice to evade tax, while workers in factories in Tullamore, Athlone, Mullingar and other areas have no option but to take what is given to them at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>The tribunal obtained this information but it could not be brought into the public domain because of the limited terms of reference given to the tribunal and the assurances given by Mr. Justice McCracken to certain people.  The terms of reference of the new tribunal should ensure that those accounts are inquired into so that people who are evading tax are identified and action taken against them.  We should extend the terms of reference to ensure that the tribunal investigates not only the sections of the Ansbacher accounts relating to Mr. Haughey but also the other accounts which it discovers have benefited him or associated people.  We would all like to know the information obtained by the tribunal in respect of the holders of the other Ansbacher accounts.  However, we cannot be given that information because of the limited terms of reference given to the tribunal.  I do not want a similar situation to arise in respect of the Ansbacher accounts or other accounts from which Mr. Haughey may have benefited.  Neither do I want to hear the new tribunal say, &ldquo;We obtained certain information but we cannot delve into it because it is not within our terms of reference&rdquo;. Our amendment is limited in its scope, yet it would ensure that any information which came to light in respect of other accounts which were of benefit to Mr. Haughey and the information obtained by the first tribunal in respect of the holders of the Ansbacher accounts could be published. For those reasons I strongly urge the Government to accept our amendment.</P>
    <P>Our second amendment relates to the manner of disbursement by Mr. Haughey of public moneys received by him by virtue of his office as Leader of Fianna Fáil between 1983 and 1992.  If any of us applied through our local GAA or soccer club or other local organisation for £1,000 from the national lottery we would have to do much paper work.  While this is very annoying and difficult to put together it is justified by the requirement that public moneys be properly accounted for.  The same reasoning should hold in this case.  The public who pay taxes to fund political activity deserve, without reservation or question, a full account of how that money is used.  That is why we want the tribunal to inquire into and report on this matter.  We want taxpayers to see how their money was spent and to judge if <Col N="125" /> it was in accordance with proper procedures.  That is a basic requirement in the smallest of clubs. This payment involved hundreds of thousands of pounds.  I support extending the inquiry to include payments to any party leader because full accountability is required in the spending of public money.  This money must be accounted for if public concern is to be allayed and the questions being asked on the street are to be answered as fully as possible.</P>
    <P>The third amendment proposes to give the tribunal powers to carry out a preliminary investigation into a matter discussed in the other House last week concerning the contribution of £30,000 paid to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant a full public inquiry into that matter. Members of the public are not satisfied with the statement and response to questions given by the Minister last week.  They are also not satisfied with the nature of some of the questions asked which they believe did not go far enough.  We want the tribunal to make a preliminary investigation into this matter and if it is found to be in line with what the Minister said last week, no further questions can be asked.  The tribunal should have the power to interview the other two people who were present at the Minister's meeting to see if all the accounts square up and to report to the Dáil on this matter of legitimate public interest.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 and 35 of the conclusions of Mr. Justice McCracken's tribunal report state that the possibility that political or financial favours could be sought in return for such gifts or even be given without being sought is very high and if such gifts are permissible they would inevitably lead in some cases to bribery and corruption.  The report further states that it is also not acceptable that any person or commercial enterprise should make such gifts in conditions of secrecy no matter how well intentioned the motives may be.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what the Minister said in the Dáil last week, these are not new 1997 rules.  These basic commonsense ethics have always applied.  I would consider the arrival of a stranger at my or anyone else's door bearing £30,000 in used bank notes in two brown envelopes, for which the recipient did not write a letter of thanks, to be a matter of secrecy.  How did the directors and auditors of Murphy Structural Engineers show the transaction on their books at that time?  Can they explain that excessively large sum of money, equivalent to £100,000 today, and the unusual method of payment?  The mantra trotted out of no favours asked or given will not deceive anybody. A former ministerial colleague of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, said as much in her column in <i>The Irish Times.</i> The public will not be taken for fools.  This matter needs to be cleared up once and for all.  That can be done in a decisive manner by including it in the preliminary investigation of the tribunal which would put the matter to rest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I started my political days in this Chamber and I am always happy to visit it but not to be re-elected to it.  I congratulate the Chair on his appointment by Seanad Éireann to be its Cathaoirleach.  It is a distinguished post and I wish him well in it.  I wish all the newly elected Senators well in their new term of office and I hope they will find it fruitful and happy.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach set out the Government's position on the tribunal at length when he opened this debate this morning.  I thank the Senators for their contributions of which we have a full note. I thank them for the positive attitude they adopted to this debate.  Many sensible ideas have been put forward which can be used to benefit us all in the future.</P>
      <P>I reiterate what the Taoiseach said this morning in thanking Mr. Justice McCracken for his work on the tribunal report.  It is a model of clarity. It is very precise and does not pull any punches.  It does not hide anything or anybody. Those who needed to be named are named.  It is a fine service to democracy and openness.  The Taoiseach made it clear that there is nobody in this or the other House who thinks it is acceptable at any stage to breach the public trust which appears to have been broken by the two individuals mentioned in the McCracken report in particular. That form of behaviour is not now and never has been acceptable in this or the other Chamber.  The challenge is to restore the public confidence by establishing a second tribunal, giving it real teeth, full resources and independence. I have no doubt it will report with equal clarity and vigour and will not show any fear or favour, but will name those who need to be named and say what needs to be said.  This and the other House have done a good day's work in facing up to the implications of the McCracken report and quickly establishing another tribunal to see where we go from here.</P>
      <P>It was not open to the Government, the Dáil or the Seanad to do otherwise.  It would have been a dereliction of our duties if we had not proceeded to investigate the matter further.  In that regard I thank Mr. Justice McCracken.  I say to him that we are taking the next logical step following his tough findings by establishing a rigorous new tribunal which I am sure will be equally tough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Opposition Members who tabled amendments to the Government's terms of reference and the parties with whom I had the honour to negotiate them.  I and other Government members spent many hours talking to members and leaders of other parties about what should be in the terms of reference.  Once the McCracken report was published and it was decided in principle that there should be a new tribunal an unprecedented step was taken of not doing what many a Government may have attempted to do, <Col N="127" /> draft their terms of reference in a hurry and hide or highlight whatever they wanted.  That would have been tempting to the Government, but that course was not taken.  The leaders and Whips of the other parties were consulted in detail over four days about what they wanted included and excluded from the terms of reference.  Those talks were detailed and comprehensive.  I am satisfied the terms of reference reflect the consensus of all the political parties about what powers are required to be given to the new tribunal.</P>
    <P>I understand Members have the privilege of tabling amendments and it is my job to reply to them.  The first amendment seeks to include in the terms of reference specific decisions including those relating to Carysfort, Glending, Johnson Mooney, Esat and export credit insurance.  The tribunal was set up with a measure of agreement from all sides to follow the money trail rather than the decision trail.  I participated in the first days of these discussions with colleagues on the other side of the House when it was made clear that the Government should not follow the decision trail.</P>
    <P>One proposal was that we should simply list all the decisions &mdash; some of which are mentioned here &mdash; examine whether they were controversial and if they need to be exposed.  It was made clear by all the other political parties that that was not acceptable. Instead they requested that the money trail be followed and that is precisely what we have done in the terms of reference.  I am surprised &mdash; I do not want to make political points because we are all trying to do the same job which is to get to the truth &mdash; that amendments appeared both in the other House and here seeking to investigate a list of decisions since my colleagues and I were specifically told that was not the way to proceed. I was told by Opposition colleagues the way to proceed was to go after the money trail, ascertain who gave money to whom and for what purpose and if there was political corruption and in that way everything would be tracked down.  It was made clear that the alternative to going through a list of 20 decisions and dragging every private citizen before a tribunal was not the way to proceed.</P>
    <P>There is an element of confusion in regard to the amendment as proposed.  The tribunal will follow the money trail.  It will be required to ascertain whether there were substantial payments, who were the donors, how much was involved, when those payments were made and whether any controversial decisions were made at or about the same time which could be linked to these payments.  That applies to both Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  The terms of reference are clear in that the tribunal is to ascertain, having followed the money trail, whether either did any act or made any decision to confer any benefit on that specific donor in respect of that particular transaction.  This approach is infinitely better than examining allegations about a particular <Col N="128" /> incident.  By following the money trail the tribunal will be focused and will not be prevented from doing what is required.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to have particular decisions investigated.  Those decisions will be investigated once the tribunal takes the view that there is a reason to investigate a particular decision.  The tribunal will ascertain whether any payments were made to the individuals mentioned in the tribunal.  If any such payments were made the tribunal is free to investigate whether they can be linked to any Government decision and, if so, it can open up that and other decisions in their entirety.  That is a strong power and a focused way of doing the business.</P>
    <P>To proceed the other way round &mdash; going through the decisions and hoping to find the money trail &mdash; would not work.  The Opposition made it clear to the Government it did not want it done in that way.  The money trail is the right way to proceed and it will work.  It allows all the decisions mentioned in amendment No. 1 to be looked at, provided any money movements of a suspicious nature are linked to these decisions. This could not be done in any other way since there could be 30, 40, 50 or 60 Government decisions and someone could ask that a new decision be added each day.  Many ordinary private citizens are involved in all these companies and one cannot assume they are guilty and require examination.  One has to assume all these companies are honest before investigating them. It makes sense to take the <i>prima facie</i> route.  That is the reason I have to reject this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 seek to widen the scope of the inquiry into the so-called Ansbacher accounts.  Two matters arise from the McCracken report in relation to these accounts: the possible breaches of the exchange control regulations and possible tax evasion.  On the day the tribunal report was received the Department of Finance formally requested the Central Bank, to which organisation the operation of exchange control arrangements was given in 1965, to investigate the issues raised by McCracken so far as exchange control regulations had been breached.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall in the case of Deputy Lowry it appeared to Mr. Justice McCracken that exchange control regulations had been breached. The Central Bank indicates that this involves going through many transactions but it hopes to be in a position before the end of the month to report to the Minister for Finance on its findings. When those findings are received the Minister will then be in a position, if it is warranted, to send those files and papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions for any further action.  When the Central Bank is in a position to conclude whether there was a breach of exchange control regulations by Deputy Lowry, Mr. Haughey or anybody else the Director of Public Prosecutions can take action.</P>
    <P>The other point concerns the audit procedures undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners.  The wording relating to the Ansbacher accounts in the <Col N="129" /> terms of reference, as proposed here, gives the Revenue Commissioners strong powers to chase up tax evasion.  If as a result of the tribunal further tax evasions come to light they too can be tackled.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Ansbacher accounts, since there can be no double think, the focus of this tribunal is to further investigate matters concerning holders of public office which arose from the McCracken tribunal.  It is not meant to be a witch hunt for everybody who ever did anything wrong in the State.  If that were the case we might as well have a permanent tribunal which sits from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. all year round and we might take out the telephone book and start investigating people from the top down, starting alphabetically. That is the alternative.  There must be a focus. The focus of this tribunal is the McCracken report which pointed us in certain directions.  The new tribunal is proceeding in that direction and nowhere else.</P>
    <P>The arguments from the media and some other quarters are woolly.  They suggest the investigation should be wider, deeper and larger.  If the Government agreed to that there could be a permanent tribunal.  I have already seen a headline, the authenticity of which I have not had an opportunity to investigate, which suggested lawyers in the new tribunal could earn £40 million. The beef tribunal cost £35 million.  I am all in favour of tribunals if they get to the truth and get on with the job quickly.  This tribunal has the teeth and the powers to do it quickly.  Those who suggest broadening the terms into a deeper trawl of everybody in the Ansbacher accounts need to think again.  We are talking about a huge job of work, enormous fees and a lack of focus.  The job here is to focus on the implications from McCracken I and ensure that McCracken II &mdash; as it is often called &mdash; deals with those issues.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 propose that the leaders' allowances be included in the tribunal for investigation.  Since this matter was raised some months ago the Taoiseach has investigated the matter.  In the case of the Fianna Fáil Party he has consulted the party's administrator, a person of unquestionable integrity, who during Mr. Haughey's tenure as Fianna Fáil leader administered the Fianna Fáil accounts.  That administrator has assured the Taoiseach these funds were disbursed for party political purposes only, mainly the salaries of party employees.  The Taoiseach has said he is satisfied with this assurance and has no reason to suspect there was any impropriety in relation to the use of these funds.</P>
    <P>The leader's allowance has been paid to party leaders since 1938 to meet the expenses of maintaining party operations.  It was always paid to a leader or a bank account nominated by the leader.  That applied to all parties until the passing, last December, of the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1996. Some former Members of the Dáil will recall that <Col N="130" /> acrimonious debate and, in particular, the stirring speech made by the then Minister for Finance concerning the media's attitude to politicians during that debate.</P>
    <P>Prior to that Act the payment was always made to the leader with no provision as to the purposes of the payment.  The 1996 Act changed that and specified that the money must go to parliamentary activities, including research.  The amount paid to political parties has always been known and it would have been the job of the members of those parties to decide how it would be spent prior to 1996.</P>
    <P>One has to be even handed about the party leader's allowance.  If a party leader's allowance has to be examined by a tribunal all party leaders' allowances would have to be examined.  They would have to be included over a long period which would mean sending for the accounts etc. It has been suggested, but no evidence has been offered, that the Fianna Fáil leader's allowance was misadministered.  The administrator has been interviewed and the Taoiseach is satisfied that there was no misadministration of those funds. Therefore, it is incumbent on anybody who wants to go any further with this allegation to say what evidence there is that this political fund was misadministered and to accept that all political parties will have such funds similarly examined.  We cannot do everything in this tribunal.  We are following McCracken, the issue of party leaders' allowances was not criticised in the findings of the McCracken report, and there is no evidence to suggest that such allowance was misadministered in any way.  One can throw everything into the pot but in that case one loses focus and does not get a result.  The Government therefore rejects these amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 seeks the inclusion of payments to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the tribunal's remit.  This donation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, has been the subject of a lengthy media campaign in response to which the Minister issued a statement setting out his position on the matter and indicating that he had issued proceedings against the person making the allegations in relation to the payment.  It seems strange that this person has yet to sign a statement of complaint to the Garda Síochána, given that he has been offered partial immunity by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In view of the continuing attention the Minister is receiving he decided, for the purposes of reassuring the public and his constituents that there was no wrongdoing, to take the unprecedented step of coming before the Dáil to make a personal statement and submitted himself to lengthy questioning by his peers in the course of which he opened up his political and personal life to a kind of scrutiny no one in this or in the other House would wish to endure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated quite clearly that he received this money.  He stated the circumstances in which he received it.  He answered every question on the floor of Dáil Éireann that was put to <Col N="131" /> him.  He is entitled to take the view that, having answered all the questions put to him with no exceptions, anyone else who has anything else to say should say it openly and honestly, not in the corridors of Leinster House.  If there are other allegations they should be made in the House and the Minister will respond to them.  If there are no new allegations, that should be the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister is entitled to that, as is everybody else in public life.  Charges were made to which he responded, answering every question that was put to him.  That should be the end of the matter. If nobody has anything else to say about the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it should be left at that.  It is a matter of putting up or shutting up. The Minister explained his position.  He went through a lot of personal agony in doing so.  He admits that the size of the donation was perhaps unwise.  He admitted the circumstances and explained that there were no favours asked or given.  Members should take his word and either produce evidence or withdraw the allegations. For that reason there is no point in pressing that amendment.  If it is pressed, I will have to resist it.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have given, I am unable to accept the amendments tabled by the Opposition. I should have mentioned that amendment No. 7 is technical in nature and the Attorney General advises me that the existing wording of this section of the terms of reference is adequate and fully embraces the meaning of the amendment as it is worded.</P>
    <P>My thanks to Senators for the debate.  Some good ideas came out of it which can be used in the establishment of the new Ethics Commission when the ethics legislation is brought forward.  I hope we can have a successful tribunal and make sure nothing is hidden, that we will get our new Ethics Commission and that the quality of public life here will be maintained.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann:</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind serious public concern arising from the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments) published on 25 August, 1997, which established that irregular payments were made to and benefits conferred on certain persons who were Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas between 1 January, 1986, and 31 December, 1996,</P>
      <P>And noting that the said Tribunal established that money was held on deposit in certain Irish banks by offshore banks in memorandum accounts (&ldquo;the Ansbacher accounts&rdquo;) for the benefit of Irish residents including Mr. Charles Haughey, (the history of which deposits is set out in Chapter 6 of the Report of the said Tribunal),</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> And noting further that the Dunnes Payments Tribunal was unable by reason of its terms of reference to investigate the source of the Ansbacher accounts, other than in respect of sums paid by certain persons referred to in the said terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Resolves that it is expedient that a Tribunal be established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, as adapted by or under subsequent enactments and the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, to inquire urgently into and report to the Clerk of the Dáil and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>(a) Whether any substantial payments were made, directly or indirectly, to Mr. Charles Haughey (whether or not used to discharge monies or debts due by Mr. Charles Haughey or due by any company with which he was associated or due by any connected person to Mr. Charles Haughey within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 or discharged at his direction) during any period when he held public office commencing on 1st January, 1979 and thereafter up to the 31st December, 1996 in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making the payment was connected with any public office held by him or had the potential to influence the discharge of such office.</P>
    <P>(b) The source of any money held in the Ansbacher accounts for the benefit or in the name of Mr. Charles Haughey or any other person who holds or has held Ministerial office, or in any other bank accounts discovered by the Tribunal to be for the benefit or in the name of Mr. Haughey or for the benefit or in the name of a connected person within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, or for the benefit or in the name of any company owned or controlled by Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>(c) Whether any payment was made from money held in any of the accounts referred to at (b) to any person who holds or has held public office.</P>
    <P>(d) Whether Mr. Charles Haughey did any act or made any decision in the course of his Ministerial offices, to confer any benefit on any person making a payment referred to in paragraph (a) or any person who was the source of money referred to in paragraph (b), or any other person in return for such payments being made or procured or directed any other person to do such an act or make such a decision.</P>
    <P>(e) Whether any substantial payments were made directly or indirectly to Mr. <Col N="133" /> Michael Lowry (whether or not used to discharge monies or debts due by Mr. Michael Lowry or due by any company with which he was associated or due by any connected person to Mr. Michael Lowry within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 or discharged at his direction), during any period when he held public office in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making the payment was connected with any public office held by him or had the potential to influence the discharge of such office.</P>
    <P>(f) The source of any money held in the Bank of Ireland, Thurles branch, Thurles, County Tipperary, the Allied Irish Bank in the Channel Islands, the Allied Irish Banks, Dame Street, Dublin, the Bank of Ireland (I.  O.M.) Limited in the Isle of Man, the Irish Permanent Building Society, Patrick Street branch, Cork or Rea Brothers (Isle of Man) Limited, in accounts for the benefit or in the name of Mr. Lowry or any other person who holds or has held Ministerial office or in any other bank accounts discovered by the Tribunal to be for the benefit or in the name of Mr. Lowry or for the benefit or in the name of a connected person within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, or for the benefit or in the name of any company owned or controlled by Mr. Lowry.</P>
    <P>(g) Whether Mr. Lowry did any act or made any decision in the course of any Ministerial office held by him to confer any benefit on any person making a payment referred to in paragraph (e) or any person who was the source of any money referred to in paragraph (f) or on any other person in return for such payments being made or procured or directed any other person to do such act or make such decision.</P>
    <P>(h) Whether any payment was made from money held in any of the bank accounts referred to in (f) to any person who holds or has held public office.</P>
    <P>(i) Whether any holder of public office for whose benefit money was held in any of the accounts referred to at (b) or (f) did any act, in the course of his or her public office, to confer any benefit on any person who was the source of that money, or directed any person to do such an act.</P>
    <P>(j) Whether the Revenue Commissioners availed fully, properly and in a timely manner in exercising the powers available to them in collecting or seeking to collect the taxation due by Mr. Michael Lowry and Mr. Charles Haughey of the funds paid to Michael Lowry and/or Garuda Limited trading as Streamline <Col N="134" /> Enterprises identified in Chapter 5 of the Dunnes Payments Tribunal Report and any other relevant payments or gifts identified at paragraph (e) above and the gifts received by Mr. Charles Haughey identified in Chapter 7 of the Dunnes Payments Tribunal Report and any other relevant payments or gifts identified at paragraph (a) above.</P>
    <P>And further in particular, in the light of its findings and conclusions, to make whatever broad recommendations it considers necessary or expedient:</P>
    <P>(k) to ensure that the integrity of public administration is not compromised by the dependence of party politics on financial contributions from undisclosed source</P>
    <P>(l) for the reform of the disclosure, compliance, investigation and enforcement provisions of company law (including in particular those which relate to directors' duties)</P>
    <P>(m) for maintaining the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of their functions while at the same time ensuring the greatest degree of openness and accountability in that regard that is consistent with the right to privacy of compliant taxpayers</P>
    <P>(n) for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the banks and of the financial services sector generally</P>
    <P>(o) for the effective regulation of the conduct of their members by such professional accountancy and other bodies as are relevant to these terms of reference, for the purpose of achieving the highest degree of public confidence, and</P>
    <P>(p) for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts, and to recommend whether any changes in the tax law should be made to achieve this end.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Payment&rsquo; includes money and any benefit in kind and the payment to any person includes a payment to a connected person within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Person&rsquo; includes any natural or legal person or any body of persons whether incorporated or not.</P>
    <P>And that the Tribunal be requested to conduct its enquiries in the following manner, to the extent that it may do so consistent with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) To carry out such investigations as it thinks fit using all the powers conferred on <Col N="135" /> it under the Acts (including, where appropriate, the power to conduct its proceedings in private), in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in relation to any of the matters referred to above to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry in relation to such matters,</P>
    <P>(ii) To enquire fully into all matters referred to above in relation to which such evidence may be found to exist, and to report to the Clerk of the Dáil thereupon,</P>
    <P>(iii) In relation to any matters where the Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry, to report that fact to the Clerk of the Dáil and to report in such a manner as the Tribunal thinks appropriate, on the steps taken by the Tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed,</P>
    <P>(iv) To report on an interim basis, not later than three months from the date of establishment of the Tribunal or the tenth day of any oral hearing, whichever shall first occur, to the Clerk of the Dáil on the following matters:</P>
    <P>the numbers of parties then represented before the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the progress which has been made in the hearing and the work of the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the likely duration (so far as that may be capable of being estimated at that time) of the Tribunal proceedings;</P>
    <P>any other matters which the Tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Clerk of the Dáil at that stage (including any matter relating to the terms of reference);</P>
    <P>And that the person or persons selected to conduct the Inquiry should be informed that it is the desire of the House that;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the Inquiry be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the <Col N="136" /> earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it, and</P>
    <P>(b) all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the Inquiry should, so far as is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals.</P>
    <P>And that the Clerk of the Dáil shall on receipt of any Report from the Tribunal arrange to have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas immediately on its receipt.&rdquo;</P>

In almost all cases there is need for careful monitoring because of the serious effects on the environment.</P>
      <P>The use of fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides has been important in increasing crop yield.  The discovery that crop yield could be improved by the application of nitrates, phosphates and potassium in areas where these are deficient in the soil has been of the greatest importance.  How much help are farmers being given in assessing whether the soil over which they are spreading expensive fertilisers is deficient in these minerals?  Farmers are becoming increasingly aware that excess fertiliser will run off into water courses and their money is literally going down the drain.  How much help are they being given to prevent this waste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just the waste of money that I wish to address, the adverse effect of high phosphate levels in our rivers and lakes must be addressed also. During the last Seanad I referred to the report of <Col N="141" /> the Environmental Protection Agency on water quality in Ireland for the period 1991-4 which makes woeful reading.  Leaving aside the steadily increasing pollution of drinking water in rural waters by E.Coli from animals in areas where there is over-grazing the report states that &ldquo;gross organic pollution by sewage and industry has been initially eliminated by the installation of new or upgraded waste treatment plants&rdquo; but that phosphorus is not removed unless there is specific phosphorus removal technology installed in the sewage treatment plant.  This technology has been installed in a considerable number of sewage treatment plants.  While the removal of phosphorus from these sources is relatively easy to achieve, it is much more difficult to deal with the diffuse agricultural sources which present a major problem.  They have made a major contribution to the deterioration of water quality, the deoxygenation and eutrophication of water and, directly, fish kills.</P>
    <P>Unless slurry and fertiliser are applied carefully, episodes such as those we witnessed this summer will recur.  There are regulations and guidelines in place but are they well-policed?  As Senators are aware, officials of the Environmental Protection Agency are not available at weekends. Is it not possible to secure the co-operation of the Department of the Environment so that action can be taken immediately an episode occurs?</P>
    <P>While policing is vital, it is of more importance to prevent abuses occurring.  In a joint Irish-UK study in 1995 Poulton and his colleagues pointed out that current recommended phosphorus application rates in Ireland are two to three times the rates recommended for the same crop under similar conditions in England and Wales by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries.  Have tests been conducted to identify those soils which may have been phosphorus deficient but which now have large accumulations of surplus phosphate which runs off with rain water into rivers and lakes?  This was pointed out in an article by Fay and his co-workers in 1995.  How easily can farmers obtain advice on the need to spread fertiliser?</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Environmental Protection Agency conducted a survey which showed that almost 30 per cent of river water could be regarded as eutrophic to a greater or lesser extent.  There is excessive plant and algae growth in many lakes.  During the summer the Lakes of Killarney had to be closed &mdash; a horrific spectacle &mdash; due to the growth of what is known as nuisance algae.  A major international angling competition had to be cancelled and swimming and boating became impossible.  The algae was so thick the lakes were considered unsafe for rowing boats as submerged rocks could not be negotiated carefully.  I am not a botanist but I am aware that a slight tilt in the level of nutrients in lake water can cause dramatic changes in flora and fauna therein.  It will take many years to reverse this process.  Because phosphates sink to the bottom of the lake, nuisance algae will continue to appear <Col N="142" /> each summer in strong sunlight.  Action needs to be taken urgently.</P>
    <P>In an article in the <i>Farmers Journal</i> under the heading &ldquo;Enrichment more serious than spills in fish kills&rdquo; our colleague, Senator Dardis, stated:</P>
    <P>Recent high profile fish kills, most notably in the Mulcair River, conceal the reality of water pollution.  Serious one-off incidents attract a lot of publicity and create controversy.  The Mulcair kill has led to calls for codes of practice, waterway authorities, countryside management plans and fisheries forums.</P>
    <P>However, a study of the causes of fish kills reveals that phosphates are a much more serious and insidious source of water pollution. Enrichment of waters, especially lakes, by phosphates from treated sewage effluent, household detergents and fertilisers has caused more enduring damage than the more publicised individual spillages or &ldquo;point-sources&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is at the heart of the matter.  We are dealing with high profile one-off incidents which are the easiest to control while little notice is being taken that pollution of water by phosphates is continuing unabated.  Senator Dardis went on to state:</P>
    <P>According to Chris Moriarty of the Fisheries Research Centre at Abbotstown &ldquo;point-source problems diminished rapidly after 1987 but have been gradually replaced by those caused by enrichment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Dr. Moriarty has written extensively on the matter.</P>
    <P>The general public is becoming increasingly concerned about the effect of farming on the environment.  I am concerned about this matter &mdash; I come from a farming background &mdash; because of its importance from an economic, environmental and tourism point of view.  We do not want to be known as the Emerald Isle because our lakes are emerald throughout the summer.  That would not be a desirable image to portray.  I am also concerned about the matter from a public health point of view.</P>
    <P>There are serious issues to be addressed.  Is the Minister for Agriculture and Food providing those who spread fertiliser with enough support and policing the situation where it is essential to do so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, who is unable to be present this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to tackling all sources of pollution which threaten our important inland water resources.  Responsibility for the implementation of legislation relating to water quality and waste management rests with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and the various local authorities under the aegis of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has adopted a catchment based <Col N="143" /> strategy for the management of rivers and lakes with the primary aim of ensuring high standards of water quality.  Comprehensive catchment monitoring and management systems have been put in place for Lough Derg and Lough Ree and are soon to be introduced for the Foyle catchment and Lough Foyle.</P>
    <P>The objective of the strategy is to readdress the deterioration in water quality in rivers and lakes caused by excessive inputs of phosphorous as evidenced by the Environmental Protection Agency's Report on Water Quality in Ireland &mdash; 1991-1994. That report recorded an increase in slight and moderate pollution in rivers from 21 per cent to 28 per cent, while 18 per cent of lakes surveyed were found to be polluted.  The strategy provides a clearer focus on a more systematic approach to the problem of eutrophication caused by excessive enrichment by nutrients.  It emphasises the importance of good water quality to the sustainable development of river and lake catchments, particularly in terms of fisheries, tourism, industry and other economic activity.</P>
    <P>The eutrophication of Irish rivers and lakes is related to phosphorous from a number of sources, including agriculture.  Solutions to the agricultural aspects of the problem must therefore lie in the correlation of fertiliser applications in farming with cropping requirements and the proper management and disposal of farm wastes in an effective and efficient manner.  Nutrient management has become a more important management tool with the enactment of the Waste Management Act, 1996.  Section 66 of this Act provides that a local authority may, on foot of water quality analyses carried out by them or by the Environmental Protection Agency, serve notice on landowners to furnish a nutrients management plan, based on a soil analysis of the holding, setting nutrient application rates and requiring the keeping of records on the production, treatment, transfer and application of farm wastes in such a way as to prevent or limit water pollution.  Before a local authority initiates this procedure, it will be required to consult with Teagasc and any other body or bodies as specified by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the appropriate nutrient application rates.</P>
    <P>The rural environment protection scheme &mdash; known as REPS &mdash; introduced in 1994 has a major role to play in reducing water eutrophication from agricultural sources.  The main aim of REPS is to establish farming practices and controlled production methods which will prevent water pollution and promote habitat conservation and landscape protection.  Among the REPS measures is a requirement to prepare a waste storage, liming and fertilisation plan for the farm. This provision of the scheme is specifically designed to protect and improve the quality of water resources by minimising nutrient losses.</P>
    <P>Since its inception in 1994, REPS has proved highly successful, with over 29,000 participants to date.  As a result, almost 900,000 hectares of agricultural land, which represents approximately 18 per cent of the total, are being farmed in an <Col N="144" /> approved environmentally friendly manner.  It is envisaged that up to 43,000 farmers will join REPS with expected spending of £350 million by 1999.  In discussions with the European Commission, the Government will be seeking to have the scheme extended.  It is estimated that up to 75 per cent of Ireland's farmers could qualify for REPS on the basis of the relatively extensive nature of their farming systems.</P>
    <P>One of the most important categories of on-farm investment from an environmental point of view is that for the installation of pollution control facilities.  Substantial assistance has been provided by the Department of Agriculture and Food in recent years in grant aid for pollution control facilities under the control of farm pollution scheme and the farm improvement programme. A total of about 1 million cattle and 800,000 sheep have been housed, with effluent storage of 6.1 million cubic metres and fodder storage of 2.6 million tonnes.  Some 26,000 applicants were grant aided to a total of £121 million between 1986 and 1995 under the farm improvement programme.  A further £145 million was allocated in grant aid to some 26,000 applicants under the control of farm pollution scheme between 1989 and 1993 and under funds agreed for the period 1994-99.</P>
    <P>These investments will enable farmers with pollution problems to stay in farming and will contribute to more sustainable farming practices, increased efficiency, improved pasture and income effects.  They will also indirectly benefit the agri-food industry, tourism and the economy generally, for example, through the reduction in water treatment costs as a result of reductions in pollution and in fish kills.</P>
    <P>In addition to grant aid under EU Structural Funds, a new tax regime is now available to the year 2000 for expenditure on controlling pollution on farms.  Under this scheme, a special year 1 allowance of 50 per cent of expenditure incurred on necessary pollution control measures will be made available up to an expenditure limit of £20,000.  The balance of expenditure will be written off in accordance with the normal wear and tear allowance of 15 per cent per annum for the next six years and 10 per cent in the final year. The scheme will also require that farmers adopt a nutrient management plan in order to protect and improve the quality of our water resources by minimising nutrient losses from agriculture.</P>
    <P>A Code of Good Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates was published jointly in July 1996 by the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  This code prescribes methods to prevent or minimise the pollution of waters from nitrates by adopting certain farm waste and nutrient management techniques in the storage of organic wastes, silage, dungstead and farmyard manure and soiled water.  Such management has the double benefit of avoiding pollution and maximising the nutrient value of farm waste.</P>
    <P>The code is available from all local offices of the Departments of Agriculture and Food and <Col N="145" /> the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Teagasc, local authorities and regional fisheries boards and all farmers are advised to take account of its guidelines.  Observance of the detailed advice and recommendations contained in the code will also make a significant contribution to a reduction in phosphorous losses from agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will considerably assist in tackling the incidence of eutrophication of rivers and lakes from agricultural sources.  They are a significant contribution to the total quality management approach which the agricultural industry needs to adopt more in all its sectors.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leat as ucht an post nua atá agat agus tá súil agam go mbeimís go léir ag obair leat don tír agus don áit seo.  Is mór an onóir domsa freisin a bheith anseo inniu agus an tAire Sláinte a bheith romhainn chun deiléail leis an argóint mhór ó thaobh sláinte i gContae Lughaidh.</P>
      <P>If I make errors in my contribution, it is because I am not used to the procedure of the House.  I hope I will make my point as clearly and succinctly as I can.  I welcome the Minister here to reply to the matter I wish to raise.  This concerns the Central Statistics Office's Louth Mortality Profile 1991-1995, which shows serious health problems for the population of County Louth.  There is a significantly higher death rate from heart disease in females, respiratory disease in males and females, deaths due to motor vehicles in males and females and cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lungs in males.</P>
      <P>In an index of 27 counties &mdash; Tipperary North and South Riding are counted as two &mdash; Louth has the highest rate of cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lungs.  It is also the worst county for deaths from all respiratory system diseases.  There are also very high rates of malignant neoplasms and as regards the incidence of breast cancer we are 22nd of 27 counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are serious health issues which must be addressed.  The <i>Journal for Health Gain,</i> published with support from the Department of Health, and Children, includes two fine articles on this issue by Dr. Alan Kelly, Dr. Hamish Sinclair and Dr. Dennis Pringle, &ldquo;Mapping Inequalities in Health&rdquo; and &ldquo;Identifying the Blackspots &mdash; An index of deprivation&rdquo;, which indicates poor health in a particular location, includes the factor of unemployment.  Unemployment in County Louth is higher than anywhere else in the country. Counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan have a combined population of 218,000 and Louth has a population of 82,000.  Yet the cumulative unemployment figures for Meath, Cavan and Monaghan are basically the same as for County Louth. Based on indicators of black spots for unemployment, County Louth has a serious problem.  The <Col N="146" /> population of County Clare is similar to that of County Louth, but County Clare's unemployment rate is half that of County Louth.  The population of County Waterford is also roughly the same as County Louth, but the number unemployed there is 2,000 fewer than in County Louth. The indications are that the unemployed tend to suffer from poor health and County Louth has the worst record in that regard.  Drogheda has an unemployment figure of 4,500 which is 200 greater than the total number of people unemployed in County Meath.  There are 3,900 on the live register in County Offaly.</P>
    <P>Car ownership is another indicator of health deprivation.  In the North Eastern Health Board region County Meath has the highest percentage of car ownership, with at least one car per family. The rate of car ownership is 78 per cent in County Meath, 71 per cent in County Cavan, 70 per cent in County Monaghan and 62 per cent in County Louth.  We must examine the effects of unemployment and the lack of ability to purchase facilities necessary for a healthy lifestyle.  One is three times more likely to die in a road accident in counties Louth or Meath than in anywhere else in the country.  Male and female deaths in road accidents in County Louth is particularly high.  I hope the Minister will address those points.  The health board and the Departments of Education and Science and the Environment and Local Government should also get involved.</P>
    <P>The question surrounding Sellafield is of tremendous importance in County Louth.  STAD has promoted an awareness of the effects of low level radiation in the county.  I am not sure whether funding has been provided for the legal case being taken by that group, but public representatives in the area are anxious the money should be provided.</P>
    <P>Lung cancer is another major cause of death in County Louth and throughout the country. Ninety per cent of deaths from lung cancer are caused by smoking.  Departments and voluntary agencies should make a co-ordinated effort to encourage people, particularly the young, to stop smoking.  As a school teacher I am aware it is difficult to stop young people smoking; young female students tend to smoke most.  The Minister and the health boards should endeavour to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>We should find out what is different about County Louth that is causing such high levels of ill health among the people there?  There is only one way to do this.  A lifestyle survey should be carried out in the county to find out what is causing the health problems.  Professional research indicates that some of the matters I have mentioned are high on the list of causes.  A minis-terial-led task force should also be appointed to address in particular the problem of unemployment in the county.  Despite the efforts of the IDA and other bodies, we could not provide a serviced site for a new industry in south County Louth if one wished to locate there.  Long-term unemployment impacts on people's health and <Col N="147" /> the Government must respond by appointing a task force to attract more employment to County Louth and better health for its people.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil duit as éisteacht liom agus tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh maith ar an chaint seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment.  I also welcome Senator O'Dowd to the Seanad where I am sure he will have a fruitful career and move on to other places if he wishes.</P>
      <P>I assume the Senator is referring to data from the recently introduced public health data information system produced by my Department.  It is intended as a minimum common data set of public health indicators and is designed for use, in the first instance, by the directors of public health in the health boards.  Data at this level of detail have not been readily available until recently and it is important to interpret the information with a great deal of caution for a number of reasons.  Rates of death or illness based on small areas and specific causes can show considerable variability.  To be meaningful they must be interpreted in the context of long-term time trends.  Even where a given rate of death or illness appears to be higher than the national average, the difference may not be statistically significant.  Differences in mortality rates may be due to lack of standardisation between regions in the recording of causes of death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that further analysis will be required by the directors of public health to determine whether the data to which the Senator referred are significant.  Subject to the comments I have made about reliability and interpretation difficulties, the following observations can be made about the individual diseases raised by the Senator.  The death rate from heart disease is best indicated by data on cerebrovascular and circulatory illnesses and heart attacks.  In the case of cerebrovascular disease, the death rate for females in Louth was very close to the national rate during the period 1991 to 1995.  The number of deaths per 100,000 population from this disease was 76 in Louth compared with 75 nationally.  The same applies to diseases of the circulatory system.  The Louth rate was 300 per 100,000 compared with 298 per 100,000 for the country as a whole.  In the case of heart attacks, the death rate among females in Louth has decreased somewhat in recent years, although it still remains above national rates &mdash; 134 per 100,000 population in Louth compared with 118 per 100,000 nationally.  Deaths from diseases of the respiratory system in both males and females appear to have remained stable in Louth while rates nationally have shown a gradual decrease.  The reasons for this divergence are not yet clear and will require further research.  In the case of cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lung, the death rate has fluctuated considerably in Louth.  Cancer mortality rates in urbanised areas along the east coast tend to be higher than the national average and Louth appears to follow this <Col N="148" /> pattern.  The National Cancer Strategy notes these apparent regional variations and indicates that further research will be necessary to determine whether they are significant.</P>
    <P>My Department has been conscious for many years of the importance of identifying and addressing the causes of preventable deaths in Ireland. The diseases referred to in the Senator's motion are among the chief causes of premature mortality, defined as deaths among those aged under 65, in Ireland.  Cancer and cardiovascular disease are two of the three biggest causes of death in the population aged under 65 years.  I emphasise that smoking is the single biggest preventable cause of cancer and cardiovascular disease.</P>
    <P>The data for Louth indicates that the death rates among those aged under 65 from the diseases referred to by the Senator have been coming closer to the national average in recent years. For example, the death rate from lung cancer among males under 65 in Louth has dropped much more steeply than in the country as a whole since 1980.  Similarly, Louth's death rates in the under 65 age group from diseases of the respiratory system have also been moving steadily towards the national average.</P>
    <P>The Senator will be aware of two important policy documents dealing with heart disease, respiratory disease and cancer that have been implemented by my Department.  These are the Health Strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future,</i> and the National Cancer Strategy.  Both documents, which were published by my predecessors, have my full support and I am totally committed to implementing their proposals.</P>
    <P>The Health Strategy points out that 20 per cent of deaths in Ireland every year are among those aged less than 65.  It identifies the key areas of risk that contribute to the likelihood of getting cancer and cardiovascular disease.  It then sets targets for each of them under the main headings of reduction in smoking; responsible use of alcohol; balanced nutrition and diet; and control of cholesterol and blood pressure.</P>
    <P>Cancer accounts for 7,500 deaths in the population as a whole every year and for about 6,000 deaths among those aged under 65.  The National Cancer Strategy aims to achieve a key target set in the health strategy: &ldquo;To reduce the death rate from cancer in the under-65 age group by 15 per cent between the years 1994 and 2004&rdquo;.  The strategy includes such initiatives as reorganising cancer treatment services, developing medical oncology and specialist palliative care services and organising targeted national screening programmes to combat breast cancer and cervical cancer.  These and many other developments under the National Cancer Strategy will be of benefit to the Louth area.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to implementing the Health Strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future,</i> and the National Cancer Strategy to best effect in all parts of the country.  I am confident that good progress will be made in reducing the rate of preventable mortality in the years to come.</P>
