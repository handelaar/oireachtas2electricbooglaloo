      <P>I have notice from Senator Maloney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to make a statement on the closing off of the Port Road in Letterkenny on Easter Sunday night.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to give serious consideration to the arguments of a group of social workers to have their qualifications and experience validated.  These social workers hold Bachelor of Social Science degrees, have long years of experience in social work practice and are employed by various agencies throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 30; motion No. 25.  Item 1 concerns the Committee and Final Stages of the Credit Union Bill and is due to conclude at 1 p.m.  We are all anxious to see this Bill enacted as soon as possible and I am sure Members will co-operate with this.  The Irish League of Credit Unions is due to hold its annual conference this weekend.  Item 2 &mdash; the Bail Bill &mdash; will be taken from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.  I have ordered Second Stage but if there is agreement among the Whips I would like to take all Stages of the Bill today.  The Bill is a short one and there is agreement on its general principle.  Item 30 &mdash; motion No. 25 &mdash; will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and if item 2 has not concluded by 6 p.m. we will conclude it after 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is acceptable to this side of the House and we will <Col N="258" /> give the Leader every possible assistance to conclude the business.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Credit Union Bill this side of the House is fully in agreement that it should be passed as quickly as possible.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has contacted us in relation to the Bill and has indicated its approval of it.  The league is anxious that the Bill should proceed through the Seanad as quickly as possible.  If it is satisfied with the Bill I do not see any reason for us to change it.  The Bill has been thoroughly debated in the Dáil and it would be superfluous to table further amendments.  That would be a repetitive and fruitless exercise.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader tell me whether I should give up any hope of having a debate in this House on the allocation of funding by the National Roads Authority?  This funding is fundamental to counties such as mine which have received less than half of the funding due to them. County Donegal, the Border counties and the west of Ireland, in general, have suffered discrimination in this area.  The National Roads Authority has allocated 73 per cent of its funding to the city of Dublin.  This constitutes further discrimination against rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>We are not debating the National Roads Authority on the Order of Business. There is a more appropriate manner in which to raise this matter.  The Senator should put a question to the Leader.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader to give me an explanation on this matter.  When I raised this matter on a previous occasion, the Leader said he raised the same issue when he sat on this side of the House and I thought I could expect a positive response from him.  I have raised the issue 20 times in this House and I am very disappointed at the lack of response received.  This issue is very important for local authorities in rural Ireland and an explanation for the National Roads Authority's neglect of rural Ireland has not been provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of terrorist attacks on road, rail and air services in Britain.  I trust that no Member of the Oireachtas subscribes to the benevolent theory that, because no lives were lost, there is no cause for concern or that such tactics leave Ireland untouched.  It should not be forgotten that this is a fascist tactic as it constitutes a direct attack on the edifices of the democratic system.  The IRA has a tradition of this.  In 1973 it threatened to murder Catholics <Col N="259" /> who voted on whether they wanted to stay in Northern Ireland or become part of the Irish Republic.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to express outrage at this development as he has done before?  He should do it in advance of the British general election because the indications are that the IRA intend to carry out a further fascist attack to disrupt the democratic electoral process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator McGowan in his call for a debate on the National Roads Authority. I understand a mid-term review is due to take place in July.  Everybody is aware of the bottleneck in Kinnegad which is in my constituency. A fair share has been allocated to Dublin city while rural areas such as the Border counties are in need of funding which will only last for a few more years.  Although time may be running out in the context of a general election, we should have a debate on this issue.  A two hour debate would suffice.</P>
      <P>Has the Leader further news regarding a discussion on communications and the proposals flaunted by the Minister regarding the introduction of a super authority which would oversee the independent Radio and Television Commission and RTÉ Authority?  There should be a debate on this issue before an election to clarify what the Minister is trying to achieve and so that our views can be heard.</P>

      <P>The waste management legislation of 1995 was brought into force in 1996. However, sections 57 and 58 are not yet in force. They are important sections and I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for the Environment the urgent need to enforce these sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his co-operation on the Business of the House.  The Whips will discuss whether all Stages of the Bail Bill can be taken today.</P>
      <P>I do not think I am expected to make a comment on Mr. Maloney's intervention.  Senator McGowan made a fair point, he raised this issue before.  Senator Cassidy is also reasonable in raising the allocation of funding.  A short debate would suffice and I will see if time can be made available, although Members will appreciate the pressure to get legislation through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator McAughtry that this new form of terrorism strikes at the heart of democracy. It is an attempt to terrorise the electorate and is the antithesis of democracy.  We strenuously condemn the suffering, hardship and inconvenience to which our friends in the neighbouring <Col N="260" /> island are being subjected, allegedly in the interests of this island.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy raised the question of a debate on communications.  If there is time I will facilitate this.  We may be here longer than most of us think.</P>
    <P>I will examine the question raised by Senator Sherlock.  I am glad Senator Mullooly raised the issue of vandalism in Glasnevin cemetery.  It is an appalling series of outrages and I will convey the views of the House to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Given that the Bill has concluded so quickly, I hope the House will not be accused of rubber stamping it, because any remarks, or the few criticisms, Members wished to make about it were made on Second Stage. There is a certain urgency about the Bill.  It almost concluded last week and I thought the Order of Business would be changed to facilitate that.  Now that it has concluded, I thank the Minister for introducing a long, comprehensive Bill.  It appears from correspondence that the credit unions are satisfied with the legislation and have no complaints.  They are great organisations <Col N="261" /> which are present in every town and serve people who might not be facilitated in other institutions. All members of credit unions are shareholders and have a voice, provided they have savings, and this makes the organisation all the better.  Those who run credit unions know what is happening in their parish and street and I praise them for their work.  I thank the Minister for his help in the speedy passage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I join my colleague in thanking the Minister for speedily bringing the Bill to this House, responding positively to the concerns raised by the credit union movement and processing the Bill in a manner which sees it passed by both Houses in a far better from than when it was published.  This is an example of democracy at its best.  The Minister is competent, caring and has acted for the general good of the people.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, as will happen when it is reported back to the Dáil.  We were right not to obstruct the Bill further as it was clear that any problems had been corrected.  The Minister took on board the concerns of the Irish League of Credit Unions, which were well explained to Members of both Houses.  The legislation presented to us was satisfactory to everyone so there was no point delaying it further.  The AGM of the Irish League of Credit Unions will be held in Killarney this weekend and its members will express themselves as being fully satisfied with the legislation.</P>
      <P>This has shown democracy in action.  The Bill has been a long time coming and there were problems with it.  Those problems were addressed by the Minister and I thank him for that.  The legislation will now allow credit unions move into the next century and continue their wonderful work.  &ldquo;Empowerment&rdquo; is something of a buzz word, but it describes what credit unions do for a large number of people who might not always be adequately served by the commercial banking sector.  Credit unions are not banks but they operate successfully in many communities.  The Bill preserves their ethos and meets their needs so we should welcome its passage and congratulate the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and Members of the House for facilitating the speedy passage of the Bill.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald &mdash; few Bills have attracted such comment and discussion both within and outside the House.  I think the diversity of views brought to bear on the published Bill have produced better legislation, which will guide the development and growth of the credit union movement into the next century.  It will be the vehicle to foster and nurture the continued expansion of the credit union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> It is remarkable that we should have ended with this degree of unanimity in both this House and the Lower House.  It is a tribute to the standing and regard with which the credit union movement is held by the majority of, if not all, public representatives.  I am pleased it has elicited such support.  I am also glad it has received the agreement and acquiescence of those who will have to operate the legislation and of the credit union members whom I hope will benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the significant service offered to our community by the credit union movement will be improved and enhanced as a result of the Bill and that the extraordinary growth in membership over the decades will continue. The movement will provide a significant alternative credit system for personal financing to many of our citizens and a stream of competition to the more orthodox financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Senators for facilitating the passage of the Bill.  As Senator O'Sullivan remarked, this is something of a milestone because the AGM of the Irish League of Credit Unions is taking place in Killarney this weekend and it was anxious that the Bill have passed all Stages before then.  The league has set itself this target for more than ten years.  It is extraordinary that so much time has elapsed since the notion of new stand alone credit union legislation was first mooted, but it has now been realised.  I acknowledge that Deputies and Senators on both sides have made important contributions to that realisation.</P>
    <P>I must record my appreciation of the officials in my Department, whose sustained and imaginative work on this Bill has brought it to this point &mdash; I did not have the opportunity to do so in the other House, through what I am sure was an accidental breach of Protocol.  It took an enormous amount of work, patience, effort and discussion and I thank them for the quality and calibre of their contribution.  I must also express my appreciation of the role of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who has had a significant formative influence on this Bill from its early stages.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your co-operation. We have produced landmark legislation which affects the lives of more than 1.5 million of our people.  That is a substantial day's legislative work and I am proud to have been associated with it.</P>

    <Title>Bail Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our bail laws have been the subject of legitimate public concern for many years.  The <Col N="263" /> Minister for Justice, since taking office, made it clear she regarded changes in our bail laws as a priority and this Government has taken decisive action on the matter.</P>
      <P>This Bill is clearly one of the most important anti-crime measures introduced since the foundation of the State.  The opportunity has been taken not just to give effect to the Amendment of the Constitution Bill which was passed last November, but to strengthen our bail laws generally. This represents a fundamental rebalancing of our criminal justice system in favour of the victims of crime and the law abiding members of society generally.</P>
      <P>The issue of bail has been discussed on a number of occasions in this House, most recently when the Amendment of the Constitution Bill was debated last year.  It is only right to record the very valuable contributions made by many Members of this House to the debate on this issue and I look forward to hearing their views this afternoon.</P>
      <P>In line with the constitutional amendment, the legislation will allow a court to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. The Bill also contains new provisions relating to amounts of cash or equivalent securities which must be lodged as part of bail; attaching conditions to bail, including conditions relating to good behaviour, and allowing forfeiture of bail where the conditions are breached; and tightening up the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</P>
      <P>It is important that this Bill should be seen in the context of the unparalleled programme of criminal law reform which has been undertaken, with the co-operation of this House, by this Government.  It would be appropriate to remind the House of what has been produced as part of that programme.  It is fair to say that for the two and a half year period involved an unprecedented number of major changes have been made to our criminal law, which have been broadly welcomed by the public.  These include the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act, 1995, and the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>They also include the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, which applies to drug trafficking offences and includes provisions allowing for detention for up to seven days of suspected persons; the issue of search warrants by superintendents in circumstances of urgency; and restrictions on the right to silence.  The Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1996, amended the Constitution in relation to bail and paved the way for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, will also speed up aspects of court procedure in criminal matters.  It makes general provision, for the first time, for the issue of search warrants in relation to the commission of serious offences such as murder or rape and <Col N="264" /> extends the application of certain other Garda powers.  It also allows for wider use by the Garda of &ldquo;stinger devices&rdquo; to stop stolen cars or cars that have been involved in crime.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Act, which was signed by the President yesterday, restates and clarifies the existing law relating to arrest without warrant in relation to serious crimes &mdash;&ldquo;arrestable offences&rdquo;&mdash; and in relation to Garda powers to enter and search premises to effect an arrest.  The Children Bill, which I brought before the other House, provides protection for children against abuse and will include provisions to outlaw all forms of child pornography and trafficking in children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.</P>
    <P>The Offences against the Person Bill, will provide a range of new offences to combat the distressing and relatively recent problem of criminal conduct involving syringes and blood.  The penalties provided range from five years to life imprisonment. The Bill also provides for a new offence of harassment aimed at &ldquo;stalking&rdquo;; a new offence of abduction out of the State of a child by a parent in a &ldquo;tug-of-love&rdquo; situation; and a new offence of endangerment to deal with conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice also brought into operation the anti-money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, as well as making regulations under that Act dealing with the seizure of imports or exports of cash associated with drug trafficking.  This Act required the actions which the Minister for Justice took to make it an effective crime fighting initiative.</P>
    <P>We also received approval from the other House for the terms of three important international conventions dealing with international co-operation on crime &mdash; the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the Additional Protocol to the Convention; the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime.  These conventions, which have now been ratified by Ireland, are very important measures which are enabling Ireland to co-operate extensively with other countries in the fight against drugs and other serious crime.  There is already evidence of the success of this co-operation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, establishing the bureau, and the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, allowing the exchange of information between various agencies, were introduced by the Government.  The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, allowing for the freezing of the assets of criminals, and the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996, dealing with child sex tourism, were accepted subject to extensive amendment by the Government.</P>
    <P>Last week the Government published the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Bill.  This <Col N="265" /> legislation will deal with the problem of drug abuse in public houses, dance halls and other places of entertainment.  It will also give additional powers to the Garda Síochána to prevent unlicensed dances, such as &ldquo;raves&rdquo;, where it is suspected there will be drug abuse. The Government looks forward to continuing this major programme of criminal law reform, and the measures being worked on at the moment include Bills on fraud offences, criminal insanity, indexation of fines, attachment of earnings and Europol.</P>
    <P>Any fair-minded observer would recognise that the Government's determination to take whatever measures open to it to tackle the problem of crime is evidenced by that legislative track record. This is especially the case with the legislation before the House today.  However, legislation alone is only part of the answer.  A host of other anti-crime measures have been taken, and it is especially relevant to mention that this Bill has been brought forward against the background of an unprecedented prison building programme designed to provide an additional 800 prison places, including a remand centre for 400 at Wheatfield.</P>
    <P>Turning to the details of the Bill, the earlier parts largely follow the outline legislation which the Government published in the context of the referendum last November.  Section 1 provides for certain necessary definitions.  The most important of these is the definition of a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo;.  The approach which we have taken to the question of defining &ldquo;serious&rdquo; in this context is to schedule certain offences to which the new regime will apply and to set a minimum term of imprisonment above which offences are to be regarded as serious.  For this purpose a term of imprisonment of five years or greater is considered appropriate.  To decide on the offences to be scheduled involved an examination of existing criminal law, but recognising that certain offences which carry a penalty of five years or more are either archaic or not ones where the question of re-offending is likely to be relevant, not all offences carrying such a penalty have been included.</P>
    <P>The Schedule, therefore, sets out the range of offences to which the definition of a serious offence applies, subject to the five years threshold which I have mentioned.  The offences covered include the common law offences of murder, manslaughter, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, kidnapping, false imprisonment and rape. A number of statutory offences are also included &mdash; for example, various offences against the person, sexual offences, offences concerning explosives and firearms, robbery and burglary, road traffic offences, offences concerning hijackings of vehicles, forgery offences, offences against the State, drugs offences and public order offences.</P>
    <P>An argument may be made that in the case of some scheduled offences which carry a potential penalty of five years or more, the actual crimes involved in particular cases might be relatively <Col N="266" /> minor.  This issue would appear to be inherent in any approach taken to the question of defining a serious offence.  It would obviously be difficult to attempt to determine this by, for example, setting a value in relation to goods stolen.  The circumstances surrounding a robbery can vary greatly. For example, the theft of someone's old-age pension may not involve a large amount of money but could have devastating consequences.  The alternative approach &mdash; and the one which has been taken in the Bill &mdash; is to specify criteria, as set out in section 2, which will in practice allow the courts to take into account the fact that an offence may be a relatively minor one of its kind.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides, in accordance with the authority granted by the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, the new ground on which bail may be refused, namely, where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by a person charged with a serious offence.  The section then specifies the criteria to which the courts are to have regard in making their decision.  These are the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence in respect of which the accused person is charged and the sentence likely to be imposed on conviction; the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence apprehended and the sentence likely to be imposed on conviction; the nature and strength of the evidence in support of the current charge; any conviction of the accused person in respect of an offence committed while he or she was on bail on a previous occasion; any previous conviction of the accused person, including a conviction which is under appeal, and any other offence in respect of which the accused person is charged and is awaiting trial.</P>
    <P>Having taken into account one or more of these matters the court may then have regard to the fact that the accused is addicted to drugs.  This would be especially relevant in some cases in assessing the probability of offending if released on bail.  However, in doing this we are not trying to criminalise drug addiction.  This fact can only be taken into account by the court where it is relevant to the question of whether a serious offence will be committed and after the court has taken into account one or more of the other matters. Let me stress that there is no question of a person with a substance addiction who does not represent a threat to the community being refused bail on the grounds of substance addiction alone.  I should also point out that, under section 2, the court does not have to be satisfied that any specific offence is likely to be committed by the accused.  If it was otherwise, an unreasonable burden of proof would be placed on the prosecution and the impact of the proposed change would be considerably weakened.</P>
    <P>Given that the Bill sets out a new ground on which the courts may refuse bail and recognising the need to ensure the speedy processing of trials of those who are remanded in custody, section 3 provides for the review of a refusal of a bail application if the trial has not commenced within <Col N="267" /> four months of the initial refusal.  This is an important provision.  While it has always been the practice to give priority to trials of accused persons remanded in custody, this provision will highlight the necessity for all concerned in the prosecution of offences to treat these cases as priority cases and avoid as much as possible a situation of an accused spending a long period in prison on remand.  If the trial for the offence has not commenced within four months of the refusal, the accused may renew his or her application for bail, citing delay by the prosecution in proceeding with the trial.  The court may then, if it is satisfied that the interests of justice require it, release the person on bail.  It should be noted, however, that this does not automatically entitle the accused to bail.  Rather, the prosecution must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that the delay is not unreasonable but is due, for example, to the complexity of the particular case.</P>
    <P>It will be evident that the provisions of section 2 clearly contemplate the hearing of evidence concerning an accused's previous criminal history in appropriate cases.  This obviously gives rise to concerns about possible prejudice to a fair trial of the accused.  To reduce the possibility of prejudice, section 4 provides that where a court is hearing an application for bail the previous criminal record of the accused cannot be referred to in a manner which may prejudice a fair trial subsequently. To prevent possible prejudice the court will have power to direct that the bail application be held <i>in camera,</i> or to exclude members of the public other than officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, bona fide representatives of the press, or any other person whom the court permits to remain.  The publication or broadcast of any information concerning the criminal record of the accused which was referred to during the bail application will be prohibited. Anyone found guilty of breaching this prohibition could face a potential fine of up to £10,000, or imprisonment for up to three years, or both.</P>
    <P>I turn now to section 5.  Under section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, an accused may be released on bail on his or her entering into a recognisance with or without sureties.  There is no requirement in the Act that the accused person or his or her sureties must, prior to being released on bail, pay any money into court.  In practice in the majority of cases no money is paid into court &mdash; the accused is released on the promise that the bail money will be paid in the event of the accused's failure to answer bail.  There has been much criticism of the apparently small amounts of bail money which are estreated where an accused has failed to turn up for trial.  This is accounted for to some extent by the fact that the estreatment process is seen as too cumbersome and lengthy to justify the resources required to pursue those who have not turned up for trial.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of great concern which we are determined to remedy.  To that end section 5 will <Col N="268" /> oblige an accused and any sureties to pay into court at least one third of the amount fixed by the court before the accused is freed on bail.  The fact that some of the bail money has been paid into court will have a number of beneficial consequences. It will mean that at least some bail money is available for forfeiture or estreatment in all cases where there is default.  Furthermore, where the court insists on prior payment into court, it has proven to be a great incentive for the accused to appear in accordance with the recognisance to secure the return of the money.</P>
    <P>One third represents a reasonable minimum proportion.  The court will have the option to accept from an accused or a surety, as security <i>in lieu</i> of the payment into court of the specified amount in cash, any instrument other than title deeds to land which is evidence of title to property. Where it accepts as security a bank, building society, credit union or post office deposit book, it will make an order directing the relevant institution not to permit the balance in the account to be reduced below either an amount equal to that required to be paid into court or the current balance, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>Under section 23 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, a person's release on bail is conditioned for his or her appearance before the court at the end of the period of remand.  That Act is silent on the question of imposing other conditions on an accused before granting bail. However, the courts in practice attach conditions to the granting of bail in many cases.  Such conditions frequently include a requirement to report to the Garda at stated intervals or the surrender of a passport.  Section 6 of the Bill will oblige the court to attach standard conditions requiring the accused to refrain from committing any offence and to be of good behaviour while on bail.</P>
    <P>In addition, the recognisance may also be subject to any other conditions which the court considers appropriate, including conditions requiring the accused to reside or remain in a particular district or place in the State; to report to a specific Garda station at specified intervals; to surrender his or her passport or other travel document in his or her possession; where the accused has no passport or travel document to refrain from applying for one; to refrain from attending any places and from having any contact with any person or persons which the court specifies.  These optional conditions can be varied on the application of the accused in cases where the court considers it appropriate.</P>
    <P>Recognising the legitimate interest of any person who acts as surety in preventing the estreatment of the recognisance or the forfeiture of the amount paid into court, provision is made in the Bill permitting the surety to return to court for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of the accused where it is feared that he or she is about to contravene any of the bail conditions.  Such an application may be aimed at preventing the estreatment or forfeiture which would arise if the accused breaches a condition.  A member of the <Col N="269" /> Garda will also be empowered to apply to court for a warrant of arrest where it is feared that the accused is about to contravene any of the conditions of his or her bail.  A person arrested on foot of such a warrant must as soon as practicable be brought before the court which made the order directing that the recognisance be entered into.  The court may then either commit him or her to prison, pending trial or until a fresh recognisance is entered into or further remand of him or her.</P>
    <P>It is important that any person who puts himself or herself forward as a surety is in a position to meet the financial commitment involved and that proposed sureties are suitable persons to act as surety.  To this end section 7 provides that the court which is considering a bail application which requires independent sureties will be required to satisfy itself concerning the proposed surety's financial resources, character, any previous convictions and his or her relationship to the accused.  This will also ensure to the greatest possible extent that the proposed surety is not only a reliable person, but also one who can be expected to have sufficient influence with the accused such that the latter will be likely to comply with the conditions of his or her bail.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill will permit the Garda to continue to release on bail persons who have been arrested on foot of a court warrant.  It will substitute a new section for section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  The new section takes account of the changes being made in procedures as a result of the provisions of section 5, concerning the payment of moneys into court, and section 6, concerning the conditions to be attached to the granting of bail.  Section 8 provides that in cases where a court issues a warrant for the arrest of a person, and the warrant contains an endorsement that he or she be permitted bail by the Garda, the recognisance will be conditioned for the accused's appearance in court as specified and the payment of the specified amount by the accused and his or her sureties as well as the conditions with which he or she must comply.  Only then will the person be released on bail.</P>
    <P>The present procedures for the estreatment of recognisances are seen by many as cumbersome. This point is also made in the Law Reform Commission report on the law of bail.  It stated that in a significant number of cases judges appear reluctant to order estreatment for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, when estreatment of the money promised by sureties is pursued, sureties have been imaginative at explaining away the absence of funds when called upon at estreatment hearings to fulfil their promise.  Clearly, the system is open to abuse and liable to be treated in a cavalier fashion by those whose only interest is to frustrate the effective operation of the law. Section 9 proposes to simplify and streamline the estreatment procedure by providing in cases where an accused breaches a condition of his or her recognisance, and where the court issues a <Col N="270" /> warrant for that person's arrest, that it will at the same time order the estreatment of the recognisance and forfeiture of the amount paid into court.  This will allow the immediate estreatment of the monies already paid into court, and the liability to estreatment or forfeiture of the balance of the recognisances entered into will remain.  The onus will then shift onto the accused or the surety to demonstrate to the court that circumstances exist which require it to vary or discharge the order for estreatment and forfeiture. This is a reasonable way of approaching the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will also permit the Garda to seek a warrant for the arrest of an accused in circumstances where it believes that an accused has contravened a condition of his or her recognisance. Section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, gives the Garda this power where an accused has failed to turn up for trial.  Where a warrant is issued in such a case for contravening a condition of the recognisance, the accused and his or her sureties will remain bound by their recognisances and any money paid into court will not be released until proceedings in connection with the alleged breach are concluded.</P>
    <P>The matter of consecutive sentences under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, has been the subject of much discussion.  The Law Reform Commission report stated that the view might be taken that section 11 of the Act, which deals with consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail, has been deprived of some of its deterrent power because of the courts' interpretation of it to permit them to suspend sentences and their view that while each sentence must be proportionate to the offence, the overall sentence must be proportionate in its totality.  We need to send a clear message to those who commit crimes while on bail that the fundamental breach of trust which this represents will not be tolerated and that anyone found guilty of such a breach should know that they will be liable to suffer additional penalties.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 10 is to strengthen the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, in relation to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed by a person while he or she is on bail.  It proposes to do this by amending the 1984 Act to provide generally that where a consecutive sentence is passed following conviction for an offence committed while on bail, the total sentence to be imposed should generally be greater than would otherwise be imposed and that the commission of an offence while on bail should be considered as an aggravating factor warranting the longer sentence.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 of the Bill deal, respectively, with the removal of references to Peace Commissioners from those sections of Part III of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, dealing with the grant of bail, and the repeal of sections 27, 30 and 33 of the 1967 Act consequent on the changes being made in the present Bill.  The removal of references to Peace Commissioners arises from <Col N="271" /> court decisions which held that Peace Commissioners do not have power to grant bail.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is a standard provision giving the short title of the Act and providing for the bringing into operation of the provisions of the Act by order made by the Minister for Justice.  As I indicated earlier, this Bill has been introduced against the background of the major prison building programme designed to provide an additional 800 prison places.</P>
    <P>Part of the Bill gives effect to the will of the people which was so clearly expressed in the referendum last November.  I believe that the other measures contained in the Bill will also receive widespread public support.</P>
    <P>It is some 32 years since the judgment in the O'Callaghan case which restricted the grounds on which bail could be refused.  At long last, and with the approval of the people, secured in the referendum last November, this issue is being addressed effectively.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the courage of the Minister of State in coming to the House to defend the Government's record on the bail issue.  That record is hopeless and appalling.  I also commend his courage in trying to bat off the most impossible odds by defending the indefensible, and attempting to pass off a case of serious delay on the part of the Government on the most important law and order issue in recent history.</P>
      <P>In January 1994 the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, submitted the issue of bail to the Law Reform Commission, which presented its report in August 1995 to the Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson.  Why did it take from August 1995 to November 1996 to hold a bail referendum?  Why did it take from November until April 1997 to bring forward bail legislation? I hope the Minister of State does not excuse the delay by saying that this is a complex area of law demanding specialised study and teams of experts.  The Bill has 13 sections and could have been drafted in a very short period of time.  I will show that many of the sections were drafted by Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did it take from August 1995 to April 1997 to hold a referendum and introduce bail legislation?  I admire the Minister of State's fortitude in defending such a position, but the Government sat on the issue and did nothing about it despite the murders and gangland warfare of 1996.  I will seek statistics on how many crimes were committed on bail in 1996.  The following people were killed between June 1995 and June 1996: David Weafer, in June 1995, Fran Preston in June 1995, Gerard Connolly in August 1995, Eric Shortall in November 1995, Catherine Brennan, whom I represented at constituency level, and Eddie McCabe in November 1995, Christie Delaney in November 1995, Gerry Lee in March 1996, John Reddan in April 1996, John Kelly in April 1996, Detective Garda Jerry <Col N="272" /> McCabe in June 1996 and Veronica Guerin in June 1996.</P>
    <P>Why was there such a delay in that period? That was not answered in the Minister of State's speech and I look forward to his reply.  The Minister of State will be aware that Deputy O'Donoghue brought forward a Bail Bill on 8 June, 1995, before the Law Reform Commission gave its report to the Attorney General.  That Bill was voted down, as was a subsequent Bill from the same Deputy.  The Minister of State should explain why the Government did nothing but sat on its collective wisdom between 17 August 1995 and November 1996, when it held the bail referendum.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State is honest, as I am sure he is, he will accept that the Government decided to hold a bail referendum on 2 July 1996.  That was when the Government issued a statement on its shock and horror at the terrible murder of Veronica Guerin in June of the same year.</P>
    <P>The Government was asleep for months, but was panicked into a decision when Veronica Guerin was assassinated.  Does the Minister of State understand why there would be disquiet among many members of the public that the Government was stampeded into action rather than acting in a planned and managed way?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not mention that the principal legislation enacted by the Government after Veronica Guerin's murder had been drafted by Deputy O'Donoghue.  The Minister of State should accept that Deputy O'Donoghue was showing leadership in the drafting of legislation and it would have been gracious to refer to this in his speech.</P>
    <P>I do not think the 1996 Garda report has been published yet, although the Minister of State could confirm that.  It is the practice that the Minister for Justice obtains that report some two to three months after it is published.  The 1995 report was received by the Minister early in 1996. Does the Minister for Justice have the report for 1996?  If so, will she publish it before the general election?  If not, why not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been published.  If she will not publish that report before the general election, I presume one of the reasons is that it will demonstrate clearly that there has been a large increase in the number of crimes committed by people on bail during 1996.  How many murders, muggings, robberies, etc., were carried out by people on bail during the period when the Government could have changed the law on bail but for some reason sat on its collective wisdom and decided to do nothing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State will not be able to contradict any of the dates to which I referred: the report of the Law Reform Commission of 17 August 1995, the bail referendum announcement <Col N="273" /> approximately one year later in July 1996 and the referendum which took place a few months later. It has taken five or six further months to publish the Bail Bill, a simple 13 point Bill.</P>
    <P>Another clue why this Government was so slow to publish a bail Bill and move on the bail issue is that it did not have prison places.  I will not blame the Minister of State for that.  Everybody knows it was the decision of the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and he accepted that in this House.  The Minister of State did not mention that in his speech.  On 9 February 1996 the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, stated: &ldquo;I am the person who proposed postponing Castlerea prison&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I referred earlier to another point which was not addressed in the Minister of State's speech, that is, that this Bill has been drafted largely by Deputy O'Donoghue.  For example, section 4 of Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill stated that a serious offence is an offence by virtue of which a person of full capacity and not previously convicted may be punished by a term of imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty.  Section 1(1) of the Minister's Bill states that a serious offence means an offence specified in the Schedule for which a person of full capacity and not previously convicted may be punished by a term of imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty.  It is copied almost word for word, and I can give three or four more examples where the wording of this Bill is taken from the Bill drafted by Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>

      <P>That is true.  The Minister should ask his spokesperson.  I played a large part in drafting the principal section concerned so the Minister should check his facts.</P>
      <P>It is a sorry sight when a Government waits approximately two years to act and when it cancels the building of prisons and claims that it is involved in a major building programme.  Fianna Fáil welcomes this Bill in so far as it is a logical consequence of the amendment to the Constitution which was passed in November 1996, but the question remains open given what this Government has done to the prison building programme and the reality of the number of existing prison places.</P>
      <P>The headline on the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 20 February 1997 stated: &ldquo;Prison Farce &mdash; Jailed for 12 months, Freed in 48 hours&rdquo;.  Does the Minister think that situation will improve when this Bill is enacted?  Does he think that when more people are being refused bail the headline will change to &ldquo;Jailed for 12 months, Served 12 months&rdquo;?  It will probably read: &ldquo;Jailed for 12 months, Freed in 12 minutes&rdquo;.  The reality is that people on early and temporary release due to the shortage of prison places have been committing crime up and down this country and this Government is culpable and stands condemned for that negligence.  That is a fact.  That is why Fianna Fáil will table amendments on Committee Stage which will improve and strengthen this Bill and why it is committed to the building of prisons by the private sector which can be leased back to the State so that prisons can be built quickly and efficiently and persons who are convicted of crimes can serve their sentences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the statements made by Senator Mulcahy when we bear in mind that bail has been an issue since the O'Callaghan case in 1966.  For the previous eight years, before we went into Government, not one whit was done about bail.  In 1989 I began introducing motions on bail in this House but each time I did so the Fianna Fáil Ministers &mdash; Deputies Burke, Flynn and Geoghegan-Quinn &mdash; voted them down. Senator Mulcahy quotes from the Bill and compares it to one originated by Deputy O'Donoghue. However, Senator Mulcahy is obviously unaware that two previous similar Bills &mdash; one introduced in the Dáil by the Fine Gael Opposition spokesperson on Justice, Deputy Barrett, and a similar one introduced by Deputy Gay Mitchell &mdash; were both voted down by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice.  The Bill before the House is very similar to those Bills.  Deputy O'Donoghue obviously copied the work done by Deputies Barrett and Gay Mitchell.</P>
      <P>One would imagine the difficulties arising from the lack of prison spaces arose overnight.  More spaces have been created by the Minister for Justice than by all the Fianna Fáil led Governments from 1987 to 1994.  By the end of this year 800 new prison places will be in train, an increase of one third, which is the biggest expansion of prison space since the foundation of the State.  I accept it is not enough, however, and that we must have a further programme to ensure prison spaces cater for the levels of crime which have escalated over the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy spoke about prison farces but I will remind him of a prison farce that took place <Col N="277" /> in the summer of 1994 when Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was the Minister for Justice and Deputy O'Dea was Minister of State at the Department of Justice.  At that time, 100 prisoners were released because arrests were expected during the Féile event in Thurles and extra prison space was needed.  This was highlighted after about 20 of the proposed 100 prisoners had already been released and there was a national debate on the prison farce taking place.  I received information that the 20 prisoners who had been released were being brought back to prison because of the furore.  On television, Deputy O'Dea announced the 20 people were back in prison but, by the time the news broke at 6 o'clock, the same people had been re-released.  He had brought them back into prison to announce they were there.  That was the level of prison farce with which we had to deal.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Justice has done more than anyone else to tackle crime.  The details have been outlined by the Minister of State in the House today.  I welcome the Bill which will give the courts discretion to refuse bail to anyone pending trial.  It will empower a judge to refuse bail to a person who, in the judge's opinion, is likely to commit further offences while on bail. Few people regarded the law as it existed since the O'Callaghan case as serving the country.  In fact, it only encourages criminal activity.</P>
    <P>In theory it sounds reasonable to uphold the golden thread of the presumption of innocence but in practice it operates as an invitation to professional criminals, who know they will be sent to prison for a long time, to start building up a nest egg for their release.  If someone is going to go down for ten years for a robbery they know they will only serve the same time if they are convicted of committing several more armed raids while awaiting trial.  I welcome the fact that the Government is dealing with this problem to ensure there is consecutive sentencing.</P>
    <P>Since I entered this House in 1989, I have pointed out that offenders on bail awaiting trial for serious offences have nothing to lose by going on a crime spree.  I was totally ignored until this Government did something about it.  There is nothing draconian in what the Government is proposing.  It applies in every other State, even the liberal Nordic democracies.  It is in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights.  It does not presume guilt before trial. Irish law has always allowed for detention before trial, whether because there is a danger of interference with witnesses or that the accused may not turn up in court.  Nobody challenged these provisions as being tantamount to internment or a presumption of guilt.  They are regularly applied in our courts.  This Bill will provide a welcome extension in ensuring that courts can decide to refuse bail to those who would use it to commit further offences.</P>
    <P>The Bill will reduce the number of serious and violent crimes, especially robberies and assaults, including sexual assault.  It reduces the threat to life and limb by professional, organised drug <Col N="278" /> pushers, gangs which specialise in aggravated burglary and car theft, and those who make a living from crime and who walk free from the remand courts to continue their criminal activity pending trial.</P>
    <P>There is a good chance that unfortunate citizens who find themselves staring down the barrel of a gun will be the victims of an assailant who has already been apprehended by the Garda, charged and then let out on the streets on bail. Our liberal bail laws benefit &mdash; if that is the right word &mdash; many relatively harmless offenders but those same laws are the daily joy of, and celebrated by, hard-core violent criminals who will scarcely hesitate to take life in pursuit of their objectives.  No state should ask its citizens or law enforcement officers to be victimised by those who have been apprehended in the act, often at great physical risk, only to be turned free pending trial.  The undeserving beneficiaries of our bail laws are the professional criminals, including gunmen, who prey upon the weak and vulnerable. The bail laws are being changed to confront those elements who daily and hourly commit serious crimes.</P>
    <P>The proposed law does not represent a fundamental breach of civil liberties or human rights, as some people seem to suggest.  It is necessary for the protection of civil liberties and human rights of the victims of crime.</P>

      <P>The fact that I am an elected Senator, as opposed to Senator Mulcahy, means that I take this job more seriously in addressing what I believe Senators are elected to do, that is to debate legislation.  I, therefore, intend to confine my remarks to this legislation.</P>

      <P>One or two definitions in the Bill do not seem to add up.  The definition of a &ldquo;criminal record&rdquo; in section 1 includes the phrase &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo; which seems superfluous.  The phrase &ldquo;reasonably considered necessary&rdquo; in section 2 is cumbersome.  That wording, which has been agreed by the people, means that before refusing bail it must be &ldquo;reasonably considered necessary&rdquo; to prevent a serious offence being committed by that person.</P>
      <P>Section 2(2)(a) states: &ldquo;the sentence likely to be imposed on conviction&rdquo;.  That appears to presuppose that the accused is guilty.  It should read &ldquo;if convicted&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;imposed on conviction&rdquo;. Section 2(2)(b) states: &ldquo;the offence apprehended&rdquo;; that warrants further discussion.  In cases of drug addiction, an addict may commit theft, burglary, etc., to feed their habit.  I would like to know how such cases will be decided because it will vary from court to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The six paragraphs in section 2 must be considered when determining if bail should be refused.  I accept paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) which are reasonable.  The beginning of subsection <Col N="279" /> (2) states that &ldquo;a court shall take into account ...&rdquo;.  That appears to emphasise the need for the court to consider each of the six paragraphs.  However, it also states that &ldquo;where it has taken account of one or more of the foregoing ...&rdquo;.  This seems contradictory because it allows the court to consider one of the paragraphs. The intention was to consider each paragraph on its merits as it applied to the individual case.  I am concerned about the drafting of this section.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the reference to drug addiction in this section.  The six paragraphs deal with the nature and seriousness of the offence with which the person is accused, the evidence in support of the charge, etc.  However, the subsection states that &ldquo;it may also take into account the fact that the accused person is addicted to a controlled drug within the meaning of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977&rdquo;.  That highlights a problem in our society but it does not deal with other issues.  The fact that a person is a drug addict leads one to suspect that the addict will turn to crime to feed that habit.  Does the same reasoning apply to a man with no means who suddenly builds a mansion?  Do we become suspicious of a white collar criminal who lives a lavish lifestyle but who submitted accounts which showed a loss to the Revenue Commissioners? Are we equally judgmental in assuming that a man who commits rape will violate another woman if released?</P>
    <P>I am convinced we do not view all crimes of equal importance equally or all criminals as equal wrongdoers.  White collar crime is rife but it is acceptable and almost grudgingly admired.  Those who commit sexual offences are driven by the need for power and control.  That will not go away because a term was served for a previous conviction. Why does this legislation regard drug addiction as the only additional criterion by which one's right to bail might be decided?  Anyone with a record of sexual offences, domestic violence or tax fraud should be refused bail.</P>
    <P>While statistics show that much crime is drug related that is not always the case.  However, drug addiction is the only crime listed in the Bill.  The Minister will say that 70 or 80 per cent of crime is drugs related.  I accept that but we, as legislators, must also deal with the remaining 20 or 30 per cent.  We must deal equally with all crimes. Drug addiction leads people to recommit crimes, but people who commit domestic offences and paedophilia are also likely to reoffend.  Yet, they are not listed or given individual attention in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the renewal of bail applications after four months if necessary.  Some say that is too long while others say it is too short; at least it is included in the Bill.  I accept it takes time to put together a book of evidence and that the circumstances in many cases will result in a delay of more than four months.  However, it is important not only to bring someone before the <Col N="280" /> court after four months but to tackle the delays in the criminal and judicial systems.  I hope the Department will continue to focus on that aspect.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the evidence of a previous criminal record.  It must have been difficult for the draftsman to draft this section because introducing evidence of a previous criminal record is bound to have an impact on the hearing.  It is difficult to determine how it can best be done unless the bail application is heard <i>in camera.</i>  Subsection (2)(b) mentions &ldquo;the <i>bona fide</i> representatives of the Press&rdquo;.  I do not know how that will work.  The court must determine who is entitled to be there during the bail application and how best to protect the good name of the citizen until proven otherwise.  The protection is discretionary because the subsection states that the &ldquo;court may [not shall] direct that the proceedings shall be heard otherwise than in public&rdquo;.  It does not ensure a private hearing of the evidence of a previous record.  I welcome the provision dealing with the prohibition on publications.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the payment of bail money, an issue which should have been addressed years ago.  Recognisance and bail are fixed in court on a daily basis.  However, no real consideration has been given to whether a surety has the money to do so, whether that surety will pay if called upon to do so or whether bail money should be collected.  This system has been abused in the past and I welcome the provision.  The requirement that &ldquo;an amount equal to one third&rdquo; or &ldquo;such greater amount as the court may determine&rdquo; of a person's bail should be paid to the court is a practical and useful provision.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 7 which, for the first time, puts in place a requirement that the background of persons paying a surety, and their ability to pay it, must be investigated.  This issue has long needed to be addressed and I welcome the attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>The conditions of bail as set out in section 6 appear reasonable.  Provision is made to vary the conditions of bail which will come into play where applications are renewed and circumstances change.  It is sensible that the legislation permits the conditions attaching to a person's reporting to a Garda station to be reviewed in accordance with any change in circumstances.  The endorsement on warrants in respect of a release on bail are well set out and long overdue.  I have always been puzzled that so many people could abscond while on bail and commit further offences without the gardaí, in the locality where such offences occurred, having knowledge that they were on bail.  If the system was computerised in terms of warrants, etc., it would be easier for the gardaí to know the current status of an apprehended person. Further work is needed in this area but the provisions in the legislation are well thought out in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 10 which amends section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  It is ironic that there was a need to restate the right of the courts to order consecutive sentences because this <Col N="281" /> existed in the past.  However, judges tended to take the seriousness of offences into account and did not desire to make this an aggravating factor in terms of the ultimate sentence handed down.  I do not believe that was correct.  There should be a penalty for committing crime while on bail. Section 10 specifically directs the courts to consider that issue and I welcome that.  Consecutive sentencing is fair and proper in circumstances where people commit further offences while on bail.  Such people must be aware that a penalty exists if they act in this way.  It is not good enough to state that these people might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, they must know that they will suffer a harsher penalty in terms of consecutive sentences.  Such a deterrent must be put in place and clearly set out in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy's comments were not helpful. During my contribution I addressed the Bill before the House.  It must be placed on record that this Government has been extremely busy in dealing with criminal justice legislation during my term as a Senator.  While much lip service was paid to these issues in the past, the Government has addressed them in the only way open to it, namely, in terms of legislation, providing funding, speeding up the judicial system, appointing additional judges, proceeding with Castlerea prison and the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  When Senator Mulcahy was still in nappies the Labour Party was seeking to address the issues of drugs and crime.</P>
    <P>With regard to the selective amnesia on the other side of the House, no one can afford to be smug in stating who has taken action on crime. Neither can any Member state that another party has failed to address that issue.  In fairness, each of us takes that responsibility seriously.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides for the wishes of the people as expressed in the referendum.  It will not be the panacea for all our ills because only a small fraction of crime is committed by people on bail.  The Bill can only address and prevent that part of the problem, but at least it is certain to do so.  It remains for us to address the causes of drug addition.  We must consider the issues of prevention rather than cure, Garda administration, in particular having gardaí who should be on the beat doing office work, and speeding up the court system in terms of dealing with evidence, etc. Having said that, we have come a long way and I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Mulcahy suggested that plagiarism had taken place.  He stated that Deputy O'Donoghue was responsible for wording parts of this legislation and other Bills.  As Senator Neville pointed out, when in Opposition the current Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Gay Mitchell, introduced legislation on this subject in which similar wording was used.  As a legal practitioner, though I would prefer to have him against me rather than on my side, the Senator will be aware that much of the language used in Bills of this nature is taken from previous legislation.  I do not believe Deputy Mitchell, any more than Deputy O'Donoghue or the Minister for Justice, is responsible for the wording in the Bill, given that it is built on previous legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to a number of Bills which the Government is alleged to have copied. I observed the actions of Deputy O'Donoghue and a number of his colleagues when introducing those Bills.  I am aware of the precise nature of their actions in bringing forward such legislation and I would consider following their example if I was in Opposition.  Perhaps I will do so when my party returns to Opposition in 20 years' time. Deputy O'Donoghue learned from the newspapers that the Government was considering introducing certain legislation and hunted for a <Col N="283" /> Bill to introduce in the Dáil.  In one instance he copied British legislation almost word for word, even though the conditions in this country are different from those which obtain in that jurisdiction. He cobbled together a Bill which he brought before the Dáil that was unrealistic and, in parts, could not be implemented or was not constitutional.</P>

      <P>For all the opportunities others had to resolve the problems with regard to bail which have existed for many years, it was this Government which put the issue to a referendum and which introduced legislation to tackle the issue once and for all.  That is the incontrovertible reality of the matter, which cannot be challenged by assertions to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill takes a two pronged approach.  It gives effect to the amendment to the Constitution passed by the people last November.  As the House is aware, since the O'Callaghan judgment in 1965 &mdash; numerous Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice did nothing about the bail issue from that <Col N="284" /> time &mdash; bail may be refused only on two grounds, where there is a danger that the accused will not turn up for trial or will interfere with witnesses or evidence.  The problem can be remedied following the referendum last November which allows a third ground to be taken into account.  When this Bill is enacted, a court will be able to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  It is important to emphasise that the refusal of bail is not automatic in any case.  We are enabling a court to take this factor into account.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the criteria which the courts must examine in making its decision.  The criteria in the Bill are broadly the same as those contained in the outline legislation published last November.  It is important to have a proper balance in the legislation and that is why the offences in question must be serious offences as defined in the Bill.  The Bill also makes provision for a review of bail applications where bail has been refused and the trial has not commenced within a four month period.</P>
    <P>The Bill does more than give effect to the constitutional change in relation to bail.  We have taken this opportunity, which was acknowledged during the course of the debate, to tighten up the operation of the bail laws generally.  These are important changes.  For the first time, it will be a condition of bail that a person does not commit offences while on bail and should be of good behaviour.  Persons who stand bail must, in effect, guarantee this behaviour and the bail money will be forfeit if any conditions of bail are breached. This should be a strong incentive for a person granted bail to honour the conditions attaching to it.  The incentive will be made stronger because money will already have been lodged in court which can be forfeited immediately.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also strengthen the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, requiring consecutive sentences to be imposed when offences are committed while on bail.  This is designed to deal with difficulties identified by the Law Reform Commission on the operation of the existing provisions. The message we want to send is that not only will crime not pay, but, even more so, crime committed while on bail will not pay.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the implications of a new bail regime for prison accommodation. The additional prison places which will be necessary cannot be wished into existence.  There was a long period under Fianna Fáil Administrations during which no new prison places were provided. The reason the Government faced a problem when it came to office was the ground work had not been done and the new places had not been provided.</P>

The Government approved an accelerated prison capital building programme which will provide the additional 800 places &mdash; 160 places became available in 1996, 180 places are scheduled for completion in 1997 and 460 new places are to become available in 1998.  That is a good programme given the starting position which faced the Government arising from the neglect of Administrations led by Fianna Fáil.  The Minister for Justice and I are proud of that programme. We will accelerate it and we will do better when we return to Government after the election.</P>
      <P>Criminal law reform is one element of the fight against crime and the Government has taken other initiatives in this regard.  One of the main features of the anti-crime measures announced last July was the recruitment of 400 gardaí.  The Minister for Justice obtained approval recently from the Government for her proposal to hold a new competition for the recruitment of gardaí over the three year period 1998 to 2000.  In addition, an extra 200 civilians will be recruited by the summer so that an equivalent number of gardaí can be released from clerical and administrative duties.</P>
      <P>As well as additional recruitment it is important that the Garda has a proper infrastructure available to it.  An information technology plan for the Garda is being implemented at a cost of about £36 million.  The House may also be aware that work is continuing on providing a dedicated air support unit for the Garda.  An effective further aid to policing is the use of closed circuit television systems.  Progress is being made on this development in a number of areas, most recently on O'Connell Street in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note Senators recognise that there must be a comprehensive approach to issues related to crime and that there must be an emphasis on measures to prevent crime.  I compliment Senator Neville on the points he made.  Emphasis must be put on crime prevention measures.  An example of such an emphasis is the operation of youth diversion schemes which specifically target young people who show signs of becoming criminals. The number of schemes in operation has increased from four to 11 in recent years and there are plans for further development in this area.  As the Minister with special responsibility <Col N="286" /> for children I pay particular attention to the youth diversion schemes and I have no doubt that many young people have been prevented from entering into a life of crime as a result of the operation of these schemes.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is one of the greatest menaces facing society.  The House will be aware of the wide range of initiatives which have been, and will continue to be, taken in this area.  In relation to criminal justice, it has become increasingly clear that there will be no untouchables as far as the Garda are concerned.  I commend Senator Gallagher on her contribution to the debate which was an extremely responsible one.</P>

      <P>I would not even consider making a comparison between them.  Senator Gallagher singled out particular aspects of the Bill with which she disagreed and she made many responsible suggestions as to how the Bill might be improved.  The Senator was unhappy with section 2(2) which states that a court may take into account the fact that an accused person is addicted to a controlled drug.  It is important to emphasise that this may only be taken account of in the context of whether a person is likely to commit a serious offence if released on bail.  This issue arises only where one of the other criteria has been taken into account.  The other criteria listed in (a) to (f) of the section will not all arise in every case; they will only apply where they are relevant to the case before the courts.  Drug addiction may be taken into account and there is no question of criminalising it.</P>
      <P>I note the point made by the Senator on whether sex offenders should be included in the same category as drug addicts.  Given my particular responsibility in relation to children, I was thinking in terms of paedophiles.  I have been informed that, in such instances, it is covered by other conditions in the Bill.  The possibility of a repeat offence may be taken into consideration. Though I thank the Senator for raising the point, it is already covered in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Irish Association for Victim Support for its valuable work.  The House will welcome the allocation of £280,000 to it this year.  My home was burgled recently and I was pleased to receive a letter from the association.  It surprised me as the burglary was not a serious one but credit is due to it for writing to me so promptly.  I will compliment it in a personal capacity at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks ago, the Minister for Justice published a charter for victims of crime and this is a significant development.  Inevitably, there was a general discussion on crime related issues during the course of this debate.  It is not possible to respond to every specific matter raised but it is worth making the point that this Government has undertaken a programme of fundamental reform on the operation of our criminal justice system. The House will be aware that we are committed <Col N="287" /> to the establishment of a new courts service and an independent prisons agency.  A review of the Garda Síochána is also being carried out under the strategic management initiative.  These measures are evidence of the Government's belief that it is not worthwhile to make changes which do little more than tinker around with the problem.  This Government is bringing about fundamental and well thought out improvements.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, under the strategic management initiative, will shortly publish a discussion document on crime which will be the first of its kind.  I hope it will lead to informed public debate on these complex issues and that the debate will address the many concerns which were expressed by Senators from both sides of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1)(a), between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii) require the accused person to enter into a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and to abstain from any form of criminal activity (including the commission of an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977-1984) for the duration of the case.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendments relate to the commission of offences by people who abuse drugs while on bail. If amendment No. 1 was accepted, amendment No. 2 would require the accused to attend at a designated location on specified days for the purpose of providing a urine sample which may be analysed to ascertain if the accused person has been in breach of the paragraph inserted by amendment No. 1 by consuming a controlled drug other than a drug prescribed by a registered medical practitioner as part of a recognised drug treatment course.  Amendment No. 3 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> Where, as part of an order admitting an accused person to bail, a Court makes an order pursuant to section 6(1)(b)(iii) and (vi), [which would be inserted if the previous amendments were accepted] the Court shall inform the accused person of the location of the nearest appropriate treatment centre for drug addiction and, if requested by the person, shall direct the appropriate member of the Probation and Welfare Service attached to that Court to make an appointment at that centre for the accused person.</P>
    <P>The amendments are self-explanatory.  Their purpose is to ensure that people on bail do not misuse drugs pursuant to the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984.  If a person is granted bail and there is a suspicion that he or she might be on drugs, the individual will be informed of the location of the nearest appropriate treatment centre.</P>
    <P>The amendments are sensible because a large element of crime is committed by people who misuse drugs.  It is in everybody's interest that, regardless of whether they are on bail, drug addicts are referred to a drug treatment centre.  I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the thinking behind the amendments I am not in a position to accept them.  Amendment No. 1 is superfluous and would cause confusion.  Section 6(1)(a) already states that a recognisance should include the condition that an accused person shall not commit any offence and shall otherwise be of good behaviour.</P>
      <P>The only difference in substance between the provision and the amendment is that the amendment includes a specific reference to the commission of an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984.  However, as the Bill already refers to the commission of any offence, offences under the Misuse of Drugs Acts are already covered.  If all offences are covered, it would make no sense to mention just one specific offence.  Why mention drugs offences and not murder?  In the other House, Deputy O'Donoghue accepted that point and withdrew the amendment.</P>
      <P>All three amendments stem from a particular approach to dealing with the drugs problem. However, regardless of the merits of that approach, the Bill is not the place to address it. The thinking behind the amendments is more appropriate to the misuse of drugs legislation or a sentencing Bill.  In particular, one cannot use a bail hearing as a device to attempt to deal with a person's drug problem.  The Bill already allows the court, in deciding whether bail should be refused, to take into account whether somebody has a substance addiction.</P>
      <P>However, this is only in the context of taking the decision on whether a person is likely to commit a serious offence if granted bail.  It can only be taken into account where other grounds also exist for believing an offence will be committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> The amendments move towards criminalising drug addiction itself in circumstances where a person before the courts has yet to be tried on the offences with which he or she is charged.</P>
    <P>There may be a case for a wider range of sanctions to be available to the courts when sentencing a person who has a drugs problem.  However, that is a different matter from the steps a court can properly take when deciding bail should be granted.  I emphasise that the Bill as it stands gives considerable discretion to a court to impose &ldquo;such conditions as the court considers appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case&rdquo;.  This is the sensible approach rather than including the specific provisions contained in the amendments in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the fact that the amendments would be inappropriate in the Bill, there would be substantial technical problems.  For example, would a designated location have to be defined? Who would be authorised to carry out a urine sample?  To whom would the report be made? What legally is a recognised drug treatment course?  Would evidence be needed from a medical practitioner?  Even if these practical issues were resolved, what could the amendments achieve in practice?  Is the Senator suggesting that if a trace of cannabis resin was found in a sample, a person's bail should be revoked although there was no evidence that the person involved represented a threat to the community?</P>
    <P>It is obvious from amendment No. 3 that the Senator regards a bail hearing as an opportunity to intervene where somebody has a drug problem. This would require a court to inform specified persons of the location of the nearest appropriate treatment centre and direct a probation and welfare service officer to make an appointment for the accused if he or she requested it.  It would involve the court exercising criminal jurisdiction. While judges often intervene to help an accused, it is not an appropriate approach to impose a statutory obligation on a court to become some type of referral centre for drug addicts when hearing bail applications.</P>
    <P>As amendment No. 3 would require a court to behave in such a manner where it made an order under the previous amendments, if they were accepted, such an order would be a condition of all bail applications.  The courts would then be obliged to inform an accused of appropriate drug treatment centres, regardless of whether there was any evidence that the accused had a drug problem.  The problem of how to tackle drug addiction is extremely complex as the relatives of those with addictions are aware.  Those complexities cannot be properly dealt with as part of a bail hearing.  However well intentioned, I reject the amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, the Office of the Attorney General, which assisted Deputy O'Donoghue in the drafting of the Bill, and all the officials concerned.  It is extremely important that we have a proper Bill to implement and give effect to the wishes of the people as expressed in the bail referendum in November 1996.  As I said earlier, the Government stands condemned by virtue of the unalterable fact of its delay in this matter.  I will not go into that in further detail &mdash; suffice to remind the House that the Law Reform Commission report on bail has been available to the Government since August 1995&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sorry that more senior figures in the Labour Party and Democratic Left are not here to explain why nothing happened then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At last we have a Bill which rightly gives legislative expression to the desire of the people to change our bail laws.  The majority of the people accept that the likelihood of a person committing an offence while on bail should be taken into account by a judge in deciding to grant bail.  In so <Col N="292" /> far as this Bill gives expression to that principle it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I again record the excellent work of Deputy O'Donoghue in drafting his Bill.  In my first contribution I only mentioned one section which the Government copied in drafting this Bill.  There are at least five provisions whose wording the Government copied.</P>

      <P>I am delighted we have a Bail Bill at last. Nevertheless, I do not think bail should ever be refused in a genuine case.  Bail remains as a constitutional right.  However, given the current crime crisis in society it is better that somebody who is likely to commit a serious offence while on bail should not get bail.  Having thanked everyone, paid tributes where appropriate and criticised the appropriate parties for their delay in this matter, we have done a good day's work for the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to set the record straight and place the blame on the appropriate party for the long delay in bringing this Bill before the House.  Nothing happened between 1987 and 1994, other than the then Opposition, led in the other House by Deputy Gay Mitchell and by me in this House, bringing pressure to bear on the <Col N="293" /> Government as a result of which the then Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, decided to send the matter to the Law Reform Commission after six or seven years.  However, she did not ask the commission to make a recommendation because she did not want one.  In fact, she did not need a recommendation because she had been getting one for many years from Fine Gael and the Labour Party when they were in Opposition.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State on holding the referendum and giving the people an opportunity to decide that the law should be changed.  I compliment the Minister of State on bringing this Bill through the House.  This is a very bad day for criminals and a good day for society and potential victims of crime.  I am satisfied there will be a reduction in crime because of this Bill, more so in serious rather than petty crimes.  I welcome the passage of the Bill through the House.</P>

      <P>I join with Senators Neville and Mulcahy in welcoming the Bill and I commend the Minister of State on bringing it safely through the House.  I listened to Senator Mulcahy's earlier comments on the generosity of the Minister of State, Deputy Currie.  Not alone was the Minister of State generous to a fault, he was also extremely kind to Senator Mulcahy.  I do not intend to be as kind.</P>
      <P>It is a joke to be lectured on law and order and the police by Senator Mulcahy of Fianna Fáil. That party introduced the phrase &ldquo;Do you want a pint or a transfer?&rdquo; to the English language and subverted the police force.  I do not have to go back too far to talk about tape recorders and assistant commissioners.  Fianna Fáil's record is pretty dodgy in that area.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy's <i>modus operandi</i> for the best part of a year has been to come to the House and pretend this country is under a state of siege because he believes there are votes in it.  He attempts on every occasion to ratchet up the fear factor and he does not mind who he uses for that purpose, young or old.  Putting the fear of God into people is Senator Mulcahy's bag.  I can tell him that will fail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Neville has done his homework and, far from deserving to be lauded, all Deputy O'Donoghue did was to get access to a photocopying machine and copy what someone else did.  Somebody once made a speech in this House which I said sounded very like a speech I had heard three years previously on the matter.  He said I was right because he was speaking from a speech which was given by Oscar Traynor in 1947.  Deputy O'Donoghue did not have to exercise his brain a great deal to come up with his Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the political nit-picking of Senator Mulcahy has detracted from this historic occasion.  It is an occasion for celebration because we are passing a Bill which has been required since the O'Callaghan case in 1966.  We have made a major contribution this afternoon to tackling crime.  It is another weapon in our arsenal.  &ldquo;Historic&rdquo; is not too great a word to use about the occasion.</P>
      <P>However, Senators Neville and Magner put what Senator Mulcahy said in context.  I have been present in the House several times when Senator Mulcahy has spoken and I am sorry that, once again, he has been unable to rise above the level of petty political bickering on such an occasion.</P>

      <P>I also agree with Senator Magner on the criminalisation of young people at an early stage.  The concept of zero tolerance would increase that possibility.</P>
      <P>I recently introduced the Children Bill to the other House.  It updates legislation dating back to 1908 and is now going into Committee.  It will be brought before this House in due course.  If the concept of zero tolerance was applicable the Bill would be a nonsense because its main purpose is to keep young people out of the custodial system and not to criminalise them.  It represents a major contribution to our juvenile justice legislation. Zero tolerance would be anathema in this situation. It is my pleasure to be here on this historic occasion.</P>

    <Title>Irish Emigrant Organisations: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to increase its financial and other resources to Irish Emigrant Organisations, many of whom are voluntary, working among our exiles especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the motion is to draw attention to the recent changes in US immigration legislation which has made life extremely difficult for undocumented Irish people and for the voluntary emigrant organisations which attempt to cater for the huge number of inquiries to their offices.  An example is the Irish emigration centre at 18 Tremont Street, Boston.  This centre received over 19,000 calls during 1996.  However, less than 10 per cent of the total budget for running the centre and its services came from the Irish Government &mdash; it amounted to approximately $35,000.  This is an abysmal failure on the part of the Government which claims to care for the less well off in society.  Irish emigrants are as much a part of Ireland as those of us fortunate to live here.  As a former emigrant and a member of the precursor to DÍON, the committee on welfare services abroad from 1979-84, I was able to acquaint myself with the priorities of Irish welfare organisations in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> My colleague, Senator Dan Kiely will deal with the American experience in more detail as he lived there while my emigrant experience is of the United Kingdom, but there are similarities between our experiences.  I had the pleasure of visiting the Irish emigration centre in Boston while carrying out public duties during the St. Patrick's week celebrations and I was impressed with the commitment and dedication of what is largely a volunteer service.  This centre was established in 1989 and began as a confidential telephone service for emigrants.  It has rapidly expanded and maintains the central philosophy of self help and community based empowerment.  It has a drop in centre where people come to check the noticeboards, read Irish newspapers, etc.  Its support and referral services are key components of its work.  It also provides a free legal advice clinic once a month and offers new and established emigrants the opportunity to pursue their job search in a friendly and supportive environment.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Kieran O'Sullivan from Kanturk, County Cork who works as a paralegal at the centre.  He is continuing his studies to become a fully fledged lawyer.  He is a credit not only to his family but also to this country and he is doing outstanding work in Boston.  Another important part of the centre's work is its outreach programme which concentrates on providing information on a variety of topics and issues relevant to emigrants.  In addition, the centre assists newcomers with information on accommodation needs.  The work of the Boston centre is mirrored not only across the US wherever there is a large population but also in several centres throughout the UK, the most famous being the Irish centre in Camden Town and the Oblate Fathers' hostel at Quex Road, Kilburn.  I admire the outstanding work the Oblate Fathers have done among the Irish community, especially in London but also in Birmingham where the late Fr. Taaffe is revered.</P>
    <P>All of these important social centres require increased resources and it is a moral imperative that the Irish State adequately resources their vital work.  Sadly, our record over the past 20 years has been lamentable and I point the finger at successive Administrations.  We have a blind spot when it comes to helping our emigrants and yet they are our own.  In 1983 Deputy Ruairi Quinn was in office and when looking at the reform of welfare services for emigrants, he used the phrase &ldquo;they are our forgotten people&rdquo;.  They have been forgotten by successive Governments. I, therefore, plead with the Government in its dying days to increase its miserly funding for emigrant centres.</P>
    <P>The situation in the US is particularly acute.  It is feared that new legislation being introduced will drive those who are illegal further underground. The changes taking place to reform welfare and immigration legislation will have a considerable impact on Irish illegal aliens in America.  For example, under the new welfare reform laws all non citizens, including those with green cards or legal permanent residents, are disturk <Col N="297" /> qualified from two major federal assistance programmes &mdash; food stamps, a Government subsidy of basic food purchases for the poor and supplementary security income which is cash assistance to low income persons who are blind, aged or disabled.  The new laws also permit individual states to bar legal immigrants from three federal programmes administered at state level if they so decide &mdash; non emergency Medicaid, a Government subsidy of health care costs for the poor; Title XX social services block grants, including day care, some subsidised housing for the elderly, care for the disabled and domestic violence programmes and Temporary Aid for Needy Families formerly called Aid to Families with dependent children.</P>
    <P>Under immigration reform laws new harsher penalties face those who enter or overstay in the US.  Anyone unlawfully present from six months to one year and who left voluntarily before the Immigration and Naturalisation Service began removal proceedings against them will be barred from re-entry for three years.  Anyone unlawfully present for more than one year will be barred from re-entry for ten years.  Very little relief is available for those undergoing deportation proceedings as cancellation of removal is granted only to those who can prove ten years' continuous residence as well as extreme and unusual hardship posed by deportation.</P>
    <P>It is now more difficult than ever to bring family members to the US as immigrants.  Those who wish to sponsor their family members as immigrants have to prove that their income is at least 125 per cent of the poverty level of a household that will include the prospective immigrant and they must sign an affidavit of support that will be legally binding.  These provisions will make it extremely difficult for undocumented residents to find sponsors.  The volunteers in the outreach programmes in Boston see the problems I have outlined daily.  Some callers are suffering depression, while others are turning to drink and drugs to alleviate the loneliness and fear.</P>
    <P>There is a grave misconception that all those who go to America do well.  The truth is that many slip through the system.  The <i>Boston Globe</i> of 10 February 1997 carried a story about a 70 year old Irish emigrant called Marie Sullivan. Miss Sullivan was buried in a part of a Boston cemetery called the welfare plot.  We would call it the paupers' plot.  She was originally from Ireland, though nobody knows where, and she told a friend she longed to return.  She was a widow whose husband died in her arms, and was an independent and private person.  That secretiveness prevented friends from knowing if she had any family in Ireland to contact when she collapsed and lay in a coma for ten days before dying in a Cambridge, Massachusetts, hospital.  Marie Sullivan was what we would call a &ldquo;bag lady&rdquo;. She wore layers of clothing and often had a cart or carriage in tow.  She sat in fast food restaurants not to eat but to keep warm.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of Marie Sullivans in England and America that deserve to be helped. <Col N="298" /> The job is usually left to the Irish centres.  They have neither the personnel nor the finance to deal with the increasing problems facing our citizens who are down on their luck.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I referred to the consequences of changes to the emigration and welfare legislation. It is imperative that action should be taken on two fronts.  One reason is the severe pressure on the resources of the emigrants' centres, particularly in the US.  There is a need to provide them with extra resources.  Second, there is a continuous need to increase funding for the many problems of broken and dysfunctional families in the UK.</P>
    <P>Is there any possibility that the FÁS programme could second people to the Irish centres in Britain and the US who could help in the welfare context?  The Government might be able to provide benefit in kind if resources are under strain.  I am unsure of the constitutional implications, but FÁS operates in the building industry in Germany.  The emigrants' centres, particularly those in Boston, would be happy to make a submission to the relevant Department.</P>
    <P>My reason for raising this was my experience in Boston in March.  The cause of emigrants is sometimes put on the back burner.  I am emotional and passionate about this because I had to take the boat to England.  Those were happy times, but it was forced emigration.  People who have not experienced this cannot fully understand the gut-wrenching feeling of turning back to watch Dún Laoghaire harbour as one leaves it, perhaps for a long time, and without knowing if one will be able to return to one's native land to live.  Any Government that represents this State should ensure it is a priority that resources are provided for this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and commend Senator Mooney for introducing this motion.  I have contacted the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and my party leader recently on the serious matter that has arisen in the US.  Emigration was a big problem for many years but we seemed to come to grips with it.  I was chairman of the emigration committee in my party in the 1980s and met the Emigration Reform Movement in New York City, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, the Catholic societies and consuls.  I brought them together and in 1988 a £250,000 grant was given to help illegal Irish aliens in America.  That was one of the first direct funding grants from a Government in this area.</P>
      <P>I thank Congressman Brian Donnelly for all the work he has done for illegals.  I worked closely with him for some years and lobbied hard for undocumented people in the US.  Over 100,000 of them have since been documented.  I also compliment Congressmen Berman and Morrison on their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy is going well and people may feel emigration is a thing of the past, but it is not. Emigration still exists, particularly to the US.  I feel sorry for people who go on vacation to their families in the US.  They are made to feel welcome <Col N="299" /> and may overstay their six months visit by a day or so.  If they want to visit their families after that vacation there is a waiting period of three years.  If they overstay a year's visit by a day, there is a penalty of ten years.  This is a serious matter and the Government must do something about it.</P>
    <P>There is a centre in Boston, New York, Chicago, Washington and San Francisco trying to help Irish people.  All of them are crying out for some kind of assistance, but above all they want encouragement from the Government.  Some financial resources must be made available to those on the ground.  There are over 100 part-time workers in the Boston centre referred to by Senator Mooney.  Many people will go to ground in the situation that will develop unless matters are rectified.</P>
    <P>The US is very close to us.  Approximately 40 million people in the US are descendants of Irish people and Ireland is like another state to that country.  These restrictions have been brought in for other groups but a special case has to be made for the Irish in the US.  We stood firm in the 1980s but now this new legislation will come into law on 1 September of this year and I am fearful as people are still living illegally in the US.  If they came home in the morning, the unemployment figures would rise by 40,000 or 50,000.  If all the people who had to emigrate remained in Ireland on the dole queues, how would we be able to handle them?  They are now crying out for a little assistance and the least we can do is assist them in their time of need.  They are not looking for much; they are only looking for funding to keep their centres going in a time of need.  Most of all, they are looking for the Irish Government to take the initiative to change the congressional legislation and lobby Congressmen.  I thank Congressman Schumer, Senator Kennedy and all the other people who have helped emigrants down the years.</P>
    <P>The people are crying out.  They do not know what to do.  Well-educated young people with university degrees are crying out for legal status in the US.  They have applied under the new lottery system for the green card, but they may all have to come back within six months.  They are being looked after by their families and friends in the US at present, they are interfering with nobody and they are just looking for a little leverage at a difficult time in their lives.</P>
    <P>I was glad I did some work for emigrants to the US in the 1980s.  I received hundreds of thank you cards from people I never met or knew because I had the honour of taking out 16,000 visa applications to the US when there was a postal strike here.  I stood outside Leinster House and gathered visa applications from all over Ireland.  I am glad to say that about 95 per cent of those applicants received visas at that time.</P>
    <P>People are writing to me in droves now too. They are crying out for help.  The Boston centre has contacted me over the past couple of weeks and Senator Mooney was in the US to meet these <Col N="300" /> people.  The people in New York have been in touch with me too.  Mr. O'Dwyer, the president of the emigration movement in the New York area, has been in contact with me.  For the first time in a long while they are looking outside the US and towards Ireland for a little assistance.  In addition to supporting Senator Mooney's motion, which I am honoured to second, I ask that the Government lobby the US Congress to change the law which is to be introduced at this crucial point.  It would be simple to do.  The political will exists.  A case was made for the Irish in the past.</P>
    <P>I agree with the call for FÁS schemes in this area.  Legislative social welfare agreements exist between the US and Ireland but we should take it a step further and make provision for other institutions which exist in Ireland.  We should sponsor people to the US if necessary.  We must come to the rescue of these people in this hour of need.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will accept this motion sympathetically and use every available resource to help people who have given so much to this country and who are looking for so little.  Such people were never takers.  Some of them brought back knowledge and training from the US, the UK and elsewhere and opened up new industries in Ireland.  That is what it is all about.  When such people are looking for a little help in return, we should be there for them and the door should not be closed to them.</P>

      <P>With regard to the specific questions raised by Senator Mooney on the Irish emigration centre in Boston, there was a specific parliamentary question on that matter during the week and I will give him a copy of the reply, the details of which are more specific than those in my speech.</P>
      <P>The FÁS issue can be usefully explored to see how that can be managed.  It has been done in the context of Germany and I will refer to that in my speech also.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney's name arises in every contact with emigrant organisations, particularly those in Britain, and I compliment him in particular for his work with organisations in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the views of Senators who have said that we should do as much as we can to assist and support voluntary Irish organisations in Britain and United States who provide valuable information, advice and guidance to our emigrants. The success in recent times of the Government's economic policies has thankfully reduced the numbers of people who must leave Ireland to find employment abroad.  Many of our young people are still doing so but they are now much fewer in number than was the case ten or even five years ago.  In the year ended April 1996 &mdash; the last for which figures are available &mdash; immigration exceeded emigration by 5,600.  We must accept, however, that no matter how good economic conditions or how plentiful job opportunities at home may be, some people will always want to seek experience or fortune beyond our shores <Col N="301" /> although they may not have to do so.  The existence of a common travel area between Ireland and Britain makes it remarkably easy for even teenagers to do so.</P>
    <P>There are long traditions of emigration to Britain and to the United States and well-established informal networks of relatives and friends to assist each new generation of emigrants. However, the need for many kinds of supplementary advice and assistance became apparent at the time of the last large wave of emigration in the 1980s.  It was against this background that the Government, with the approval of the Oireachtas, decided in 1984 to establish the London-based DÍON Committee and to give grants to support voluntary organisations providing advisory and welfare services for Irish emigrants in Britain.  The funds are allocated by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on the basis of recommendations from the DÍON Committee. The grants support the employment of professional workers to provide advice, counselling and practical assistance to Irish emigrants &mdash; new arrivals as well as those who have been in Britain for some time.  DÍON funds are used to support voluntary agencies which facilitate access to employment and welfare services, the objective being to promote the continued contribution to British society of Irish people resident in Britain.</P>
    <P>A small proportion of each year's allocation is also used to support key research into aspects of problems affecting emigrants' welfare.  Two DÍON-assisted projects relating to the health of Irish people in Britain are currently under way.</P>
    <P>DÍON grants totalling £4.8 million have so far been provided to voluntary organisations in Britain.  In the years immediately preceding 1996, the amount provided for these grants in the Vote for Enterprise and Employment was £500,000. Last year savings elsewhere in the Enterprise and Employment Vote made it possible to increase the amount to £550,000.  This was used for grants to 31 organisations working in Irish communities throughout Britain.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment recently announced an increase of £100,000 in the annual DÍON grant aid for Irish emigrant advice and welfare centres in Britain, bringing the total for 1997 to £600,000.  This increase was made possible by savings identified in the Vote for Foreign Affairs at the initiative of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring.</P>
    <P>These recent increase are evidence of the Government's willingness to help voluntary groups in Britain to respond to the continuing high level of demand for their services, notwithstanding the fact that there are fewer new emigrants. This continuing high level of demand is mainly due to recent changes in social provision in Britain which adversely affect disadvantaged members of the Irish community there, especially with regard to getting work, housing and entitlement to benefits.  The categories of emigrants who are most in need of the services Irish Government grants help to make available are: first, the newly <Col N="302" /> arrived, particularly people still in their teens who leave Ireland ill-prepared; second, people who have been in Britain for some time but have not yet found a permanent niche for themselves; and, third, the elderly.</P>
    <P>In the United States in the late 1980s the difficulties encountered by many new emigrants, especially those who were undocumented, also were responded to by an increase in the number of voluntary groups catering for them and an expansion in the range of services they provided. Since 1990, therefore, the Government has provided money in the Foreign Affairs Vote each year for grants to assist those groups.  Decisions on the distribution of this funding are made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on the recommendation of the Ambassador in Washington and the Consuls-General in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco.</P>
    <P>The resources of the Embassy and of the four Consulates General were also directed towards the enactment of legislation to make it easier for undocumented Irish people to regularise their status as immigrants.  With the assistance of friends in Congress, notably Congressmen Donnelly and Morrison, this was achieved.  The problems to be faced in more recent times have been less acute than they were eight or nine years ago. A more restrictive US immigrant visa regime combined with better economic conditions in Ireland have reduced the number of emigrants. However, there has been a continuing need for the advice and information provided by voluntary Irish organisations on matters such as accommodation, employment, entitlement to social services and access to further education.  The amount of funding provided in the Foreign Affairs Vote for support for these organisations is £150,000 a year and this year's grants bring to £1.2 million the amounts paid out since 1990.  Last year the allocation for groups in the US was divided between 11 centres &mdash; three in New York, two in Boston, four in California, one in Philadelphia and one in Washington DC.</P>
    <P>Some of the significant changes in US immigration and welfare legislation enacted last year have negative implications for some Irish people there.  One category particularly affected is those who have taken up residence there in recent years but who do not have the status of legal immigrants. In response to these concerns the Embassy and Consulates-General are maintaining close contact with the immigrant organisations and co-operating with them in arranging seminars at which information is exchanged and the implications of the new legislation are considered.</P>
    <P>The Embassy and Consulates have also raised with members of Congress the position of undocumented Irish people who are seeking to regularise their status without leaving the US.</P>
    <P>In 1996 for the first time assistance was provided for immigrant welfare groups in Australia. Grants were made to three organisations.  This year's Estimate for the Department of Foreign <Col N="303" /> Affairs includes a provision of £15,000 for such groups.</P>
    <P>The upsurge of emigration in the 1980s also led to the establishment by the Government in 1988 of the interdepartmental committee on emigration. This committee, chaired by an assistant secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs, is a forum for exchanging information and for coordination of action on matters relating to emigrants and emigration.  The committee is currently reviewing its activities.</P>
    <P>While the motion refers to assistance to organisations working among our exiles, I would like to inform Senators that the Department of Social Welfare and FÁS are assisting intending emigrants by helping to provide, or themselves providing, booklets with useful information and advice that are available in Ireland.  The Department of Social Welfare gives grants to Emigrant Advice, a Dublin-based voluntary organisation, towards the costs of producing these booklets.  A separate booklet with practical information and advice for returning emigrants, also produced by Emigrant Advice, will be available shortly.  FÁS and EURES, the European Union's Employment Services, jointly produce and distribute a series of leaflets about working in other countries and a video with pre-migration advice.  Together with the UK Employment Service they have produced a directory of help agencies in Ireland and the UK which can give support and advice to Irish emigrants to the UK.</P>
    <P>The Government accepts that the welcome reduction in emigration does not mean that the difficulties and problems that confront Irish people when they go abroad no longer matter. We acknowledge the continuing need for the valuable assistance being provided by voluntary bodies in Britain and the United States as well as in Australia.  They do excellent work and deserve all the support, financial and otherwise, we can give them.</P>
    <P>Government financial support for organisations in Britain and the US has been increased from £650,000 in 1995 to £700,000 in 1996 and to £750,000 this year.  We will, of course, take account of this motion and the views of individual Senators expressed here today and, in the context of the prevailing budgetary circumstances, we will continue to look as sympathetically as possible at the level of funding in the future.</P>
    <P>I am of an age and from a background in the west of Ireland that makes me acutely aware of the devastating effect of widespread emigration on families and communities.  I remember the heartbreak of the &ldquo;American wakes&rdquo; in the 1950s and the trains from Westport in the 1960s filled with men returning to building sites in England with cardboard suitcases.  This was not voluntary but forced by economic circumstances.  Ten of the 13 members of my own family had to do so.</P>
    <P>I also remember the letters home that always contained dollars and pounds.  These enabled persons such as myself to avail of the fee paying system <Col N="304" /> of education, which was in vogue then, with food in our beliefs and shirts on our backs.</P>
    <P>I want to thank our emigrants for their generosity and for continuing to remember the conditions at home when they were far away.  I also want to acknowledge the huge contribution that Irish people, both men and women, abroad have made to the communities in which they settled in the USA, Britain, Australia and elsewhere.  They are our best ambassadors and trade representatives. The acknowledgement of that diaspora by our President made up in some way for many years of neglect of their potential and worth by official Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the motion, which deals with Irish emigrants in Britain, America and Australia.  We have 900,000 emigrants &mdash; people who were born in Ireland &mdash; now living permanently in England.  Many are happily living there in prosperity.  I accept what the Minister of State said about the situation in North America and Australia and, while I do not have personal experience of those areas, I have personal experience of the situation in London.  I want to thank Senator Mooney for the tribute he paid to the Oblate Fathers and their work.  I have the good fortune to be related, through marriage, to Fr. Patsy Carolan, who looks after Conway House in Quex Road, Kilburn.  When I visited that house I was impressed by the work that is carried on there.  Conway House accommodates 270 people and provides training courses for young emigrants as well as helping them to find work.</P>
      <P>One of the most moving aspects of my visit there was to meet and speak with old people who emigrated up to 50 years ago, never married and are now lonely men.  I met two of them smoking their pipes.  When I spoke to them it was as if they had never left Ireland.  Conway House is a little piece of Ireland for such men.</P>
      <P>Voluntary workers there provide a wonderful service and I am glad the Government has made a commitment of £600,000 to DÍON to help them carry out their work.  That organisation in Kilburn has 35 full-time and 25 part-time workers.  Last year they dealt with 442 newly arrived emigrants. Many people who emigrate find success, but there are others who fall by the wayside and that is where these organisations can be of assistance.</P>
      <P>For a number of years the Kilburn Centre has been helping people with drug, alcohol and gambling problems.  When I spoke this evening to Fr. Carolan by phone, he told me he is in contact with a night shelter in Kilburn which has detox beds for people with alcohol and drug related difficulties. It is important to deal with the social aspects of our emigrant population also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed when I attended a conference organised by DÍON some time ago in the European Parliament buildings in Molesworth Street, Dublin.  I discovered it has a network of workers in Ireland who put young emigrants in touch with people they should approach when they travel to London and other parts of Britain.  The Minister <Col N="305" /> of State mentioned the advice booklet, which is another important aspect in helping our emigrants.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to those who work voluntarily in these organisations to assist our emigrants. They deserve our full support, including financial help.  They do a wonderful job in looking after what Senator Mooney called &ldquo;our lost friends&rdquo;.  They should not be lost to us and, while these voluntary workers have a loving outlook, they will be our friends.</P>

      <P>There were 19 children in my mother's family, of whom 13 or 14 emigrated.  My mother always regretted not knowing three of her brothers because they emigrated from west Kerry before she was born.  One was gassed in France during the First World War and the other two never came home, probably because they could not forget what they had left behind.  We should not be ashamed to say that things were bad at that time. They must have thought they were in heaven when they arrived in a new country, although they had problems finding jobs.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke fondly about emigrants and their families who have become great ambassadors for this country.  We are proud that people of Irish descent became President of the United States and founded the American navy.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there is a difference of over 5,000 between those returning to and leaving Ireland.  He also said that booklets and videos are available to help our emigrants when they move to another country.  However, they are still not properly prepared.  There is no problem going on holidays to America since the visa requirement was relaxed.  However, prior to that, a number of people were not given holiday or working visas, so they decided to take a chance in the hope they would not be caught.  They wanted to make money before returning home.  However, problems arose when they did not succeed or when their health failed.  They did not seek help from home because they were either embarrassed or too proud.  This was clearly outlined in the letter I received from Mr. Kieran O'Sullivan of the Irish Immigration Centre.  It stated:</P>
      <P>Examples of just a few of our callers are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mary is a 75 year old Irish widow living here since her twenties but never became a citizen because she states it would have meant reneging her allegiance to Ireland. She is losing her supplementary social security income and food coupons within the next few months.  Her chronic health problems and advanced age force her to depend on these benefits.  She worked &mdash; like most Irish <Col N="306" /> women did &mdash; as a nanny, housekeeper in non-pensionable low paying jobs.</P>
    <P>There are a number of people in similar situations in America and England.  Many are embarrassed to return home because they have not been as successful as they hoped.  Many send letters home pretending everything is all right.  However, when others from the same area emigrate, they learn the true story.  The loneliness felt by these people often leads them to drink and drugs.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined generous support for emigrant centres and organisations in Ireland, England and Australia.  Perhaps he could clarify if Canada is included.  I was in Canada last year where I met Mr. Dinny Sullivan from Castlemaine. He has been an illegal immigrant for 35 years.  He was unmarried and seemed to be in good health.  He wanted me to try to get him an Irish passport because he could not get one in Canada and he wanted to return home.  Perhaps some emigrants are uneducated and do not know where to go to get help, but many are too proud to look for help and it is then too late when they receive it.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to know the problems experienced by emigrants.  Generous sums of money have been given to emigrant organisations, but this motion was tabled to persuade the Minister and the Government to give further funding.  Senator Mooney suggested that personnel from Ireland could go to Europe on a FÁS scheme to help sort out these problems.  Last Christmas I heard a radio interview with a man who was organising a convoy of buses to go to England to bring people home.  He said the voluntary organisation for which he worked did this every Christmas.  This is a deserving cause which should be funded.  We are a proud people and we should acknowledge the help given by successful Irish people abroad by increasing the funding for these organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  I compliment the Minister on his speech which shows his clear understanding of the problems associated with emigration and the lack of available help over the past few years.  The county in which I live has a terrible history of emigration, which took place when there were no supports available for those who worked in tunnels or on building sites in Great Britain and other countries.</P>
      <P>The groups to which Senator Mooney referred are to be commended for their valuable work. Sadly, in the case of some people, that work is more than merely valuable, it is essential.  I refer to the organisations that provide welfare services to Irish emigrants.  I am aware that much valuable work is done with homeless people in London which was highlighted at a recent seminar organised by Focus Point to mark its anniversary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to address a potential misconception that might arise because this motion was tabled by Fianna Fáil Senators.  This might lead people to believe that the Government has neglected groups that support Irish people who have emigrated to foreign countries.  That is not the case. <Col N="307" /> The Government has provided increases in funding to these groups from the two relevant Departments during the past two years.  These amounted to a 10 per cent increase in the funding provided under the Estimate from the Department of Foreign Affairs and an increase of 20 per cent provided under the Vote of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Department of Foreign Affairs, this is the first increase since 1989.  I would like to highlight the political reality of this fact for the Senators opposite.  The Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrate Coalition failed to provide an increase in funding to overseas groups.  On the other hand, the Rainbow Coalition provided the funding increases to which I referred.  As the Minister stated, funding from the Department of Enterprise and Employment is channelled through the DÍON Committee in Britain.  This committee consists of representatives of the Irish community in Britain, in addition to representatives of the Irish Embassy in London and a representative of the Eastern Health Board in Dublin.</P>
    <P>DÍON provides grants to support the employment of counsellors and advice workers who meet the needs of Irish emigrants at the front line.  In the area of activities for the homeless, for example, last year Action Homeless Concern received £15,000 and Cricklewood Homeless Concern received £21,000.  These figures are in Irish punts, not sterling.  Other organisations such as Solas Anois received £17,000 and An Teach housing association received £5,000.  I do not intend to read into the record the list of 31 organisations which received a total of £550,000 last year.  I wish to make an important point about that total, which, when the original Estimate was published was to have been £500,000.  The Government's commitment is real and when savings were found, the Department allocated an additional 10 per cent to this heading.  This proves that the Government is committed to supporting emigrant groups.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs funds support for Irish immigrants in the United States of America.  I wish to place on record information about one of the groups that carries out invaluable work.  I refer to the Irish Immigration Centre, situated on Tremont Street in Boston, which received just over £22,000 last year.  Last month Denise McCool who works at the centre &mdash; if she was not living in Boston she would be a constituent of mine in the Inishowen peninsula &mdash; wrote to me to inform me about the work carried out there.  Much of the centre's work is connected with what is termed &ldquo;undocumented emigrants&rdquo;&mdash; Irish people in the USA who do not have a valid visa.  These people cannot access healthcare or obtain a valid driving licence, accommodation or employment.</P>
    <P>Last year the centre took 19,000 telephone calls and a total of 6,000 people walked in off the street to seek advice.  Some of these individuals suffer from depression or have turned to alcohol or <Col N="308" /> drugs to alleviate the fear they experience.  Due to the success of the Irish economy the centre is now receiving calls from those who want to return home.  I welcome this emerging trend.  I call on the Minister of State to provide the funding outlined in the motion to support it.  The Boston centre is one of 11 Irish centres in four US cities to receive Government support.  On that basis, I have no hesitation in asking the Minister of State to increase financial support to these centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his kind comments about my modest contribution and for relating his experience of growing up in the west.  It is only when one has experienced such things that one gains a real understanding of the nature of emigration.  I am grateful to the Minister of State for outlining with clarity the Government's action in the area of emigrant welfare. I would be churlish &mdash; it would border on the irresponsible &mdash; were I not to acknowledge the Government's contribution.</P>
      <P>This is not a partisan political issue.  Senator Maloney and I are the best of friends and I am slightly disappointed that he introduced a partisan element to the debate.  I understand the impetus behind his contribution and I do not doubt his sincerity.  We are playing on the same team in terms of emigrant welfare but whoever wrote his speech obviously decided that it might be no harm, in the current environment to have a cut at Fianna Fáil.  The purpose of tabling this motion was to generate the type of debate which would focus on the real problems faced by emigrants and emigrant welfare organisations.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Minister's remarks about DÍON, the funding of emigrant welfare organisations did not commence in 1983.  As I stated earlier, the Committee on Welfare Services Abroad was first initiated in the mid-1970s.  The current Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, in his previous role as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, decided to reform the area of emigrant welfare and he reconstituted COWSA, as it was known in the old Department of Labour, as DÍON.  I state this merely to emphasise that there was a succession of funding mechanisms put in place from the mid-1970s.  However, the difficulty is that the money provided has never been adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald and I had a discussion earlier, we were probably walking on dangerous ground, and are of the view that if all of the money allegedly given away by Ben Dunne in recent years was added up, the total would be far in excess of the funding provided by successive Governments in respect of emigrant welfare.  The monumental amount of money the Taxing Master allocated for legal fees last week in connection with the Beef Tribunal is staggering when compared to the funding given to emigrant welfare by successive Governments.  Evryone is aware that the funding allocated in this area will never be adequate but we must continue to climb the greasy pole, even though we may fall back down, <Col N="309" /> to focus Government attention on this important area.</P>
    <P>I am glad that several Members highlighted the fact that emigration has not ended and remains a real problem.  It may be instructive for the House to know that 6.5 million people worldwide applied for 55,000 visas to enter the US in 1996.  Of the European quota of 3,500, Ireland received a mere 900 green cards.  Those who wish to be sponsored to be employed in America are obliged to wait for upwards of ten years.  My sources in Boston inform me that it is estimated that there are approximately 10,000 illegal Irish immigrants in that city alone.  They advise them to return to Ireland to become regularised, to apply from here under the new immigration laws but many of them will not return home.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the case of a man who has spent 19 years in the US with his family and he is still not documented.  When I mentioned this case to some of my colleagues they were at a loss to understand how this man could not be documented given all the good work done by US Congressmen, as was outlined by Senators, in introducing legislative measures on this issue.  Many such emigrants may not have registered because they may have had suspect backgrounds.  They may have gone to the US for a variety of reasons which they do not wish to convey to the US authorities, so they are in limbo.  The emigrant welfare organisations in the US will have to focus on these emigrants.</P>
    <P>The British experience is a different issue and the Minister of State and I are familiar with it.  Senator Doyle has connections with the Oblates and we agree they do outstanding work in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is for this combination of reasons that we tabled this motion.  I am grateful to my colleagues for their contributions, Senator Maloney included. We are at one on this matter.  Notwithstanding budgetary constraints, I hope there will be a focus on this issue in Government circles, brought to bear by the Minister of State who, I hope will continue in office if that is the wish of the electorate.  When it comes to emigrant issues I do not mind who is in power.  The people who control the country's purse strings should give more money for emigrant services. I hope the Minister of State and I will be able to develop the FÁS scheme concept on the administrative and training sides.  It may provide a window of opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to all who contributed to the debate and I thank the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, for attending in the House.  I wish <Col N="310" /> to refer to the closure of the Port Road in Letterkenny by the Garda on the Easter Saturday night due to disturbances which occurred just off the road on the Ramelton side.  I understand there was only one garda on duty in this area of the town that night.  He was badly hurt and has not returned to work since due to the injuries he sustained.  I recently raised this matter at a meeting of the urban district council out of concern for the Port Road residents and the gardaí.  I received many representations from people from the town and from outside Letterkenny.</P>
      <P>Problems in this area of the town have been ongoing for a number of years.  In the past when there was trouble the Garda numbers were increased for a few weeks and that seemed to calm matters.  There have been calls for extra gardaí in the Port Road area on a Saturday night when trouble is expected there.  The matter has been swept under the carpet time and again.</P>
      <P>Public houses and clubs in the town have been raided by the Garda recently who exercise a tough policy.  However, the same policy does not apply to the clubs on the Port Road.  There are two main clubs on the Port Road and when the gardaí arrive there the shutters go down. However, when the gardaí leave, the shutters go back up and business resumes.  People then drink as much as they can in the short time before closing. These people come onto the streets and create mayhem.  There have been many fights in the area and I am sure the number of arrests must run into thousands.</P>
      <P>This is very worrying for the residents on the Port Road.  The late Justice McMenamin commented that the clubs which serve such people drinks should be responsible for their behaviour. I agree with that sentiment.  The Garda is not applying the law fairly in this case.  Outside Letterkenny, in areas such as Dromahill, St. Johnstone and Raphoe, a number of premises have been visited on an ongoing basis by the Garda and a number of summonses issued against the owners.  The club in Raphoe has almost been put out of business because of attention from the Garda.  However, one would not hear of the same amount of trouble there as in Letterkenny.</P>
      <P>On the night in question there were up to 3,000 people on the Port Road.  More gardaí were needed.  Manpower should be deployed at the time and in the area in which it is most needed, that is to say, on the Port Road on a Saturday.  I ask the Minister of State to meet the Garda Commissioner and request an investigation into and a resolution of the problem once and for all.  I do not believe the law should be broken, but if it is to be applied it must be applied fairly to everyone. If the clubs on the Port Road are responsible for what is happening and the Garda is not able to tackle the problem, someone else may well have to do so.  I seek the Minister of State's help in this matter to give the people in the area peace of mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has been informed by the Garda that the incident to which the Senator refers occurred on the night of 29 March 1997 between 2 a.m. and 2.30 a.m. when a serious disturbance took place in and about the Port Road in Letterkenny.  There were about 2,500 people attending discos on the Port Road that night and a number of youths were involved in the disturbance.  As a result, the Port Road was closed by the Garda and the disturbance subsequently quelled.</P>
      <P>The Garda informed the Minister that the road was closed, as provided for under section 91 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, in the interests of the safety of the public and to enable the Garda to deal with the problem.  The Garda has also informed the Minister that a member of the force was injured and hospitalised as a result of this incident and has not yet resumed duty.  Disturbances involving youths occur from time to time in this area which has at least two discos.  A large number of young people attend these discos from surrounding areas and adjoining towns in Northern Ireland.  I understand that there have been approximately 400 arrests made by the Garda over the past 12 months as a result of similar incidents. However, the Senator can be assured that the situation is being closely monitored and the area receives, and will continue to receive, adequate Garda attention.</P>
      <P>The Senator's remarks give me cause for concern and I will ensure his comments are brought to the attention of the Garda.  No complaint has been received by the Garda in relation to the manner in which they dealt with this incident on the night in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Health to give serious consideration to the arguments of a group of social workers employed by various agencies throughout the country to have their Bachelor of Science degrees and their many years work experience validated.  There are approximately 200 social workers concerned.  They have given many years of service as social workers and they are requesting that the national validation board recognise and validate their qualifications.  They are also requesting that they be included in the validation process by virtue of their experience, ongoing supervision and in-service training.  The Bachelor of Social Science degree was the best qualification available at the time of their qualification. Many of the social workers, on whose behalf I am speaking tonight, have been working in the profession for more than 20 years.  They were committed to studying for this course in the <Col N="312" /> first instance unlike others who opt for postgraduate and diploma courses.</P>
      <P>If their qualifications are not validated, this will have serious effects on their opportunities for promotion, permanency in employment and mobility.  Their integrity as social workers would be compromised and doubts would be cast on decisions made, and advice given, by them.  Their status within their employing agency would be diminished.</P>
      <P>Social workers are merely seeking fair play and I hope the Minister can accede to their request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The National Social Work Qualifications Board was established as a corporate body on 27 February 1997 replacing the National Validation Body on Social Work Qualifications which was dissolved on that date.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of misinformation has been circulating concerning the role and function of this board which relates, in the main, to overseeing standards in social work training and education and the assessment of qualifications obtained outside the State.  The board will also grant the National Qualifications in Social Work &mdash; NQSW &mdash; to those who have successfully completed recognised courses.  The NQSW will replace the CQSW which was traditionally awarded by the UK Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work before its withdrawal from Ireland in 1993.</P>
      <P>The NQSW is now the benchmark entry qualification for employment in the public health service but I stress that qualifications pertaining to social work posts in such areas as the probation and welfare service, local authorities and so remain a matter for decision by the relevant Departments, that is, the Departments of Justice and Environment respectively.</P>
      <P>The former National Validation Body on Social Work Qualifications and Training was requested to examine the issue of Bachelor of Social Science graduates in the public health service and make recommendations on the matter. The body reported on 20 November 1996 and, following examination by my Department of the advice received, it was decided that additional detail was required on a number of issues.  This information was provided in due course and will be dealt with following the inaugural meeting of the National Social Work Qualifications Board which is tentatively scheduled for late May.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am not in a position to make any further comment at present other than to say that, as the board is not a registration body, the question of disqualifying social workers who do not hold NQSW qualifications and who are currently employed in the State will not arise.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 April 1997.</P>
