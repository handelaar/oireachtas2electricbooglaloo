      <P>Before the Order of Business we will hear expressions of sympathy on the tragic death of our former colleague, Michael Enright.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with the deepest shock that we learned of the death of Michael Enright.  He was a Member of this House for a short time only, having been nominated by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, on 13 June.  He had been actively involved in politics for a considerable time.  He worked hard on behalf of the people of Wexford in his capacity as a member of Wexford Corporation since 1985.  He contested general elections on a number of occasions on behalf of Democratic Left.  Both he and his wife were teachers; he was extremely active in the TUI and his wife, Mary, is currently serving on its executive.  I offer our sincere sympathy to her and their two children on their sad loss.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I join with the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Michael Enright.  We heard of last night's horrific accident with great shock, which was made all the greater when we heard that a former Member of this House was among those who so tragically lost their lives.  He sat in this House for just one day during the interregnum but he knew at that stage he would have a short Seanad career. He made a point of speaking on that day and he spoke well.  He was an engaging person whose whole life was dedicated to service, particularly to his local community as a teacher.  He was one of those dedicated public servants who received little from politics but put in a great deal, not least his sense of idealism and concerns about the deprived in society.  I convey the sympathy of my party and myself to his wife and family on their terrible loss.  I also express sympathy to the families of the three other people who lost their lives at such a young age in this crash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great sorrow that I express sympathy on behalf of the Independent Senators, particularly Senator Ryan who is a colleague of Mrs. Enright in the TUI.  Every morning we wake up to another tragedy and it is sad to think that the man who sat directly in front of me on the one day on which he able to attend the Seanad as a Member is now dead.  He was thrilled to attend and speak that day because he was not standing in the Seanad elections.  Along with the Leader and Senator Manning, we send our deepest sympathy to his family and the families of those three other young men killed in this horrific crash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I extend sympathy to the wife and family of Michael Enright and to the other families who have been so tragically bereaved by this horrific car crash.  I also extend sympathy to Democratic Left, of which Michael Enright was a prominent member.  I knew him well as a teacher and colleague. He was a member of the TUI executive and a strong trade unionist.  It is sad that a former Member of the House should die in this manner and perhaps the best memorial to him would be to see what steps we can take to prevent such terrible accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I join with the expressions of sympathy to the family of the late Michael Enright. We were disturbed to hear of the horrific crash in Wicklow last night and we were even more shocked to hear Michael Enright was one of the victims.  We extend our sympathy to the families of the three other people killed, to the wife and family of Michael Enright and his colleagues in Democratic Left and on Wexford Corporation.</P>

      <P>There has been a speaker from each group but, in accordance with precedent, I will call his County Wexford colleague, Senator Walsh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím leis an méid atá ráite ag na cainteoirí eile.  I join in the expressions of sympathy to Michael Enright's wife, Mary, and his two children.  He was a Clareman who lived in Wexford for many years.  He was first elected to Wexford Corporation in 1985 and served there with great distinction ever since.  He taught in the vocational school in Kilmuckridge, as does his wife.  His pupils have also suffered a great loss and we should extend our sympathy to them.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that if Michael Enright had served in any other constituency he would have been elected as a Deputy for Democratic Left. He served his party and constituents extremely well during his period in public life.  I understand that during his brief period in the Seanad he said prophetically that his first speech in the House would be his last.  It is sad that turned out to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> Despite the circumstances of the accident, I also join in the expressions of sympathy to the families of the other three people who were killed.  I am sure the circumstances of the accident will only aggravate the grief they are suffering. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 which will be taken until 4 p.m. I propose a time limit of 30 minutes for spokespersons and 20 minutes for all other Senators.  There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m..</P>
      <P>I also have to take an additional item later in the day, the referral of the Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997, to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills.  The Dáil is due to pass a motion without debate this morning referring this Bill to the committee.  On receipt of a message from the Dáil, I propose to have the motion of concurrence circulated on a supplementary Order Paper.  The matter can be taken without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I am sure colleagues would be very happy to join with me in sending congratulations to a former Member of this House, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, on his election as Chancellor of the National University of Ireland.  He is only the fourth holder of the office this century, the previous three being Archbishop Walsh, Éamon de Valera, who held the office for a very long period, and Dr. T. K. Whitaker.  I am delighted such a distinguished person as Dr. FitzGerald has been given this honour by the graduates of the NUI.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the current controversy surrounding the referendum which is due to take place on the same day as the presidential election.  The point has been well made over the past number of days that there has been virtually no public debate on this very important issue.  We debated it in this House, but it was a rather hurried debate on a Bill to enable a referendum take place.  The issues involved are serious.  The reservations expressed by two former Cabinet Ministers, Deputy O'Malley and Ms Gemma Hussey, should be taken into account.</P>
      <P>As a practical way of encouraging public debate, will the Leader say if the Government proposes to issue an information leaflet putting both sides of the argument, as happened in previous referenda or is that ruled out under the terms of the McKenna judgment?  Such a leaflet would be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House could also make a contribution to that debate.  Under our Standing Orders, it is possible for us to invite distinguished persons to address the House.  I would be pleased to propose <Col N="320" /> inviting Deputy O'Malley, Ms Gemma Hussey and Mr. Michael McDowell to outline their views, although I do not want to have an entirely Progressive Democrat line up.  We could also invite Mr. Gerard Hogan, which would be three Progressive Democrats out of four speakers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We could invite distinguished people on both sides of the argument.  The debate could be televised and transmitted during Oireachtas Report.  I am not making a party point in this regard &mdash; there is a genuine deficit of information on this referendum.  This matter should not be taken lightly but it has been overshadowed by other events.  If this House can help to enlighten the public on the matter, it would be a very useful innovation to so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Senators that inviting distinguished persons to address the House is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Manning said about the referendum.  There were grave objections from the Independent benches during that debate about the narrowness of the wording, so I am sure we would support any call for further debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>I presume it is not proposed to sit on the day of the presidential election.  Is the House sitting any day that week?  It would be useful if the Leader could tell us if there is any other week between now and Christmas when the House will not sit.  The Order of Business is agreed by the Independents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning in congratulating the new Chancellor of the NUI, the former Senator, Dr. FitzGerald.</P>
      <P>In regard to the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality, my party tabled an amendment to that Bill which was roughly similar to the terms now being suggested by Deputy O'Malley and the former Deputy, Michael McDowell, of the Progressive Democrats.  That was the time when everybody should have rowed together to ensure we would have a proper referendum on the issue. The referendum will be voted on in two weeks' time, which means it is very difficult to now make good the deficit of information.  I do not know whether anything can be done about it.  I am surprised by the statements which have now been made by those two members of the Progressive Democrats, considering both Houses have been discussing the matter for the past six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many motions on the Order Paper relating to refugees and asylum seekers, and the matter was discussed on the Order of Business yesterday.  According to a report in today's newspaper, the Government is reducing its commitment <Col N="321" /> to international aid.  The last Government committed itself to spending 0.05 per cent of GNP on development aid but that is now being reduced to 0.03 per cent, which is a long way from the OECD target of 0.07 per cent of GNP.  Can we have a debate on the question of refugees, asylum and international aid, which is obviously exercising the minds of many Members?  It is also a major issue for the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a one time acquaintance of Dr. FitzGerald, with whom I had constructive dialogue on many issues when he was Taoiseach, I am delighted he has been elected Chancellor of the NUI.  It is a continuation of the tradition of having very distinguished people in that office, and he will fulfil the role extremely well.</P>
      <P>I am glad people have discovered their consciences before the referendum is held.  We will today debate the implications of a single currency, which were not debated before the 1989 referendum.  I am glad, therefore, that people are discovering the problems with the issue of Cabinet confidentiality in advance of the referendum.</P>
      <P>I know the Government will probably produce an information document, but will the Leader ask it to produce something which people can easily read?  The Government document produced for the previous referendum was written in such turgid English as to be almost incomprehensible to anyone other than a lawyer.  If the Government is to produce an information document, will it be in a form which informs rather than confuses people?</P>
      <P>If 20 people had been killed by terrorist outrages in the last ten days there would be an outcry, and rightly so, and there would be justified demands for emergency legislation.  We are becoming immune to the carnage on our roads which is a reproach to us all.  In discussions with my students yesterday it emerged that the roads have become the most hazardous place in the country.  It is time we did something about it.  I suggest that a committee of the House be established to listen to views on what is needed to stop this.  There is no point in having a debate where everybody blames the Government.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the issue of refugees?  I attended a debate in Cork last week where it was difficult to find a speaker to justify the clampdown on illegal immigration, which has sinister and racist overtones.  Who is instructing people to operate this clampdown?  It appears that skin colour is the first criterion used to single out people.  Given our experience over the last 100 years it would be sad if Ireland, of all countries, started to operate a dubious and racist immigration policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for organising the debate on EMU today.  He changed it from another day at my request.  The lack of debate on EMU is similar to the lack of debate on the bail referendum and the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality. Perhaps there is a way in which the <Col N="322" /> House can be used to debate such matters.  We should consider Senator Manning's suggestion.</P>
      <P>I am delighted at the election of Dr. FitzGerald as Chancellor of the National University of Ireland.  I had the pleasure of studying under him.</P>
      <P>There is an answer to the carnage on the roads but I am not sure if it is in the hands of this House.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that the same national attention is paid to speed as was paid to Operation Freeflow last year?  Operation Freeflow resulted in a change in mindset among users of the roads which enabled it to succeed last December.  According to the Garda Síochána, speed is the cause of accidents.  We must change our attitude to this issue.</P>
      <P>Today is World Food Day.  The Cathaoirleach kindly afforded me the opportunity to speak on this matter on the Adjournment yesterday.  On that occasion I was reminded that the report by Bord Bia was recently published.  Will it be possible to debate the report?  There is a lot of meat in this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the late Senator Enright.  I also congratulate Dr. Garret FitzGerald on his election.</P>
      <P>I support the proposal by Senator Costello for a debate on overseas development assistance.  It is worrying that we are apparently not about to honour our commitments with regard to the UN target for ODA.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation when its deliberations were adjourned.  A couple of weeks ago the Taoiseach said that he considered it would be useful if the forum reconvened but he did not give any further details.  Will the Leader ascertain what is proposed for the future of the forum?  It is imperative that it recommences its good work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on spiralling house prices, especially in Dublin? The Department of the Environment and Local Government has established a commission on the subject.  Could the House make recommendations to the commission?</P>
      <P>Many Members of the House are elected by local authority members.  We are in a better position to evaluate what is happening on a national basis.  I am told, for example, that house prices increased by 14 per cent in Dublin last year compared with a 3 per cent increase in the North. Despite the fact that building materials have increased by approximately 3 per cent over the past two years, house prices have increased in some instances by 30 per cent.  There is a need for a debate because if matters are allowed to continue young couples will not be in a position to buy their own homes, especially in the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality I am surprised that the leader of the Opposition and the spokesman for the Labour Party, who were members of the previous <Col N="323" /> Government and whose Bill on this matter was accepted by the Government, have lost faith in their Government to make a proposal which they now see to be inadequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not lost faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Beware of calling for a debate in house prices because it will raise issues regarding the control of inflation.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by visually impaired people that there is no voice over system on the DART.  If one is blind one must count the number of stops.  There is a mechanism on trains but it is not used.  This is a shame.  Will the Leader raise the issue with the relevant Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating Dr. FitzGerald on his election as Chancellor of the National University of Ireland.  He follows in a distinguished tradition and is a distinguished person. He will make an excellent Chancellor.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  It had almost reached a conclusion in terms of its work.  The only outstanding matter was the report, which could not be agreed because Sinn Féin would not accept the principle of consent or, more correctly, the way it should be exercised.</P>
      <P>While it is desirable that the forum should recommence its work, there is a practical difficulty in that the senior people in the northern parties, especially in the SDLP and Sinn Féin, cannot be in two places at the one time.  It is more important that they be present at Stormont than at Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>Regarding the forthcoming referendum on Cabinet confidentiality, I realise the House would benefit from the wisdom of Deputy O'Malley and the political skills of former Deputy Michael McDowell. However, there is a degree of hindsight about this matter.  The issue was debated when the Bill was before the House and there was adequate time to discuss it.  I do not recall many of the reservations being raised now being expressed then.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning would not conduct anything other than constructive opposition. It has always been his practice and I would not expect anything different.  However, there is a degree of hindsight and opportunism about this matter.  If the Seanad wishes to discuss it, I am sure Members would be happy to debate it in <Col N="324" /> further detail although we had such an opportunity when the Bill was before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Leader's attention to the fact that County Louth had the highest rate of deaths from road accidents before Operation Lifesaver was introduced by the Louth/Meath division of the Garda Síochána.  The number of admissions to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital following road accidents has reduced by 25 per cent. If Operation Lifesaver was extended to the rest of the country, there would be the same significant reduction in the mortality rate following road accidents.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, the great concern of the people of County Louth about the Government's position on the case against British Nuclear Fuels?  Page 31 of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto states that &ldquo;in Government, Fianna Fáil will ensure that the case taken by the Dundalk residents is fully funded and if required appealed through the higher courts&rdquo;.  It is of great concern to the people of County Louth that this has not been done yet and I appeal to the Government, even at this late stage, to rectify the position.  The Irish Sea is the most radioactive in the world and the rate of deaths from cancer was 15 per cent higher in County Louth in the period 1971 to 1991 than any other county.  This case warrants a significant commitment from the Government.</P>

      <P>It was suggested that it was blooming.  However, the remarks give me the opportunity to mention that today is Rose Day for children with autism.  Will the Leader ask the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children to continue the great work being done to help people with such conditions as autism?  Such conditions are irrelevant to the majority of people but they are extremely relevant to the families of those who suffer from them.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a debate on the number of deaths on our roads.  There was a debate last night on the National Roads Authority and many of the comments made then, and this morning, should be passed on to the authority.  In the last Seanad I said four wheel drive vehicles with bull bars on the front should be banned.  They are the most dangerous vehicles on the roads and have caused innumerable accidents.  I apologise to Senator Dardis for mentioning the farming community but because its financial status has improved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;all young men want four wheel drive vehicles.  They look down on everybody else.  They drive up behind other motorists on motorways and try to force them off the road. Bull bars on the front of such vehicles should be banned and if the current rate of deaths on the roads continues, perhaps even four wheel drive vehicles should be banned from motorways.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Connor that there should be an early debate on our overseas development aid obligations.  However, the Senator is wrong when he says that Ireland is reneging on its commitment to bring its percentage of such aid up to the United Nations target.</P>

      <P>Given the debate last night on the National Roads Authority, will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to clarify the future of the authority?

      <P>I support the call for a debate on the recent carnage on our roads.  There would be a major debate on this important matter if as many people were killed by guns or farm machinery. I agree Operation Lifesaver has been successful but more legislation will not solve the problem.  Many Bills have been passed in recent years and innocent people going five or six miles an hour above the speed limit in villages are often caught.  The number of people caught and fined for such offences is much higher than for other speeding offences.</P>
      <P>The Government should make it mandatory that devices are put on every car which would ensure they can travel only up to 70 miles an hour.  This would reduce the number of accidents caused by speeding and the need for more legislation and programmes such as Operation Lifesaver. People caught interfering with those devices should be banned from driving for at least five years.  Such devices were placed on trucks 20 years ago and they are also on tractors.  Why not place them on cars?  It would be a simple way to reduce the number of accidents.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta recently announced that it intended to withdraw its service of carrying the remains of deceased people flown to Knock Airport from England.  There are many discussions about subsidiarity and the fact that Ireland is on the periphery of Europe.  The Minister made a long statement yesterday about the State's investment in Knock Airport and its future.  The House should ask Aer Rianta, which is a private company and runs its business as it sees fit, to resume that service in Knock Airport for the people of the west.  It is fundamentally necessary to restore it in that part of the country. I travelled from the tip of north Mayo to Castlebar yesterday, a distance of over 65 miles.  Much inconvenience is being placed on the people of <Col N="327" /> the west by the withdrawal of that service.  I ask the House to support my call to Aer Rianta to reinstate that service at Knock Airport.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Manning and other Members in congratulating Dr. Garret FitzGerald on his appointment as Chancellor of the NUI.  It is a great honour for him and for Seanad Éireann.  Former Members of this House have become Presidents while others who began their careers here have been appointed to distinguished positions.  I will inquire about the information leaflet on the forthcoming referendum and will come back to the House on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry asked about the possibility of the House sitting during the presidential election week.  It has been the precedent of the House not to sit the day after the bank holiday.  Bearing in mind the election is on a Thursday, I do not propose that the House sit that week.  The House must deal with a considerable amount of legislation before Christmas and judging from the number of debates which have been called for, to most of which I will accede, Senators may be poised for a busy time between now and Christmas.  Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, under the stewardship of the Cathaoirleach, could discuss sitting additional days.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Connor and Brendan Ryan called for a debate on the refugee issue, with which I have no problem.  I will make time available at the earliest possible opportunity.  Senators Ryan, Quinn, O'Dowd, Lanigan and Farrell spoke about the 20 deaths on the roads in recent days.  We discussed this matter at length last night and perhaps this morning is a sensitive time in the House as a former colleague has lost his life. I have no objection to a debate on this matter. Perhaps the leaders of the various groups in the House could discuss this matter to see how best to facilitate Members' requests.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn requested statements on Bord Bia.  I understand statements are taking place in the Dáil but I have no problem with his request and will accede to it.  He also called for a debate on EMU a number of weeks ago and I am pleased to say the Minister for Finance will open that debate after the Order of Business.  I would like as many Members as possible to participate in this discussion.  I will monitor the participation of Members to assess the genuineness of calls for debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor and Senator Dardis asked about the future of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  All Members would like the forum to be reconstituted but, as Senator Dardis pointed out, it is impossible for them to be in two places at the one time.  We will keep the matter under review and will welcome its return.  Senator Finneran called for a debate on house prices.  I overlooked his request yesterday but Members will appreciate that when the Order of Business <Col N="328" /> takes over one hour it is easy to overlook a request.  Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might consider tightening it up, a suggestion with which Senator Connor, a new and distinguished Member, will agree.</P>

      <P>I hope we will have a debate on house prices before the Christmas recess.  Senator Ridge raised a matter in relation to the DART which would be more suited to the Adjournment. I concur with many of the Senator's wishes.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd raised what is known as the &ldquo;County Louth issue&rdquo; with which we all concur. This House may take pride in the stance it took during the last Seanad.  When in Opposition, I along with other colleagues and Independent Members, was able to get the Government to change its views on the issue.  I sympathise with the Senator's request.  It is extraordinary how Members change to our view but when they were on the other side of the House it was more difficult. Political decisions must be taken by politicians. The problems which existed in the past will have to be overcome by the political system and politicians.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke raised the question of the National Roads Authority.  I would have taken a different view of last night's debate which I thought was worthwhile.  If five hours had been made available, there would have been enough speakers.  A review of the National Roads Authority enabled Members who are also members of local authorities to express their views.  Indeed, we are all representatives of the local authority system.  I thought it was timely that the first significant debate should facilitate local authority members' wishes.  Senator Burke will concur that the National Roads Authority has transformed the landscape.  As one who used to travel up to 60,000 miles per year, it is now more pleasant to travel around the country than in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this House on the question of Economic and Monetary Union. Senators may recall that on 4 December last, my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, set out the background to EMU and outlined the issues to be addressed at the Dublin European Council meeting which took place on 13 and 14 December 1996.  In addition, he also gave a short summary of the report, Economic Implications for Ireland of EMU, published by the ESRI in July 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to concentrate on preparations for stage 3 of EMU which the Amsterdam European Council of June last reaffirmed will commence on 1 January 1999.  I will outline progress towards stage 3 of EMU and Ireland's performance in terms of meeting the convergence criteria and <Col N="329" /> briefly explain the national changeover plan for the introduction of the single currency, the euro.</P>
    <P>Before addressing some of the consequences of EMU for Ireland, I would make the following points.  First, the global economic environment is changing fast.  This process will continue, and would continue even if EMU had never been thought of.  It involves greater globalisation of activity, increasing intensification of competition among all the countries of the world, and increasing technological change.  Second, the formation of EMU will mark a substantial change in the economic environment of the Union as a whole. This is true for all member states and it is true whether they join EMU.  In other words, continuation of the <i>status quo</i> is not an option for any member state.  EMU will change things even for member states that do not join it.</P>
    <P>The report included detailed sectoral analyses of the impact of EMU on the tourism, retailing, agriculture, manufacturing industry and financial services sectors.  The ESRI report concluded that EMU participation by Ireland would yield a net benefit to the Irish economy.  This would be the case even if the United Kingdom were to remain outside the euro zone.</P>
    <P>The principal benefit of EMU participation by Ireland identified in the report was the prospect of a lower trend in interest rates for Ireland within the single currency area, reflecting the elimination of the currency risk premium on Irish pound assets.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report also examined potential but unquantifiable effects of EMU participation. They concluded that some of these, such as the increased attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for foreign direct investment, could be substantially positive and hence strengthened the case for Ireland's participation in EMU.</P>
    <P>The Treaty sets out three stages for achieving EMU.  The third and final stage will commence on 1 January 1999.  The European Central Bank will have been established before then; on that date the exchange rates of the currencies of participating member states will be irrevocably locked, the single currency, the euro, will come into being, and the ECB will begin operation of the single monetary policy in respect of the euro.</P>
    <P>There has been much progress in terms of preparation for stage 3.  Agreement has been reached on the establishment of an exchange rate mechanism in the third stage of EMU to be known as ERM 2.  This will minimise real exchange-rate misalignments and excessive nominal exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the other EU currencies.  Participation in ERM 2 will be on a voluntary basis in accordance with the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The euro will become the currency of the participating member states from 1 January 1999.  A Council regulation has been adopted on the legal framework for the introduction of the euro to provide legal certainty for citizens and firms to enable them to prepare for the changeover.  This text provides for one-to-one conversion between <Col N="330" /> the ecu and the euro, and continuity of contracts as set out in the rules, including rounding rules, for conversion between the participating currencies and the euro.</P>
    <P>The text of a second Council regulation was also agreed.  This cannot be adopted until the participating member states are known but was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 2 August 1997 in order to aid preparations.  This regulation will establish the euro as the currency of participating member states as from 1 January 1999 and will set out transitional and certain other arrangements for the introduction of the euro.</P>
    <P>A stability and growth pact has been adopted based on the objective of sound Government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.  The pact provides both for prevention and deterrence of excessive deficits, and the strengthening of multilateral surveillance of budgetary and economic policies.  Adherence to this budgetary objective will allow member states to deal with normal cyclical fluctuations while keeping the Government deficit within 3 per cent of GDP reference value.  This will require a tighter underlying stance for member states' fiscal policy in order to achieve a structural budget close to balance and also continued reductions in the burden of public debt in the economy.  This is a policy which in itself would make perfect sense even if EMU had never been proposed.</P>
    <P>The decision on who will participate in the third stage of EMU is to be made around May next year in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 109j of the Maastricht Treaty. The Council of Ministers, ECOFIN, will assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency on the basis of convergence reports from the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute.  On the basis of these reports, ECOFIN, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission, will recommend its findings to the Council, comprising the Heads of State or Government, who will, after receiving the opinion of the European Parliament, confirm which member states fulfil the conditions.</P>
    <P>I expect that some Senators may raise the question of United Kingdom participation.  This is a matter for the British Government.  The UK has an opt-out from the Maastricht Treaty provisions on EMU.  The UK Government has not yet said if and when it will join EMU.  While the EMU debate in the UK has sounded a more positive note of late, it must be said that the UK position remains unclear, although many commentators feel that the UK will not be a member at the outset. While I would welcome a decision by the UK Government to enter EMU, the clear priority for Ireland is to ensure that whatever happens, Ireland qualifies for EMU.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> In relation to our decision, I stress that when the Maastricht Treaty received the endorsement of the Irish people, it did so without qualification or any provision for Ireland to opt out from the provisions for economic and monetary union. Membership of EMU, irrespective of what the UK does, will on balance be of benefit for Ireland, according to both the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council in a report, &ldquo;European Union: Integration and Enlargement&rdquo;, which was published in March this year.</P>
    <P>Ireland at present meets all of the convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty for qualification for EMU.  Among most of our EU partners, there has also been very considerable progress in recent years towards meeting these criteria.  Based on the EU wide measure, the harmonised index of consumer prices, Ireland's inflation rate is at 0.6 per cent, currently the lowest in the EU.  Given our expected inflation figure of 1.4 per cent for 1997, we are comfortably within the likely reference figure.</P>
    <P>Ireland's general Government deficit has been consistently below the reference figure of 3 per cent of GDP for the last eight years and this year our general Government position may be close to balance.  Ireland's debt/GDP ratio is still above 60 per cent but because it has been falling significantly over the last ten years and a further significant improvement is in prospect this year, we meet the terms of the Treaty in so far as this measure is concerned.  This ratio is expected to reach 68 per cent for 1997, which is below the average for the EU as a whole.  Ireland meets the EMU exchange rate criterion, that the normal fluctuation margins of the exchange rate mechanism be observed for at least two years.  Ireland is also on target to meet the EMU interest rate criterion that the average long-term interest rate should not be more than 2 per cent above that of the three best performing member states in terms of price stability.</P>
    <P>According to the Autumn Economic Forecasts published by the EU Commission on Tuesday, the Commission view is that a majority of member states should be capable of meeting the necessary conditions to participate in the euro from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>In relation to the rates at which participating currencies will convert to the euro, the September ECOFIN agreed that, at the same time as the participants of stage 3 of EMU are announced around May next year, there will be a preannouncement of the bilateral exchange rates of the currencies of the participating member states. These rates will become effective on 1 January 1999 and, in line with the Treaty on the European Union, the actual setting of the conversion rates against the euro can only take place on that date.</P>
    <P>As regards the Irish pound, the Government's intention is that Ireland joins EMU at an exchange rate that meets the needs of the economy in the fullest sense of the term, and that <Col N="332" /> between now and decision day we will be keeping the issue under active review.</P>
    <P>Regarding the practical preparations which are being made for EMU and the changeover to the euro, when EMU was discussed in this House last December, several Senators emphasised the need for adequate planning and preparation for the changeover to the euro at a practical level.  My Department has responsibility for co-ordinating the preparations of the Irish public administration and has a key role in helping the rest of the economy to prepare itself for the changeover. The following initiatives have been taken in this area.</P>
    <P>In the public sector a single currency officers team, known as SCOT, was set up in Autumn 1995.  SCOT consists of a representative from every Department as well as from the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Central Statistics Office and the National Treasury Management Agency. Its remit is to co-ordinate preparations for the changeover to the euro in the public sector.  As such, SCOT played a leading role in the preparation of the national changeover plan which was published on 29 May 1997.</P>
    <P>The plan, which is based on the assumption that EMU will begin on 1 January 1999 and that Ireland will be part of it from the outset, outlines the arrangements which will be made by the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare and Government Departments generally, as well as by banks and building societies and the Irish Stock Exchange, in order to facilitate the use of the euro.  This framework is designed to help economic agents to plan effectively and so facilitate a smooth and orderly changeover.</P>
    <P>In summary, the main points of the plan are that from Ireland's entry into EMU Government Departments will accept payment in euro as well as in Irish pounds; Revenue will accept payment of tax in euro as well as in Irish pounds; Revenue will also accept returns and declarations in euro from companies and for self-assessed income tax, subject in the case of some taxes to an irrevocable election to adopt the euro as the reporting currency for that tax, for accounting periods which begin on or after 1 January 1999; companies may file their accounts with the Companies Registration Office in euro; banks and building societies will process lodgments and payments expressed in either Irish pounds or euro regardless of which of these the customer account is denominated in; any banking service required in euro will be available in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The national changeover plan will be extended before the end of 1997 to include other parts of the public sector.</P>
    <P>The private sector was centrally involved in the preparation of the plan through the euro changeover group, which was set up in 1996.  This group includes representatives from the trade unions, <Col N="333" /> business, consumers and farming sectors as well as from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The group meets monthly to advise my Department on technical issues in the run up to the 1998 European Council decision on which member states qualify for EMU, and to help co-ordination of the changeover across the economy.</P>
    <P>The national changeover plan states that assuming the European Council confirms in 1998 that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for entering EMU, a currency changeover board will be established, after the European Council's decision, in order to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover, including in the areas of public and consumer information.  The euro changeover group is expected to provide the nucleus of this board, which will of course be dissolved at the end of the changeover.</P>
    <P>Preparations for the changeover in the public sector are ongoing.  My Department has established a euro changeover team to help accelerate preparations in the public sector and to help the rest of the economy to prepare also.  Further-more, the Government has recently approved arrangements to intensify public sector preparations: these involve requiring each Department to prepare a detailed changeover plan, designate a senior official to oversee its implementation and provide regular progress reports to my Department.  On foot of these reports, my Department will in turn keep the Government regularly informed on how the changeover is progressing across the public sector.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to deal with the question of information about the changeover.  Senators will be aware that a national information programme on EMU and the changeover to the euro was launched in December 1996.  The first phase of the programme, to end 1997, consists mainly of a business awareness campaign which is being run by Forfás and aims to provide businesses with the information they need to prepare themselves for the changeover to the euro.  The campaign has produced an information pack containing a set of leaflets, 18 in all, which provides background information on EMU and sets out the issues for business.  The series is regularly added to and every leaflet is sent to all Members of the Oireachtas, thus Senators will recently have received copies of the two most recent leaflets on the national changeover plan and the design of the common face of euro coins.</P>
    <P>A management committee, which is chaired by Forfás and includes representatives from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my own Department and the Central Bank as well as from the private sector, meets regularly to direct the campaign.</P>
    <P>A consultative committee advises the management committee.  It draws on expertise from business and trade associations, professional bodies and the State agencies that deal directly with business.  It provides both a channel for distributing <Col N="334" /> information to enterprises and provides feedback on the preparations underway in the enterprise sector and the issues arising in the changeover process.</P>
    <P>The Forfás campaign has already distributed some 25,000 copies of its information pack.  It also distributes a quarterly newsletter, has a web site which provides campaign information both nationally and internationally and has organised regional meetings to bring the messages of the campaign to the enterprise sector in different parts of the country.  It has set up working groups on information technology, training and the retail sector.</P>
    <P>Following a recent survey of the campaign's effectiveness, further approaches are being developed to reach companies which have not yet received the information pack, especially those which are not members of business organisations. I should add that overall, the national information programme will be reviewed by end-year with a view to broadening its focus.</P>
    <P>Practical preparations for the changeover to the euro are thus well underway on a number of fronts.  Within the public sector, the work of the single currency officers team has continued apace and is set to intensify over the coming months. At the same time the interface between the public and private sector has developed in a very constructive way, in particular through the euro changeover group and the management and consultative committees of the Forfás business awareness campaign.  I take this opportunity to thank all the bodies represented on these groups for their excellent co-operation with us, and for the work they are doing in their own areas to keep their members and clients well informed on EMU and the changeover.</P>
    <P>The publication of the second edition of the national changeover plan will mark a further stage in the process of facilitating a smooth and orderly changeover to the euro in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>It is clear that stage 3 of EMU will commence on 1 January 1999.  The EU Commission has expressed the view that a majority of member states should be capable of meeting the necessary conditions to participate in the euro from 1 January 1999.  I, as Minister for Finance, am happy that Ireland approaches EMU from a position of considerable strength.  Economic growth in 1997 is expected to be very similar to that of 1996 with GNP increasing by about 7 per cent.  The outlook for 1998 and 1999 is favourable and GNP is expected to increase by an average of 5 per cent over the two years with inflation likely to remain moderate.</P>
    <P>The outlook beyond the year 2000 is for sustained economic growth, although at a more moderate rate than that seen in recent years.  Our priority now must be to continue to build on achievements in order to ensure that the Irish economy can fully exploit the benefits which a European single currency can bring.  In doing so we will also be contributing fully to the work of <Col N="335" /> building a strong European economy that will be ready to face all the challenges of the 21st century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  It is a position he well deserves.  Many across the country are pleased he has received this appointment because he has been somewhat in the political wings for a number of years and it is good to see a man of his capacity and calibre in such an important Department at a very important time in the development of this economy.  I am sure given his professional background this is something he can sail through quite easily.  It is evident that he has taken to this ministry like a duck to water.  I wish the Minister the very best in the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>It is opportune that we are debating EMU.  It is important because we are facing a major step forward in closer European union: economic and monetary union.  It is important to recognise that the Irish economy is seen as one of the strongest economies within the European Union.  This has come about as a result of a variety of factors but two in particular.  When we joined the EMS we had an international discipline laid upon us which focused national policy in a very disciplined financial direction.  In addition the criteria laid down for participation in EMU focused national thinking and policy in a particular direction.  These two factors, combined with responsible government since the early 1980s and the Tallaght strategy adopted by the Opposition in 1997 have set us on a path of sound financial rectitude that has now produced a booming economy and a strong economic performance.  We are now benefiting from the sacrifices made in the 1980s and the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>Because we have such a buoyant economy and strong currency at this point, the question must be asked why should we join the EMU.  It is important we recognise that we are a small economy within the European Union.  That is one of the main reasons we must join EMU.  Almost 40 per cent of our exports is to the EU.  In joining EMU we will be protecting those exports and this is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The downside to EMU is that between 27 to 30 per cent of our exports go to the UK.  What will be Ireland's position if the UK does not join EMU?  The Government must give serious consideration to this issue because, under the Maastricht Treaty, the UK has the right to avail of an opt out clause.  If it exercises that right and does not participate in EMU, industries exporting primarily to Britain will encounter particular difficulties. There is a need to provide protection for companies facing that predicament.  The Minister must elaborate on this issue in greater detail because people should be able to fully understand the position.  The arguments put forward to date about the UK opting out do not placate or <Col N="336" /> reassure those exporting to Britain.  I hope the Minister will deal with this matter in greater detail when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>EMU will secure definite economic benefits and provide Ireland with a steady interest rate which will make it easier for us to trade with our EU partners.  Equally, it will challenge us to show greater competitiveness.  We will be obliged to be more aware of competitors within the EU and outside who could cause difficulties for us.  Common interest rates among EU member states will be of greater assistance when trading with our partners.  This should substantially deepen the single market and ensure that greater trade occurs within the EU.  Once we enter EMU, the Government will not be in a position to devalue our currency because the punt will become part of the euro.  All matters pertaining to currency valuation will be decided by the European Central Bank.  The Government will no longer retain the right to devalue the punt and we must be aware that we will be unable to insulate our economy from any fluctuations which might occur, particularly in respect of the UK.  This could provide an economic shock and we must address this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult for the UK to completely opt out of EMU.  It is heartening that in recent days the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, seems to be more amenable towards joining EMU.  We would welcome the UK joining EMU because our economy will be more secure than it would if the UK opted out.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the preparatory work carried out in respect of EMU.  I compliment Forfás and SFADCo on the business awareness campaign they are conducting, the information and leaflets they have circulated to businesses and the advice they have given to industry, particularly small and medium sized concerns.  It is vitally important that small and medium sized industries are protected because they generated the greatest growth in employment in recent years.  They need assistance and advice from the Government, the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, their representative organisations and professional bodies to ensure that growth continues and they should not incur major costs in securing such assistance.</P>
    <P>There are three elements which will hopefully emerge from involvement in EMU.  The single currency will secure the European economy in the future and the single monetary policy to be implemented by the European Central Bank will bring about a common monetary policy throughout Europe.  This will apply to all member states and will provide assistance to their economies. When the budget is introduced next month we will begin to experience the co-ordination of the economic and budgetary policies of participating member states.  We will take our first step in that direction when the budget is introduced in December.  In the future it is hoped that a budget will be introduced on the same date each year to coincide with other member states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> It is good to realise that the convergence criteria are being met by the Irish economy.  In recent years we have focused on meeting those criteria and we are now in a strong position.  The rate of inflation is low, interest rates are below the ceiling set down by the EU, our currency is stable &mdash; the punt is performing well within the ERM &mdash; and our Government deficit is below 3 per cent of GDP, and has been since 1989.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy is well positioned to participate in EMU.  However, it is equally important that Irish businesses be well positioned and large, medium and small interests must put in place plans to prepare for the transfer to EMU.  It is important that the specific elements of EMU relevant to business are addressed by everyone involved.  This is essential because, as an island nation, we will incur additional transportation costs.  I appeal to the Minister to address this issue because there is a need to provide some sort of structural cohesion funds.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, will agree with me in this regard because he has articulated the problem on many occasions.  It is important that we procure additional support in respect of transporting goods by sea and air to mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter with Commissioner Kinnock when he addressed the House last year. Unfortunately, I did not receive a satisfactory reply.  Successive Governments will be obliged to pursue this issue until we are on a par with our competitors.  At present, Irish exporters are being placed at a competitive disadvantage.  It may not mean much now while the economy is strong, interest rates are low and the currency is performing well but, if the situation declines, this will become a key element with regard to the performance of the economy.  I urge the Minister to raise this issue at future meetings on EMU.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal specifically with the conversion of member states' currencies into euro notes and coins.  Will the euro note be in full circulation in all member states by the year 2002?  If the conversion takes place on time it will make communication and travel between member states much easier and people will not be forced to change their money from one currency to another.  It would greatly enhance Ireland's position as a tourist destination if European visitors were not obliged to convert their currency to punts as they enter the country.  I hope serious consideration is being given to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that certain sectors of the economy will benefit from EMU.  The construction industry should benefit substantially because interest rates will be low.  The construction industry has experienced difficulties in the past due to interest rate uncertainty.  However, manufacturing industry faces a different scenario because it imports many of its raw materials from the UK and exports many of its products to the UK.  If the UK remains outside EMU this raises questions for the manufacturing sector.  I hope the costs to that sector will be closely examined.  If sterling devalues it could cause serious problems <Col N="338" /> for Irish industry.  It is a matter we have not considered in detail to date and we need to do so to ensure we do not act contrary to the interests of that sector.</P>
    <P>There are also concerns in the farming community about the impact of EMU on agriculture. The CAP is the major policy instrument in that sector but EMU will impact on agriculture and the Departments of Finance and Agriculture and Food could provide greater information on what may be involved.</P>
    <P>At present, businesses can raise loans in foreign currencies and switch between currencies depending on interest rates.  The single currency may restrict businesses to fewer choices as to where they borrow.  We must assess whether this will be good for business.  Will we force business to raise loans in dollars and yen thus moving borrowing out of Europe?</P>
    <P>Those opposed to EMU argue that we would place ourselves in an invidious position in EMU because an economic crash in Europe could lead us into a catastrophe similar to the Wall Street Crash.  We must have more information on this possibility.  It may be argued that having different currencies would protect states from being affected by the economic difficulties of others. However, in a common currency, if two or three of the major EU member states have economic collapses will they take the rest of the members with them?  That is an important element in the overall assessment of the project and we should have more public debate on the matter.  In EMU the Government will no longer be in a position to insulate the economy against external shocks, particularly from the UK, and we must address this matter.  Our economy is greatly influenced by the world economy and to a large extent we are not the masters of our own destiny.  However, it is important that the issues involved are considered.</P>
    <P>It is good that the Irish economy is in a position to become part of EMU.  All parties involved in the work done over the years to put the economy in such a strong position &mdash; politicians, social partners and citizens &mdash; deserve to be complimented. We are well in line with the convergence criteria and the difficult decisions taken in the past have put us in such a position.  We should not forget the difficulties of the past and take our current strength for granted.  We need to remain aware of increasing competitiveness.  All things considered, we are better off in EMU than outside it.  The issues I have raised need to be addressed publicly to inform the public of the details of the project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to the House.  I remember serving with him here a few years ago.  I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Senator Taylor-Quinn in complimenting those who took the difficult decisions over the last ten years to put the public finances in order.  The process started in 1987 and decisions taken then and subsequently have put us in the strong economic position outlined by the <Col N="339" /> Minister, from which we are well placed to join EMU at the outset.  That is a compliment to all involved, including the social partners.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union is a major economic and political project aimed at creating a single currency, the euro, for the EU.  EMU aims at producing economic benefits for the participating member states, including the elimination of exchange rate uncertainty and transaction costs for trade, investment and tourism, the convergence of interest rates and the extension of the single market.  On 1 January 1999 the exchange rates for the states joining EMU will be fixed and the euro will come into effect.  National currencies will continue to be used up to 1 January 2002 at the latest and national coins and notes will be completely withdrawn by 1 July 2002 at the latest. The changeover to the euro will then be complete.</P>
    <P>To become a member of EMU each state must satisfy convergence criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty, showing that its economy has achieved certain targets on inflation, interest rates, Government debt and budget deficit.  Other factors are taken into consideration, including how Central Bank legislation complied with the Treaty obligations, the balance of payments on the current account and the development of unit labour costs.  This is part of what we must adhere to in order to gain membership of EMU.</P>
    <P>As the deadline for the introduction of the common currency approaches, the question of the likely economic impact on Ireland of EMU membership becomes increasingly relevant.  What changes will it mean for the environment in which Irish businesses operate and how can they best position themselves in the run up to EMU?  As part of the preparation for economic and monetary union the former Minister for Finance commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to carry out an in-depth study of the likely economic implications for Ireland, with particular reference to employment.  This study looked at the prospects for the overall operation of EMU, as well as the Irish economy's ability to respond.  It identified several ways in which the effects on Ireland will be beneficial, as well as some which could present threats to individual sectors.</P>
    <P>The common currency regime for members will be unlike the EMS in that there will be no escape valve through currency depreciation.  This is very important because if costs get out of line with those of our competitors we will not have the luxury of devaluing.  That means we have a responsibility to prevent costs drifting and we must keep in line with our competitors.</P>
    <P>The lasting effects of EMU are expected to flow through three main channels.  These are interest rates, competitiveness effects and the cost of foreign exchange transactions.  The most obvious beneficial effect of EMU will be that firms and individuals will not have to incur costs <Col N="340" /> when buying and selling currencies of other member states.  This is very important.  I have heard in the past of somebody leaving Dublin Airport with £100, changing it in every capital of the member states of the EU, arriving back two weeks later at Dublin Airport and finding that the £100 was worth just something in the region of £26.  That shows the effect of the exchange rate and the cost to the individual.  This is something that must be borne in mind at this time.  The ESRI study notes, however, that the gain from that will be offset in the early years of EMU by the adverse effect this loss of business will have on employment and income in the financial sector.  We must also be conscious of this.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union will have far-reaching implications for all the citizens of Europe, not just Ireland and, not least, for the business, financial and agriculture sectors.  Many other sectors will be affected also, notably the retail and tourism sectors.  EMU will have substantial implications for Ireland.  The global economic environment is changing fast.  This process will continue, even if EMU had never been thought of.  It involves greater globalisation of activity, increased intensification of competition among all the countries of the world and increasing technological change.</P>
    <P>The formation of EMU will mark a substantial change in the economic environment of the European Union as a whole.  This is true for all member states, and it is true regardless of whether they join EMU.  In other words, continuation of the <i>status quo</i> is not an option for any member state.  This must be borne in mind and I am sure Governments around Europe are conscious of this fact.</P>
    <P>The six mark question for Ireland is the position of the United Kingdom.  Most people think of sterling when they think of the exchange rate exposure involved in Ireland joining the single currency.  It is, therefore, appropriate to say something about the position of the United Kingdom in relation to EMU.  The UK has an opt-out clause under the Maastricht Treaty provisions on EMU.  The UK Government has not yet said that it will exercise this opt-out clause but it has not said that it will never join EMU.  It has only said it will decide closer to the starting date of 1 January 1999.  While the EMU debate in the UK has sounded a more positive note of late, it must be said that the position remains unclear. There was recent media speculation on this matter but the new Government in the UK is a positive factor.</P>
    <P>Our priority must be to ensure that Ireland qualifies for membership of EMU.  I compliment the present and the former Ministers for Finance, and all those who have taken a position on this matter since 1987.  This has resulted in our being in a position to join EMU on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report considered the potential impact on Ireland of a 20 per cent fall in the value of sterling in two scenarios.  It stated that in both cases such a fall in sterling would present problems <Col N="341" /> for Ireland.  The ESRI estimate that with both countries out of EMU there would be a loss of in the region of 16,000 jobs in Ireland, while with Ireland in EMU and the UK out the loss would rise to 28,000 jobs, a net difference of 12,000 jobs.  These figures should be of concern to us all in deciding whether to join EMU.  Clearly in either case such a sterling depreciation would present a significant challenge, particularly since the job losses would be concentrated in those sectors most exposed to competition.  It is worth noting, however, that the ESRI report demonstrates that not being in EMU would give us total protection against such a shock.  It should also be borne in mind that participation in EMU will remove the interest rate problem which created such difficulties for Irish industry during the currency crisis of 1991-3.  We remember the issues the Minister for Finance had to confront at that time.</P>
    <P>Ireland cannot escape significant competitive exposure to sterling fluctuations unless the UK also enters EMU.  If the UK remains out, a substantial depreciation of sterling would have damaging effects, irrespective of whether Ireland joined EMU.  With Ireland in EMU there will no longer be any risk of exchange rate movements between Ireland and other EMU countries.  Thus the currency premium which has kept wholesale rates in Ireland above the German rates will be eliminated.  It is important that with Ireland in EMU we will have that luxury which we did not have heretofore.  The most favourable scenario would be if the UK joins EMU.  That would minimise the exchange rate shocks and allow greater savings on currency costs.</P>
    <P>Many sectors will be affected in different ways and it is believed that the construction industry will benefit substantially from EMU entry.  That sector is particularly sensitive to interest rate effects while being relatively unaffected by competitive or foreign exchange transaction cost effects.  The principal gainers from lower interest rates are those industries which primarily serve the domestic market, especially suppliers to the building sector, and those firms which are heavily indebted to the Irish banking system.  The opportunity would seem to be there for the construction industry and that is welcome news.  That industry is very much part and parcel of our economic life.  It is an important sector in the economy.</P>
    <P>The waters are somewhat muddier as regards agriculture, one of our main industries.  It appears that agriculture is likely to be much more affected by changes in the common agricultural policy régime than by EMU.  The trend is very worrying for the farming sector at present because the thinking is that prices will fall.  Obviously there will be benefits in EMU as regards interests rates for the sector, but there is great concern among young farmers who have taken over farms and are just starting out; they see an uncertain future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> Any information that can be provided by the Department of Finance or the Department of Agriculture and Food should be made available now.  Representatives of the Irish Farmers Association and other farming organisations should be involved in the discussions that are taking place on EMU because agriculture is one of the most important areas of economic life.  In some people's eyes, it is the main industry as we are major exporters of agricultural produce. Some 85 per cent of all cattle raised here is exported.  The agricultural sector is very dependent on exports so it is important that the industry is well protected within EMU.  Any changes that need to be made should be discussed now rather than having a shock wave effect as we had in 1974 when agriculture was undermined.  Confidence was lost during the 1970s because of what happened then.</P>
    <P>We all remember that cattle prices fell at that time and cattle were abandoned at marts and fairs.  Their owners did not even bring them home because they did not see any future in the industry. We must ensure that farmers' confidence is not broken.</P>
    <P>The type of information that should be available to this sector is not available at the moment. The Minister of State should indicate what the Department of Finance and Department of Agriculture and Food intend to do about promoting debate on this area for the benefit of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Tourism will gain modestly from a reduction in the cost and inconvenience of currency transactions and from a reduction in Irish interest rates.  The effect of introducing the euro is being considered throughout the economy, including the financial services sector.  In recent years we have seen Dublin establish itself as a significant provider of financial services to both domestic and international markets.  We must compliment all those involved in the extension of those services in Dublin.  It was an innovative move and has given a new focus on financial services.  EMU will present greater opportunities for that sector, which hopefully will be in a position to avail of them.</P>
    <P>However, the introduction of a single currency on 1 January 1999 will require the financial services sector to prepare for, and adapt to, one of the most historic European projects ever.  Any project of this magnitude is not without its challenges. EMU will entail transition costs and will demand improved competitiveness and flexibility in the economy with increased competition and greater price transparency.  With the introduction of the euro, changes currently under way in financial services can be expected to accelerate with an increasing degree of financial market integration between participating member states as a consequence of the removal of foreign exchange rate risk and centralised monetary policy pursued by the new European Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The increased depth and liquidity of the European financial markets will permit the development <Col N="343" /> and use of new financial instruments.  As in any time of change, there will be great opportunities for those who can respond speedily and effectively to such changes.  That applies to all sectors, but in the financial sector particularly we are better equipped to benefit as the necessary information appears to be more readily available than, for example, in the farming sector.</P>
    <P>There is also some concern in the retail sector, among shops and other retail outlets, about the changeover.  Many of us are reminded of the time decimalisation was introduced and we changed from 240p to 100p in the pound.  Prices shot up then because people used the opportunity to increase them.  If that were to happen on this occasion we would be in serious trouble with our competitors.</P>
    <P>The cost to some retailers of changing over to the single currency, involving the adaptation of tills, is a matter of concern and they need a response from Government Departments.  The Minister said there was a euro changeover group, but from the representations I have received it does not seem retail organisations are happy that everything that needs to be done is being done. The retail area should be examined by the Government.  I am not talking about large chains but individual corner shops.  We have a responsibility to maintain them in operation because over the years they have been the backbone of rural communities.  Under the designated areas scheme we are providing an opportunity to set up new shopping complexes that put smaller shop owners out of business because they cannot compete. That is an unfortunate development and even though it may be inevitable, it is not in the best interests of maintaining the rural infrastructure of small towns and villages.</P>
    <P>Our manufacturing industry is closely linked to the United Kingdom and there is concern about what the UK Government's attitude to EMU will mean for that country's manufacturing industry. It could affect exports or imports depending on the industry in which one is involved.  Further debate is required concerning the effects of EMU on agriculture, manufacturing and the retail industry generally.  If anything, the people in those three sectors are most worried at present.</P>
    <P>The other day I read about an eminent American financial expert who dismissed the view that the euro could challenge the dollar after EMU. He identified the problem of regional recession under the euro as one of the areas where proper debate had not taken place.  He explained this by stating that in the US there is an excepted movement of people.  Up to 17 per cent of the US population move on an annual basis.  He said that was not practical in the EU.  There are borders and language barriers and there is no tradition of such movement.  Whereas there is immigration and migration, movement does not occur to that extent.  In the event of regional recession in the US people can move from one state to another. That could have devastating effects in a European <Col N="344" /> context.  For that reason the expert thought that Europe should address this particular matter and I agree with him.  I do not think that matter has been agreed.</P>
    <P>We have not examined the politics of EMU. We have examined the benefits of the euro and EMU as it would apply in financial and other sectors but we have not examined it on a political basis.  Obviously, that is a sensitive question because if we do so, then we are talking to a great extent about a government of Europe which would make decisions which would affect all the people.  We know that a short debate on security and defence can raise all sorts of objections and the air can become very heated in such a debate, so I can imagine a debate which would take a political view of how we should handle Europe in the event of a regional recession.</P>
    <P>For the euro to play its role in the economic life of those countries which adopt it as well as in the larger global context, it will be necessary to harmonise budgetary policies.  That cannot be done unless there is political will.  This means harmonising fiscal policies on income.  Are we prepared to do that?  On the expenditure side, it means harmonising policies for town and country planning, social welfare provisions, and other forms of spending decided by public institutions in areas such as the environment, education and the future of State-owned companies.  There is a great deal involved.  Matters will have to be dealt with in the event of things not being exactly as we would hope.  No doubt another opportunity will present itself for such a debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Minister Jacob to the House.  It was interesting to hear the speech of the Minister for Finance and to realise that there is a great deal of control in the Department of Finance.  The fact that it is aware of what is happening puts our minds at rest.</P>
      <P>A group of my heroes are the men who sat around a table in Philadelphia in 1782.  They included people like Franklin, Jefferson and Madison.  I am a great admirer of those men because the American Constitution has managed to thrive, admittedly with many amendments, for over 200 years.  They designed the kind of United States they would create, and they had a number of choices.  They could have decided to have 13 states, each with its own immigration, passport and currency policies.</P>
      <P>Among the decisions that were made at the time was one to have a common currency for the future United States, the original 13 and the further 37 who joined them.  We look back now and see the success of having one currency in the United States, which has a population of 250 million people.  When one begins to think that through, one begins to understand better how Jean Monnet and others created the concept of a united Europe, recognising that this would not just stop war for all time in Europe but would also bring prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> The correct meaning of EMU is economic and monetary union &mdash; I was corrected when I referred to it as European monetary union some time ago in this House.  If one takes EMU into account and realises what is being achieved by this next stage, it is not a united states of Europe by any means but the hope to achieve some of the ambitious plans which have developed so well in the past 40 years and the 25 years which have almost passed since Ireland joined in January 1973.</P>
    <P>If Pennsylvannia had decided to opt out of the new currency in the 1780s and keep its own currency and the other states had to decide whether to join, I suggest Pennsylvannia would have been left out of things.  It is as far apart from Virginia as Ireland is from Italy and yet 200 years ago it agreed to this development.</P>
    <P>I have always been an advocate of doing all we can to strive for a single European currency and I am happy to see that we are heading in that direction.  However, I caution that we should only do so in our best long-term interests.  My existing favourable attitude to EMU remains as it has been when we have spoken on this matter on different occasions over the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>Ireland should join EMU in the first wave and I am delighted to see that Minister McCreevy, along with the previous Ministers for Finance, Deputies Ahern and Quinn, have all been saying the same thing and that policy in recent years has been heading in that direction.  We should join in the first wave, irrespective of whether sterling joins now or at a later stage.  The long-term interests of our country demand that we do so.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the apparent lack of awareness of EMU in this country and this has been spoken about this morning.  I do not think the people, as a nation, understand the realities of EMU.  The transition to the single currency and the first ten years under EMU will be a time of major adjustment for us, some of which will be quite painful.  When I say that participation is in the interests of the country, I do not mean to suggest that there will not be costs.  The point is that in the long term these costs will be outweighed by all the benefits we are likely to receive.</P>
    <P>That is not the way the public sees it.  There is an illuminating graph in the current issue of <i>The Economist</i> about the results of opinion polls on EMU in all the member states.  In some countries the public is, on balance, hostile to EMU; in others, it seems broadly indifferent; and in a few countries, public attitude is strongly positive. According to this research, the Irish people are in the strongly positive camp.  In Ireland, over 60 per cent of voters are in favour of EMU and only a tiny minority are against.  That compares with an average positive balance across the EU of only 15 per cent.  However, I do not take comfort from those figures.  In a sense they are unhealthy because they are based not on a cool appraisal of reality but on a lack of knowledge of the real <Col N="346" /> costs of EMU, which springs directly from the absence of public disagreement about entry.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate because we have not sufficiently discussed the issue.  On the Order of Business we mentioned the concern that people have not taken an interest in the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality.  The same was true of the bail referendum last year, and it is only now that people are beginning to realise what was agreed and to question it.  I do not want that to happen to EMU &mdash; we should debate it as a nation and this is one step in that regard.</P>
    <P>The position with the bail referendum was similar.  I favoured it, as did almost everyone else, but as I said in the House at the time, the absence of disagreement was unhealthy because the issues were not properly addressed.  The same is happening with EMU.  All the political parties favour it, even Senator Dardis and the Progressive Democrats who were initially cautious.  They may have taken this new position because they are now in Government.</P>
    <P>EMU has become like motherhood &mdash; everyone favours it but no one talks about the realities. However, by ignoring the costs and difficulties which will arise, we are making life harder for ourselves.  First, we ignore the opportunity to develop a timely strategy to mitigate the costs of EMU and the special difficulties Ireland will face in its trade with Britain &mdash; the Minister, Senator Finneran and Senator Taylor-Quinn all mentioned that today.  Second, we risk a public backlash against EMU when people are eventually confronted with the costs they will have to pay. In five years' time the public may have the opposite view to the one expressed in the current issue of <i>The Economist.</i>  If the people are taken by surprise they will focus on the unexpected costs we did not tell them about, and they will ignore the wider, long-term benefits to come.  The political costs of such a switch in public opinion will be high.  I hope the Government realises that the present public enthusiasm will turn around quickly if the people are surprised by the outcome. They will be quick to blame whoever is in power at the time.</P>
    <P>The first cost of EMU will apply not only to Ireland but to those countries which adopt the single currency in the first wave &mdash; yesterday's newspapers indicate that there will be 11 such countries.  This is the cost of the final phase of the transition as currently planned, when bank notes and coins are introduced and national currencies are finally withdrawn.  The current date is 1 July 2002 but it is planned to draw out the transition from 1 January to 1 July of that year.  This is a costly remedy for disaster and if we persist in this folly we will regret it for a long time.</P>
    <P>I do not mean here the transition before the new bank notes appear, from 1 January 1999 until 2002.  That first transition period, when all European accounting systems will adjust to the euro, will require a massive amount of work which cannot be done overnight.  If anything, the three year transition period is rather tight.  It was interesting <Col N="347" /> to read recently that one German car company plans to change almost everything on 1 January 1999 whereas another plans to change on 1 July 2002.  It is the second transition, however, which concerns me &mdash; when the accounting systems have changed but the economy has not.  At some point national bank notes must be withdrawn and replaced with euros in all cash registers, wallets and purses.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the EMU unit in AIB, a competent group headed by Ms Caitriona Murphy with support from Mr. John Begson, which has put much work into this area in the last two years.  They told me that certain things have not yet been fixed, one of which is the date of 1 July 2002 which may be brought forward.  The present suggestion is that the final transition will be phased in over six months, from 1 January to 1 July of that year.  This has not been properly thought out and it will lead to unnecessary costs and, perhaps, to total chaos.</P>
    <P>The only experience available in this area is the switch to decimalisation on 15 February 1971, mentioned by Senator Finneran.  Every country which made that switch in this century did it overnight &mdash; the &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; approach.  One day one uses the old money, the next day one uses the new.  When we introduced decimalisation this aspect was carefully investigated.  We were warned of the dangers of a long transition and wisely heeded that advice.  That involved only two countries, Britain and Ireland.  However, the same applies to this changeover and we should use that experience.  On the assumption that the British do not join from the start, Ireland is the only European country with any experience of making such a change.  The other member states and the bureaucrats in Brussels do not have that experience and we should share our experience with our partners in the single currency area.</P>
    <P>It would result in nothing short of chaos if everyone who handles cash &mdash; including banks, shops, bus drivers and the public &mdash; has to cope with two currencies side by side for up to six months.  That would place a particular burden on small businesses like shops; it would double their work and give rise to endless confusion.  In case anyone thinks I am pushing a sectional interest because of my job, it is not only retailers and people on the money chain who will be affected, but everyone.  It will create havoc for the public for that six month period, which will feel like an eternity.  The final transition will not be gradual anyway, because most people will not make the final changeover until they have to, in other words, at the last minute.  This will be particularly true of older people &mdash; a slow transition will be particularly difficult for them.</P>
    <P>We are the only people who have experience of something like this but we have not made this case; we have nodded our heads to the bureaucrats in Brussels and have accepted something similar to the introduction of metrication.  I am 166 centimetres tall, which makes me much taller <Col N="348" /> than under the old measurements.  Years ago I promised to metricate myself.  Other people may still use imperial measurements but I believe in making a change on a single day rather than doing as we did with metrication.  I urge the Government to tell Brussels to do as we did with decimalisation and make the change on one day.</P>
    <P>If I am right about this and people postpone the changeover until the last minute, the high cost of the extended transmission, which will put a considerable strain on the economy, will be totally wasted because nothing will happen in that six months until the last day, so we might as well do it in one day.  I hope the Government takes a lead on this in Europe.  It is a real issue but it has been virtually ignored so far.  People have assumed that Brussels knows best about this highly practical matter but that assumption is false.  Ireland would do Europe a favour by exposing that falsity.</P>
    <P>There are other European wide costs which can be mitigated if we develop the right strategy in time.  The decimalisation experience provides us with a hint of some of these dangers.  There was a belief that decimalisation had an inflationary effect because prices tended to be rounded up rather than down.  Senator Finneran referred to that earlier.  If that had been foreseen it could have been watched very carefully; perhaps, it could have been legislated against to some extent.</P>
    <P>The change to EMU will be accompanied by a period of turbulence as regards prices.  We should be aware of this and make plans to smooth that turbulence as much as possible.</P>
    <P>However, there will also be costs specific to Ireland.  They arise from the highly likely situation that when we will join EMU Britain will stay out.  We have no plans for the worst case scenario. I warn against taking the latest crop of rumours too seriously.  This is no time for wishful thinking. The fact is that the British are involved in window dressing as they prepare for their presidency of the EU in the first six months of next year, when the big decisions on the euro must be taken.  I would not take the present rumours any more seriously than that.  We must plan for the worst case scenario, and if it does not happen we will not have lost anything.</P>
    <P>The worst case scenario is that we are locked into one currency while conducting about one third of our trade with a partner that has a different currency, one which is likely to fluctuate quite widely in both directions at very short notice because it will be free.  With a single currency, the Irish economy will be forced to ride two horses at the one time.  That will be a very costly experience and some businesses will go to the wall in the adjustment process, as was the case when we joined the EEC in 1973 when the realities of completely free trade began to bite.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we are facing up to this new reality, rather we are almost trying to sweep it under the carpet.  By doing that, we risk more costs and pain than we need to.  If we face reality now, we can plan for the change and, with a proactive <Col N="349" /> strategy, reduce its impact.  I urge the Government to take this realistic stance.  I do not underestimate the difficulties of so doing because the reluctance to face up to the realities of EMU is mirrored by a similar lack of reality in other matters.  For example, we do not want to accept that the Celtic tiger has a price tag attached.</P>
    <P>As Senator Taylor-Quinn said, we are the fastest growing economy in the developed world. Our standard of living is rapidly approaching the EU average.  Within the foreseeable future, it will have passed out that of Britain, and in many respects it has already done so.  We pat ourselves on the back, as we are very good at doing, and squabble over who will get a tax dividend from buoyant Government revenues while still expecting Brussels to continue to help us over the stile, as it has done in the past.</P>
    <P>The reality is that we will be at the back of the queue in the next round of Structural Funds.  The gravy train is over for us.  I am pleased that is the case, in that the reason behind it is our income will soon be above the EU average.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy will also have to be drastically reformed before the EU can expand.  That is not that far away but such reform will be at the expense of countries like Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another reality is that, for all the huffing and puffing, duty free sales within the EU constitute a ridiculous anomaly.  Ireland no longer has any special case to press for preserving them, although when one comes through Dublin Airport one can see how strongly that case is being made.  It is impossible that it will be accepted there should be duty free sales in certain parts of an internal market but not in others.</P>
    <P>The EU will also not easily tolerate a situation in the long term in which one prosperous country has a corporation tax rate three times lower than the European norm.  We should, of course, make a very strong case to protect our interests in that regard but it will not be easily done.</P>
    <P>Those are four of the realities we will have to face sooner or later.  They can be summed up in this way &mdash; tigers cannot hold begging bowls.  The sooner that message sinks in and we begin to apply our energies and imagination to coping with the new reality, the less costly and painful the transition will prove to be.  We can start now by being more realistic about EMU.</P>
    <P>I do not think we, as a nation, are prepared for EMU.  AIB and others have held many seminars, which have tended to concentrate on the competitive issues of what EMU will mean for business. They pay great attention to the worthwhile point that EMU will create transparency in price differences.  Every business has to ask itself whether EMU will be an advantage or disadvantage for it and whether it can survive in that new world.  Only after they have answered those strategic long-term questions should they ask about the operational questions.  I am told that is one of the big concerns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> I am also told, although I do not have evidence for this and will have to rely on those I asked, that the Central Bank is not as far advanced as it should be, not so much in its preparation but in drawing the nation's attention to what has to take place.  It was interesting to hear from the Minister today that he seems to be happy with it, but is he sure his euro changeover team is actually achieving what it has to?  It may be in terms of the preparation, but is it selling the attitude and changes which must take place?</P>
    <P>For example, is the national information programme, to which the Minister referred, far enough advanced?  I congratulate Forfás which produced 25,000 copies of the information pack. However, while the leaflets are very good, I am not sure they are being read.  There is a need to sell this concern to the nation, and this debate is one small part of that.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a number of concerns. I want to place competitiveness at the top of his list.  With EMU we will lose control of our exchange rate.  As a result, we will also lose control of our interest rate, which is 6.5 per cent at the moment, double the DM rate of 3.25 per cent.</P>

      <P>I wish I was.  The Minister will have to take that into account, which is why the question of tax must arise.</P>
      <P>I am one of the few Members who do not automatically seek a reduction when talking about tax.  However, the Minister expressed his concern about inflation and the danger of stimulating domestic demand.  I would like him to express concern about stimulating labour supply.  Many Irish companies are having great difficulty in finding workers with the right skills.  Part of the reason we cannot coax our best young graduates and others to stay in Ireland or coax emigrants back, is our unattractive tax rate.  The Minister must take those concerns into account.  The <i>Financial Times</i> today reports the chief executive of Rolls Royce, Mr. Rose, stating that under the single currency, different tax rates which give advantage to one section over another cannot be permitted. In view of this the Minister will have to fight hard to achieve his targets because the voices of protest will become louder when people are threatened by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The euro is a racing certainty.  Germany is the key to the project and Italy will be included.  It is due to commence in approximately 424 days time. Like Senator Dardis, I attended Newbridge College. We had a great rugby trainer, Fr. Hegarty, who one day referred to the attacking team and the defending team.  I asked what he meant by the &ldquo;attacking team&rdquo;.  Did it mean the end of the field where the ball was located?  He said that the attacking team was the team in possession of the ball even if it was on one's back line.  I never forgot that.  No matter how small we are in the EU, <Col N="351" /> to get these steps right and grasp the opportunities afforded by the euro will be similar to grasping a rugby football.  If we can do that we can win in the next couple of years provided we play the game right.  Irrespective of whether we are in the back or the front line, the important thing is to be in possession of the ball.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded to the Minister to share his views with the House on this issue.  I also welcome the steps he is taking and I encourage him to take account of the concerns expressed by others here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Jacob to the House and congratulate him on his appointment as Minister of State.  I am sure he will have a successful term of office.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn and I approach this matter from the same perspective and I broadly agree with most of his remarks.  Perhaps it is because we both attended the same <i>alma mater.</i></P>
      <P>We must operate on the assumption that we are participating in EMU on schedule and that it will take place according to the timetable.  If the single currency is to have credibility it is important that the timetable set by the EU Commission and the Council of Ministers is maintained. I will return to the issue of credibility, which is central to the project.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn was right to point out that the Progressive Democrats had reservations.  My party continues to hold them about certain aspects of EMU.  Our principal reservation centres on participation by the UK and is based on the level and importance of the trade between the two islands.  There would have to be concern if the UK stayed out of the system and we joined and the UK then exercised its capacity to engage in unilateral devaluation which would put us at a serious competitive disadvantage.</P>
      <P>EMU is a logical conclusion to the single market, although the project began to be formulated before the single market was established.  The Maastricht Treaty and the creation of a European Central Bank are part of that package and the so-called &ldquo;train&rdquo; to which Euro jargon refers.  The train is on the tracks and it is important for us to keep it heading in the right direction, although I am intrigued to know how it can be changed around.</P>
      <P>We must welcome the economic growth which has taken place in this country.  It has been underlined by the reports of the ESRI and, most recently, by the positive report from the EU Commission.  It is a tribute to successive Governments that we have maintained such a prudent management of the economy, including finances and fiscal policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was probably to our advantage that the parameters set out in the convergence criteria in the Maastricht Treaty were imposed on us because it kept us within certain confines and required us to adhere to economic disciplines despite the temptations offered by economic growth.  While we <Col N="352" /> always had the capacity to ignore those parameters and self destruct, we have thankfully not done so.  This has been hugely beneficial to us because it is unquestionable that without economic convergence between the EU member states it would be much more difficult to create economic and monetary union and the single currency. The timetable is predicated on that convergence.</P>
    <P>The benefits that can accrue from EMU are self evident and have been explained in various reports.  Overall, it would appear that they are long term while the difficulties are short term.  As we progress into EMU the benefits will become clearer.</P>
    <P>It is important that we enter on the first wave. There is the potential difficulty that we will create a two speed or even a three speed Europe which would make the exercise difficult.  This is why convergence is important.  In this context, enlargement is a factor.  The accession of the central and eastern European countries will create difficulties for the system and put pressures on the budget.  It is argued that, given growth in the European budget, it will be possible to fund enlargement.  That is questionable.  An increase in the budget may be required, but enlargement will be difficult in terms of EMU.</P>
    <P>The advantages of a stable currency are self evident.  Senator Finneran referred to the difficulties in agriculture.  A single currency will significantly ease some of the difficulties which have taken place in terms of exports, including agricultural products.  Much of the political argument between the Government and the farming organisations frequently occurs around the matter of compensation for devaluations or changes in the green currency.  If the currency is locked to the ecu and finally the euro this difficulty will be removed.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that will change is typified by those who travel throughout Europe &mdash; the Acting Chairman is still fortunate enough to tour Europe at her leisure and exchange her currency at every frontier &mdash; and return to Ireland with approximately one third of the money with which they commenced their journey, not having spent any of it except on exchange.  The euro will benefit them.  Interest rates will be forced downwards and this will help to sustain economic growth, which is to be welcomed.  Senator Quinn referred to information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support a point made by Senator Quinn relating to the engagement of the citizen in the process.  I accept the Department of Finance and the financial institutions have been active in the lead up to the single currency and I noted what the Minister said about the various structures which have been put in place to prepare us.  However, the Minister did not refer to the role of the citizen and small business.  There was a notable absence of public debate on Maastricht and other aspects of European Union, which is one of the reasons this debate today is desirable.  EMU is one of the most important things to happen fiscally for many years, certainly since decimalisation.  It is important that citizens are aware of what is involved.</P>
      <P>One negative associated with preparation for the single currency was also evident during decimalisation. The single currency creates an opportunity for retailers to increase prices during the transition period.  In other words, they could avail of the confusion in relation to exchange rates to make hay.  A consequence of that would be an increase in the level of inflation.  If retail prices increased as a result of just the technical aspects of entering the exchange rate, there would be a negative effect on inflation which would be undesirable.  Reference was made to the possibility of overheating the economy in the present circumstances and the Minister's fears in that regard were quoted in this morning's newspapers. This is one aspect of EMU of which we should be aware.</P>
      <P>Citizens need to be engaged in this process and the media has some responsibility in this regard. They are only waking up to some of these issues as we move closer to the event and when most decisions have been made and the debate, in many respects, is virtually over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their preparations for entry into the single currency, the financial institutions, the ESRI and others have looked at the effects on various sizes of business.  We must concede there will be significant compliance costs for some people.  There will be implications even for the simple cash register.  Implications for banking machines and <Col N="354" /> toll bridge machines also come into play as does the question of accounting and book-keeping for small companies.  There will be costs associated with EMU.  The banks, in their analysis of some of these situations, have shown there are more minuses than pluses for certain sections.  Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and the other major financial institutions have prepared valuable documents on EMU.  We must be aware of the impact on small businesses, for example, the corner shop.  Much preparation and detail has gone into aspects of Departments.  The Minister said payments would be made by and to Departments. I am concerned about the degree of advice and information available to smaller countries.</P>
    <P>A critical issue is the rate at which we enter. Obviously, it would be imprudent to state a rate which would restrict the Government's positioning leading up to entering.  However, it would be reasonable to suggest that the currency should be somewhere at its mid-rate on entry.  Recently, it has been very much at the top of the band which would have implications for us but perhaps not as significant as might be perceived at first because of the strength of the economy.  Perhaps we may take whatever little jolt might be associated with that.  However, it comes back to the point that once the rate is fixed we will not have to worry about currency fluctuations.  Exporters will not have to worry about the rate moving against them in the period between the quotation and the delivery of goods to an export market. From a competitiveness viewpoint, this is desirable.</P>
    <P>Turning to the United Kingdom and its approach, there has been a detectable shift in the attitude of the UK Government which has been even more noticeable since the Labour Party came into power.  It was the perception of the former Tory Government that the UK would stay out.  It is not certain what the UK will do, but the chances of it joining, though not at the start, are better than they were several months ago.  I agree with the Minister that the clear priority for Ireland is to ensure, whatever happens, we qualify for EMU.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of what we would do in the absence of EMU.  The point was made that a continuation of the <i>status quo</i> is not an option and that there must be a degree of common currency or, at the very least, a structure whereby the currencies are linked.  Deputy Quinn, as Minister, said there had been benefits to us in terms of our fiscal and economic policy by abiding by the Maastricht criteria.  The Minister spoke about the debt-GDP ratio, the exchange rate, interest rate and the deficit and the fact that we qualify. At the start, we were well outside the parameters in respect of the debt-GDP ratio but the trend has been in the right direction, more significantly than might have been expected at the outset of the process when we were well outside of what was required.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the ESRI and the net benefits which will accrue.  It was suggested that <Col N="355" /> this would be the case even if the United Kingdom remained outside, although I contest that to some extent.  I would be interested to know if the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. This brings us back to the level of trade and the degree to which we are dependent on the UK as a trade partner.</P>
    <P>Another reservation I have relates to the creation of the European Central Bank.  The system of central banks is fine but we are ceding part of our sovereignty to the European Central Bank. Sacrifices will obviously have to be made in sovereignty, and we have made several such sacrifices since joining the then Common Market. Those sacrifices have brought more benefits than disadvantages.  However, the degree to which the European Central Bank could dictate our fiscal and economic policy is worrying.  If the Bundes-bank makes a statement it can have a very serious negative effect on, for example, exchange rates. If we are locked into an exchange rate that would not arise, but questions arise on the issue of centralised influence.  Senator Quinn raised the issue of the degree to which Brussels assumes it is right. If the European Union stands for anything, it should stand for flexibility, which it frequently proclaims it does.  There will have to be a flexible approach to the European Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Enlargement, Structural Funds and Agenda 2000 are issues that lead us away from the central subject of this debate, but they are nevertheless related to it.  I disagree with Senator Quinn's assertion that the gravy train has stopped.  It is wrong to describe these funds as a gravy train, but if it is a train, it has not come to a stop but is slowing down; it will slow down increasingly as Agenda 2000 is adopted, but it will not stop. Under GDP criteria, we will not qualify for Objective 1 status, which would entitle us to maximum accrual of EU funds.  There would also be very advantageous co-funding arrangements in that status.  However, there is now discussion of Objective 1 in transition, which leads to the suspicion that we will have to argue that the infrastructural and general economic benefits have been such as to warrant continued transfer of funds from Europe to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong, however, to overstate the degree to which our economic boom has been contingent upon those European funds.  Most analyses suggests that perhaps 1 or 1.5 per cent of the 6 per cent growth rate accrues from the transfer of Structural and Cohesion Funds.  Our management of the economy has been very good, and it has not just been the contribution of Structural Funds that has caused growth in Ireland. Those funds have helped, but not to the extent that some EU enthusiasts believe.</P>
    <P>Exchange rate management will be very important leading to entry.  I am content to leave it to the Minister and his officials to form a coherent strategy to get us to enter at a desirable rate.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran made an important point when he raised the question of changes in the <Col N="356" /> Common Agricultural Policy, a matter to which Agenda 2000 is related.  That may be more significant to Irish agriculture and the economy generally than EMU.  While it is desirable to remove those exchange rate fluctuations which have caused problems for exporters of beef and other food products, the changes in the CAP will be very significant for the individual farmer.  There will be other significant changes because of European enlargement.  One of the biggest battles we will have to wage in the next five years will relate to protection of the CAP and farm incomes.  That will dominate our approach to the World Trade Organisation talks, as it will be difficult to ensure that our interests are served.  Trade liberalisation is a very attractive idea as it presents a package of removing trade barriers to create a world economy. I profess myself a liberal, and that doctrine is very attractive to a liberal.  However, it has as much to do with American dominance of world trade as any other factor.  American manufacturing and agriculture are so competitive as to give that country an edge in circumstances where trade barriers are removed.</P>
    <P>Mechanisms will have to be put in place to ensure that retail customers are not exploited.  It is an issue that will have to be examined, though I am content with the public sector's approach to EMU.</P>
    <P>The competitiveness of the Irish economy has been mentioned in this debate, and EMU will improve that competitiveness.  It is sometimes suggested that we are relatively uncompetitive from a labour viewpoint in comparison with economies such as Taiwan in the Far East.  Their labour costs are much lower than ours, but a senior American industrialist I met suggested that Ireland is extremely competitive.  His view was that while our labour costs on the unit cost of production were high relative to the Far East, our educated and productive workforce meant that the labour factor in the unit cost of production was less here in certain circumstances than in the Far East.  That applies particularly to hi-tech industries such as Intel and Hewlett Packard, which we are fortunate to have in Kildare.</P>
    <P>It is important that this process be seamless, from entry to the locking of rates and then to production of notes and coins.  That is where difficulties may lie in establishing the ideas of the single currency and economic and monetary union. Hiccups may occur, and it is critical to meet targets on time so that there is international confidence in European determination to meet those targets.  Several leading experts in this field have made this point, and it was emphasised at a Philip Morris Institute conference on Europe's global currency in Rome last year.</P>
    <P>Regarding the euro, we will create a critical mass in currency by balancing the dollar and, to a lesser extent, the yen.  However, experts will probably suggest that the dollar will be the dominant currency and that there is a danger that the euro will become a regional currency.  A co-operative relationship between the yen, dollar and <Col N="357" /> euro rather than a contest has been suggested as a remedy to that.  We would then be in the fiscal equivalent of the World Trade Organisation.</P>
    <P>We must stick to the timetable so that the system has credibility.  It has long been the case that Ireland is committed to entry.  There is a <i>caveat</i> about the UK, but that is no longer as serious as it was.  One hopes that the positive forecasts of the long-term benefits to the Irish economy are correct and that the growth we have experienced will continue into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome this debate on economic and monetary union.  We always complain that there is not enough debating of European matters in this House, the other House or by the public at large.  We have been preparing for the internal market since 1990 and we are coming to the end of the century; there was almost a decade of preparation for its initial implementation in 1999 and its final implementation in 2002.  Nevertheless there is very little knowledge abroad of EMU and its implications for the country.  From that point of view this debate is welcome.</P>
      <P>Of all the countries in the European Union, EMU will have more implications for and a greater impact on Ireland as it is on the perimeter of Britain, which would qualify for entry but has expressed reluctance to enter initially.  An enormous amount of our exports go to Britain.  A third of our economic activity is related to that country so clearly we will have to analyse carefully the implications of the single market, what bearing it would have if we enter in 1999 and how it will affect us.</P>
      <P>From that point of view I am disappointed with the Minister's contribution.  He has focused entirely on the narrow fiscal elements of the Union.  Remember, this is not simply monetary union, it is economic and monetary union.  There are many elements to be discussed besides the rigid criteria for entry and whether we conform to the convergence criteria.  These matters concern small businesses about which Senator Quinn spoke, farming organisations about which Senator Finneran spoke, the labour market, long-term unemployment and youth unemployment, problems which, ironically, the rest of the European Union is experiencing to a greater degree than Ireland.  We are fortunate that we are looking at entry to EMU at the end of the 1990s as opposed to the end of the 1980s.  There would have been riots on the streets if we had contemplated the full implementation of this ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are fortunate that we have been beneficiaries of a booming economy for the entire 1990s. Remember the developments of the other countries have been quite modest.  They are, in many cases, experiencing increased unemployment. Germany, which has always been the great engineroom of the European Union, is experiencing considerable difficulties in this area.  A country that would be expected to be at the forefront <Col N="358" /> of the convergence criteria is now facing difficulties. A couple of years ago Germany said that Ireland was unlikely to enter the first tier, that there would be two separate tiers of entry.  Now Ireland will be in the first line of entry by all accounts.</P>
    <P>France is likewise experiencing considerable difficulties in terms of employment.  There are problems with the Italian economy.  There are other economies such as Britain, Denmark and Sweden, which are voluntarily opting to remain outside initially.  We are fortunate that we can speak from a position of strength in relation to the European Union.</P>
    <P>We are discussing a <i>fait accompli.</i>  All the major political parties have indicated their support for entry to EMU at the earliest opportunity. Undoubtedly that will happen in May of next year when the decision will be made who fulfils the criteria for entry.  We will be there.  It is unlikely that the economy will suffer an earthquake between now and May.  It suits us to be able to present a rosy picture of criteria that have been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The question remains whether the benefits of entry exceed the problems it will cause.  There are many people at the coalface of economic activity in this country, the Small Businesses Association for example or those organising labour, who have reservations about what is going to happen.  Are we going to experience a setback in unemployment figures for the first time in a considerable period.  The ESRI report indicates approximately 28,000 jobs will be lost initially.  That is a substantial number in one fell swoop.  Last year in excess of 50,000 new jobs were created.  We are talking about the loss of 50 per cent of jobs created annually. We have had a tremendous job creation record over the last four or five years &mdash; in excess of 200,000 jobs.  Nevertheless, many industries have not benefited from the transfer of European funds, particularly in the small business sector. Small industries could find themselves in difficulty because of the greater competition the single market will create.  Many people in the labour market where remuneration is not high could find their employment at risk.  These are extremely important factors.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows the implications of Britain not joining.  Thankfully the new Labour Government in Britain has indicated a greater degree of flexibility compared to the Conservative Government. Mr. Major, the previous Prime Minister, was hidebound by the Euro sceptics.  At least the new Labour Government has indicated it will not enter in 1999 but will leave the option open for entry at a future date.  That is an important step forward and gives us a glimmer of light.  A third of our products are exported to Britain and another 10 per cent to the United States and if we include Japan and other countries we export in excess of 50 per cent of our products.  France, Germany, Italy, Denmark and other member states have land borders and their natural markets are across these borders but we are an island <Col N="359" /> and we must transport our goods by plane and sea.  As a result our markets are more diffuse than those in Europe.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of economic and monetary union.  Stage one began in 1990 and we have been preparing for the single market since that time. As I understand it, we will be better off inside the single market than we would be outside.  We must be cognisant of the difficulties this will present and ensure we identify such difficulties and prepare for them.</P>
    <P>The concept of a union of European states is excellent.  In the aftermath of World War ll, when the coal and steel pact was agreed between the Benelux countries, an attempt was made to move the most competitive countries in the European market away from strict competition towards co-ordination of economic activity.  Since 1973 the Common Market has been a major boon to Irish people, particularly farmers who have benefited enormously from the Common Agricultural Policy. Farmers have been fortunate that the Common Market provided an alternative to the British market where beef and agricultural produce prices were always determined by the policy to provide cheap food for the UK's large working population.  Ireland proved to be an easily accessible source in this regard but we were dependent on British market forces and prices.  Thankfully, however, our farmers have prospered.</P>
    <P>Political candidates canvassing for votes throughout Ireland at present can see the signs of prosperity, namely, new housing developments and improvements to the appearance of many towns and villages.  Membership of the European Union has been very beneficial in this respect. Ironically, it may prove difficult for farmers to adapt to the EU in the future with the end of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Farmers are already complaining about the difficulties they are experiencing in respect of the amount of funds being transferred.  The extension of the European Union to countries on the Eastern bloc fringe, including Poland and Romania, with mainly agricultural economies &mdash; Russia has also indicated an interest in joining &mdash; will result in the greatest threat to the transfer of funds.  I do not doubt that farmers, who are not slow in coming forward, will have something to say when this comes to pass.</P>
    <P>Ireland has benefited enormously from the transfer of funds to other areas.  If one travels through the country one will witness the major changes that have occurred during the past 20 years as a result of European funding, which has fuelled developments in our infrastructure &mdash; roads, bridges and bypasses &mdash; and improved transport facilities.  There are proposals to put in place the light rail system, LUAS, which will hopefully proceed before the funding is taken away, and a tunnel from Whitehall to Dublin port to relieve congestion.</P>
    <P>In the environmental context, funding has been provided to provide tertiary and secondary treatment <Col N="360" /> in respect of sewage and improve waste disposal methods.  These are welcome developments and they have had an environmental and social impact.  In terms of education and training for young people, FÁS programmes, community employment schemes, VTOS, third level education and post-second level skills training have benefited considerably through ESF funding, etc.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, these developments have contributed to the transformation of Ireland during our lifetime.  The majority of Members will remember the difficulties of living in Ireland in the early 1960s.  One can only imagine what it must have been like to live in the period between the 1920s and the 1950s, when emigration was at its height.  Following the oil crisis in 1973, the numbers emigrating rose again and this continued until the 1980s.</P>
    <P>We must focus on the downside of EMU. Employment has not been dealt with in a coherent fashion on a European level.  There are no effective policies in place to deal with long-term unemployment, which is one of the great cancers of modern society.  The Celtic tiger may be roaring, but that roar is insignificant in many of the ghetto areas located in Ballyfermot, the north inner city, Ballymun and Blanchardstown, which are situated in my constituency.  Uniform development has not taken place.  While our criteria, in terms of figures and percentages, have been excellent in their theoretical framework, an adequate effort has not been made to focus attention on unemployment blackspots and large areas affected by the problems of drug abuse and crime.  This has created poverty and prevented the social inclusion of a common economic social and monetary market where cohesion would be based on a broad humanitarian and egalitarian model, and where people could have the freedom to control their lives.</P>
    <P>People have no freedom to control their lives if they are dependent on the State from birth until death &mdash; particularly if everything they possess, such as their houses and money, are given to them by the State &mdash; and have no prospect of gaining employment.  The ghettos must be eliminated. I am not satisfied with European action in this regard.  One could state that part of the problem lies with our failure as a nation to target resources and funding from the EU into these areas to ensure that the level of social cohesion we expect from a united Europe would be put in place.</P>
    <P>Another downside of EMU is the prospect of further unemployment being created in the short term.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this but the general conclusion of the ESRI report is that we will experience initial difficulties in respect of unemployment.  To look at the long-term picture, which is similar to gazing into a crystal ball because our vision is limited, we must consider whether Britain will join EMU and the effect its decision in that regard will have on our trade with that country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> The businesses which trade with Britain are, by and large, small indigenous concerns.  The multinationals operate on a global level and their markets are more diffuse as a result.  Because of limited resources, research and development opportunities and capital, small businesses are likely to opt for the nearest large market, namely, Britain, to which it is cheap to export.  For this reason, I am concerned that many small businesses could go to the wall in the short term unless we put in place support measures to lessen the impact of EMU.  Funds should be made available from the European Investment Bank for such supports.  We should argue the case in Europe that we have a unique problem in terms of our economic relationship with Britain and that nothing should be allowed to destabilise the present success of our economy, which is a model for development for the EU and for applicant states.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have raised the duty free issue.  Senator Quinn spoke disparagingly about the notion that the Commission would allow a continuation of the duty free status at our airports and ferry ports.  I take a different view.  In theory he is right that in an internal market there should be no perks in any one area.  However, I would view the matter in terms of Ireland having introduced the principle of duty free status, in Shannon originally and then in the other air and sea ports.</P>
    <P>The concept has great capacity to generate employment; indeed, it is estimated that over 140,000 people in Europe are employed in the duty free business and its removal would have a major impact.  Duty free sales in Europe increased from £2.7 billion in 1991 to £4.2 billion in 1996.  Ending duty free status would impact on employment and on travel and airport costs.  It is a concept which helps people to enjoy travelling and encourages them to do so because they have an opportunity to obtain goods at a reduced cost.</P>
    <P>The trade unions and the business community are in favour of its retention.  It would not undermine the internal market.  It is a valuable incentive but one which does not distort economies. With that in mind we should adopt a sympathetic approach to its retention.  My main concern with EMU is the expectation of an initial growth in unemployment in virtually all the member states, although in the long term the benefits outweigh the costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance should indicate his support for retaining duty free status.  As Minister for Finance in 1991, the Taoiseach agreed to its abolition.  The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has enthusiastically supported its retention at EU level.  I do not know the Government's policy on the matter at present but if it is in favour of duty free status it should campaign in favour of it.  After all, Ireland created the concept of duty free.  To counteract the possible restrictions in Europe Aer Rianta has sought new duty free markets in Russia, Pakistan, India and elsewhere with a measure of success.  However, while that has been happening in other countries <Col N="362" /> it seems to be a contradiction that the EU should abolish duty free within its market area.  That is one area I should like the Minister to address sympathetically.</P>
    <P>The impact of EMU needs careful analysis because it is important not to destabilise our economy.  EMU will bring substantial benefits. For example, our interest rates may be halved from their present low level and this must be of long-term benefit to the economy.  People will be able to travel anywhere in the EMU area without the cost and inconvenience of changing currency, which will make tourism easier and cheaper.</P>
    <P>The economic disciplines of EMU have been of benefit to date and will continue to be of benefit in the future.  We have had to keep the national finances in strict control which has meant that the large public debts are a thing of the past.  When we began to prepare for EMU our debt to GDP ratio was about 130 per cent and that has been reduced to about 74 per cent; it is reducing at about 8 per cent a year bringing us almost to the convergence criterion of 60 per cent.  That is an indication of the beneficial effects of the disciplines of EMU.</P>
    <P>This debate on EMU is timely.  EMU will have a considerable impact in the next few years and continuous assessment and monitoring of developments will be important, particularly to gauge the reactions of neighbouring countries and changes in the political climate, and to consider how best we can use capital supports to assist the sectors of the economy which will be affected in the initial stages.</P>

      <P>Before offering some of my thoughts on the subject being discussed, I wish to express the sense of pride and honour I feel in addressing Seanad Éireann for the very first time.  It is a privilege given to few people and I am conscious of the obligations and responsibilities it imposes. The sense of tradition that pervades this Chamber generates feelings that are both uplifting and humbling.  I am all too aware that many great people have stood here in the past, and still do, and in a variety of ways they have helped to influence and shape the destiny of Ireland and its society.  I hope that, in some small way, I will be able to live up to the ideals they gave voice to in this House and that my voice will be listened to as the voice of the people I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we approach the historic moment when we will enter economic and monetary union, we might do well to reflect on an old saying: &ldquo;if money is not your servant, it will be your master&rdquo;. This is a very wise and appropriate thought at this juncture of modern European affairs. Money must not be allowed to control us, we must control money.  I suppose I am talking about money in the new shape and form in which it will manifest itself, which will be very strange and unfamiliar to us all.  It will take a lot of getting used to.  In just about 15 months' time, the process of introducing the single currency into <Col N="363" /> Ireland and the other EU countries that meet the convergence criteria, will begin.  There is no doubt that Ireland will meet these stringent criteria. Indeed we have already done so thanks to that opulently virile creature that now bestrides our economy, the Celtic tiger.  Perhaps a more appropriate image would be that of a benign but powerful Irish wolfhound streaking ahead of the pack.  However, we are doing very well and can no longer be looked on as a backward country with an unpromising future.  Our economy is setting a shining example for the rest of Europe, and we can be forgiven if we unashamedly revel in that fact.  We can take pride in the fact that at this moment it looks as though Ireland, in terms of economic health, will be leading the countries entering EMU.  This was reiterated this morning by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>In this regard I sound a note of caution. Despite being in the full flush of economic health, Ireland has some way to go before reaching the level of development of the more prosperous regions of the European Union, as pointed out recently by the Minister for Finance.  Even after entering EMU, we will still need significant levels of structural and cohesion funding, especially in regions such as the west of Ireland where we have yet to benefit fully and equitably from EU funding already received.  We must continue to attract high levels of investment, not only to complete the developments under way but to wrestle with the new challenges thrown up by our economic resurgence.  Our new found prosperity must be secured, sustained and made permanent.  This means that investment must continue.  The European Commission must bear in mind that the various incentives Ireland and other member states have put in place to attract investment are of benefit not just to one country but to the whole European Union.  Did we ever believe that employers in Ireland would be recruiting people in Europe and the UK to fill job vacancies here? There has been a marked globalisation of industrial activity in recent times and a fierce intensification of competition among all countries. Because of these altered circumstances, if outside investment is not drawn to Europe it will go to other parts of the world and the European community will be the loser.</P>
    <P>The coming of the new currency will necessitate a complete change in our monetary mind-set. By the year 2002 the punt, which so many people have spent a lifetime struggling for, will sadly have gone from our purse and our pockets and will already be disappearing into the mists of nostalgia. We will be hiding the £1 coins under the mattresses and bringing them out to show to our grandchildren in the future.  The punt will be replaced by the euro, a denomination that has not a very inspiring sound to it but will become the hard cash currency of day-to-day living.  By July 2002, the punt and the national currencies of all the countries participating in EMU will completely changeover to the euro.  That does not <Col N="364" /> mean there will be a risk of anyone being stuck with their old notes and coins because they can continue to change them for the euro, free of charge, in banks and building societies.  The changeover may come as something of a shock to the system.  That is fair to say when we look around at people shopping and doing business. They have not realised that a time of change is ahead of us and we will soon have to confront it. We should not be fearful of what is ahead.  Many thought the change to the decimal system in the seventies would cause something close to chaos, but as we know it went very smoothly.  I have only vague memories of it.</P>
    <P>The change to the euro currency will have implications for everybody &mdash; businesses large and small, workers, housewives, students, the unemployed and for Government.  We should take a very positive stance in looking ahead to the transformation that will take place.  Of course there will be difficulties, but I believe they will be outweighed by the benefits that will accrue to Ireland in the fullness of time.  Above all, we should bear in mind that we, being the resourceful and imaginative people we are, will be well able to adapt to the new order of things provided we prepare carefully and meticulously for the changeover.</P>
    <P>It is important that we concentrate on the benefits to this country from being a participant in EMU.  Unlike our nearest neighbour, we should not be nervous about becoming a more integral part of Europe.  It is a matter of regret that the UK seems to have forgotten the injunction of one of its greatest statesmen, Gladstone, who, long before the idea of the European Union was mooted, said: &ldquo;We are part of the community of Europe, and we must do our duty as such.&rdquo;  As the Minister said earlier, that is a matter for the British Government.  For our own part, we should never forget that our connection to the Continent stretches back to the time when Irish missionaries kindled the flame of learning and civilisation there.  We are not exactly strangers to Europe and the part we have played in its history is a preeminently honourable one.</P>
    <P>The implications of membership of EMU will be widespread, none more so than in the business sector.  The currency change will impact on existing markets in a way that at present is not entirely predictable.  Looking at it positively, the advent of EMU will no doubt enable many businesses to expand into new markets in the euro sphere.  It is important that Irish business people should seek to identify in advance any opportunities that may arise and plan to take advantage of them.  For instance, they should study their production lines and consider the desirability of diversifying in order to avail of new market opportunities.  The coming of EMU will also mean sharper competition and it is vital that Irish business takes steps to respond to the competitive threats that will arise.</P>
    <P>Large businesses will be able to assign senior managers, or even form special committees, to <Col N="365" /> take responsibility for stimulating and co-ordinating preparations for entry into EMU.  However, small business people will not have any such luxury and, as is so often the case, may well have to figure out the complexity of the changeover on their own.  We should keep small business people in our mind at this time, and I call on the Minister to do so.  They are always under pressure of which many people are unaware.  They do the marketing, management, selling and the financial work of a business.  We should never forget their significant contribution to the life and economy of the country.  If we look at the make-up of businesses, it is true to say that small businesses make a very significant contribution to the wellbeing of the country and to employment.  Often companies are owned and managed by one person who must be a very resourceful and versatile individual to survive in a sometimes cut-throat marketplace that invariably is beset by official bureaucracy of all kinds emanating from Dublin and Brussels.  In so many cases the success of such firms is due in large measure to a handful of employees who show unstinting commitment and loyalty to their company.</P>
    <P>Small businesses can hardly be blamed for thinking that the EMU represents yet another layer of bureaucracy with which to contend.  It must be shown that this is not the case, and, in fact, bureaucracy may eventually be diminished in the new regime.  Would we not all like to see that happen? Perhaps the Government also will look to the changeover in such a way as to allow bureaucracy and red tape to be reduced.</P>
    <P>As all our forms will have to be redesigned to take cognisance of the change in currency, perhaps it is time to look at the information requested on those forms and ask whether we really need it or do we already have it in a different format.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to imagine the kind of problems that will be encountered in the early days of transition by small cash-based retailers such as newsagents, hardware shops and corner grocers. They will have much juggling to do when handling two sets of notes and coins &mdash; the old pounds and the new euros &mdash; which will be in circulation until the transition period is completed.</P>
    <P>Unlike the big outlets they will not be able to afford separate tills for both currencies so they are in for a difficult period of adjustment until the euro takes over fully.  In the early days, retailers will also need to be aware of the fixed conversion rates and understand that their bankers will accept euro payments in lodgments and that all their dealings, both with bankers and Government agencies, can be in euros.  Paying suppliers may also cause headaches initially, particularly if suppliers have not changed over to working in euros.</P>
    <P>A greater sense of urgency should be shown by the Government and European institutions in alerting small business concerns to the necessity of preparing the groundwork in readiness for the <Col N="366" /> profound changes that will take place.  They must be assisted in every way to make the necessary adjustments to their operations.  That will help to smooth their transition to the new regime.</P>
    <P>All bureaucratic obstacles with which, rightly or wrongly, the EU has become identified, must be swept away so that small businesses in particular can gain easy access to all the information and assistance they require in making the changeover. It is important not to underestimate the effort that is necessary or the urgency with which it should be pursued.</P>
    <P>Some of the issues that have to be confronted are highly complex, not least in the legal area. The legal framework for the EMU was agreed at the EU summit in Dublin late last year.  Businesses would do well to study the implications of the legal provisions, particularly as they affect contracts and the conversion of currency values. This whole area represents a confusing maze to most people, and businesses would be wise to seek professional advice in helping them navigate their way through it.</P>
    <P>The impact of EMU entry will vary greatly over a wide spectrum of interests with each sector encountering its own specific problems.  Sectors such as retail, agriculture, manufacturing, property, import-export, tourism, financial services, information technology and cross-Border trade will be presented with their own unique problems. Each sector should now take steps to make preparations appropriate to its own particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is heartening that help is available to all these interests and others, to advise and guide them as we venture into the new territory of EMU.  The Government has initiated a euro awareness programme providing information on the euro conversion plans of the public and financial sector.  This provides a framework against which other sectors can draw up their strategies more effectively.</P>
    <P>This changeover plan is gradually being extended to other sectors.  The EMU business awareness campaign, launched earlier, has been useful in helping businesses to prepare for transition. It is doing a good job.  A number of banks and other financial institutions are also making information available on the correct approaches to the changeover.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on the good work that has been done to date.  I welcome the Minister's undertaking to conduct an end of year review as well as his commitment to broaden the focus on the information campaign.</P>
    <P>The emerging EMU can be likened in many ways to the United States of America and, indeed, Senator Quinn has already done so.  The USA is a large, brilliantly successful nation made up of many states, each of which still holds on to its own rights and autonomy in many areas.  I am confident that full economic and monetary union will not mean the end of our country's right to determine its own economic policies.  I am convinced that smaller countries like Ireland will <Col N="367" /> have a far greater say in the economies of the larger member states.  After all, each country will have a single vote on decisions affecting monetary policy taken by the European Central Bank. If anyone makes a wrong move, perhaps they will hear the growl of the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>No matter what some British politicians may think, the advantages of a single currency are many.  To take just one such advantage, think of the convenience it will afford travellers and tourists who will no longer have to change money, at a price, when they go from one member state to the next.  Exchange margins and commission fees paid to banks will simply disappear.  Last night I drove from Dublin to Newry, and it was only when I discovered I had no sterling in a Northern shop that I realised I had moved into a different jurisdiction with a different currency.  EMU will make a big difference to us, particularly as we move around Europe.</P>
    <P>A single currency will also take away the uncertainty surrounding the prices at which goods are sold.  The danger of sudden exchange movements wiping out profit margins in a matter of hours will be removed.  We all know the trouble such fluctuations caused the punt some time ago.  The fact that goods and services will be priced in the same currency should strengthen the competitive effect of the single market considerably and this will benefit the Community as a whole.  I will not be surprised if this helps to stimulate growth and employment.</P>
    <P>I hope the euro will find its way into the pockets of those who work hard as well as the pockets of the less well off in ever increasing amounts.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He and I served on the last Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs that examined this subject in some detail.  To that extent we have been through the rounds of the subject before.</P>
      <P>I support the concept of economic and monetary union along with the idea of a single currency and the economies of the EU becoming more integrated.  It is a natural progression of the situation from which we have evolved on the continent of Europe in this age of enlightenment.  It has been the greatest period of enlightenment in terms of giving us peace on this continent.  We pride ourselves as being in the most civilised part of the world, yet this century alone we have had the greatest level of mass slaughter seen on any continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent my holidays this year in Belgium and visited the little town of Ypres where over half a million people were slaughtered between 1914 and 1918 because of the conflict on this continent. We continue to move on from that, however.  The progress of the movement of these positive events is the greater integration of the economies and, <Col N="368" /> indeed, of the politics of the Governments which form what we now call the European Union.  One hopes that in the not too distant future we will be able to take in other countries on the continent with which we have a great deal in common, that is, Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic Republics, and that Norway and Switzerland will join eventually.</P>
    <P>The idea of a monetary union is not new.  I am old enough to remember most of the debates on Ireland's entry into the European Economic Community between 1970 and 1972.  The lengthy Werner report brought forward this idea of a single currency and it was the subject of considerable discussion that preceded Ireland's entry into the Common Market or European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>In 1989 Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission with the greatest vision, brought forward a report which became known as the Delors committee report.  Then the Commission brought forward its report, which was published in 1990, prior to the drafting of the Maastricht Treaty and it was called <i>One market, one money.</i>  Effectively, that found its way into Articles 102a to 109 of the Maastricht Treaty on which this project is based.</P>
    <P>There are three elements to economic and monetary union and I intend to examine each in detail because, while one supports the concept, there are still a few unanswered questions and while some questions have been answered, we wish to raise them again.  First, there is the single currency between the participating states; second, is the single monetary policy implemented by an independent European Central Bank and the European system of central banks and, third, closer co-ordination of economic and monetary policies among the member states &mdash; that is what we call the convergence and perhaps eventual fusion of all the economies in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The criteria for convergence is that the deficit must not exceed 3 per cent of GDP.  If it exceeds the 3 per cent by only a small amount, then this must be for exceptional reasons and the excess must be temporary in nature.  The ratio of Government debt to GDP must be 60 per cent.  If it is more than that, it must be diminishing to 60 per cent at a satisfactory rate.</P>
    <P>Ireland's deficit does not exceed the 3 per cent criterion.  There was much debate on this and I accept that we fulfil that criteria.  However, Ireland still does not meet the criteria relating to the ratio of Government debt to GDP; it still has not been reduced to 60 per cent.  We may argue that we are reducing the ratio at a satisfactory rate, but I want the Minister to deal with this in some detail and say how he sees the ratio of Government debt to GDP on 1 January 1999 or when the final decisions must be made.  That is important.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to comment on the situation in other member states also.  He may say it is not for an Irish Minister for Finance to comment <Col N="369" /> but that is not good enough.  He should be able to express his concerns or make positive remarks about other member states.  They do it about us and we can do it about them.  If we are to have a fully informed debate, it is important that we hear not only what concerns the Irish people but also how other economies will affect us.  I want the Minister to feel free to comment.</P>
    <P>There are requirements to be met in relation to interest rates, the stability of the currency and inflation.  Inflation must not exceed 1.5 per cent of the three best performing member states and average long-term interest rates must not exceed more than 2 per cent of the three best performing member states.  These, I am sure, are good criteria.</P>
    <P>A member state's currency must not have fluctuated by more than the normal fluctuation margins in the last two years and a currency must not have been devalued on the initiative of a member state against the currency of another member state.  There has been hardly a decade since the war in which the British currency in particular or, indeed, Ireland's currency has not devalued voluntarily or involuntarily.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate today about whether Britain will join EMU.  The prevailing mood in Britain is that they will enter on the first day, 1 January 1999 and I think the Blair Government will work toward that.  They are not saying that at present but I believe they will.  We cannot understate the problem for Ireland if Britain stays out and Ireland goes in.  Such a high proportion of Irish trade will still be with the United Kingdom and Ireland's biggest fear would be that the British Government would unilaterally devalue its currency &mdash; what is called predatory devaluation.  That would have a serious effect on Ireland, and it has been the subject of considerable discussion.  There is not a great deal that this Government or any other can do about it.  We can only hope that the British will see the common sense of joining because in the long-term interest of the British economy &mdash; and I feel free to lecture them on this &mdash; it is better that they be a part of this project from the outset than that they stay out.  Fortunately the little Englandism of the Tory Party is not part of policymaking.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point deals with the discipline within an economy, managing deficits, etc.  We must ask how the French are dealing with their current economic problems.  Is it not true that they are running an excessive deficit and that it will continue?  One can be creative with figures, but the Maastricht criteria are clear as to the rules one must obey.  Nevertheless, I am worried about the French and how they must deal with their economy.  Is there the political will in the light of <Col N="370" /> the political configuration of the present French Government to face up to and take the hard economic decisions?  That has to do with running a tight deficit programme.</P>
    <P>It is not clear what will happen in Germany. For generations Germany had the largest and most successful economy in Europe but the knock-on effect of German unification has been a serious economic down turn.  Of course there are indications of recovery but there will always be the temptation to use the old Keynesian principle of spending one's way out of a recession. Excessive spending in recessions has caused problems for many countries.  We suffered them after 1977.  Will the Minister comment on the handling of economic difficulties in France, Germany, Sweden and other member states?  Concerns are being expressed by many economists and there is nothing wrong with the Minister telling us what he, the Government and the Department of Finance think about how these countries are dealing with their excessive deficits.  The Minister may quote Article 104, which provides that a country which does not follow the rules has no come back, but I would not be too sure of that.</P>
    <P>The job of the European system of central banks, or the European Central Bank as it will be known, will be powerful.  We will have a say and will appoint a director like all other member states.  The ECB will operate the single monetary policy and single currency, will maintain price stability and will support, in a general way, the economic policies of the Community with a view to achieving Community objectives &mdash; the promotion of non-inflationary growth with increasing employment, better social protection and social solidarity, and giving citizens a better sense of cohesion and belonging to this ambitious experiment. Many citizens have difficulty understanding this great historical movement and when they do not know enough about it they are inclined not to support it.</P>
    <P>My concern about the European Central Bank is that I am not sure how it will be accountable. The Maastricht Treaty states it will be accountable to the European Parliament but, while not wishing to denigrate that body, it is a rather toothless institution.  Despite the changes brought about under the Maastricht Treaty and the other changes to come, the European Parliament will not be one of the major decision making institutions of the EU.  The new bank will be much more powerful.</P>
    <P>The control of monetary policy is crucial.  If times are hard and money must be squeezed from the system by the European Central Bank, countries on the periphery where the economic structure is weakest will suffer the greatest.  That happens not only in countries but in unions of states such as the USA and India.  Senator Finneran, Senator Ryan and I represent the most peripheral areas of the most peripheral country in the Union and I am not satisfied that an official of the European Central Bank will be held accountable in the sense of reporting to a committee of the <Col N="371" /> Oireachtas.  They will come here and tell us what monetary policy will be.  We will still have domestic budgets, as individual states of the US do, but the monetary policy of the EU will have a major effect on those budgets.  It is important that people elected from all the regions have a voice.</P>
    <P>The directors of the European Central Bank will be unelected and while I value their independence I do not like the level of accountability which will apply to them.  This small nation calls itself peripheral, and has done well as a result in the sense of receiving transfers.  However, those transfers have not helped the more peripheral areas of Ireland but they have had a tremendous effect in the better developed regions.  It is most important that we are satisfied that the European Central Bank is accountable.  It should not only be the director whom we appoint who is or she will have equal status with the directors appointed by Germany and France, countries far larger than ours.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, was present when the director of the Central Bank of Ireland reported on several occasions to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs. The director informed us about what he told the Government on monetary policy.  I hope an official of the ECB will be amenable to such examinations in national parliaments.  Those parliaments will not fade away, despite the lengths to which the Maastricht Treaty goes to establish a federal Europe.  They stand for national sovereignty, and national interests are best expressed in national parliaments.</P>
    <P>On that select committee the Minister of State also expressed interest in the period before the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates.  Will there be speculation against certain currencies in that period?  The day on which the link will take place will be known and speculators may make a predatory attack &mdash; we saw what happened some years ago.  At a meeting of that select committee in this Chamber, the current Minister, Deputy McCreevy, put an interesting question to Mr. John Fitzgerald of the ESRI:</P>
    <P>In the lead-up to that date, what is to stop widespread speculation against certain currencies? We are in for an interesting two-month period, maybe less, in the lead-up, particularly regarding the French franc. The lead-up to this date will be littered with dangers, particularly for a small economy such as Ireland which is not a significant player as far as exchange rates are concerned.  In 1992 and 1993 the bigger currencies such as UK could do little when the markets turned against them.  Even a strong currency like the deutschmark would have difficulty in defending itself from a concerted attack.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald took that point but he had no satisfactory answer to it.  The question remains unanswered and more than a year has elapsed since it was asked.  There may have been developments <Col N="372" /> and perhaps the Minister could address them in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As always, Senator Connor's remarks were a good deal more thoughtful than those of many more politically eminent advocates of EMU.  I am happy to describe myself as a European in a cultural sense and take delight in regarding western and northern Europe as the centre of civilisation, with the United States a poor second.  Europe has been successful in achieving economic growth and using it to do something for its citizens on a large scale and with a degree of compassion which the US has singularly failed to do.  In terms of how the world is to develop in the future, Europe is a far more wholesome model than the US will ever be.</P>
      <P>However, there are still problems in Europe and it is an indication of a profound lack of confidence on the part of those who advocate further European integration and have set the pace on this issue over the last 25 years, that they find it impossible to address the deficits, the losses and the things we gave up.  They must portray our involvement in Europe as entirely positive.</P>
      <P>It is difficult, for example, to get people to accept that since we joined the EU, between £14 billion and £20 billion worth of fish have been caught in the Irish zone of economic interest by foreign trawlers.  One could argue forever about what we would have done about that matter if we had not joined the EU.  However, it is a significant sum of money, representing the best part of half our gross domestic product.  That sum, which we gave away, bears comparison with the amount of transfers to us.</P>
      <P>I am not saying it was not worth it.  I always say we gave away fisheries, which was a growth industry, in return for agriculture, which was, and still is, a declining industry.  I am not sure the sum was ever calculated.  There was an ideological rigidity, perhaps in the Minister's Department or in politics, which did not appreciate the possibilities which existed for the fishing industry 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>The common agricultural policy is probably the most elaborate welfare system in the developed world dressed up as an economic policy.  It has probably hindered the development of our food industry and has made people in the area of cold storage rich over the past 20 years from doing nothing but providing storage facilities.  It is impossible to discuss this, even with people who are otherwise passionate supporters of a competitive market economy as they have different views when it comes to agriculture.  We cannot have a serious debate if both sides do not engage the negatives and positives.  The same applies to economic and monetary union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have much choice about EMU now. I am astonished by the emergence in the last 12 months of a large number of economists who apparently now believe we should perhaps not enter a single currency.  It is a little late for the economics profession to discover its reservations <Col N="373" /> when it was collectively as meek as mice during the serious debate on the Maastricht referendum.</P>
    <P>The economic side of the Maastricht Treaty was barely mentioned during that debate.  We were obsessed, yet again, by the abortion issue during that time.  That which claims to be our newspaper of record saw the Maastricht referendum victory as a defeat for the forces of the Catholic right, in one of its finer flights of imagination in terms of headline generation.  Whatever the Maastricht Treaty was, it was neither a victory nor a defeat for either side of the abortion debate.  The second issue which arose at that time, which was important but not nearly as central, was neutrality.</P>
    <P>However, the implications of economic and monetary union were never discussed.  An economist in one of the banks raised a few doubts but, beyond that, doubt was either ignored or suppressed, depending on one's point of view.  Ample doubt was expressed, however.  A report for the National Economic and Social Council, written by Rory O'Donnell, the economist, dealt at considerable length with many of the possible negative effects of EMU.</P>
    <P>It is time for us, particularly politicians, to move away from the totalitarian influence of economists.  This country is a democracy and is not run with the totalitarian rigidity about human behaviour which economists would have us accept.  Our rates of growth now exceed what economists believed was the possible upper limit possible for this country.  Our growth rate is around 7, 8 or 9 per cent but most economists would have argued that our highest possible rate was about 6 per cent.  Six months ago an eminent academic wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> that he does not know why our economy is growing at that rate.  If people cannot explain what is happening with our economy today, we should have enormous reservations about listening to what they tell us will happen in five years' time.</P>
    <P>As I said, we do not have much choice now because we are heading irreversibly towards a single currency.  I am extremely perturbed about the consequences of that when the downturn comes.  We could probably survive anything at present because of the state of our economy.  We could even survive a dose of increased public expenditure, with considerable social and other benefits, rather than an orgy of tax cuts for already well off people who are paying 48 per cent income tax.  We could do a great deal with our resources but we are now constrained.</P>
    <P>I am worried about a number of issues which people do not want to address.  In 1989, one of our most eminent economists, writing for the Institute of European Affairs, of which I am a member said we should forget about the idea that devaluation was of benefit to a country because it only created inflation.  We all remember the crisis in 1992-93 which resulted in devaluation and an earlier crisis in Britain which also resulted in devaluation.  The extraordinary aspect is that <Col N="374" /> neither country had an outburst of inflation and both had an outburst of economic growth.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of economics is that people like to believe there is only one cause and one effect &mdash; although most sophisticated economists do not believe that &mdash; such as that devaluation causes inflation.  However, devaluation in those two countries operated in parallel with low inflation and high economic growth.  It is nonsense to suggest there is one rigid currency valuation which can optimise our performance for the rest of time.  We are sacrificing any right to use the value of our currency as a lever or to use domestic interest rates to determine or affect the value of our currency.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that is good or bad, and I do not believe anybody else knows.  Nobody can foretell the future.  There are no tools available for economic forecasters to foretell the future. There are very sophisticated computer models which predict what the future will be if certain things happen; however, one cannot foretell whether those certain things will happen.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record, in case somebody might want to engage in this debate, the much quoted ESRI report on the economic implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union.  It forecasts the possible implications for Ireland of a number of scenarios.  It forecasts that if Ireland joins EMU and the UK stays out, our membership will have a net benefit of 0.4 per cent of GNP.  That benefit rises to 1.4 per cent of GNP if Britain enters EMU.  I invite any member of the economics profession to explain to me from where that precision came.</P>
    <P>The same report, which happily forecast a net benefit of between 0.4 per cent and 1.4 per cent of GNP, said, in the middle of 1996, that gross national product would grow in 1996 by 5.5 per cent.  GNP actually grew by 6.75 per cent in 1996. Therefore, while it was wrong in 1996 about economic growth by a figure of 1.25 per cent, it is quite happy to forecast, with all the uncertainties, that our GNP will benefit from EMU by between 0.4 per cent and 1.4 per cent in four years' time.  It is true that if its assumptions, model and computer are correct that is what would happen.  However, it is no more real than my Granny's guess about what might happen in five years.</P>
    <P>The ESRI does not know.  It was out on its forecast for economic growth for 1996 by a factor of approximately 20 per cent.  In 1996 it forecast a growth rate for 1997 of only 4.5 per cent. Nobody, not even the Central Bank, believes it will be less than 7 per cent while some think it will be closer to 8 or 9 per cent or even 10 per cent, which would be twice the growth rate which most economists believe the economy is capable of without generating massive inflation.  If our most eminent economic forecasters can be out by a factor of close to 100 per cent on what the economy will do in 12 months time, what weight can be given to figures such as 0.4 and 1.4 per cent of GNP?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> The problem is that we do not know where we are going.  Given the assumption that we are going somewhere, we know that if we do not go in the direction on which we are now embarked the consequences could be profoundly serious. We do not have the option of not joining, but that does not mean it is the best option or that what was negotiated is the best deal.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor believes that the UK Government will join on time, which is unlikely.  Many believe it will join inside two or three years, which is possible but improbable because it will have to make a decision to join following which there will be political and economic reasons it may not.  For example, the opposition in the UK will oppose it. We could be left, therefore, with the long-term position where Newry would become perhaps the only place within the EU where citizens in Ireland would have to change their currency.  It would be a profound psychological barrier to introduce at a time when we are trying to begin the process of drawing the two parts of the island closer, at least in terms of understanding.</P>
    <P>There is a peculiar putting the cart before the horse logic here.  One would have thought that an attempt would have been made to ensure that banking and political structures and tax rates would have converged into a generalised European model after which we would move towards a single currency.  This would include a form of agreement on political structures, a government to which a central bank could be accountable and a parliament towards which a government could be accountable.  I do not advocate these measures but they would appear to be the logical way to build the structures on top of which a single currency would have a logic to it.</P>
    <P>However, we have limited political structures, including a virtually powerless European Parliament, a EU Council of Ministers which has a degree of unwieldiness, secrecy and lack of accountability which is undemocratic, and a EU Commission which is accountable to nobody.  In the middle of this we are going to plant a European Central Bank which will be more independent than the US Federal Reserve and our own Central Bank and which will operate a policy which it believes is best in terms of the views of central bankers.</P>
    <P>If previous Governors of our Central Bank had been listened to, especially in the 1980s, we would have decimated our education system because they would have advocated that too much money was being spent on education in a time of economic crisis.  That would have meant that we would not have the educated workforce which is now the basis of our economic growth.  We are now handing over extraordinary powers to people without any political accountability.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why we do not discuss these matters.  We are stuck with the arrangements, but the implications are enormous.  It probably amounts to the single biggest change in our capacity to exercise sovereignty since 1921 <Col N="376" /> and we are apparently doing it because it will be easier for tourists to change their money when they travel to Lourdes or wherever.</P>
    <P>Nobody is sure what a European Central Bank will do about interest rates.  There is a theoretical possibility that they will drop in terms of a convergence towards German rates, but German rates are now increasing.  If they increase further and we are forced to follow them what benefit is there?  There may be a little more stability, but we do not know.</P>
    <P>We are creating a large and dangerous experiment to fulfil a political agenda.  It is as if we could not agree on political and democratic structures but were determined to agree on a single currency.  The big concern is with what will happen when there is what economists call an asymmetric shock &mdash; when something happens in Europe which especially affects this country.  For example, if there was an outbreak of a disease which was worse than the BSE crisis and a largely agricultural country such as ours lost all its production, we would find that bankers in Frankfurt would not allow us to take common sense measures.  There needs to be a serious revision of the terms of convergence and the stability pact to allow for such possibilities.</P>
    <P>Europe is not yet a single market and asymmetric shocks will be part of its experience until the market is integrated.  It is daft to impose constraints which are based not on reality but ideology. The future job of the Government is not to take us out of EMU, nor to prevent us from joining, but to deal with problems and negotiate space for us based on our peripherality, on our extraordinary growth rates and on our need to be able to respond to things that may affect us uniquely in the future.</P>

      <P>I thank all who contributed to this important debate.  I was reminded of the days I was happy to be a Member of this House.  Anybody who underestimates the quality of debate here is making a serious mistake.  I do not mean that in a patronising way.  I also thank Senators, especially my good friend, Senator Finneran, for their warm welcome.</P>
      <P>Practically all speakers raised the question of Ireland participating in EMU in the absence of the UK.  First, everybody is aware that it was always a possibility that not every country was going to participate in EMU and there was never an expectation that this would be the case; second, the UK negotiated an opt out from the Treaty with regard to EMU and, third, the Maastricht Treaty received endorsement in Ireland without qualification, provision or opt out.  Once we meet the qualifying criteria we are obliged and honour bound to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of reports have been published and several Senators, including Senator Brendan Ryan, whom I welcome back to the House, mentioned the ESRI publication.  Many people were disappointed when he lost his seat some years ago <Col N="377" /> and he has regained his rightful place because he was always a good contributor.</P>
    <P>While it is not for me to comment directly on the internal machinations of the United Kingdom Government, we had to focus on ensuring that Ireland met all the criteria for participation in the first round of monetary union.  As the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy said earlier, it is worth noting that irrespective of whether we join EMU, the criteria have been good for Ireland. We can see the benefits of the disciplines it imposed.  The latest negotiations indicate that a second ERM will evolve with regard to monetary union and the relationships which will exist at that stage.  There is a desire in all member states for convergence and the maintenance of stability. That is very much in the interest of the participants in EMU but also of countries which may not join initially in terms of their internal needs, price stability and their relationship with the euro.</P>
    <P>From an Irish perspective, I am pleased Senators raised the issue and it is correct that it should be tackled.  However, we should not necessarily spend all our time concentrating on it because it is a matter for another country.  On balance, the conclusion is that once Ireland is ready for monetary union, it should participate. As Members are aware, this is a view I have always held.  It is also the Government's view and given the current performance of the economy, we could and should look forward to it with a degree of confidence as one of the leading countries in the EU.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn and others referred to euro notes and coins.  They will not be introduced until late 2001 or perhaps early 2002.  The final date has not been set but that is the timeframe involved.  The Senator also raised the issue of borrowings in foreign currencies but I take the opposite view in terms of the effect of EMU.  The Senator said the removal of the option of countries such as Ireland to borrow in foreign currencies will force them to consider using dollars and yen.  However, that is not the case.  One of the central points of monetary union is that it will allow countries to avoid borrowing in foreign currencies. It will create stability in a one currency unit and avoid the main problem of exchange rate risk.  Countries such as Ireland and others which currently borrow in DM will be able to borrow in one currency and avail of lower interest rates, which is one of the reasons countries seek to borrow in other currencies, particularly the DM. When countries join EMU, it will eliminate the need for foreign borrowings.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran and Senator Dardis focused particularly on the issue of information for small retailers and in the marketplace.  As Members are aware, Forfás is involved in this area and has established a group which includes representatives of RGDATA and the vintners' association. Forfás constantly monitors and responds to concerns and groups are also well represented in <Col N="378" /> IBEC.  In addition, in excess of 25,000 information packs were distributed.</P>
    <P>Much information is available and people watching developments on EMU from a business point of view do not have to wait for somebody to arrive at their doors and tell them what is happening. If one is in business, there is plenty of information available on computer systems and for the price of a telephone call.  This does not mean the State and its agencies will not play a role in this area but everything does not happen on one side of the fence.  I advise companies to use modern technology and communications to access the huge range of information.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the dual circulation of Irish currency and the euro and he mentioned a timeframe of six months which he thought was too long.  However, six months is the maximum rather than the minimum timeframe.  The general view is that most countries wish to achieve the move from their currencies to the euro in less than six months.  This will be a matter for individual Governments but Ireland is anxious to move from the IR£ to the euro as quickly as possible when the changeover occurs.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the changeover period and the issue of the euro being used to raise prices.  The Commission is concerned about this matter and is studying it intensely.  It has produced reports on various aspects, such as dual pricing and how it will work where national currencies and the euro are in circulation at the same time.  The situation is being monitored and countries are aware of it.  Those of us who are old enough remember when decimalisation was introduced and the effects it had at that time.  Lessons were learned although the position is not exactly the same in terms of EMU.  However, there will be ongoing monitoring and preparation in this area.</P>
    <P>Other questions were raised regarding information about the changeover for small and medium size enterprises.  The comments I made earlier also apply in that regard.  A point was raised about how Ireland's trade has evolved with the UK.  Our trade with the UK, as a proportion of our total trade, fell from 41 per cent in 1983 to 29 per cent in 1996 and Irish exports to the UK, as a proportion of total exports, declined from 36.9 per cent in 1983 to 24.8 per cent in 1996. Much of that is due to the fact that our exporters, including overseas investors in the context of international companies in Ireland and indigenous companies, have developed new markets. There has been a happy redefining of our markets within Europe.  The proportion of our trade with the UK is high and it will always be so because it is our nearest trading neighbour.  If that were not the case, we would perhaps have other concerns. However, it is at a more realistic level in the totality of our exports, particularly to European markets.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor and I soldiered together for some time on the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and we know each other's <Col N="379" /> views.  I am sure he is aware that it is not my place to predict or comment on whether other member states meet the criteria for EMU.</P>

      <P>It would be unhelpful and premature for me to do so.  In terms of Ireland's position, we must concentrate on maintaining our commitments under the various headings and subheadings to achieve the most harmonious transition to monetary union.  If we do that, we will be in a strong position to take up all the opportunities available to us as a participant in monetary union.  In that regard, it is important to point out that we should look at monetary union more strategically and at the opportunities it presents, and not focus exclusively on the operational aspects of it.  It is important that we see both the wood and the trees on this occasion and seize these opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was much discussion on the role of the European Central Bank and Members made valid comments.  It is important to bear in mind that the basis of the European Central Bank and its primary objective will be to maintain price stability. For this and other economies which will become one great economy as monetary union moves to establish it, that underpinning will be necessary for the maintenance of growth which exists in our economy.  The president of the ECB will be answerable to the European Parliament but that is only one element.  The President of the Council of Ministers will have hands on involvement in this area as will a member of the governing council <Col N="380" /> of the ECB but they will not have a vote.  The president of the ECB will be invited to participate in meetings of the Council of Ministers.  Those mechanisms will make clear the thinking of the main players in terms of their national views on how the European economy is doing and what mechanisms or otherwise may be needed in the context of maintaining the pace of growth in Europe.</P>
    <P>However, we want independence.  Neither I, nor this country want the European Central Bank to be answerable to one part of Europe.  It must be independent of political interference but be aware of the developing European economy.  A balance has been struck in the way in which it is anticipated it will operate.  As the situation evolves and changes, that relationship will be enhanced and looked at if necessary.</P>
    <P>I hope I have responded to the points Members raised.  This is an important debate and I expect, as time progresses, to be back in the Seanad to discuss this topic.  While it is important to keep on top of this issue and keep the points of greatest concern under constant consideration, we should move forward with confidence as we have achieved much.  Senator Ryan looks forward with great uncertainty, but we may take great strength from the progress we have made.  There is much to engender confidence within us about the future rather than focusing on the minutiae of point something of a percentage of figures.  Overall, Ireland has done well and is performing extraordinarily well.  This Government will ensure that continued strong performance and will not want to see anything hinder that growth and advancement in a European context.</P>
