      <P>I have notice from Senator Tom Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to discuss the statement made last week recommending that consumers do not purchase and that butchers do not sell Irish beef on the bone.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised as suitable for discussion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3 and 8, motion 11.  Item 1 is to be taken without debate.  The proceedings on all Stages of item 2, if not previously concluded, shall conclude at 2 p.m. The contributions of spokespersons on item 2 shall not exceed 15 minutes and other Senators shall have ten minutes.  The Second Stage of item 3 will be taken at 3 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of other Senators 15 minutes.  Item 8, motion 11, shall be taken at 6 p.m. and the proceedings on item 3, if not previously concluded, shall resume at 8 p.m. There will be a sos from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader allow 30 minutes for speakers on item 3?  We agree with the time arrangements for item 2.  We agree with the Order of Business otherwise, although Senator Cosgrave may wish to propose an amendment on another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the climate conference in Japan yesterday there was a debate on greenhouse gas emissions. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has said that levels of emissions in Ireland in 2010 could be 55 per cent higher than 1990 levels.  In view of the seriousness of this matter, will the Leader arrange for the Minister to <Col N="70" /> come to the House to inform Members of the controls that will be put in place to lower the levels of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised the issue of the all-party committee on the Constitution and I will return to that issue this week as I am under pressure from my colleagues.</P>
      <P>Today is the fiftieth anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights and it would be appropriate to have a debate on the related area of cultural rights, not least to discuss the position of travellers, immigrants and refugees.</P>
      <P>The OECD is to publish today a report on education in Europe which will underline pertinent facts about Irish education which we should discuss. The Leader has given a commitment that on the first sitting day after the recess there will be a debate on literacy.  Perhaps we might discuss these related matters at that time.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the session I requested a debate on the taxi service in the greater Dublin area.  This is not an isolated or narrow issue in national terms but has security and other implications.  I understand a report on the taxi service in the greater Dublin area is due to be published shortly and the House should take an interest in it.  It will be the model for other urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Leader on his initiative in having four Bills introduced in the Seanad this week.  I am sure it is a record; perhaps he will contact the Guinness Book of Records. We seem to be playing musical chairs with regard to the time arrangements for speakers.  Yesterday the Leader proposed 30 minutes for spokespersons. Today he is proposing 15 minutes for spokespersons for one Bill and 20 minutes for another.  The leader of Fine Gael in the House is proposing 30 minutes.  I suggest we allow 20 minutes for both Bills and that this be taken as a rule of thumb.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I raised with the Leader the unsatisfactory procedure whereby all Stages of a Bill are taken on the same day, something the Leader is again proposing to do.  It is not satisfactory to begin discussing a Bill after the Order of Business at 11.15 a.m. and to conclude all Stages by 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two months ago the House passed legislation establishing a tribunal to examine planning irregularities which was due to make an interim report by Christmas.  However, according to the newspapers, a wrangle has been going on regarding lawyers' fees and the Minister for Finance, the Attorney General and the chairman of the tribunal have had to come together to work out a compromise formula.  It is unseemly that a body set up to examine a particular issue is held back from its work for an extended period for financial reasons.  It is almost as though we need to establish a tribunal to examine the legal fees for other tribunals.  Because of this and other rumours in relation to delays in setting up the tribunal, will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to make a statement about why the tribunal has not been <Col N="71" /> operating at a time when it should have presented its first interim report to the House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator O'Toole in asking for a debate on the OECD report, which contains startling facts about Ireland in relation to other countries.  It would be worthwhile if the report could be debated alongside a debate on literacy.</P>
      <P>Yesterday morning I asked the House if it would consider a debate on radon gases.  The Leader, not realising that it is a different substance, the consequences of which are widely known, included radon with other forms of radiation. In a few months a report on radon radiation throughout Ireland will be published.  It affects many households, particularly in the west of Ireland and areas of high limestone content, and has consequences for people in terms of housing costs, including the costs of new housing. It is critical that we have a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed and surprised that the Leader has not responded to my repeated attempts last week and yesterday to raise the Flood tribunal and the C case.  I am beginning to think that some sort of cover-up is operating and I respectfully suggest that this is the last thing the country needs in view of the important matters which the Taoiseach raised in both Houses regarding the establishment of the tribunal.  The problem is not only about legal fees. I would like everything to be fully revealed, including details of all correspondence and communications covering the provision of expertise, including specialist staff, and the role of the Garda, who have been previously involved in investigating this matter.  The tribunal cannot function without these being in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a debate on the matter.  Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have the precise detail as to why everything is not in place.  Regarding the C case, were the two eminent counsel appointed by the Attorney General to protect the life of the unborn not prepared to appeal the decision of the High Court?  In the more likely event that they were prepared to do their job fully, were their instructions withdrawn or were they dismissed or sacked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on telephone charges?  I am not sure which Minister should come to the House to explain why we have such high telephone costs. Big international companies are anxious to enter the market to share the profits of the telephone service at the same time as small businesspeople are paying exorbitant rates for their calls.  Half of the business people in Ireland are based in Dublin. The other half are finding it difficult to sustain <Col N="72" /> themselves and to pay for trunk calls while those in Dublin are paying for local calls.  I have to pay international rates for a telephone call from Lifford to Strabane, a distance of half a mile.  This House has a contribution to make on this matter and I ask the Leader to bring the appropriate Minister before the House for a debate.  We are a small island and our goal should be to ensure that every call within Ireland is a local call. Rather than seeing international companies entering the market and reaping the benefits of the high rates which have been in place for years and which established a very credible business for Telecom Éireann, we should demand local call rates for the entire island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is shedding crocodile tears.  Market forces are at work.  The Senator did not want to hear about it ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not take kindly to interruptions from Independent Members who have no opinion on anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the announcement by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to set up of an independent body to examine the rural rail network in order to identify areas where there are serious defects and which will report within six months, I ask the Leader to bring the Minister to the House to indicate the Government's fundamental support for this important element of our infrastructure.  In light of what has happened in the west and south in relation to the rail network, it is important that the Government gives some indication of its financial support for the longterm development of the network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello expressed his view regarding the allocation of time for today's business.  I understand that item 2 is a Bill with two sections and that item 3 is a Bill with 41 sections.  We will be insisting on 30 minutes for spokespersons and, if necessary, will call for a vote on the matter.  We are not comparing like with like.  Senator Costello has had a long association with the subject of the Bill under item 2, and I am sure the House will have no difficulty in facilitating him if he wants more time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move: &ldquo;That statements on the facilities for the Leas-Chathaoirleach and other Senators not exceeding 30 minutes be taken before item 1.&rdquo; It is with reluctance that I propose this amendment to the Order of Business.  As Members know, I am reasonable and not prone to being over aggressive.  However, since 18 September I have been allocated an office in the College of Art while I share a secretary with two others in Kildare House.  The telephone remains unanswered when I am meeting with the Leader, the Whip and Senators Callanan and Ormonde in the College of Art.  This is unfair to me as an officer of the House who substitutes for the Cathaoirleach <Col N="73" /> if he is unavailable.  It is also unfair in view of the facilities available to Members of the other House.  It appears that certain Deputies can ring the Government Chief Whip and he comes running to them.  They do not even have to go to him.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow the House discuss this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on taxi services in Dublin city.  I considered raising this matter because I received complaints from people in my area who travelled to Dublin by train and waited almost an hour in a queue at Heuston Station for a taxi.  The position is the same at taxi ranks in the city centre when people want to travel to the station in the evening.  It is most unfair and there is a need for extra taxis in Dublin city centre to ensure the service is efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader pass on the congratulations of many Members of the House to the President on her act of ecumenical worship in Christchurch Cathedral last weekend?  It was deeply appreciated by members of the Church of Ireland and many other people.  It showed a forward looking attitude and I welcome that on the part of the President.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader about the current state of play of the Litter Bill.  Does the Leader have a report on this matter?  The position is appalling in Dublin city in the run up to Christmas.  The days for rubbish collection have been changed and a mass of rubbish is blowing around several streets, including my own, in the centre of the city.  This is unacceptable and appalling in a capital city.  Cars drive over the rubbish, litter is spewed over pavements and bags of rubbish are left out for several days.  The position is intolerable.  If the House is serious about its role, it should monitor the implementation of laws. Dublin Corporation is responsible on this occasion, not only the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader clarify the position regarding the duration of contributions on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill?  Although it is extremely important legislation and many Members, including myself, wish to contribute to the debate, I understand it is a technical Bill relating to a specific aspect.  Since all Stages are due to conclude by 2 p.m., will the Leader consider altering the time available for contributions?   They should not be the usual length of speeches on legislation.  This would allow as many Members as possible take part in the debate.  I understand 20 minutes for opening speakers and 15 minutes for other contributors has been suggested. Perhaps this could be reduced to 15 minutes for opening remarks and ten minutes for other speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mooney's <Col N="74" /> suggestion on the time arrangements.  I also support Senator Burke's call for statements on the environmental summit in Japan.  The Leader indicated yesterday that he is agreeable to statements on the environment generally and such a debate could include this matter.  The role of the European Union regarding the control of the emission of greenhouse gases, and particularly the reluctance of America to implement strict measures in that respect, must be looked at critically.  Another aspect is enforcement.  The Earth Summit should be included in statements on the environment, which the Leader agreed to arrange soon after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Cosgrave's amendment to the Order of Business for a discussion on Members' facilities.  I am strongly of the view that if Members do not uphold the dignity and seriousness of the role we are expected to play, we cannot expect others to do so.  Those of us who were in the Seanad previously know it takes little to realise how quickly the relevance of the House can be questioned by those who are not aware of its important function in our bicameral Parliament.  I plead with the Leader to allow a serious discussion on this matter.</P>
      <P>I share my office with a secretary and another Senator.  My secretary serves four Senators, which means four telephones are ringing all day.  The only fax for our corridor is five feet from my desk. It is either pumping out faxes for half a dozen people or material is being fed into it.  We would not tolerate from our youngest children in their play spaces at home the chaos, untidiness and lack of discipline in terms of how the system is organised.</P>
      <P>I plead with the Cathaoirleach, who understands the functioning and seriousness of the work of the House, on this matter.  For months Members have pleaded through the normal channels for a resolution of this problem.  I and other Members take their work seriously.  We must be prepared to address this problem instantly because four months have passed since Members were elected.  What can we do to make people realise it is impossible for Members to serve the House, contribute to debates and carry out the necessary research on important legislation without basic facilities?  We do not want luxuries, only a clean area with fresh air in our rooms and places where secretaries can function and are not frazzled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine.  Regarding Senator Costello's point, the Bill is short and contains only two sections.  I made the original proposal of 15 minutes and ten minutes for speakers to allow as many Members as possible contribute to the debate.</P>
      <P>Regarding the calls of Senators Burke, Dardis, Cregan and Coogan for statements on the Earth Summit and their concerns about this matter, I will make time available for such a debate at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator O'Toole's concern about Independents on the all-party committee on the Constitution, I am waiting for an indication on this matter.  I hope to have information for him by the end of this week.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Coogan mentioned the OECD report and called for a debate on literacy.  As I assured the House previously, such a debate will take place on the first day the House sits in the next session.</P>
      <P>Senator Rory Kiely and Senator O'Toole raised their concern about taxi services in Dublin. I understand a report will be available in the next few months.  I share the Senators' concern about this matter.  When the report is published, I will provide time for a debate on it.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan mentioned radon gas.  The west is at risk from this gas, but the midlands, and particularly the area I come from, has the highest level in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be delighted to facilitate Senator Coogan with a debate on that matter.</P>
      <P>Some of the issues Senator Coghlan raises on the Order of Business at every sitting are matters for the tribunals.  I am doing all I can to ascertain the information the Senator requires.  That information is very sensitive, but as soon as I have it the Senator will receive it within an hour.  Senator McGowan requested a debate on high telephone costs, and we will have that debate early in the next session.  Senator Chambers expressed serious concerns about rail links.  The Senator will be pleased to hear that the Minister for Public Enterprise has called for an inquiry into this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave has been very patient in relation to the matter he raised and I take a serious view of the difficulties he, his party and other Members are experiencing. It is not my fault, nor is it the fault of the Leader of any group or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  We have done <Col N="76" /> everything in our power to bring this issue to the attention of those in charge of the various Departments with responsibility for this matter, and we have had many meetings to deal with it. However, the House is to deal with two Bills today, one of which must conclude in order to be returned to the Dáil.  Bearing that in mind, statements from party leaders regarding Members' facilities will be taken at the conclusion of today's business.  Those statements will be 15 minutes in length.  However, if other Members wish to speak on this matter we can have those statements tomorrow.  We do not know when business will conclude today, as at least 15 Senators have indicated they wish to speak on the second Bill before the House.  I will make time available to Members within reason.  Legislation must be processed.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned the Litter Bill.  I will make inquiries into this matter and contact him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their co-operation in taking all Stages of this Bill today. The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the transfer into the State of persons who have been sentenced to periods of imprisonment greater than the maximum penalties allowed under our law for similar offences.</P>
      <P>The immediate effect of the Bill when enacted should be to assist in facilitating the transfer of seven Provisional IRA prisoners who are in the United Kingdom at the moment.  The Bill is relatively short, but it is of particular importance in the context of confidence building measures.</P>
      <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, provides the legislative basis for the operation of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons between Ireland and other parties to the convention.  Section 7 of the Act provides for the issue of a warrant by the court here authorising the continued enforcement by the State of the sentence imposed by the sentencing State.  In accordance with Article 10 of the convention, section 7 permits a court to adapt the sentence prescribed by the law of the State for an offence similar to the offence for which the sentence was imposed where the sentence concerned is, in its legal nature or duration, incompatible with the law of the State.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill a court will be permitted to adapt a sentence that is incompatible by its duration with the law of the State only where an application in this regard is made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This should facilitate the negotiation of transfers with States which insist that there can be no question of the sentence imposed in the sentencing State being reduced, while at the same time allowing a mechanism for the adaptation of the duration of sentences where the States in question have no objection to this procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be helpful before going into the detail of the Bill to give some brief background information about the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which is <Col N="78" /> the basis for our 1995 legislation.  The initiative for the convention came in 1978, when at a Council of Europe Conference, Ministers for Justice discussed the problems posed by prisoners of foreign nationality, including the question of providing procedures for their transfer so that they may serve their sentence in their home country.  The text of the convention was approved by the Committee of Ministers in 1982, and opened for signature in March 1983.  The operative date for the convention, that is to say the date it came into force, is 1 July 1985.  Ireland signed the convention a year later on 20 August 1986, and ratified the convention following the enactment of the 1995 legislation.  The aim of the convention is to facilitate the transfer to his or her home State of a person who has been sentenced in a foreign State.  The convention provides a procedural framework for such transfers and it seeks to provide a simple and expeditious mechanism whereby the repatriation of sentenced persons may take place.</P>
    <P>The policy of the convention, which is based on humanitarian considerations, is to overcome the difficulties posed for prisoners serving sentences in foreign jurisdictions through, for example, absence of contacts with relatives and differences in language and culture.  For a transfer to take place the following conditions must be met: the sentenced person must be a national of the state to which the transfer is sought; the judgment must be final; there must normally be at least six months of the sentence left to serve; the offence for which the sentenced person is imprisoned must also be a criminal offence in the state to which the transfer is sought and there must be consent to the transfer from all parties, that is, the person and the two states involved.</P>
    <P>Under the convention the receiving or administering state is given a choice between two ways of enforcing the sentence imposed by the sentencing state.  It may continue to enforce the sentence, in which case it is bound, subject to any technical modifications that may prove necessary, by the nature and duration of the sentence as determined in the original sentencing state.  Alternatively, it may adapt the sentence to one prescribed by its own law for the same or a similar offence.</P>
    <P>Article 10 of the convention is concerned with continued enforcement of sentences.  It states:</P>
    <P>1.  In the case of continued enforcement, the administering state shall be bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>2.  If, however, this sentence is by its nature or duration incompatible with the law of the administering state, or its law so requires, that state may, by a court or administrative order, adapt the sanction to the punishment or measure prescribed by its own law for a similar offence.  As to its nature, the punishment or measure shall, as far as possible, correspond with that imposed by the sentence to be <Col N="79" /> enforced.  It shall not aggravate, by its nature or duration, the sanction imposed in the sentencing state, nor exceed the maximum prescribed by the law of the administering state.</P>
    <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, has operated successfully so far but an issue which needs to be addressed has been identified in relation to a number of prisoners in England who are seeking repatriation and who are serving sentences longer than the sentences which could be imposed under our laws for similar offences.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, section 7 of the 1995 Act provides for the issue of a warrant by a court here the effect of which is to authorise the continued enforcement by the State of the sentence imposed by the sentencing state.  However, in line with Article 10 of the convention, section 7 permits a court &ldquo;if the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned is in its legal nature or duration incompatible with the law of the State&rdquo; to adapt the sentence to a sentence prescribed by the law of the State for an offence similar to the offence for which the sentence was imposed.  In adapting the sentence the new sentence may not aggravate it by its legal nature or duration or exceed the maximum penalty prescribed by the law of the State for a similar offence.</P>
    <P>In operating the convention between here and the UK, the UK authorities have sought specific assurances about the length of time to be served by persons seeking transfers here.  This has not given rise to difficulties where the sentences at issue would have been similar to those available in our law.  Under the terms of the 1995 Act, it is a matter for the High Court to decide whether a sentence is incompatible in its legal nature or duration and whether to adapt the sentence. Therefore I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, would not be in a position to assure the UK authorities, in cases where the sentences were greater than those permitted by our law for similar offences, that such sentences would not be adapted by the courts to the maximum permitted under our law.</P>
    <P>Neither the convention nor the 1995 Act makes the adaptation of a sentence mandatory on a state.  In the Act the court is given discretion as to whether to adapt a sentence if it is &ldquo;by its legal nature or duration&rdquo; incompatible with the law of the state.  While it is relatively easy to envisage circumstances where a sentence would be incompatible by its legal nature, for example penal servitude, which has been abolished here, there is no authority available to indicate how incompatibility in relation to duration of sentence would be determined.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals in the Bill it would be left entirely to the court to adapt sentences where there is an incompatibility in legal nature. However, where there is an incompatibility as to the duration, the court could only adapt the sentence on the application of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Even then it <Col N="80" /> would still be a matter for the court to decide that the duration of the sentence involved was incompatible with our law.  This approach will allow me to offer assurances to those jurisdictions who are concerned that transferred prisoners would receive a reduction of sentence while allowing adaptation where jurisdictions are prepared to accept this.</P>
    <P>Before going on to comment on the individual provisions of the Bill it might be helpful to the House to give some brief statistics on applications under the Act.  My Department has processed 102 applications for transfer into the jurisdiction.  Successive Ministers have consented to the transfer of 53 applicants.  Of these, 21 have now been transferred.  This included 11 PIRA prisoners.  In relation to the transfer of prisoners out of the jurisdiction, a total of 14 have been transferred to date.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill involves an amendment of section 7 of the 1995 Act by way of substitution of new subsections for subsections (5) and (6). The new subsections will provide for applications to be made, in appropriate cases, to adapt the legal nature of a sentence and to adapt the duration of a sentence where they are incompatible with the position under our law.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (5) (a) will provide that, when the High Court is requested to issue a warrant for the transfer of a prisoner into the State and where the sentence imposed by the sentencing state is, by its legal nature, incompatible with our law, the court may adapt the sentence to one which is prescribed by our law for a similar offence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) (b) deals with the situation where the duration of a sentence is incompatible with the duration which could be imposed under our law for a similar offence, that is, one which is longer than could be imposed here.  In those cases the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have absolute discretion where he or she thinks it appropriate to do so, to include in an application for a warrant authorising the transfer an application that the court adapt the duration of the sentence to one prescribed under our law for a similar offence.  If the Minister makes such an application and the sentence imposed by the sentencing state is by its duration incompatible with our law, then the court may adapt the duration of the sentence to conform with our law.</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 7(6) arises as a result of the amendment to subsection (5) which I have just outlined.  The new subsection (6) (a) will provide that the legal nature of a sentence adapted under subsection (5) (a) will, as far as practicable, correspond to the legal nature of the sentence originally imposed.  However, the subsection goes on to stress that the adapted sentence must not either aggravate the original one or exceed the maximum penalty prescribed by the law of the State for a similar offence.</P>
    <P>Under the new subsection (6) (b) where the duration of the sentence is adapted following an application in that regard by the Minister, the <Col N="81" /> same conditions will apply, that is, that the adapted sentence must not either aggravate the original sentence or exceed the maximum prescribed by our law for a similar offence.</P>
    <P>In order to remove any confusion which might arise from the use of the term &ldquo;legal nature of a sentence&rdquo;, the Bill is making provision for the insertion of an interpretation of that term. Section 7(10), which is a new subsection, provides that a reference to the legal nature of a sentence does not include a reference to the duration of such a sentence.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is in standard form setting out the short title and stating that it will be cited together with the 1995 Act.</P>
    <P>They are the provisions of this short, but important Bill and I am sure it will receive widespread support in the House.  Again, I thank Senators for their co-operation in agreeing to take all Stages today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltímid roimh an Aire chuig an Teach.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh díospóireacht mhaith againn ar na rudaí an-tábhachtach atá sáite isteach sa Bhille.</P>
      <P>This is a very important Bill which incorporates a clear humanitarian principle.  Prisoners should be brought closer to their dependants and families so that the families suffer as little as possible. It is right and proper for the State to arrange for the transfer of prisoners held overseas to serve their full sentences in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy de Valera, stated in a 1995 report that it cost £300 for a relative to visit a prisoner in the UK.  It would probably cost about £500 now.  When parents get older and brothers and sisters are scattered around the world, the overseas prisoner suffers further punishment in addition to being imprisoned.  This Bill is an effort to ameliorate that suffering.</P>
      <P>We must also look at the historic role of prisoners in Irish politics, particularly in Sinn Féin. The politicisation of Sinn Féin came about through the prisoner movement and the H-block protests.  Sinn Féin prisoners have played a major role in affecting the policies of that organisation, particularly in bringing about the first ceasefire.  I gather from my reading of various articles that the failure of the British Government to deal fully with prisoner interests may have been one of the main reasons for the eventual breakdown of that ceasefire.</P>
      <P>A member of my family, Niall O'Dowd, was part of the American involvement in brokering the first ceasefire.  I am very aware of the effect the collapse of that ceasefire had on him and the entire country.  We need to ensure that prisoners in the UK are transferred as speedily as possible and that their views are brought to our attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Neville and Senator Costello recently visited prisoners in the UK.  Deputy Neville's report is very important from the Fine Gael point of view.  He stated he was very disappointed at the rate of transfer of republican prisoners from the UK to Ireland.  He is in weekly touch with <Col N="82" /> many prisoners and he detects a growing level of frustration with the lack of progress on the transfer issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the work of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas and its interest in all prisoners, regardless of the reason for their imprisonment.  It sent me a letter which states:</P>
    <P>ICPO is concerned with all Irish prisoners throughout the world and this Bill applies to all, regardless of offence or country of sentence. We are worried that legislation is being amended in a &ldquo;general&rdquo; way to deal with a &ldquo;specific and limited&rdquo; group of prisoners, even if the aim of this is one of helpful intent, that is, to further the peace process by facilitating transfer.</P>
    <P>It is our belief that this problem, that is, the integrity of sentences, is ultimately a political and/or administrative one and should be addressed in such a manner &mdash; that is, by political persuasion and administrative flexibility &mdash; permitted by the convention.  After all, the convention, in the words of the Taoiseach's adviser, &ldquo;itself establishes the framework within which prisoner transfers can take place but does not prescribe precisely how its provisions, including those relating to adaptation of sentence, should be translated into domestic law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is of general application, to deal with all situations where a sentence imposed by a foreign court is greater than the maximum penalty provided for in Irish law.  But it could have unforeseen consequences, even in terms of the peace process, not to mention the effects on prisoners in countries other than England.</P>
    <P>The commission goes on to state that other questions arise about the proposed Government amendments to the legislation:</P>
    <P>Is there a need for the new subsection (5), changing the legal nature of the offence to one &ldquo;similar&rdquo; and not comparable, if the High Court is already doing this in practice?  The existing Act provides that if the foreign sentence is by its legal nature or duration incompatible with Irish law, the court may adapt it at the time a transfer warrant is applied for.  At present, the adaptation is done at the discretion of the court.  In relation to the republican prisoners who got 35 years for conspiracy to cause explosions there is a comparable offence, albeit commanding a lesser sentence.</P>
    <P>In regard to the duration of sentence, has (5)(b) been put into place in any other country and what has been the effect, especially for long-term prisoners and politically motivated prisoners?  How does this amendment fit in with the State's right to grant pardons, amnesties or early releases, especially for politically motivated prisoners?</P>
    <P>If there are changes in remission in England or Northern Ireland in the future how would <Col N="83" /> this affect such sentences affected by this amendment?  For example, the UK may be lowering its remission rates to 8 per cent next year or some time in the future.  Is it to be applied for the 35 year sentenced prisoners only?   Could it be open to charges of discrimination?</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to think that all systems can be brought into complete alignment via amendments to the Irish transfer Act.  It is harmful to introduce or amend in a general way legislation for a very specific and limited number of the prisoners.  The downstream consequences are unforeseeable.</P>
    <P>The commission has suggested two possible amendments.  The first is to amend the new subsection (5)(b) to read:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, where he or she considers it appropriate and where the prisoner concerned, after being full advised of the effect in relation to him or her, has expressly indicated in writing his or her consent to such application, include in an application to the High Court.</P>
    <P>This would, at least, ensure that the prisoner had fully considered the implications before any such application was made.</P>
    <P>The commission suggests a second amendment which would provide that:</P>
    <P>...subsection (5)(b) would remain in force for a period of 12 months only unless both Houses of the Oireachtas voted to extend its period of operation for another period of 12 months or succeeding 12 month periods.  This would be without prejudice to the continuing validity of any orders made under the subsection. This would ensure that the power would lapse when the specific problem had been dealt with and could not be used for any extended period in a way that the Oireachtas did not intend.</P>
    <P>The commission also suggests that &ldquo;there may be a potential contradiction between subsection (5)(b) and subsection (6)(b)(ii) which suggests that the court could not require a prisoner to serve longer than the maximum permitted under Irish law&rdquo;.  This should be clarified.</P>
    <P>Now that there is peace in our land and the guns of the IRA and most of the other organisations are silent, it is very important for us to reach out and support those in the Sinn Féin movement who fight for peace.  Even as I speak, changes are happening in our country.  There is a mood for change and for peace.  The transfer of prisoners to Ireland will support and underpin that desire.  We will deal with other points on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is the first time four Bills have been initiated in this House and it is to be welcomed. The Leader was praised this morning.  I also praise the Minister's initiative.  It is a great honour <Col N="84" /> and an acknowledgement of the role of the House.  I am proud of this development and would welcome similar initiatives from other Departments.  It would improve the image of the House and show that it does not merely rubber stamp, but can also initiate and amend legislation.</P>
      <P>While this is technical legislation, it is appropriate, given the ongoing peace process.  I compliment the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, John Hume and many others for their work on the peace process.  I also welcome the recent reestablishment of peace; please God it will continue. It is the most important development in the State over the past 30 or 40 years, despite the recent economic progress of the Celtic tiger. Peace on this island is of huge importance to people, both North and South, and to the development of the economy.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amending legislation was set out in the Minister's speech when he stated:</P>
      <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, has operated successfully so far but an issue which needs to be addressed has been identified in relation to a number of prisoners in England who are seeking repatriation and who are serving sentences longer than the sentence which could be imposed under our laws</P>
      <P>A number of Provisional IRA prisoners are serving sentences in England of 25, 30 and 35 years.  Under our laws they would serve sentences of probably 20 years in respect of comparable offences.  This is where the difficulty lies.  The Minister and the Government have grasped the nettle with this legislation, which is both timely and urgent.</P>
      <P>While I concur with the view that legislation should not be rushed through this House, I am glad that my colleagues on the other side have agreed to take all Stages of this Bill today.  It is an indication of the commitment by the Leader and the Minister that there was a lengthy debate yesterday on Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997.  A number of valuable contributions were made.  Committee Stage will be taken next week.  I am slow to criticise my colleagues on the other side, but the Labour Party engaged in a cynical exercise yesterday by moving an amendment on Second Stage, yet when a vote was called only one Member from the Labour Party was present.  If a party or group moves amendments their members should be present to vote.  Otherwise it is reasonable to speculate that amendments may be no more than filibusters to delay the progress of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will enable the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, 1978, which has been adopted by this country and Great Britain, to come into operation.  It is a positive reflection on the relationship between the two states that the transfer of prisoners is allowed.  However, there is a fear in Great Britain that prisoners from Ireland serving long sentences of 25, 30 or 35 years for very <Col N="85" /> serious crimes, usually terrorist related and involving the planting of bombs in Britain by the IRA, would serve lesser sentences if transferred back to this State.  This Bill guarantees that this will not occur and that if transfers of prisoners are to be made the type of offence for which they were sentenced can be taken into account and that, on application by the Minister to the courts, there will be a guarantee that the returned prisoners cannot apply to have their sentences of, say, 25 or 30 years, commuted to ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>Both countries are trying to accommodate the transfer of prisoners.  This legislation guarantees that if Great Britain allows the seven Provisional IRA prisoners to be returned to Ireland they will serve comparable sentences in this country.  That is the most important aspect of this Bill.  Given the need to allay fears regarding the peace process and to build good relations between the respective leaders and Governments, we must give such an assurance to our colleagues in Britain.</P>
    <P>I welcome the transfer of these prisoners.  It is good that an Irish national serving a long sentence in Great Britain, away from his family, his relatives and his country, can be transferred to Ireland.  It will resolve the geographical problems and the cost of access incurred by visitors.  It also improves the level of co-operation and understanding that exists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to note that certain conditions must be met before this arrangement is put in place.  The sentenced person must be a national of the state to which the transfer is sought.  If an appeal is lodged in Great Britain, for example, a transfer cannot take place until a judgment is made.  A person must have at least six months of the sentence left to serve as it would not be practical or economically viable to transfer someone who is serving less than six months back here.  The offence for which the sentenced person is imprisoned must also be a criminal offence here.  The party concerned and the two states involved must agree on what should happen.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation which amends the 1995 Act and gives substance to the 1978 European convention.  I hope it is given a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department for introducing this legislation.  It is good that conventions are dealt with speedily. I have often been critical of the Department of Justice for being slow to ensure that internationally agreed conventions are included in law.  There seems to be a peculiar resistance in that Department to take the necessary action.  I applaud the fact that this legislation will create confidence in the peace process and in the <Col N="86" /> relationships between the different groups on the two islands.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to explain if this Bill raises constitutional issues.  I know transfers can only take place with the agreement of both states and of the prisoner or convicted person.  Could a constitutional issue arise if a person who has not been proven guilty in our courts is given a jail sentence here?  Could this lead to a petition under <i>habeas corpus</i> because we are holding someone in prison who has not been found guilty of a crime through our courts, although they have gone through a court procedure?  Despite the fact they might have agreed to this when in another land and that it had the agreement of both states, that could not override the person's constitutional right not to be held in prison.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to outline the relationship between this legislation and two other pieces of legislation here and in Great Britain which allow for a person to be brought for trial in this country for crimes committed in another jurisdiction. There must be complications because that legislation also dealt with some of these issues.</P>
      <P>How do the different arrangements for probation tie in with the acceptable demand from the convicting state that nobody should get off serving their sentence?  The difference between the UK and the Republic in terms of remission is that people often get remission in the UK and the North of Ireland of up to 50 per cent of the sentence. If someone is convicted in the UK and imprisoned in Northern Ireland for a crime for which they could have expected a 50 per cent remission for good behaviour but they opt to move to the Republic where the remission arrangements are not quite so generous, could this create problems?  If someone from the North is convicted in a court in the South and the judge sentences them on the basis that they are likely to get remission of a proportion of the sentence but a year later they are transferred to a prison regime where there is a likelihood of a 50 per cent remission, would that have implications for the administration of justice in either this or other jurisdictions?</P>
      <P>I am more concerned about the constitutional than the legal issues, particularly those associated with <i>habeas corpus</i> or with the imprisonment of someone by the State who has not been found guilty by our court system.  I know this has not been challenged before but could it be said we are holding someone against their constitutional rights?  I ask the Minister to examine that and the problems and legal complications of different remission rates in different jurisdictions and the relationship between this and other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation shows compassion not so much for the prisoner but for the prisoner's family. They will be in a better position to visit them and help or facilitate their readmission to society. There are two sides to this story but we must welcome the possibility that a prisoner's family could have a good influence on them.  This is to be welcomed. I welcome this legislation.  I did not hear <Col N="87" /> the main Opposition spokesperson so I do not know what their position is on the Bill.  It seems to be advancing a policy on which this and the previous Government agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on this Bill.  Senator O'Toole raised most of the points I wished to make.  The Bill makes an important contribution to the peace process.  However, it is important to present the Bill as not being a concession to anything except humanitarian values and decency.  It is important to facilitate prisoners who wish to be transferred to their native jurisdiction. This is primarily to ease the burden on families and to help rehabilitation.  The Bill should be seen as a triumph of these principles rather than a reaction to any political process or pressure.  The fact that we are introducing this legislation to advance a political process should not exclude the needs and requirements of other prisoners who might wish to be considered in the same way.</P>
      <P>It is also important that the Bill is not seen as anything other than showing respect for the convention and for the transfer of prisoners on humanitarian grounds.  It must be made clear that it does not involve a lessening of sentences or a disguised release.  However, this raises the problem of variable remission rates.  Under this provision, I assume that a prisoner retains not only his/her sentence but also his/her existing remission regime.  There are already problems concerning the transfer of prisoners between Britain and Northern Ireland where different remission rates exist.  Will prisoners receive the benefit of changes in remission rates in the other jurisdiction?</P>
      <P>With a little luck, I can foresee a situation in a few years in which we will have an established peace and in which order will have been restored. In such circumstances authorities in all jurisdictions would legitimately look at the possibility of the early release of prisoners, even on parole. It is important that there should be consistency between jurisdictions.  In some serious crimes the sentencing judge is consulted before remission is granted.  Which judge will be consulted in these cases?</P>
      <P>The feelings of victims should also be taken into account in all remissions.  Where there is a crime there are victims.  When victims are close at hand, administrations can reflect their concerns. However, it is easy to forget victims when they are far away.  I hope some mechanism can be built into the administrative arrangements to take this into account.  I welcome this Bill and commend the Minister on the speed with which it is being introduced.  I hope it receives a speedy passage.</P>

      <P>When I was asked about this Bill yesterday, I looked for the Dáil records to see what the Lower House had to say.  However, I discovered that the Bill was being initiated in this House.  At first I did not believe this, but it is <Col N="88" /> encouraging to see such an initiative coming from this House and I hope it will be the forerunner for much legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as I do any measure which underpins the peace process.  That is essential. Senator O'Toole raised some constitutional issues in relation to this Bill.  I am sure that the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons looked at these issues carefully. That convention is the forerunner to this legislation and the Bill would not have been possible were it not for that convention.</P>
      <P>When discussing this Bill we are talking about republican prisoners in Britain, even though they are not mentioned.  Six hundred Irish nationals are in prison throughout the world.  Each of these prisoners has the same entitlement to request a transfer as political prisoners in Britain. However, run of the mill criminals are involved in a revolving door syndrome in our prison system. People who should be in prison are on the streets one week later.  In such a situation we cannot open the sluice gates to criminals abroad who get homesick.  The discretion ultimately lies with the Minister, but I would have grave concerns about placing further strain on our prison system.  I am not speaking about political prisoners in Britain with whom this Bill is designed to deal.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill from a humanitarian viewpoint. We know the problems and the cost involved in visiting prisoners in Britain.  I can foresee legal battles concerning prisoners who have received the maximum 35 year sentence in Britain.  What happens in cases where that jurisdiction decides that it will not allow a reduction in the sentence in the state to which a prisoner is being returned?  This may result in more money for legal teams and, as always, the taxpayer will have to foot the bill.  I would not like to see such a situation arising.</P>
      <P>The previous Government introduced the forerunner to this legislation which will enable the Bill to pass.  I have no great concerns with the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister has scored a first on two counts this week.  This is an important milestone in the history of Seanad debates.  He scored a first in that he has four Bills before the House this week.  From my recollection of events in the Lower House, he has also scored a first in that the Second Stage debates of all four Bills are being taken this week.  Ordinarily we would be surprised and express amazement that a Minister could make such an achievement.  However, in the case of this Minister, I am not surprised because of the time I spent with him in the Lower House.  I am aware of his ready grasp of the law and his understanding of the need to bring forward legislation in this and other areas as part of a comprehensive anti-crime package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never fail to be impressed by the Minister's work rate.  In that context I was deeply impressed when during his time in Opposition he introduced many important Bills which will be proven in time <Col N="89" /> to be landmarks on the road to effective anti-crime laws.  I am equally impressed that after such a short period in office the Minister has brought forward so many important Bills.  I commend him &mdash; I hope the House will support me in this regard &mdash; for delivering on commitments he made while in Opposition.</P>
    <P>If any Opposition spokesman who subsequently became a Minister was ever faced with a barrage of criticism in the national media, it is this Minister.  He is currently a target for &mdash; in some cases, reasonably legitimate &mdash; criticism in respect of statements and assertions he made and views he expressed.</P>

      <P>Yes, certain people must have their fun.  However, they should not do so during debates on such important and significant Bills.  While I fully sympathise with the grievances of Members on the other side of the House, contributions &mdash; I do not proffer my own as being special &mdash; on such an important and timely Bill should not be interrupted.</P>
      <P>This short Bill is an amendment to section 7 of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, and is designed to overcome a bottleneck which occurred as a result of the workings of that Act. The bottleneck arose from the unwillingness of certain states, particularly Britain, to operate under the 1995 Act where a court had the right to adapt sentences where incompatibility occurred.  It revolved around a certain category of prisoner, namely, seven Provisional IRA prisoners held in Britain.  At this early stage, it is important that the Minister, recognising the existence of the bottleneck, brought forward this legislation to address it and ensure the smooth operation of the 1995 Act.</P>
      <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, was introduced to enable the ratification of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and it was welcomed by all sides of the House.  I am glad to discover that all sides of the House equally welcome this amending legislation.  Brief as it is, the Bill will be equally significant in promoting the smooth repatriation of prisoners where there is full compliance with the conditions outlined and defined by the Minister and other Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the 1995 Act was brought before the House, there were in excess of 600 Irish nationals serving sentences in other jurisdictions.  As Senator Caffrey indicated, it is fair to state that successive Governments, in taking account of and <Col N="90" /> considering the convention, were concerned about the impact of such transfers or repatriations on the Irish prison system.  However, I understand that on closer examination ways and means to alleviate that concern have been discovered. None of these is more spectacular than the Minister's decision to increase prison spaces by over 50 per cent of current capacity.  There is no doubt that our prisons are bursting at the seams or that a repatriation of 300 to 600 prisoners from foreign jurisdictions, all at once or over a short period, would have dire consequences in respect of prison conditions. However, a phased repatriation programme &mdash; which is likely to happen &mdash; in addition to making additional spaces available will address this problem.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental underlying principle of the convention and the 1995 Act involves a response, on humanitarian grounds, to the concerns of this jurisdiction in respect of Irish nationals serving sentences in foreign prisons and, as other Members stated, its concerns about their families.  It is unnecessary to deprive relatives of access to members of their families incarcerated in foreign prisons.  Incarceration is, by definition of the sentence and the law which guides and directs it, an adequate punishment not only for the prisoner serving it but also for his or her family. People should not be deprived of access to members of their families.  While I accept some of Senator Caffrey's concerns, I believe that any modern democracy with a degree of humanity must take into account concerns relating to prisoners and the potential for their rehabilitation. As other Members stated, in many cases ongoing contact with their families facilitates such rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>Of more fundamental importance is the significance of this legislation in addressing an important stage in the development of Anglo-Irish relations, that is, the peace process.  We are at a critical stage where new momentums have been given by both Governments.  For example, the Taoiseach's meeting last week with David Trimble was a milestone in the history of Anglo-Irish relations, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland.  To my knowledge, it is the first time a Taoiseach has met the leader of the main Unionist party.  It is imperative, therefore, that both Governments do everything possible and avail of every opportunity, resource and initiative to propel that process forward.  I welcome the contribution this Bill will make in facilitating and reassuring the British Government and in breaking down its reluctance to facilitate the transfer of a limited number of Provisional IRA prisoners for the reasons to which Senator Caffrey, other Senators and the Minister adverted.</P>
    <P>From speaking with the Minister since his appointment, I understand there has been tremendous co-operation between his office, that of his counterpart in Britain and Ministers in Northern Ireland and that smooth transfers have taken place, and did so before his appointment. <Col N="91" /> It is vital that the process of repatriation continues, that hard cases, which cause difficulties and are sensitive for the British establishment are addressed and that the assurances provided in this Bill, which I am sure will be adequate, reassure the British authorities of the Minister's commitment and sense of responsibility in addressing their concerns and successfully remove the bottlenecks.  It is imperative that any bottleneck which inhibits or slows down the momentum of the peace process is cleared as quickly as possible.  It is heartening that the Minister has risen to this challenge at such an early stage.</P>
    <P>During the 1980s I travelled to Britain on a number of occasions where I met representatives of organisations representing the Irish community. It would be remiss of me not to pay a compliment to them on the work they have done over many years for Irish emigrants.  I met some councils where &mdash; it was almost as if the League of Nations was present &mdash; the Irish community was held in extremely high regard, primarily because of the work of these Irish organisations. The previous Minister and, I am sure, this Minister would commend the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas which has done vital work in assisting the welfare of Irish emigrants.  The commission and organisations representing Irish residents in Britain have reached out to our prisoners there in a meaningful way.  I commend the Minister and welcome the Bill, which appears to have the support of all sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the broad package of legislation he has presented to this and the other House.  I commend the Leader on initiating four Bills in the House, which has been noted by others and is a record.  However, I must protest that we are taking this legislation in less than three hours and that all Stages must be completed by 2 p.m. There might have been justification for a guillotine if the Bill had gone through the other House first, but this important legislation was initiated here.  It requires careful examination and analysis.  Contributions made, the document read into the record by Senator O'Dowd relating to the reservations of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas and questions raised on the constitutionality of this measure in terms of precedence in law require considerable analysis which can be done only on Committee and Report Stages.  It appears Second Stage will take up most of the time and that we will have a limited amount of time to deal with amendments tabled.  It is unacceptable to the House that legislation should be passed in a day because we need time for reflection.  It is an insult to legislators that it must happen in this way and I protest against it in the strongest terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act was fine legislation.  The European convention was introduced in 1983 and ratified in 1986.  Unfortunately, we were the last country in the EU to <Col N="92" /> enact the convention.  Thankfully, we did so in 1995 even though at the time there was a fear that there would be a huge influx of prisoners into this country.  Approximately 140 prisoners have applied to date, as was expected by the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas.  Roughly one-tenth of those eligible to apply have done so.</P>
    <P>This legislation has a good and humanitarian purpose and will facilitate families rather than prisoners.  It will ensure families will not have to travel long distances, incur large expenses or endure hardship when visiting relations and friends in distance climes.  Because we are an island community, anybody visiting a prisoner in another jurisdiction other than Northern Ireland must travel by air or sea, which may be very expensive.</P>
    <P>There are considerable concerns about the delay in transfers to date.  Approximately twothirds of those who have applied have not had their applications processed.  Each jurisdiction seems to blame the other.  When I get in touch with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am assured there is no delay there and when I contact the Home Office, I am told the same and yet two thirds of applications have been received for 22 months and have not been processed. We need to streamline procedures and set a time scale for processing applications when the prisoner applies.  It is important to say that because we are talking about amending legislation for a specific group of prisoners.  For the majority of prisoners who have applied, the administrative side has fallen down and they are waiting for their applications to be processed. Prisoners who have contacted me and other Members of this or the other House have made the same complaint.  They cannot understand why it takes so long; the process is confusing in terms of who is responsible for the delay and they are not kept abreast of where their application stands.  These matters should also be addressed.</P>
    <P>Tariffs are an administrative matter for the Home Office and have nothing to do with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; legislation is not required in this regard. Why can that not be set when it has been promised for the past 12 months or more?  The repatriation process cannot begin until such time as the tariffs are set.</P>
    <P>Although the legislation has given rise for concerns, it is welcome in that its purpose and intent is to facilitate the transfer of prisoners who were finding it difficult to have their applications processed without an enabling provision of this nature. Perhaps the Minister will clarify how the need for such an amendment arose.  Who was responsible for the initiative?  Did it come from the Home Office?  Did it come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  Why was it suddenly discovered out of the blue that there were seven prisoners for whom amending legislation would be required?  Why did not it happen in 1995 or 1996?  These people submitted <Col N="93" /> their applications a long time ago.  Why did it happen and who was responsible?</P>
    <P>The Bill refers both to the legal nature and the duration of time.  It refers to all prisoners, even though the Minister stated in his opening remarks it is intended to refer to seven prisoners in a particular jurisdiction.  There is no reference to a number of prisoners, a category of prisoner, a jurisdiction, a period of time, a sentence or an offence.  It is a generic, wide ranging provision.  It could apply to Turkey, China or any other jurisdiction which has or will have in the future reciprocal legislation of this nature with us.</P>
    <P>That gives rise to considerable concerns.  Why is it not tied down in any way?  Does it mean that any jurisdiction can make similar demands on us in relation to its transfer process and that we would have to introduce amending legislation to suit that jurisdiction if it is not prepared to make the transfers subject to the decision, which is normally made be the court, on the nature of the offence when the Minister makes an application on receipt of that application?</P>
    <P>It also raises a constitutional question.  If people in another jurisdiction were sentenced for conspiracy to 35 years imprisonment, and the maximum comparable sentence in this jurisdiction was 20 years, combined with the one-quarter remission in this jurisdiction and the one-third remission in the sentencing jurisdiction, effectively we are doubling the length of sentence. It seems to me that at some future date a court could decide that this is unfair and contrary to natural justice.  Where then would we be?  Has the Minister addressed the particular concerns that we are effectively introducing a very stiff new sentencing process which has not been imposed by this jurisdiction but by another?  Another jurisdiction has insisted that we accept fully a very severe sentence, half of which this jurisdiction would regard as the maximum warranted sentence.</P>
    <P>It also brings into question other sentences which are relatively similar in nature, where prisoners have already been sentenced here for the same type of offence, such as conspiracy, with other offences, such as possession and where the major part of the sentence would relate to conspiracy &mdash; in fact, more than 20 years of the sentence could relate to conspiracy.  How does that tie in with this Bill when a number of prisoners convicted of similar offences have already been transferred to this jurisdiction and no such amending legislation was required?  Many such issues need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>What will happen in the future should the peace process succeed?  We know how much the prisoner issue contributed to the peace process. How will that work down the road should the Minister, or one of his successors, wish to grant an amnesty or pardon when he has already introduced amending legislation which will respect the integrity of the offence, when he has gone to the High Court and applied to have the sentence so respected?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> I say all this because I spoke to most of the people who will be affected by this legislation only last Thursday and Friday.  While they welcome the legislation in principle, they are not anxious that precedents be established on their behalf which could have a detrimental effect on the authority of the legislative and judicial processes in this jurisdiction.  These are matters to which I hope the Minister has answers.  I will be listening carefully to his response because there are many issues which need to be teased out and carefully explained.  These concerns were expressed to me by people who are directly affected and the organisations involved with prisoners, such as the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas &mdash; the Minister will presumably be aware of that organisation's concerns because, like me, he received a copy of the fax, which Senator O'Dowd read into the record, relating to the legal opinion it had received about these matters &mdash; NIACRO and the British Probation Officers Organisation.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Bill is being introduced with the best of intentions and it is intended that it would contribute substantially to the peace process because the prisoners were a party to the initiation of the peace process and the building of confidence in that regard.  It will also make many families happy in that it will bring their loved ones in prison close enough so that they can visit more often and without too much hardship. These outcomes are very desirable but for us, as legislators, the moot point is will this legislation stand the test of time and stand up to a constitutional challenge?  Is this legislation being directed by another jurisdiction in relation to a single category of offence?  Will we find similar demands being imposed upon us in future?  If that is the case, it would not be in the spirit of the convention which allows the discretion to be made in this jurisdiction by the High Court.  I am worried that we would get into the business of specifics in relation to one jurisdiction and one category of offence.</P>
    <P>I will listen carefully to the Minister's reply.  I hope he will accept some of our Committee Stage amendments.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House and join with others in commending him warmly for the nature and scale of this Bill.  For some weeks after the appointment of the Seanad we were grumbling that we did not have enough to do; now we are grumbling that we have too much to do.  That is a very good complaint.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I also acknowledge that, while this may appear to be a short Bill, it is of fundamental importance and it will have far-reaching consequences in this country on a number of fronts.  First, it enables us to incorporate into Irish law the provisions of the Council of Europe convention, and it is important that that would be done.  Second, by so doing, it helps us to advance decent humanitarian principles.</P>

      <P>The application of this legislation in the context of the ongoing talks will be an important element in the process of confidence building.  When historians research and write about the role played by prisoners in the Northern Ireland troubles, specifically since the introduction of internment, and their involvement at key times, such as the dirty blanket protests and the Birmingham Six, it will be seen that prisoners and the way their issues were treated by both sides were a potent force in the Northern Ireland troubles.  It is welcome in the context of the recent peace process that prisoners were a potent force in creating the conditions for peace.  That is an important factor which must be acknowledged and which merits more time for discussion than we have today.  Members on both sides acknowledged that by giving an unguarded welcome to this Bill.  We hope it will have a beneficial effect, in the short and medium term, in bringing about not only permanent peace but also the political conditions in which all people on this island can live side by side as civilised communities in a modern democratic state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is also important in that it acknowledges the great hardship families undergo when a member &mdash; often, though not always, the father &mdash; is in prison.  When a member is in prison in a different jurisdiction, the hardship is multiplied many times.  There is suffering at both levels.  The imprisoned person in a different jurisdiction and culture is removed from the nourishment he or she draws from other family members and which often leads to a change of heart and helps towards their rehabilitation.  I cannot imagine that any man looking into the eyes of his young children would not be prepared to reconsider the deed that put him in prison in the first place and would not be prompted on the road to rehabilitation and leading a crime free life.  That becomes <Col N="96" /> extremely difficult when prisoners are at a great distance from their families.  It is important to minimise the hardship for families who want to visit the person in prison.  By repatriating prisoners we are helping greatly to do this and that is the second positive point of this legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill can and, I hope, will have positive and long-term benefits for all parts of this country. When examined in detail, it is very broad and has applications far wider than for IRA prisoners serving in British prisons.  I was a little cautious when I heard a previous speaker speak of an amnesty for all prisoners.  I remind Members we are a considerable distance from the point and time when I hope that will be a reasonable prospect. We must move towards it in a series of reasoned and reasonable steps.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes wisely cautioned that we must always take into account not only the welfare and future of the prisoner but also the feelings and future of the victim.  That is a fine balance which must be maintained when dealing with crime.  With political crimes, we are dealing with a much wider pool and are at a finely balanced and critical point in the talks.  We must maintain the balance between sides which are only beginning to grow marginally comfortable with each other.  It takes much time, patience and reasoned discussion &mdash; listening, talking and otherwise &mdash; to wear out the folk memory and bitterness which besets a society when terrorism has continued for a long time.  It is a slow process which must be underpinned with measured, finely tuned legislation.  This Bill meets that standard and, while I recognise that we will visit this issue again, I warmly welcome it and give it my party's full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues I welcome this significant legislation.  I listened with great interest to the contributions, particularly that of Senator Costello who has a long track record on prisoners' rights and interests.  I share some of his concerns but I have every confidence in the Minister and the Department, who have gone into some detail not only in the drafting of the legislation, in which balance is required, but also in negotiations with the British authorities leading to the drafting and presentation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This legislation is an act of faith on the part of our Government.  There was a logjam in that the British authorities refused point blank to agree to the transfer of prisoners because they did not believe the Irish Government would agree to the sentencing policy imposed by the British courts. We are now signing up to the European Convention on the Transfer of Prisoners and that is a welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case of Irish prisoners in British jails &mdash; as distinct from Irish prisoners in jails elsewhere, who are also affected by this legislation &mdash; has been a running sore for the duration of the war since 1968.  In this time many people have been sentenced in British courts for terrorist offences. I have taken more than a passing interest in these <Col N="97" /> cases, including the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the less high profile cases.  It always struck me that younger, more idealistic terrorists, irrespective of their motives, carried out the most heinous crimes against humanity.  The people I felt for were the families, who were as much victims as those who were bombed and killed.  Many of them, particularly the younger members of families, have been scarred to an extraordinary degree.  For a variety of reasons, not least the petty vindictiveness of the British prison system, sons and daughters of prisoners were unable to meet their fathers and if they did have an opportunity to visit, it was so restricted they were not allowed to display basic affection such as putting their arms round them.  One can imagine the long-term psychological impact on youngsters who saw their fathers in jail and were unable to hold their hand.</P>
    <P>As a result of the ceasefires and the easing of tension in Anglo-Irish affairs and North-South relations, one hopes that day is now gone.  The recent downgrading of the security status of republican prisoners in the UK has meant that families are not only able to visit on a more regular basis but can have open visits.  The groundswell of anger and trauma, coupled with the desire to visit imprisoned spouses and family members on a regular basis, has led us to this important juncture in Anglo-Irish relations.  For that reason if for no other I welcome this initiative.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the ongoing peace process and, like the Government, I believe the issue of prisoners is central to unblocking any obstacle which may arise as the peace process negotiations continue and, one hopes, arrive at a fruitful conclusion.  Preventing the consideration of issues concerning loyalist and republican prisoners in Northern Ireland will have a detrimental effect on the long-term viability of any political settlement.  This is within the Minister's brief and as a result of his many dealings with his opposite number in Britain and the Northern Ireland Office, he is more aware than most that this issue is central to a future political settlement on the island.  The significance of this legislation is all the more enhanced by the delicate position of the ongoing negotiations.</P>
    <P>I join colleagues in paying tribute to the unsung heroes, those who represent English mainstream liberal opinion, which is sadly not always evident here but has been a part of the British tradition for many decades on a variety of human rights issues.  Ms Gareth Pierce has represented many Irish prisoners on remand, some of whom have been convicted of awful crimes.  Her compassion and humanity in dealing with prisoners and their families has been nothing short of saintly.  If we refer to the late Mother Teresa in revered tones, we should place Gareth Pierce in the pantheon along side her, as another person with a humane view of life.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Irish Prisoners Overseas, set up on the initiative of the church, carries out <Col N="98" /> extremely valuable work not only with Irish republican prisoners in the UK but with Irish prisoners all over the world.  This legislation will prove an attractive option for prisoners in other parts of the world who have for some time requested the possibility of transfer back to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello and others touched on the act of faith on the part of the Irish Government.  For instance, will this jurisdiction honour the agreement, solemnly entered into, to ensure continuation of sentence?  The Minister pointed out that Article 10 of the convention is concerned with this point.  It should be emphasised that the State may, by court or administrative order, adapt the sanction to the punishment or measure prescribed by its own law for similar offences.  There is no legal obligation on the State to change the sentence and it can only be done at the request of the Minister of the day.  The precedent set by this Minister, which will be adhered to by his successors, will ensure that the legal agreements entered into &mdash; and the moral imperative on any future Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; will be binding.  Notwithstanding that, one hopes that with a future political settlement encompassing all the people of the island and the resulting improvement in Anglo-Irish relations, the issue of prisoners will be addressed in a general sense.  Hopefully, at that point the severity of many of these sentences may be reviewed.  For the purposes of the Bill a strong message has been sent by the Minister.  As drafted it is the best that can be done in the prevailing circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Bill will lessen tension and create an environment in which families will be able to visit their loved ones without the difficulty and expense of travel.  I hope it will make a contribution to the peace process.  I also hope there will be a humanity in the Irish prison system which was lacking in the British prison system for the prisoners concerned.  I cannot help but reflect on the late Giuseppe Conlon as an example of the petty vindictiveness of the British prison system towards Irish prisoners.  He was an innocent man who died primarily as a result of the treatment he received in a British jail.  Whatever we may think of our prison system I hardly think such a situation would pertain in an Irish jail.</P>
    <P>The severity of sentences is a tradition in British law which does not only apply to republican prisoners.  The great train robbers received excessive sentences for the crime they committed. I hope a message might be sent to the British judicial establishment with regard to the severity of sentences.  One must question the heavy sentences handed down to many prisoners.  The crimes were awful but I wonder if the sentences were a vindictive revenge on the part of the British establishment because the persons were Irish.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.  Reference was made <Col N="99" /> to delays in processing applications for transfers. I appreciate that the time it will take to process applications for transfers can be frustrating for those concerned, but owing to the complexity of the documentation required to effect the transfer, the administrative process can be time consuming. For example, legal confirmation must be obtained that the offences for which sentences are being served would constitute offences under Irish law.  When the application is consented to by the sentencing state, the administering state and the person seeking the transfer an application must then be made to the High Court for the necessary warrant authorising the person's transfer and subsequent imprisonment here before the actual physical transfer can take place between the two jurisdictions concerned.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that every effort is made to process each application as speedily as possible when the three way consent of the jurisdictions involved and the person concerned is forthcoming. It must be remembered that two jurisdictions are involved, so the pace at which an individual transfer application is dealt with is not entirely within our control.</P>
      <P>With regard to transfers from the UK, I keep in touch regularly with the Home Secretary and I wish to record my appreciation of the attention which he gives to these matters.  There is a high level of co-operation between my Department and the Home Office in processing applications. The House will appreciate that the question of transfers of prisoners from Britain to the North is not directly within my remit, but it is a matter in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs takes a particular interest.  I will bring to his attention the points made on this issue in the debate.</P>
      <P>Given the context in which this legislation is being proposed it was inevitable that the debate would touch on a number of aspects concerning the North.  I am sure the House will bear with me if I say a few words on political developments generally.  There has been substantial progress in the multi-party negotiations since September.  We have come a long way since the stalemate of the first 15 months of the talks, but much remains to be achieved.  As a legacy of Northern Ireland's difficult history there is a lack of intercommunity trust and mutual confidence.  Building this trust and confidence will enable the two sides to reach to each other and make the necessary compromises and accommodations which will lead to lasting peace.  The Government attaches deep importance to building confidence as an essential element in the underpinning of peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of areas where sensitive and generous action can be taken and where it can make a significant difference to the talks process. One of the most important of these, as this Bill recognises, is the issue of prisoners.  The assurance of a peaceful atmosphere has helped to provide the necessary foundation on which to promote meaningful dialogue between the parties <Col N="100" /> and to develop measures to increase reconciliation and trust.  It is essential that we focus in an imaginative and progressive way on all the questions relating to those who have been imprisoned in the context of the conflict, both republican and loyalist, while also giving full attention to the concerns of the victims of violence.</P>
    <P>If we are to achieve lasting peace there must be progress in the multi-party negotiations towards a political settlement.  As the chairman of the talks, George Mitchell, has put it, the talks are now getting down to brass tacks.  We need to step up the pace and get into more intensive negotiations on the core issues.  A small working group of the chief negotiators from each party and the two Governments has been engaged in identifying those key issues where agreement seems to be required.  The working group has been considering how to organise the work ahead to deal with the crucial issues.  The working group will report on 15 December to the review plenary which will lay out a work programme for the second phase of the talks which we are now entering and which will be the decisive phase.</P>
    <P>The broad outlines of an agreement are already clear.  Its basic characteristics across the key relationships should be partnership, fairness and mutual respect.  The Framework Document and the draft report of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation represent the basis of the Government's approach.  We do not wish to impose a blueprint on anyone.  We are willing to examine any proposals which meet agreed objectives.  It is not for the Government to prescribe the form of institutions in Northern Ireland, but there should be structures which allow the two communities to work together for their shared benefit on a wide range of issues.</P>
    <P>Nationalists and Unionists must feel an equal stake in their society, an equal sense of ownership. Reforms promoting justice and equality, including in the policing area, should also be agreed.  There is a need for new North-South structures which, as the Taoiseach said in Belfast on Monday, will enable mutual co-operation in the interests of developing the issues that will be common to the island of Ireland.  Such structures will also serve to express the Nationalist sense of an all-Ireland identity.  They must be meaningful and have the capacity to make decisions and agree policies.  They can only work by agreement and in a democratically accountable fashion.</P>
    <P>We are also willing to develop more substantial East-West links.  These would allow for enhanced co-operation between Ireland and Britain on a wide range of practical issues.  We recognise that these matters are of particular importance to Unionists.  Devolution within Britain opens up a range of exciting new possibilities.  As part of these changes we have expressed our willingness to replace the Anglo Irish Agreement with a new and more broadly based agreement.  These arrangements must be compatible with each other.  Indeed, they should be interlocking and <Col N="101" /> mutually supportive.  It is impossible to address any one of our key relationships in isolation. There was also a need for balanced constitutional change in both jurisdictions.  In the context of a satisfactory settlement we would, as set out in the Framework Document, propose the amendment of our Constitution.  It is also very important &mdash; and there is already a broad consensus among the parties on this matter &mdash; that this institutional structure be underpinned by provisions which address the equality, justice and human rights agendas.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the challenge that faces all participants in the talks to find acceptable political structures which can command the agreement of both communities. However, the elements of a settlement exist and if we seize the opportunity these can be combined into a comprehensive and durable agreement. The talks provide our best chance to achieve such an outcome.  We must all build on the good work of the autumn and work together to reach agreement by May.  The Bill has a significant role to play in confidence building measures and it is in this context that I warmly thank Senators for the wonderful co&mdash;operation they have so far given in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole and Hayes raised the issue of remission rates.  Under the convention sentences are governed by the law of the state to which the prisoner is transferred.  This means that the balance of a sentence of somebody transferred here is subject to our remission rate, which is one quarter. However, in considering cases for release, a Minister could take into account the fact that a person would have been entitled to a higher remission rate in the sentencing state as one of the factors to be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole wondered whether the Bill raises constitutional issues.  It is because of such issues that the 1995 Act requires a court to issue a warrant before a person can be transferred into this jurisdiction.  The 1995 Act is not relevant to trials taking place in the jurisdiction for offences committed elsewhere but deals only with persons already sentenced.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello mentioned discussions about Ireland's legislation and I know the Senator has taken a particular interest in one issue.  I met with the relevant groups, including the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas on 10 November with which I had a wide ranging and most helpful discussion. Senator Costello also wondered about the origins of this legislation.  I initiated the legislation &mdash; I do not mean to be boastful &mdash; in the context of considering particular cases which came before me.  Having studied those cases I realised it would not be possible for me under existing legislation to give a categoric assurance to the Government of the United Kingdom that I would be in a position to respect the integrity of sentences handed down by its courts.  It is of fundamental importance that the British Government be assured this <Col N="102" /> happens, failing which there is the possibility that it would not transfer any more prisoners.  In such circumstances I felt it appropriate to amend Irish law to ensure I could give a categoric assurance to the UK Government that, in respect of transfers, I would be in a position to guarantee respect for the integrity of sentences handed down in British courts.  That is the genesis of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the legislation will pass through this House and the Dáil before Christmas.  The issue of prisoners is of considerable importance &mdash; it cannot be overstated &mdash; to the peace process.  My sincere wish is that, following passage of this legislation and the assurances I will then be in a position to give to the British Government regarding respect for the integrity of sentences handed down in British courts, we will see further transfers of Irish prisoners held in British jails in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) in subsection (4), after &ldquo;remission of sentence accrued in the sentencing state,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and such remission of sentence as would be likely to accrue if the sentence were to be served in that state, provided that such remission would be at least as favourable to the person transferred as the remission which would apply to a similar sentence</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment.  The amending legislation provides for the integrity of the sentence in the context of the sentencing state to be retained within the host country once the transfer takes place.  It does not make provision for remission, while the convention and the original legislation referred to remission operating in the host jurisdiction.  It would seem reasonable that where there is greater remission in the sentencing country as opposed to the host country, remission should operate at least as favourably in the host country as when the sentence was imposed.  The Minister could easily accept this amendment, which would not interfere with the integrity of the sentence.  It would also mitigate against a harsh sentence in the host country in the context of the maximum sentence being 35 years as against 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister said it is open to him to take into account disparities in remission, the Bill deals with sentencing but makes no provision for remission.  I would prefer if the issue was dealt with in the Bill rather than leaving it on an <i>ad</i><Col N="103" /><i>hoc</i> basis.  The Minister is not going to deal with every transferred prisoner and every sentence. Therefore, I commend this important amendment which is appropriate in the context of the legislation. I have discussed it with the various bodies involved in the prisoner issue both here and abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the thinking behind Senator Costello's amendment.  At present when a court is issuing a warrant for continued enforcement under section 7 of the Act it has due regard to any remission of sentence accrued in the sentencing state.  The amendment seeks to allow a court to also take into account any remission likely to accrue to that person if they remained in the sentencing state once that arrangement was beneficial to that person. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept the amendment for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>Article 9 of the Council of Europe Convention states that the enforcement of the sentence shall be governed by the law of the administering state and that state alone shall be competent to take all appropriate decisions.  This provision is obviously fundamental to the operation of the convention and it means, in effect, that transferred prisoners are subject to the same remission arrangements which apply to other prisoners.  This principle is underpinned by section 7(4) of the Act which states that the warrant issued by the court shall otherwise have the same force and effect as a warrant imposing a sentence following conviction by that court.  The sentence is to be treated as if it had been imposed in this country.</P>
      <P>Even if the issue of adherence to the convention did not arise, there appears to be a practical difficulty with the proposal in that remission is earned for good conduct and is prospective in nature.  It could be argued that to seek to have a court grant remission in advance in such circumstances would be to overlook the nature of remission.  It can also be argued, given the principle that remission exists to encourage good conduct, that it would be invidious to discriminate between prisoners in Ireland on the basis of where they received their sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not dismissing the concerns expressed by Senator Costello.  I am sure the House appreciates the sensitive issues involved and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases.  However, sentences under the Act are subject to our laws governing remission, but they are equally subject to our laws governing temporary release.  There is nothing in our law to prevent the Minister taking into account administratively, when considering a decision in relation to release, the fact that a person would have been likely to have gained a higher level of remission if they had remained in the jurisdiction in which he or she was sentenced.  In these circumstances and given the provisions of the convention I mentioned, I regret that I am unable to accept the <Col N="104" /> amendment.  I hope Senator Costello will agree that it would not be helpful to pursue the matter at this stage.  However, I assure him that I have taken careful note of his remarks on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the convention provides for a different approach.  However, the amendment is to the legislation which will implement the convention and would not be at variance with it.  It would dovetail well because the legislation and not the convention would be amended.</P>
      <P>The Minister made an interesting statement about the current stage of the peace process in his reply to the Second Stage debate.  The Bill was obviously introduced, as the Minister pointed out because he is its author, to resolve a problem he faced in relation to the integrity of sentences of republican prisoners.  The Bill states that remission would be at least as favourable to the person transferred as the remission that would apply to a similar sentence in this State.  There is a disparity in terms of remission rates which are a third in Britain, a half in Northern Ireland and a quarter in this jurisdiction.  The Minister should take the amendment on board.  I will put it to a vote if he is not prepared to consider it positively between now and the debate in the other House. The amendment has substantial merits and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I cannot consider accepting the amendment because Article 9 of the convention states: &ldquo;The enforcement of the sentence shall be governed by the law of the administering state and that state alone shall be competent to take all appropriate decisions.&rdquo; This provision is fundamental to the convention. It means that people who are transferred to this jurisdiction are subject to the same remission rates as other prisoners here.  The fact that the convention specifically states that the enforcement of the sentence shall be governed by the law of the administering state suggests that the Senator seeks to supplant the provisions of the convention with his amendment.  I cannot agree to that.</P>
      <P>An international obligation has been entered into and it was brought into force by the 1995 Act, which the Bill amends.  If I was to interfere in the manner suggested by Senator Costello, I would supplant Article 9 of the convention.  This would raise the issue of whether I was breaching the international convention.  I do not wish to give the impression that I intend to reject every amendment tabled by Senator Costello, but I have a particular difficulty with regard to amendment No. 1 which I cannot overcome.  In those circumstances I ask him to reconsider the position. I appreciate and understand his objective.  I am aware that different remission rates exist, but the convention is specific regarding the function of the administering state in relation to enforcement.</P>

      <P>In page 3, lines 24 to 26, to delete &ldquo;in his or her absolute discretion if he or she thinks it appropriate to do so&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;where he or she considers it appropriate and where the prisoner concerned, after being fully advised of the effect in relation to him or her, has expressly indicated in writing his or her consent</P>

      <P>The point of the amendment is already covered by section 6(5) of the 1995 Act. This specifies that the Minister must be satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to inform the sentenced person concerned in writing in his or her own language of the effect of any warrant which may be issued in respect of him or her.  It is difficult to understand how the amendment is a safeguard for prisoners.  The issue in such an application would be to have the sentence imposed in the sentencing state reduced.  It is unlikely any prisoner would fail to consent to this approach, particularly given the provisions of section 6(5) of the 1995 Act.  Accordingly and unfortunately, I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  It arises from the point that it is important applications are fully considered.  It is also important the applications are in writing to ensure it is obvious that the prisoner understands the implications of the transfer.  A number of issues have been raised in relation to remission and other aspects which could lead to prisoners serving a substantially longer sentence than they would have served in the sentencing jurisdiction.  That will not interfere with the procedure other than to copperfasten it, so that those making applications know exactly what they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply may not have been as clear as it should have been.  Section 6(5) of the 1995 Act covers this matter.  It states that the Minister may not consent to a request under subsections (1) or (2) of the Act unless he or she is satisfied that all reasonable steps have been take to inform the sentenced person concerned in writing in his or her own language of the substance, so far as relevant to the person's case of the international arrangements in accordance with which it is proposed to transfer him or her and the effect in relation to the person of any warrant which may be issued in respect of him or her under section 7 of the Act.  The person must also be informed of the effect in relation to the person of the law relating to his or her detention under such <Col N="106" /> a warrant and of the powers of the Minister under section 9 of the Act.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment, laudable as it may be, has already been achieved in section 6(5) of the 1995 Act.  Accordingly, the amendment is superfluous.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) The period of operation of section 5(b) shall be 12 months from the commencement of the operation of this Act unless a Resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas resolving that the subsection will</P>
      <P>This is a very unusual measure which means that prisoners will serve sentences longer than those prescribed in Irish law.  It is designed to deal with the particular situation of a number of Irish prisoners sentenced to terms of 30 to 35 years, while the equivalent offence in Irish law carries a maximum term of 20 years.  It is generally undesirable to have a situation where some prisoners in Irish prisons are requested to serve sentences longer than those prescribed by Irish law, and this might also be open to legal challenge.  If the prisoners concerned wish to be transferred here, even on conditions that they serve longer terms, it may be reasonable to facilitate them. However, if a general power to imprison transferred prisoners for periods longer than the equivalent Irish sentence is introduced, it could allow a Minister to consent to persons being transferred here which could otherwise be regarded as excessive or unjust.  This could arise in the case of transfers from a country like Turkey if it were party to the convention, and that could be unacceptable even if the prisoner concerned agreed to it.  It is probably contrary to the spirit of the convention to limit any such legislation to one or more countries.  Because of these concerns and the unusual nature of the legislation, I will press the amendment.  The Minister should inform us of how things may have changed.  It is important to review within 12 months legislation like this processed urgently.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Dowd's amendment.  It is important that certain legislation is not forgotten.  It is in the Minister's interest, given difficulties in his Department in recent years, that a review should be done to see if improvements need to be made.  This amendment is reasonable and the Minister should accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Dowd's important amendment.  The legislation relates specifically to seven prisoners whose sentences in another jurisdiction are in excess of those permitted here.  Once that transfer has been processed, <Col N="107" /> there seems to be no immediate need for the legislation.  While the Act is couched in general terms and might apply to a range of offences in any jurisdiction, it has been introduced for a specific reason.  It would be improper that the legislation lapse once it has fulfilled its function.  This could be done by providing that it would cease to operate after 12 months unless reasons why it should continue are presented to the Oireachtas. Checks and balances are necessary for our legislation. Many concerns expressed here would be modified if the Minister accepted this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be forgotten that a section of the 1995 Act appears to be inefficient. We are currently dealing with Provisional IRA prisoners in Britain, and the lacuna in the 1995 Act has necessitated this Act.  If the amendment were accepted, it would defeat the purpose of the legislation.  In the current climate a prerequisite for the transfer of any prisoners is acceptance that the sentences imposed must be respected.  This applies particularly to Britain, which is the country we are most likely to deal with.  Sentences here will have to be adapted so that any prisoner transferred here does not serve a lesser sentence because of that transfer.  This amendment would defeat the thrust of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is neither desirable nor necessary.  Experience of the operation of the convention has shown that some States are not prepared to consent to transfers unless a guarantee can be given that the sentence imposed will not be reduced.  If the sentencing state decides not to transfer a prisoner on the basis that the sentence would be reduced if that occurred, the legislation and convention would be rendered superfluous.  In reality, some countries insist upon the integrity of their sentences being respected by the state to which a prisoner is transferred. Because consent is a three-way process, there is nothing the administering state can do. One would not be in the real world if one felt one could oblige a state to consent.  One of the main concerns of sentencing states is that the integrity of their sentencing is respected.  If that does not happen, there are no transfers, and in that case the convention cannot work.  That is the position in the real world.</P>
      <P>The only way in which I could give assurances to the British Home Secretary, for example, that the integrity of the sentences handed down by courts in his jurisdiction will be respected by courts in this jurisdiction is if the amendment to the 1995 Act proposed by this Bill is passed. Otherwise, it is quite clear I could not give the categoric assurances which are required.  It may be the case that other states will seek such categoric assurances in the future.  There may also be further cases, in addition to the seven cases to which Members are referring, where such a categoric assurance will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> The question of the need for categoric assurances is not locked into a 12 month timeframe or any other timeframe.  Such guarantees could be required at any time by any foreign jurisdiction. If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day is not in a position to give the required categoric assurance, that could only militate against the prisoner held in a foreign jurisdiction who wants to be transferred to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear this Bill will work to the advantage of applicant prisoners more than anyone else because of the requirement for three way consent. For example, the consent of this State and that of a prisoner in a British jail to his transfer to this jurisdiction is not sufficient &mdash; the British Government must also consent.  If the British Government felt in certain instances that we would not respect the integrity of sentences handed down in British courts, the entire arrangement would probably be cancelled.  Those are the pragmatic facts.  There is no mystery about it &mdash; it is quite lucid.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong in principle with what is being proposed.  However, the situation will not have changed in 12 months' time or the foreseeable future.  With the greatest respect, the amendment is pointless and should not be accepted.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd said the Bill was about people serving longer sentences in this jurisdiction than they would if they had been sentenced by an Irish court.  That is not what the Bill is about.  It is about this sovereign Government being in a position to give categoric assurances to a foreign jurisdiction, within the context of our legislation, that it will respect the integrity of sentences handed down by its courts.  It is about facing the reality that if we do not do that, the unfortunate prisoners who want to be near their families will not be able to be transferred.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not being proposed to do down prisoners or to ensure they serve longer sentences in this State than they received in other jurisdictions. It is about helping the transfer process by ensuring the Government can guarantee, where required, that the integrity of sentences imposed in foreign jurisdictions will be respected here.  While the Bill will immediately affect seven Provisional IRA prisoners, it is not confined exclusively to them in terms of its scope or timeframe.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave said I should accept this amendment in light of recent difficulties in my Department.  I am not aware of any recent difficulties in my Department.  I am aware of the attempt by some politicians, in these Houses and elsewhere, to&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House.  The British Government has in every transfer application to date sought an undertaking from the Minister for Justice that the integrity of the sentences will be respected.  This is the first time there has been a demand for legislation to copperfasten that position.  It is strange that we must suddenly introduce amending legislation when an undertaking to respect the integrity of the sentences has always been sought.  The previous Minister made a commitment to grant those undertakings.</P>
      <P>This is the only issue to arise over the past couple of years on which there has been a showdown and on which no progress can be made unless amending legislation is enacted.  It relates to a specific issue; otherwise, it would not be before us.  We must respect our own laws, criminal justice system and administration of justice.  It is not good for us, as legislators, to encourage a situation whereby any jurisdiction, not necessarily a democratic one but one such as Turkey, could insist that transferred prisoners serve out an unjust sentence imposed by a repressive regime.</P>
      <P>We can make a commitment to respect the integrity of sentences without statutory obligations. It behoves us, as good legislators, to ensure the legislation is operating properly. Therefore, it should be reviewed after 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is true the legislation addresses a specific issue, it is equally untrue to say it addresses specific individuals.  I hope it will be of benefit to certain prisoners whom this issue affects in the immediate future. <Col N="110" /> However, that is not to say the issue will not affect other prisoners in the future.  I cannot say that and, with all due respect, neither can Senator Costello nor anybody else.</P>
      <P>There is already a requirement under the Act for a report on its operation to be laid before the Oireachtas each year.  This is quite sufficient and there is no need for further such requirements.  I was not aware of a demand to change the legislation. It has been introduced by me on foot of assurances which I want to be in a position to give.  To date, I have been in a position to give categorical assurances with regard to prisoners transferred to this country that the integrity of their sentences would be respected.  I have been able to do that because of the fact that there was no great difference in terms of sanctions in either jurisdiction in respect of those cases.</P>
      <P>With regard to the seven cases concerned, the position now is that some of the prisoners are serving prison terms of 30 to 35 years, whereas the corresponding maximum sentence in this jurisdiction is 20 years.  In these circumstances it is clear that unless I amend the current legislation, as is proposed, I could not give categorical assurances with regard to prisoners who were given a greater sentence in a foreign jurisdiction than could have been imposed in this jurisdiction in respect of the same offence.</P>
      <P>The question did not arise before.  This is the first time that sentences greater than our maximum have been involved.  Were it the case that I did not, of my own volition, introduce this legislation then it would not be possible for me to give the categorical assurance which may be sought with regard to those, and future, prisoners. In that event, it must be clear that the prisoners would not be transferred.</P>
      <P>This legislation is designed to ensure that I can give the categorical assurance when it is requested so that prisoners can benefit from the convention and the legislation.  Any argument against that arises from a misinterpretation of what I am trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that, as far as practicable, the Minister makes a decision on an application within six months of the date of the application.  Amendment No. 6 seeks to keep the applicant informed on a regular basis about the progress of the application.  These matters were mentioned before in terms of the administration of justice because of delays experienced by prisoners and their families.  Approximately two thirds of prisoners wait more than 22 months for applications to be processed.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider these two amendments.</P>

      <P>As I indicated at the outset of the debate, I am prepared to take on board constructive amendments.  I consider amendments Nos. 5 and 6 to be constructive.  The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that, as far as practicable, applications are dealt with within six months and that an applicant is kept informed of their progress.  I assure the House that applications are dealt with as expeditiously as possible. It is important to emphasise that because of the involvement of the second jurisdiction the timescale is not entirely within our control.  Nevertheless, I appreciate the philosophy behind these amendments and in those circumstances I am prepared to accept them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes a right of appeal to the High Court against decisions made by the Minister on applications made under the convention.  Unfortunately, I cannot agree to the amendment.  Transfers take place under an international convention and arrangements for transfers are purely a matter for the executives of the states involved.  However, the convention has stated the right to refuse any application and it would be inappropriate for that <Col N="113" /> decision to be left, ultimately, to the courts.  This is what is proposed by the amendment.</P>
      <P>One of practical issues which arises is the effect which transfers have on the availability of prison accommodation.  It would be unthinkable for control over this matter to be taken away from the Minister.  I emphasised that decisions on transfers are policy matters for the Executive, not the courts.  Our courts are involved in transfers into the jurisdiction but that involvement relates to ensuring the lawfulness of the detention of a person who is being transferred.  The actual consent for the transfer is a decision for the Minister.</P>
      <P>As Minister, I am responsible to the Oireachtas for the actions which I take under the legislation. While I cannot accept this amendment, I assure Senator Costello and the House that I will continue to operate the convention to facilitate to the greatest possible extent transfers into the jurisdiction where they are warranted.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their courtesy and efficiency in dealing with this important legislation.  I agree with Senator Costello that it is undesirable to rush legislation through either House.  Unfortunately, this legislation is urgent for the future transfer of prisoners to this jurisdiction.  That is why I asked the House to take this Bill today and I am grateful to Senators for agreeing to do so.  The Bill will be brought to the Dáil and I, expect, passed expeditiously.  However, I do not wish to create a precedent.  Urgent legislation must be dealt with urgently.  In the vast majority of cases, legislation should be carefully analysed and thought out <Col N="114" /> prior to being passed.  This was an exceptional circumstance and I am grateful to the House for accommodating me in the manner in which it has.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and Members of the House for facilitating me by adjourning for 15 minutes as I had to attend a conference in Dublin Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years a dramatic increase in the number of cases coming before the courts has placed a very severe strain on the administration of justice in this country.  While significant improvements have resulted from the appointment of additional judges, the fact remains that we have <Col N="115" /> reached the stage where the current arrangements for the management of the courts, which have remained largely unaltered over the past 70 years, are not adequate to meet the demands that are being placed upon them.  This is a matter that has attracted concern both within and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>At a very early stage the Government recognised the need to ensure that parties involved directly with the courts and the general public can secure a quality service from the courts.  This was the basis for the undertaking given by the Government in its Action Programme for the Millennium to set up an independent courts service to manage the courts system more efficiently. I am happy to be in a position to bring before the Oireachtas the legislation required to give effect to that undertaking in the action plan.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of an independent body which will be known as the Courts Service and will assume my current functions in relation to the administration of the courts.  The policy of the service will be determined by the board of the service and day to day management will be the responsibility of a chief executive who will be appointed by the board.  The effect of these arrangements will be to introduce the most comprehensive and radical reform of court administration since the foundation of the State.  In order to ensure that the new measures are implemented as quickly as possible provision has also been made for the establishment of a transitional board and the appointment of a chief executive designate with a view to preparing for the full establishment of the service.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to deal in detail with the sections of the Bill I would like to provide a general outline of the background to its proposals. At the end of 1995, my predecessor established the Working Group on a Courts Commission chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham to review the operation and financing of the courts system and, in particular, to consider the matter of the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy. The previous Government agreed to the establishment of a Courts Service as a statutory body to manage a unified courts system as recommended by the working group.  The group's third report entitled <i>Towards the Courts Service</i> provided an outline of a legislative scheme to establish a Courts Service and this has served as the framework for the Courts Service (No. 2) Bill.</P>
    <P>I should not let the opportunity pass to pay tribute to Mrs. Justice Denham and the members of the working group who have invested and, indeed, continue to invest a very considerable amount of time and energy examining and reporting on the operation of key elements of the courts system.  Their valuable work has provided a very firm foundation for the legislative framework <Col N="116" /> for the new Courts Service and I am sure the House will join with me in giving due credit to Mrs. Justice Denham and the working group.</P>
    <P>A further development I would like to mention with reference to the measures contained in the Bill concerns the changes which are taking place within the framework of my Department.  As the Members of this House will be aware, there is a significant ongoing programme of organisational change in the Justice area.  Leaving aside my functions in relation to the Garda Síochána, which were dealt with in the Garda SMI document published recently, my responsibility for the administration of justice is discharged in the context of the relationship between my Department and the courts and the Prison Service.  Under the Strategic Management Initiative in my Department, the role of the Department is shifting away decisively from the day-to-day provision of support services for the courts and the administration of prisons. The Bill underpins this development in the courts area by transferring the function of managing the courts to the Courts Service, and I can inform the House that a prisons service Bill is being prepared to establish a prisons board on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>A key element in the development of the new services in the Justice area will be the retention by the Minister of political responsibility and accountability to the Oireachtas for the discharge by the new bodies of their functions.  Crucial to the success of the new bodies, too, will be their structuring to take full responsibility for the management of their respective services, including the achievement of agreed objectives, service levels and financial performance.  This approach to political accountability and management responsibility is reflected in the provisions of the Courts Service (No. 2) Bill.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 4 is the pivotal provision of the Bill as it brings the Courts Service into existence on the establishment day.  That day will be appointed by order of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under section 3.  However, section 1 and Part VIII provide for the establishment of the Courts Service Transitional Board.  As the text stands at present, this will happen immediately on the enactment of the Bill but, for operational reasons, I am considering whether it would be more appropriate that a short period, perhaps a month, should be allowed after enactment for the establishment of the transitional board.</P>
    <P>Section 11 establishes the board of the Courts Service and provides for its membership in accordance with the recommendations of the working group on a courts commission.  The board will have 17 members and will be widely representative, which is appropriate and, indeed, necessary in a body which will be located at the top of the Courts Service structure and will have responsibility for formulating the policy of the service.  It is only right that the judiciary, staff of <Col N="117" /> the service, practitioners and users of the courts, who have a very real interest in the future of the courts system, should be represented at the decision-making level.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice and the Presidents of the High, Circuit and District Courts will be members of the board or will nominate another judge for that purpose.  An ordinary judge of each of those courts will also be elected to the board by his or her judicial colleagues.  A further judge will be nominated by the Chief Justice in respect of his or her expertise in a specific area.  The other members of the board will be the chief executive, a practising barrister nominated by the Chairman of the Bar Council, a practising solicitor nominated by the President of the Law Society, a member of the staff of the Courts Service, an officer of the Minister, a person nominated by the Minister to represent consumers of the services provided by the courts, a person nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and a person nominated by the Minister with knowledge and experience of commerce, finance or administration after consultation with bodies representative of such interests.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice or his or her nominated replacement will chair the board.  Elected or nominated members will serve for a term of three years, which will be renewable on re-election or renomination under section 12.  The Minister will be entitled to remove, for stated reasons, a member of the board nominated by the Minister.  To remove, for stated reasons, members nominated by the President of the Law Society, the Chairman of the Bar Council or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Minister must first consult with the nominating person or body concerned.</P>
    <P>Under section 14, the board must meet at least once every three months and that section provides in a standard form for the procedures of the board.  Finally, as regards the workings of the board, section 15 empowers it to establish committees which may comprise persons who are not members of the board but who have expertise relevant to the work of a committee.  This flexibility would allow the board, for example, to examine in a very specialised way particular aspects of court operations.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the essential purpose of the Bill is to transfer the current functions of the Minister which relate to the courts to the Courts Service.  This is reflected in section 5 which draws out the broad parameters of the service's functions.  Apart from the general mandate to manage the courts, the section provides that the service shall provide services for the judges, information and facilities to the public, and courtroom accommodation.  I take this opportunity to highlight the service's function of providing facilities for those who use the courts.  I am aware that courthouse facilities and conditions are of vital concern to members of the public, including victims of crime.  Considerable improvements have been made in this area but it is essential that the <Col N="118" /> process of the modernisation of courthouses be kept up to pace.  I am confident that the service will be fully aware of the need to target resources towards the provision of modern accommodation to meet the requirements of all court users.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is also relevant in this area.  That section, which is essentially an adaptation provision, taken in conjunction with Schedule 2 to which it relates, provides a list of the many statutory provisions where functions will be devolved on the service with effect from the establishment day.  The section provides that the schedule can be augmented by way of an order made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The section also provides that any other statutory function relevant to the work of the service may be conferred on the service by a Government order.</P>
    <P>Section 6 confers powers generally on the service to enable it to perform its functions under the Act and certain powers are specifically mentioned, including the power to hold land and to enter into contracts and arrangements.  Essentially what we are talking about is to ensure that the new service will have the capacity to carry out its functions as effectively and efficiently as possible, and I am satisfied that aspect is properly covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>While the provisions to which I have just referred map out the overall remit of the service, sections 13 and 20, dealing respectively with the board's functions and those of the chief executive, cover a key relationship within the overall framework of management of the Courts Service. Under section 13, the board will be responsible for the policy of the service and for overseeing the implementation by the chief executive of the board's policy.  By virtue of section 20, the chief executive's function will primarily be to manage and control on a day-to-day basis the business, administration and staff of the service.  Section 20(2) makes it clear that the chief executive will be accountable to the board in the implementation by him or her of the board's policies and the performance generally of his or her functions, including all functions conferred on him or her under the Bill or by the board.</P>
    <P>One of my priorities in bringing forward this measure has been to ensure that the statutory framework for the Courts Service establishes clear lines of accountability and responsibility. Under the Bill full responsibility for the management of the courts system will be conferred on the Courts Service while political accountability for the activities of the service will continue to rest with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Under section 8 the service will be required to submit an annual report to the Minister of its activities and the Minister will lay that report before each House of the Oireachtas.  The section allows the Minister to direct that additional information be included in the annual report.  It also imposes a general requirement on the service, <Col N="119" /> acting through the chief executive, to provide information to the Minister about the policy and activities of the service.  It is essential that the Minister and Government of the day as well as the Oireachtas has a clear insight into the way the service is operating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill goes a number of steps further to underpin the policy of ensuring the optimum level of accountability.  Section 7 requires the service to submit three year strategic plans to the Minister for his or her approval following which the Minister is required to lay the plans before each House of the Oireachtas, with or without amendment.  This requirement is based on corresponding provisions contained in the Public Service Management (No. 2) Act, 1997, and arises from the same policy objectives, that of enhancing the management and effectiveness of public services, in this case in the area of the courts.  The underlying principle of strategic management is to promote the provisions of an excellent service to the public which ensures that resources are used in a value for money way.  I am satisfied those principles will be reflected in the operation of the service as a result of the obligation placed on it under section 7 to plan ahead strategically, not least due to the specific requirement that the strategic plans have regard to the need for the best use of the resources of the service.</P>
      <P>Section 13(2) supports the value for money approach of the Bill which, in the context of the discharge by the board of its functions, requires it to have regard to the best use of the resources of the service and any Government or ministerial policy or objective relating to its functions.  This section also enables the Minister to inform the board of any such policy or objective.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Bill provides for lines of direct accountability for the service to the Oireachtas. Under section 19, the chief executive of the service will be the accounting officer for the service and as such will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  A wider general obligation on the chief executive to attend before an Oireachtas committee when required to account for the general administration of the Courts Service, including its strategic plan, is contained in section 21. This is based on the corresponding provisions of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges, and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Section 9 protects the independence of judges in the exercise of judicial business and a person, such as the Master of the High Court, exercising quasi-judicial functions from interference by the service, the board or the chief executive.  Section 39 makes similar provision in respect of the transitional arrangements under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> The working group's fourth report, <i>The Chief Executive of the Courts Service,</i> was approved for publication by the previous Government earlier this year.  It provided a comprehensive framework for the role of the service's chief executive which is reflected in the Bill.  Section 17 provides that the chief executive will be appointed by the board and the appointee will be the chief executive designate who will have been appointed by the transitional board.  The terms of appointment of the chief executive will be fixed by contract, which will be renewable on terms and conditions determined by the board and approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The effect of section 18 is that the chief executive will not be subject to the provisions of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, and will not, therefore, be appointed as a civil servant.</P>
    <P>The role of the chief executive in the management of the service will be critically important.  A vital task for him or her will be the management of several hundred staff members who will become part of the Courts Service.  To achieve this task, it is essential the existing courts system which is dispersed between several court offices and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is brought together into a single cohesive structure.  The existing system may have been sufficient in the past but it is no longer adequate to meet the demands arising from the large volume of business now coming before the courts.  In that context, section 22 of the Bill, which declares that the service shall have a unified organisation and structure, is a critical reference point for the form the new service will take.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that the board may appoint staff and determine their grades with the approval of the Minister and the consent of the Minister for Finance, and staff of the service will have the status of civil servants of the State.  That Civil Service designation is consistent with the role of the service, which will be a statutory agency of the State, independent of the Government.</P>
    <P>There are broadly two groups of Civil Service staff currently involved in the work of the courts. The first group &mdash; the vast majority of such staff &mdash; is located within the courts and includes registrars, court clerks, clerical and very many more grades of staff.  Section 24 provides that such staff, who are specified in Schedule 1 to the Bill, will transfer to the Courts Service on the establishment day.  The second group of relevant staff &mdash; staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform engaged in functions relating to the administration of the courts &mdash; will transfer to the service by way of designation by order of the Minister.  Designation of such staff will take place after consultation with organisations representing staff interests.</P>
    <P>For all staff transferring to the Courts Service, section 25 provides that a lesser scale of pay or less beneficial terms and conditions of service than those applied prior to the transfer will not <Col N="121" /> be imposed unless this is done in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with recognised staff representatives.  The procedure for varying scales of pay and terms and conditions of staff by the service will be agreed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance following consultation with a recognised trade union or staff association concerned. I pay tribute to all court staff who have given such an excellent service over many years under the existing courts organisational structure.  I know that I can look forward to the continuation of that excellent service to the State under the new arrangements that we are embarking on.</P>
    <P>At present, local authorities, in accordance with the provisions of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, are responsible for the provision of courthouses throughout the country with the exception of the Four Courts complex and a number of other venues in the Dublin area which are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  Consistent with the function of providing, managing and maintaining court buildings which the Bill confers on the service, section 26 provides for the vesting in the service of appropriate premises.  Although I have mentioned the Four Courts, I should make it clear that, exceptionally, I do not envisage the transfer of the Four Courts to the service under the vesting arrangements provided for under section 26.  Because of the unique history of the Four Courts and the significant place it holds in our heritage and culture, it would be appropriate that the service should lease these premises from the Commissioners of Public Works in an arrangement similar to the one in place with An Post in respect of the GPO.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the transfer from the Minister to the service of property other than land used for court purposes.  Section 28 provides for the transfer from the Minister to the service of all rights and liabilities under a contract or commitment relating to court functions.</P>
    <P>Part Vll of the Bill makes provision for miscellaneous matters which require attention with a view to the establishment of the Courts Service. In particular, section 30 is a standard type provision disqualifying members of the board or of the staff of the service from serving as such once they become nominated as a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or are elected to the European Parliament.  In addition, steps have been taken under section 31 of the Bill to exempt the Courts Service from planning permission requirements under the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>The final portion of the Bill is concerned with the arrangements to be made in respect of the transitional board and the chief executive designate. Under section 36, the composition of the transitional board will be identical to that of the board of the service under section 11, with necessary modifications to enable a court staff representative and the chief executive designate to be members of the transitional board.  Apart from <Col N="122" /> the appointment of a chief executive designate which will arise under section 38, the transitional board will, under section 37, have the broader function of preparing generally for the taking on by the service of its court management functions. Section 41 provides for the dissolution of the transitional board on the establishment day.</P>
    <P>The transitional arrangements provide a mechanism for putting a chief executive in place as quickly as possible and, crucially, in advance of the actual start-up of the service.  The chief executive designate, who will be the first chief executive of the service, will work in partnership with the transitional board within the remit of its power to prepare the way generally in the run-up to the establishment of the service.</P>
    <P>I believe the establishment of the courts service on the lines proposed in this Bill is the best way forward to ensure the administration of the courts is carried out with the greatest efficiency and the provision of a high level and quality of service to the public.  That is the yardstick against which the success of the service will be measured in years to come.  I am especially pleased to have had the opportunity to shape and advance the statutory framework for the establishment of the Courts Service.  I believe this Bill represents a landmark development for the administration of justice through the courts system in this State.  I look forward to the debate on the Bill in this House. Senators, I am sure, will recognise the very significant move forward for the courts system for which the Bill provides and will, I know, want to contribute in relation to these far-reaching reforms.  I look forward to hearing those contributions and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is getting to know the House this week in presenting various Bills. If he has been inconvenienced I am sure the Government Whip will bring him up to date on the difficulties experienced by Members.  When he is speaking to other members of Cabinet he might pass on suggestions for resolving the matter.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to be welcomed and we whole-heartedly support it.  While we may have amendments on Committee Stage the thrust of the Bill is welcomed by this group and, I am sure, by all Members of the House.  As the Minister said, it had its genesis in the working group set up in 1995 by his predecessor, Deputy Owen.  In the 75 years since the foundation of the State the operation of the courts has not been changed.  As we approach the end of the century, one hopes this Bill will bring about the necessary improvements. Many aspects of our judicial system work reasonably well but the Minister and Senator O'Donovan are well aware that other areas require attention because they are still in the 19th century.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the working group for what it has brought about.  In a recent article the Director General of the Law Society wrote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> The litany of problems [noted by the working group] included:</P>
    <P>no clear reporting structure;</P>
    <P>no adequate performance measurements;</P>
    <P>no objectives;</P>
    <P>minimum planning;</P>
    <P>poor use of information technology;</P>
    <P>fragmentation of administration systems between each of the courts;</P>
    <P>apparent remoteness of administration system from the judiciary;</P>
    <P>lack of statistical or financial information;</P>
    <P>no strategic plan.</P>
    <P>Clearly matters must be resolved.  Hopefully, with the establishment of the independent body, in the form of a transitional body initially, and the policies outlined in the Action Programme for the Millennium, this will be a turning point in bringing about improvements.</P>
    <P>In certain areas there are questions about the running of the courts, who they serve and the improvements needed for all those who use the courts professionally and the consumers in courts at all levels, whether facing charges or taking an action.  We welcome the Bill although there will be teething problems in the transitional period.  I understand there is concern among some staff who may be transferred, in particular county registrars.  It is a matter we will revisit at a later stage.</P>
    <P>It is important that this new agency will slay the dragon, so to speak.  The problems are related to delays and to the courts being overcrowded and unsatisfactory for administering justice. There are courthouses in certain parts of the country which are unsuitable and consultations must take place on the street or in a local hostelry or hotel.  In some cases courts are damp and squalid. I recall that Judge Hussey had to compete with rats in the courthouse in Kilmainham.  That problem was resolved but I am sure the Minister is aware of similar difficulties elsewhere.  I am aware of another case in which a district judge had to put on his overcoat during hearings because the windows behind him were cracked. These issues must be addressed.</P>
    <P>At the level of the higher courts these problems are not as acute and may be more easily solved. However, a vigilant fire officer might close down the Circuit Court in Dublin, for example, because of the number of people who are in the court on any given day, many of whom are wandering around not knowing where they should be.  The courthouse may be crowded with barristers, solicitors, clients and witnesses.  The judge may be lucky to be heard in court and it is little wonder there are problems with the public getting lost or turning up at the wrong court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> It can be a frightening experience for people going to court for the first time, not necessarily as defendants but as plaintiffs seeking to have their rights vindicated or to reach a settlement in a case.  Courts can be overcrowded and there may be poor amplification systems so the judge may tell the petrified witness to speak up and the witness will try to address the judge, but all the while there may be the noise of doors opening and closing and people coming and going.  As often as not cases are scheduled for the 10.30 a.m. or 2 p.m. sitting, yet even if the case is heard that day people may have to wait for hours.  These are basic problems of which I am sure the Minister is aware, being a legal practitioner himself.  I am sure the courts in County Kerry are similar to those elsewhere.  I hope these problems will be examined by the board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and particularly the composition of the board.  It will comprise the Chief Justice or a judge of the Supreme Court nominated by him; the President of High Court or a judge of the High Court nominated by him; a judge of the High Court elected by the ordinary judges of that court; the President of the Circuit Court or a judge of that court nominated by him; a judge of the Circuit Court elected by the ordinary judges of that court; the President of the District Court or a judge of that court nominated by him; a judge of the District Court elected by the judges other than the President of that court; a judge nominated by the Chief Justice in respect of his or her experience or expertise in a specific area of court business; the chief executive; a practising barrister nominated by the Bar Council; a practising solicitor nominated by the Law Society; a member of the staff of the service &mdash; an important inclusion; an officer of the Minister nominated by the Minister and, perhaps most important of all, a person nominated by the Minister to represent consumers of the services provided by the courts.  Barristers, solicitors and gardaí can look after themselves.  However, if other consumers of the service feel aggrieved after their day in court, it is important that they have somebody to whom they may address their concerns or queries so that problems do not recur.</P>
    <P>It is important that the board will report annually and that we will have the chance to discuss its report in the House, as we discuss the Ombudsman's report and those of other bodies. These provisions are important for the operation of the courts.  I am glad the board will meet at least every three months.  The Law Society is concerned that during the period of transition there will be teething and staffing problems.</P>
    <P>After the transition period the aim is to have courts which are workable and where there are basic facilities for those who go to court, particularly with regard to family law cases.  In many instances at present the courts are so crowded that both parties in such cases find themselves sitting outside <Col N="125" /> the court unable to have a private consultation. These issues must be considered.  Some of the courts are in fairly good condition and could be described as state of the art.  However, there are areas that need to be addressed and children's courts and family law courts should have an area where people can have a consultation in private if necessary.  At present courts can be more like Heuston Station on a busy Friday with people hanging around.  People have no place to talk and it is difficult for those who want to show an injury they received in an accident.  In other words, it can be very difficult for people to conduct their business.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the prison facilities are to be improved and I welcome this.  Earlier I mentioned delays in the courts system and I hope this Bill, in conjunction with other legislation which the Minister will bring forward, will effect some streamlining and improvement.  A combination of matters, including procedures, needs to be examined. While some improvements have taken place, it can still be far too long from the setting down date until the case is brought to trial. Instances where constant remands and adjournments are sought in relatively serious District Court cases, resulting in gardaí having to appear and diverting them from issues on which the Minister would prefer them to concentrate, should be examined.  Notice should be given if an adjournment is being sought by a client or if a member of the Garda is not available.  Such things should not have to go to court and take up time.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has heard from county registrars who are concerned about their position. The First Schedule deals with transferred officers and I ask that their viewpoint be taken on board. Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether he or his representatives have met representatives of county registrars or District Court clerks.  We have all had dealings with District Court clerks who do so much to help the smooth operation of the court.  People who deal with them on a regular basis can be helped by them because problems may arise if, say, two cases are listed for the same time in nearby courts and the same solicitor or barrister is involved.  This issue must be examined and I ask the Minister in his reply to tell us that the future of those at present employed is safeguarded, that the concerns that have been brought to my attention will be examined and that the problems envisaged by such officers will be dealt with.  We can return to this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister is hoping this legislation will pass speedily through both Houses.  What timescale has he for the transitional period?  The Director General of the Law Society, Mr. Ken Murphy, expressed concern that all aspects of the Bill be fully operational by the beginning of the next legal year which is October 1998.  Is the Minister satisfied that this deadline can be met?</P>
    <P>I referred to the staffing difficulties in courts and the condition of courthouses.  These conditions <Col N="126" /> will be improved by the transfer of functions to the board.  For many years the corporation in Dún Laoghaire was responsible for the courthouse.  However, it only provided money for its upkeep while the Department of Justice ruled the roost.  It was a ridiculous situation. &mdash; The manner in which courts operate is important.  Some courts are very overcrowded.  If the fire officer was vigilant he would make changes in the Four Courts.  If anything happened there it could lead to a tragedy.</P>
    <P>We support the thrust of this Bill which was initiated by Deputy Owen and which the Minister has progressed.  Both are to be complimented on bringing forward the Bill.  It is important that the proposals and initiatives of the working group are put in place and that we get things right.  It is also important that the justice system is seen to be working, particularly for consumers.  Barristers and solicitors also need facilities.  There should be a long-term policy to have very old courthouses torn down and replaced with new buildings. Regarding the financial implications of the Bill and the commencement date, does the Minister envisage further expenses in the operation of the Bill?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael supports and welcomes the Bill and praises those involved in bringing it forward.  It is important legislation on which many people are depending.  We must get over the transitional period and ensure any teething problems are resolved.  I look forward to debating the first report and to hearing how the service has evolved.  This side will support Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on introducing the Bill.  I also thank Senator Cosgrave for his broad supportive remarks.  In the late 1970s a member of the Garret FitzGerald led Government made the broad statement that he intended to drag the court system and barristers and solicitors kicking and screaming into the 20th century.  That comment was appropriate at the time.  I compliment the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Owen, on their work on Bills which will bring the work of the courts into the 21st century.  This is most important.  I join the Minister and Senator Cosgrave in thanking the working group of the courts commission, which was chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.  I compliment her on the excellent work on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a practising lawyer, the Bill is a most welcome initiative.  In common with Senator Cosgrave, I have experience of poor courthouses, inefficiency, lack of technology and courtroom space.  From my frequent visits as a lawyer to the Four Courts, I concur with his point about overcrowding and the facilities in the Bar room.  It is similar to a cattle mart and one wonders how the public think the legal profession is in another world.  I hope the new service will streamline the courts system and administration of justice and <Col N="127" /> make it more user friendly and accessible to the public.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave mentioned the lack of facilities. On at least 20 occasions in my District Court Area No. 19, judges have adjourned courts before business commenced because of arctic conditions in courtrooms.  Senator Cosgrave mentioned a judge in Kilmainham putting on his overcoat.  I am aware of incidents where judges had to adjourn court sittings because of broken windows and desperate facilities.  Some courts were held in dance halls that were used two or three times a year.  A room was opened and a heater plugged in for the sitting of the court.  That was no way to treat the District Judge, the lawyers or the public. People were left standing for hours in atrocious conditions.  As the District Judge commented on one occasion when adjourning proceedings, it was cold justice.</P>
    <P>This position prevailed for many years, although matters have improved in the last decade and not before time.  I compliment the various Bar organisations, such as the southern law association, which did much to try to improve their lot in their areas.  It was unusual 25 years ago for judges of the District, Circuit or High Courts to attend local Bar association functions or seminars.  However, this happens frequently now and it is a welcome step because practitioners can hear what is wrong with the system at first hand from judges.  The associations then try to make the system more user friendly and accessible to the public and practitioners.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is a total lack of facilities in most courthouses in rural Ireland.  Every courthouse should have proper waiting and consultation rooms, particularly for family law cases where delicate topics are discussed and instructions taken by lawyers.  As Senator Cosgrave said, it is not acceptable in this day and age that barristers and solicitors must take instructions on the street.  We are still working under 19th century systems and facilities and we must propel them into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of questions and perhaps the Minister will respond to them in his reply or on Committee Stage.  As somebody from west Cork, which is one of the most peripheral areas in the country, I am baffled as to why a High Court judge is not based permanently in Cork or Munster to cover Cork, Tralee and Limerick. I accept this is a matter for the President of the High Court, but I do not understand why barristers, solicitors, the public and senior medical personnel from Cork, Kerry and Limerick must travel to the High Court in Dublin.  They must wait hours and sometimes days for cases to be called.  It is a most uneconomical system.</P>
    <P>In addition to a High Court judge being based permanently in the south, another should be based in the Galway/north-west region.  There is no reason in this day and age, particularly in civil matters, that a High Court judge could not sit <Col N="128" /> three weeks every month, with the exception of August, in these areas.  As a practitioner this matter is of great concern to me.  At present it is necessary to bring clients from Castletownbere, Castlebar or Donegal all the way to Dublin.  One must ensure all one's medical experts, such as consultant surgeons and neurosurgeons, are available. In many cases they are unavailable.  I hope the Bill will streamline this system and ensure that it is efficient, cohesive and involves co-operation.</P>
    <P>I do not condemn neurosurgeons or consultants for not attending courts because they also have schedules.  A neurosurgeon told me recently that if he was carrying out technical brain surgery in Cork University Hospital, I should not expect him to rush off to the High Court in Dublin or elsewhere.  This must be accepted because lives must be saved.  I ask the Minister to consider whether High Court judges could be based permanently in the west, north-west and Munster areas to deal with civil matters.</P>
    <P>I hope my comments are viewed as positive rather than critical because the Bill provides a great opportunity to grasp the nettle of decentralisation. Is it necessary for everything to revolve round the Four Courts in Dublin?  I asked a colleague earlier if there were District or Circuit Courts in Tallaght, which is as big as Cork city. Everything should not revolve around one small building in Dublin which is totally overcrowded and lacks basic facilities that the public, practitioners and judges require.  Although some improvements have taken place in the last decade, the lack of facilities for family courts is of great concern.  With the provision of this new service and the appointment of a chief executive, there is no reason a section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform could not be decentralised to Cork, Limerick, Galway or Athlone.  There is overcrowding in Dublin, and decentralisation should be implemented.  The Minister should examine this.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the new service includes appointing a chief executive and 17 members to its board.  I welcome the suggestion that this should include nine judges, who want better facilities more than anyone else.  They want decent courthouses, fax machines, telephone systems and proper consultating rooms.  Including nine judges among the members ensures that those most concerned with the administration of justice will be able to help provide a proper service.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice and the Presidents of the High Court, Circuit Court, District Court and Supreme Court will all be members of the board. Other judges will also be appointed.  A practising barrister, a practising solicitor, an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and others will also be appointed.  He has a direct input in the appointment of only two members of the board.  He is trying to allocate much of the workings of the court system and the administration <Col N="129" /> of justice to a separate body.  Different bodies were responsible for these matters until now, but with the appointment of a professional chief executive who will be responsible to the board, matters can only improve.  There will be proper services all over the country.  This will require money, but the board's powers should not be diminished.  It will have powers to sue and be sued because it will be a separate legal entity in certain respects.  It will have the power to acquire courthouses, obtain leases on courthouses or take over existing leases.  This is a significant leap into the future.</P>
    <P>The board will meet regularly; the Minister suggests it should meet every three months.  That means there will be at least four meetings every 12 months, perhaps more.  The chief executive will be answerable to the Minister and an annual report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  While the Minister is giving independence to the board, the chief executive and board are responsible to the Minister, who retains political responsibility.  That must be acknowledged, even if he might want to divest himself of it from time to time.  I welcome this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will be appointed to the board, which is welcome.  The new service envisaged by the streamlining of the courts system will have wide ranging powers.  It will have the power to employ extra staff, to take staff from the existing Department and to ensure that courthouses are up to date with fax machines, telephone systems and video recording machinery as recommended under the Children Bill.  Those facilities should be made available but should not be totally Dublin based.  We must look at Munster and the west. Cork, Limerick, Galway, Tralee and Athlone must not be left out.  Courthouses there must be updated.  I have visited courthouses in Britain, America and some European countries, and our courthouses, with some exceptions, are well below the average.</P>
    <P>Accountability is an important aspect of this Bill.  It is important that the new Courts Service is fully accountable and is seen to be responsible. The board, and also possibly the chief executive, is required to bring forward a plan of action for an extended period.  The chief executive can be compelled to come before an Oireachtas committee to answer questions and possibly to amend the plan.  That is crucial, because everything will not be transformed by this legislation even by next year, although I hope that this legislation will be enacted by Easter.  The transformation cannot happen overnight.  We must plan for a longer period.  In five or seven years, practitioners of law, the public and Members of the Oireachtas can look back and say that this legislation, initiated in the Seanad, worked.  The taxpayer will fund this through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition must be picking on me because this is the third time in two days that my contribution has been interrupted. Perhaps my contributions sound inappropriate or inadequate.</P>
      <P>I was speaking about the importance of the accountability and responsibility of the service. The chief executive will be responsible to an Oireachtas committee which, in turn, is responsible to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Section 9 protects the independence of judges in the exercise of judicial business and a person, such as the Master of the High Court, exercising quasi-judicial functions from interference by the service, board or chief executive.  That independence must be retained under the Constitution and I welcome the Minister's commitment to protect it.</P>
      <P>The chief executive and the board will have full responsibility for staffing and running the service. Court staff includes court clerks, county registrars and other officials.  The service will also have important powers in regard to the heating and furnishing of courthouses, the provision of rooms, refurbishment and the acquisition of new buildings. I do not wish to harp on the issue, but the condition of some rural courthouses leaves a great deal to be desired.  We are not asking for luxury but this service will have an obligation to ensure decent facilities are provided.</P>
      <P>The board will also have powers in regard to the grading of staff, such as county registrars and court clerks.  It is also provided that officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who transfer to the new service will not suffer a decrease in salary, which is understandable and welcome.</P>
      <P>The remuneration of judges is paltry.  People with such experience and qualifications could probably quadruple their annual salaries in the commercial sector.  Eminent senior counsel who take on the honourable and noble position of Attorney General usually incur a huge decrease in their annual income.  Politicians are often criticised for being overpaid.  Alas, despite the advances of the Celtic tiger, that is not the case. Judges at all levels are also underpaid.  Nine out of ten senior counsel with a half decent practice, aside from those in the top 20, earn far more money than a High Court judge.  If one pays peanuts one will get monkeys.  I am not criticising any member of the Judiciary, but if we want top quality lawyers to become judges we must pay more. The Minister might refer to these issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the criticism levelled against the Judiciary over the years has been unfair.  Many judges, especially those in the Circuit and District Courts, have had to put up with appalling facilities over the past 20 or 30 years.  There have been <Col N="131" /> improvements in the past ten years but they still leave a great deal to be desired.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I was delighted Senator Cosgrave, on behalf of Fine Gael, broadly welcomed the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister, his predecessor and the independent commission.  The purpose of the Bill is to establish a Courts Service.  It is on a par with the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997, which represents a courageous leap into the future.  This Bill probably comprises the most practical legislation in this area to be introduced in the last 40 years.  It covers the day to day administration of justice, including the running and staffing of courthouses and it will provide a comprehensive and co-ordinated strategy for the future.  The Minister must be congratulated for his initiative.</P>
    <P>I hope that the thrust of the Bill, which deals with the administration of justice, will be welcomed. It should ensure that basic facilities are provided.  These include lighting and toilets in courthouses, the provision of staff and technology, such as computers and word processors, and other items which would be standard features of a solicitor's office or any commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the board, the service and the chief executive are established there will be a reformation and renaissance of the courts system and the administration of justice within the next seven years.  I also hope it will mean that in, say, 20 years, those who administer justice, from judges to solicitors and barristers, will look on this legislation as being among the best and most practical to be enacted by the Oireachtas representing as it does an efficient and cohesive combination of the various relevant strands within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation.  Senator O'Donovan hailed it as the best legislation in this area for 40 years.  Have we not waited for it for 75 years?  We recently celebrated the foundation of the State.  Until then, the courts were administered by the Lord Chancellor and his staff, which continues to be the case in the UK.  We never replaced that office, which meant that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which is overloaded with work, had to take on the running of the courts.</P>
      <P>This legislation is a great innovation.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Owen, is to be complimented for establishing the working group under Mrs. Justice Susan Denham to investigate the Courts Service.  I am delighted that the Minister responded so rapidly to the report of the working party by introducing this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also delighted that the Minister indicated that he intends to establish an independent prisons board.  Having been the Chair of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, he will know that we sought such a board for some years.  I am gratified that a <Col N="132" /> Bill providing for the establishment of an independent prison service is to be introduced.  I hope it will appear before the House shortly.  While I am enthusiastic about the upgrading of prison places I am more reticent about the huge increase in the number of places.  I would prefer the money to be invested in the Probation Service.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned that for decades we have suffered from an appalling lack of co-ordination within the Courts Service.  Terrible facilities have been provided, not only for those appearing before the courts but also for those working in them.  The Judiciary and the courts staff are to be complimented on maintaining the service because they have had to work in dreadful conditions.  Where justice was not delayed it was seen to be exercised in inferior conditions, which was not good.  Justice may not be taken seriously if there is a long delay in bringing cases, especially criminal cases, before the courts.  While there is always a victim in such cases there is also a suspected criminal who may be incarcerated for some time only to be found innocent.  There have also been appalling delays in civil cases.  In some instances people may have had to wait nine or ten years for accident cases to be assessed and compensation awarded.  The co-ordination of resources and the establishment of a Courts Service are, therefore, to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The facilities provided in the courts should be rightly stressed.  I have appeared as a witness in criminal cases at District Court sittings in Sutton Rugby Club and in a north Dublin night club festooned with fishing nets.  It was difficult for the criminal to take matters seriously when the court was deliberating in the surroundings of rugby boots and hanging plastic lobsters.  The new District Court on the site of the old Richmond Hospital is to be welcomed.  People attending that court know cases are taken seriously and that they are treated with much greater respect and importance.</P>
    <P>Delays in the children's courts were unforgivable because a child has a different concept of time from an adult.  I am glad that the work done on the court in Smithfield has improved the facilities for the hearing of cases.  Nevertheless, family cases are being heard all over the country involving parties consulting with their solicitors on the same corridor.  This is intimidating for both sides. It is good to note that the new board will have control of buildings, although I understand that the Four Courts are to be excluded.</P>
    <P>The proposed structure of the board is welcome. In many countries the courts are controlled exclusively by judges.  In the US, Japan and in some of the states in Australia the courts boards are comprised solely of judges.  It is right that the majority of members of the proposed board &mdash; nine &mdash; should comprise the Judiciary.  The spread of the other members is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Who does the Minister have in mind with regard to the consumer member of the board?  Is a consumer with experience in this area required?   <Col N="133" /> Should it be an experienced criminal?  There is nothing to say that somebody with a criminal record cannot be represented.  A consumer with such experience on the board may highlight the sad side of criminal justice, which may be no harm.</P>
    <P>The proposed size and balance of the board are also about right.  Anything bigger than 17 members would become unmanageable.  In addition, the Judiciary cannot say it is being outflanked by those who work within the courts system or by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The proposal to establish subcommittees in specialist areas is to be welcomed, especially if the Minister wishes to have specialist functions of the courts examined.  This will enable him to introduce the expertise he considers is not already represented on the board.  I applaud that.</P>
    <P>The Bill should state that the report, which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, must be published.  We often see a list of reports on the Order Paper but we do not know much about them.  It is important to publish this report.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill in the House so quickly.  It has been delayed for 75 years but I hope he ensures it is enacted in the near future.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Liam Fitzgerald.  It was not my aim or intention to cause a row as it would not be in the spirit of this partnership Government.  Nevertheless, a principle was clearly outlined to me and I wanted to know the reason for changing it. I compliment the Minister on introducing this legislation in the House so quickly.  It is based on the report of a working group which was put in place by the Minister's predecessor.  It did its work diligently and submitted its report in 1996. I am sure the Chairman knows the standing joke in our part of the country that politically we are always one report away from action.  However, that cannot be said in the case of this Minister.  I commend him for taking the recommendations of the working group on board and for drafting this legislation with extraordinary speed.  It marks him as a reforming and progressive Minister.</P>
      <P>This legislation is long overdue.  Many speakers mentioned the conditions of courthouses, the backlog of cases and the delays in hearing such cases.  These are some of the more salient features of the courts section of our justice system.  I am pleased that rather than tinkering around at the edges and introducing minor reforms, the Minister has undertaken full surgery.  He has taken the administration of the courts out of the Minister's hands and given it to an independent body whose recommendations will be dealt with by a chief executive.  When this Bill becomes law, I hope our courts will be run on a businesslike basis and will deliver a speedy, effective and efficient service to their consumers.  That should be the ultimate objective of those of us who are concerned about every arm of the justice system, whether it is the courts, the prisons or the Garda.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the functions which were carried out by previous Ministers will now be given to this proposed body.  These functions are to manage the courts, provide support services for judges, give information on the courts system to the public, provide, manage and maintain court buildings and provide facilities for users of the courts.  This broad range of functions needed to be clearly defined because in many cases they were nobody's business.  The new body has a clearly defined set of tasks which it must undertake and deliver.  If these functions are fully carried out, we will have an effective, efficient and streamlined courts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive will be the key person to make these new changes work.  I read the Bill in some detail but it did not specify a fixed term of office for the chief executive.  I ask the Minister <Col N="135" /> to comment on that.  It is important when devising and designing new posts to have a clearly defined term of office, such as five or seven years.  County council and city managers are now appointed for seven years.  If one cannot deliver on something in seven years, questions should be asked.  I recommend that a set term of office should be specified for the chief executive.  That imposes its own discipline because it requires people to set and meet realistic targets.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the proposed composition of the board which is broadly based.  Senator O'Donovan said he was glad there will be nine out of 17 judges on it, which gives them a fair balance.  It is important to have a strong input from people who are consumer conscious, such as the Consumers Association of Ireland.  The Bill states that a person will be nominated by the Minister to represent consumers of the services provided by the court.  I am unclear how the Minister will choose that person, although the principle is correct.  The courts should be consumer friendly because they provide a vital service.  It is important that consumers' needs and priorities are taken into account.  This appointment is critical. I want to see a strong input into the board's deliberations and policy making strategies from community conscious people, the Consumers Association of Ireland and from business.  I am glad that it is proposed to nominate someone with the relevant knowledge and experience in commerce, finance and administration.  This is very important.  Any businessman looking at the manner in which some of our courts are run would have many useful things to say.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan mentioned the wastefulness of dragging clients and highly qualified people, such as brain surgeons, to courts in Dublin instead of taking the service to where the need exists.  This waste must be eradicated so that the chief executive will have resources to upgrade and update the Dickensian conditions in some of our courthouses. There is scope for huge savings in the day to day running of the courts.  I am pleased that someone with a strong business ethic will be put at the heart of this policy making board which will oversee the work of the chief executive.  That is of equal importance to the number of judges. The Consumers Association and the world of business will put the ideas in place to help achieve the objectives of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The conditions of courthouses are legendary. There have been occasions when judges have refused to sit.  There must be a systematic programme of upgrading and updating our court facilities.  They should be places where people can work efficiently.  They should be equipped with modern technology.  These are good investments as they save time particularly when highly paid professionals are involved.  I have seen squalor in the environs of many courtrooms.  Clients have to confer with the desperate mothers of juvenile <Col N="136" /> criminals on stairways and behind doors.  How can justice be fairly administered in such an environment?   As we move into the next century and deal with buildings which were erected before the foundation of the State, we must think of the change which has occurred in society.  Family law was not a big issue when most of our courthouses were built.  Children's courts were hardly thought of.  We must design and equip our buildings in the knowledge that proper provision must be made for family courts with consulting rooms so that clients can consult with solicitors and the best service is offered to all.</P>
    <P>In particular, we must construct proper courts for the hearing of juvenile cases.  It is sad that one third of all crimes are committed by juveniles. When we are upgrading our courts system we must bear in mind the number of juveniles being brought before the courts.  Younger juveniles should not be mixed in with hardened criminals who have almost turned court appearances into a science.  That is no place for young people.  The principle of juvenile justice must be to divert people from serious crime.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that we do not have any modern juvenile justice legislation.  Senator Liam Fitzgerald and I were members of a select Dáil committee which spent 11 months drawing up proposals which were to be the basis of a juvenile justice Bill.  That was in 1990-1.  That committee worked very conscientiously.  It carried out a thorough examination of the causes of juvenile crime and the possible cures.  I made a shrew of myself in the Dáil begging the last Government to bring forward the legislation.  It is critically important that we have modern juvenile justice legislation so that we can provide a legislative framework to protect young people and allow for early intervention to prevent them from slipping into a lifetime of crime.  I hope that a juvenile justice Bill will be introduced early in the lifetime of the Government and that we make proper provision for juveniles and family courts.</P>
    <P>The conditions of our courthouses are a salient feature of the courts system.  There is no reason courts cannot provide a more responsive service. In extreme cases, courts sit at night but this should happen more often.  There is no reason they cannot sit at weekends in certain cases. There are incredible delays between a charge being brought, a Garda file being completed and a hearing commencing.  This has been a damning feature of our courts system.  In this respect, I compliment two judges who have taken that system by the throat and established procedures which have speeded up hearings and more than halved the backlog.  I hope I am not being too chauvinistic but both of these are from Cork, namely, Judge Harvey Kenny and Judge Sean O'Leary.</P>

      <P>They have worked very well and established procedures which other judges are beginning to follow.  No matter how bad the buildings, if a good system is put in place one can improve matters.</P>
      <P>An outrageous amount of Garda time is spent in court.  The Minister has plans to cut down on this waste but it is not unusual to see battalions of gardaí hanging around courtrooms waiting for cases to be heard only to find out at the end of a long day that the case has been adjourned for a flimsy reason.  That is a wasteful use of Garda time and I am glad it is being tackled under another Bill.  In other jurisdictions court officers present cases on behalf of individual policemen and justice is well served.</P>
      <P>While discussing courts &mdash; we may not revisit this issue &mdash; most people believe we should work towards an updated sentencing policy.  Many citizens feel disquiet by the disparity between sentences handed down in different jurisdictions in respect of broadly similar crimes.  It is time to put in place a sentencing policy and more up to date guidelines to assist judges in arriving at their decisions.</P>
      <P>There is nothing more corrosive in respect of the sentences handed down by judges than petitioning Ministers which has taken root in recent years.  This applies across the board, regardless of the parties in power.  Courts hand down sentences in public &mdash; which is proper and fit for the administration of justice &mdash; but surreptitiously, without reference to the original judgment, a sentence can be shortened or changed by a Minister.  That is wrong.  Will the Minister give consideration to this issue because such petitions should only be accepted in exceptional cases.  This kind of behaviour corrodes the justice system.  It must be sickening for gardaí who bring perpetrators to court and obtain convictions and for judges who hand down sentences they believe to be based on justice to discover that their actions have been completely undermined by a person who petitions a Minister to have a conviction or sentence changed.  Since we are trying to institute reforms we should reform this area also.</P>
      <P>It is important that the new chief executive be given a budget to enable him or her to proceed immediately with modernising court buildings.  I agree with Senator O'Donovan's assertion that High Court judges should be appointed on a regional basis.  The service should be taken to the people because that is the way the modern world operates.  High Court judges who are appointed in the Cork/Kerry/Limerick regions should also be resident there.  This would speed up the hearing of cases and reduce costs considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarradh orm é seo a rá.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh seirbhísí agus áiseanna <Col N="138" /> na gcúirteanna ar fáil trí Ghaeilge as seo amach, go mbeadh cúirteanna a bhíonn á reachtáil sa Ghaeltacht ag feidhmiú agus ag riarú as Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>That is in the spirit of what I have already said. If we are taking the service to the people, as a minimum we should appoint judges who can deal with consumers who want their cases to be heard trí Ghaeilge.  That is of fundamental importance. I ask the Minister to take this issue on board because I may table an amendment on it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Tá sé fíor-tábhachtach go ndéanfaí a leithéid. Má tá cúirteanna ag feidhmiú sa Ghaeltacht tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh sé ar chumas gach uile duine atá ag feidhmiú sna cúirteanna sin an Ghaeilge a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I welcome the Bill.  I look forward to seeing measurable and tangible improvements, in the short-term, in the administration of this element of our justice system.  The provision which requires that the Courts Service report back to the Minister is good because it is important that the Houses can make any necessary changes or amendments.  However, I do not believe this will happen.</P>
    <P>This legislation gives me great grounds for optimism because crime, and the way it has been dealt with, has caused major hardship in this country.  Anything we, as legislators, can do to improve our criminal justice system &mdash; whether it be upgrading courts or prisons or modernising the Garda Síochána &mdash; can only yield good results for all citizens.  I am glad the Minister stated that, as an early priority, he would put in place a similar system in respect of prisons.  I congratulate him, wish him well and look forward to the speedy enactment of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I apologise.  In the Minister's absence yesterday I complimented him on initiating four Bills in the Seanad this week.  I stated that perhaps he was becoming fond of us and preferred the gentility of this Chamber to that of the more robust nature of the Lower House. <Col N="139" /> However, the bells calling for a quorum have been rung so often today that I am not sure the Minister would agree with my assertion.  Perhaps he can use his influence and good offices to rectify our accommodation difficulties and severe staff shortage.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has set about achieving in this Bill.  I compliment his predecessor, Deputy Owen, and Mrs. Justice Susan Denham for her work on the commission which delivered many reports, the recommendations of which, have been taken on board in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The system for administering the courts is unwieldy and has been in place for many years and the management of the Courts Service has been inadequate.  For those reasons, I welcome the Bill and what it sets out to achieve in respect of the Courts Service.  As consumers, citizens have a right to expect quality service from the courts as they do in other areas.  The independence of the Courts Service, which the Minister is seeking to accomplish by way of the Bill, is vitally important.</P>
      <P>I agree with the provisions of the Bill in respect of the composition of the Courts Service Board. I am intrigued about the person to be nominated by the Minister to represent consumers of the services provided by the courts.  Perhaps that person should be someone with a good criminal record who has been suitably reformed.  However, I have no doubt the Minister will deal with this issue in good time.</P>
      <P>Section 15 is important because it provides for the establishment of committees to investigate particular aspects of court operations.  I am glad the Minister acknowledged the serious problem in respect of courthouse facilities and conditions. We all agree they are not up to scratch and are not what we want to see in our democracy.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 26 which states that courthouses, the property and the functions of the service will be vested in the board at a suitable juncture, presumably by way of ministerial order.  I always thought it wrong that county councils should have any function in the provision or maintenance of courthouses.  I am delighted that will cease on the enactment of this Bill and the setting up of the board.  I also welcome section 29 which provides that any other statutory function relevant to the work of the service may be conferred on the service by Government order.  I welcome the fact that the Minister said he will still be politically accountable, which is right.</P>
      <P>As regards sentencing policy, we have all been intrigued by the different sentences handed down for similar offences.  I do not know if this is relevant to the Bill but perhaps the Minister could use his good offices to ensure judges are in touch with one another, through seminars or whatever, particularly those in the lower courts, to guarantee some semblance of uniformity.  It is an issue which, from time to time, outrages the public and I recommend that the Minister consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we were interrupted by Senator Cosgrave, who engaged in activity which I suggest is not in keeping with the Cosgrave tradition, I said the Minister was fortunate to have had Deputy Owen as a predecessor.  She did wonderful ground work on these Bills and laid the foundations.  The former Minister established the working group which completed its work and we now have a Bill as a result.  It is appropriate to compliment Mrs. Justice Susan Denham and the members of the working group on reporting so efficiently and effectively to the Minister.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a welcome development because there is a need to modernise the courts system and the way the courts operate.  I am delighted the Minister has taken this route and decided to set up a board.  The proposed membership of the board is commendable because it is important that those who are most familiar with the courts system are members.  It should ensure the provision of an efficient service.</P>
      <P>Throughout the debate, the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; has been used.  We associate many things with the courts, but &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; is unusual in this regard. We usually refer to the consumer as a consumer of specific goods or services.  The public would not aspire to be consumers of the Courts Service. Only some members of the legal profession would aspire to be users of the Courts Service. We are the consumers of the Courts Service.  I find this interesting new piece of terminology which we are applying to the service rather amusing to put it mildly because one is not a consumer in court; one is either the prosecutor or the accused, but one is definitely not a willing consumer of the service.  Applying that particular word in this scenario is a little ludicrous and merely carrying modern terminology too far.  We are talking about courts which provide a specific service and it is important that the service, which is part of a legal and constitutional service, is carried out in the most effective and efficient way possible.</P>
      <P>The Bill states that meetings of the board must be held at least every three months and this is essential.  I hope that the board will meet far more often and that members may be renominated after three years or new members appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about one section of the Bill in particular.  Everyone in this Chamber is familiar with the efficient work of county registrars and I am concerned that the Minister has decided to <Col N="141" /> change completely the position of county registrars. In effect, this Bill abolishes the position of county registrar.  That is not a good idea.  Section 24(1) and Schedule 1 would clearly suggest that this is the case.</P>
    <P>Maybe the Minister might elaborate on section 9(b), which relates to the independence of the exercise of judicial functions.  It states:</P>
    <P>No function conferred on or power vested in the Service, the Board or the Chief Executive, under this Act shall be exercised so as to interfere with the conduct of that part of the business of the courts required by law to be transacted by or before one or more judges or to impugn the independence of..</P>
    <P>(b) a person other than a judge in the performance of limited functions of a judicial nature conferred on that person by law.</P>
    <P>Does that refer to county registrars?  If that is the only section which refers to them, there is a need to amend the Bill to clearly establish their position.</P>
    <P>The Minister should remember that county registrars were established under the Court Officers Act, 1926, and that they have a specific quasi-judicial function.  If, as it seems, the Minister proposes in this Bill to subsume them into the Civil Service, that is a totally different situation. At present, county registrars are appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government.  They are independent appointments.  Now the Minister is suggesting that they will become civil servants and, in the future, will be appointed by the Civil Service Commission.  That is not a wise decision and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>County registrars have a definite quasi-judicial function; they act as county sheriffs.  Coming, like the Minister, from a rural constituency, I am sure he fully appreciates the importance of that function and how it is implemented in each and every county.  It is extremely important that the county registrar is independent and able to make specific judgments, with his or her local knowledge, as county sheriffs.</P>
    <P>The county registrars are also arbitrators and they make judgments in relation to landlord and tenant disputes and this, again, is a quasi-judicial function.  They also manage the Circuit Court as it moves to different locations around the country, and that is extremely important.  They also have a statutory function under the Electoral Acts as returning officers at general and presidential elections and at referenda.  Therefore, it is extremely important that they be allowed to maintain these quasi-judicial functions and, as the Bill stands, this would not appear to be the case. They are also district probate officers and county land registry officers.  I appeal to the Minister to examine all these issues.  These are statutory powers vested in county registrars.  They are not court clerks or civil servants but have a specific judicial <Col N="142" /> function.  It is amazing that this course of action is being taken by the Minister at this time.  I appeal to him to re-examine this and ensure there is consultation on the matter.</P>
    <P>I know his predecessor was involved in consultation as is this Minister.  He was supposed to get back to these people within a month but his officials have not got back to them since their last meeting with the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to do so not just in the interests of county registrars but in the interests of the people.  If this Bill is enacted who will appoint the county registrar in future?  Will these appointments be made subject to the Local Appointments Commission?</P>
    <P>This is an extremely serious matter which should be addressed by the Minister and I am disappointed that he did not elaborate on it in his speech.  It is the one outstanding issue.  He chose in his speech to exclude the Master of the High Court, who, he stated, exercises a &ldquo;quasi-judicial function&rdquo;.  He recognised that in his speech but he did not recognise that county registrars exercise a quasi-judicial function also.  I appeal to him between now and Committee Stage to rectify that matter and provide the same exclusion to county registrars as he has provided to the Master of the High Court.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators Coghlan and Taylor-Quinn for their generosity of spirit in proposing to extend some of their time to me but I assure them that we, on this side of the House, are not that badly off yet although it may have appeared to them that there was confusion as to the allocation of time this afternoon.</P>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill, I welcome the Minister as this is his second appearance in the House today.  I welcome in particular the fact that this is a double first for the Minister, and I make no apology for repeating that.  It is a first for him in initiating four Bills in the Seanad in one week and in bringing four Bills through Second Stage in a House in one week.  It is important that the record clearly show that is the case.</P>
      <P>This Minister was extremely vocal, articulate and definitive in his understanding of necessary anti-crime measures in Opposition and he came in for some criticism as a result, as I said this morning.  As Minister, he deserves the highest commendation for being equally strong and forceful, and for being a politician of action, in bringing forward a wide ranging package of legislation. This Bill is but one of a series, and it is very important.  Among his objectives are the clear determination to fast track trials, the conviction of the guilty to the maximum possible extent by the elimination of the loopholes in the law &mdash; he stated definitively that he was determined to look at that, even if it took going through the statutes to eliminate existing loopholes &mdash; and tougher sentences where stronger signals need to be given to the criminal godfathers.  All of these objectives will inevitably lead to even more pressure on an already hard pressed system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> In commending the Minister for bringing forward this Bill after such a short period in office and shortly after the receipt of the final report from the working group, to which I will refer, I also commend his predecessor, Deputy Owen.  I would not be as eulogistic in her regard as the previous speaker although I concur that the courts system was badly in need of review, as it had not had one for over 70 years, and action was badly needed.  I commend the Minister's predecessor for setting this review process in train and for overseeing publication of the third report.  The fourth report may have been published in her tenure but I am unsure of that.  Departments often display lethargy and coyness in publishing Bills as a follow up to what in many instances were good comprehensive reports which deserved and merited comprehensive legislation.</P>
    <P>The courts system has until now been under the administration of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Recent evidence suggested that the quality of administration had become unsatisfactory and that the quality of service delivered had seriously deteriorated at a time when demands were increasing and at a phenomenal rate in some categories of cases.  For example, the public has become very claims conscious over the past ten years and this has added a substantial burden of work to the courts system with no concomitant reform or substantial addition in resources, personnel or equipment, to meet that increased demand.</P>
    <P>It is little wonder, therefore, that the first interim report of the working group on a courts commission chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham &mdash; everyone has paid tribute to her for chairing the working group and issuing these reports &mdash; was widely referred to as a milestone for having recognised the crisis in the courts system.  The central conclusions of that report and subsequent ones &mdash; the second was a follow up and the fourth dealt with the role of the chief executive &mdash; have been adopted in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A radical reform of the management of the courts system was called for so that day to day control would be removed from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I am delighted the Minister has quickly embraced the central recommendation of the report and has shown the courage and commitment to bring it forward in legislation.  He has ensured the general service will be answerable to him and to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Annual reports must be laid before both Houses and strategic plans must be submitted to the Minister every three years.  These are vital links which must be retained by the new Courts Service in the interests of accountability.</P>
    <P>One of the cornerstones of any democracy is the right of a citizen to have ease of access to the courts of the land to right a wrong or redress an injustice they feel has been meted out to them by the State, an individual, an organisation or a <Col N="144" /> corporate body.  A victim of crime has a right to see that justice is done in an efficient, effective and speedy manner.  The ordinary citizen has a fundamental democratic right enshrined in the Constitution of ease of access to the courts.  It is an inviolable right which must be protected by Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by Governments.  They must also take prompt action where there is evidence to suggest this right is being denied, inhibited or frustrated. The Bill is a significant response to that problem and the Minister has shown he is determined to uphold and preserve that right in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing the legislation forward after only four months in office and shortly after the receipt of four reports in this area.  The terms and measures are based on the recommendations of the working group on a courts commission in its third report entitled <i>Towards the Courts Service,</i> published in November last year.  As the Minister pointed out, the chief executive's powers are based on the fourth report.  I believe the Bill will make a major contribution towards creating a much more efficient courts system.  The structures proposed will make the courts more streamlined, focused, unified and integrated in discharging their functions.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the resources aspects are being examined in detail because they will be fundamental in ensuring this new service works efficiently from the earliest date.  There must be training of personnel and, if adequate provision is not made, I earnestly encourage the Minister to ensure it be provided where it is lacking and shortcomings are evident.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to utilise the large pool of expertise available.  The expertise, experience and knowledge of the workings of the system will be invaluable in the launch of the service and will make a considerable contribution on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's decision to direct the new service to computerise its systems.  He acknowledged that the system of operations in terms of communications systems and mechanisms is outmoded, belongs to another century and was born of the need for a service which has nothing to do with the wide ranging complexities of and the huge volume of demands on the service at the moment.</P>
    <P>Resources directed by a unified body in a focused and streamlined way will ensure the delivery of a far superior service into the next millennium. Radical reforms are proposed in structure and administration which will create far reaching efficiencies thus enhancing the quality of service available to the public and significantly improving the fundamental right of access.  The first and second reports of the working group detailed serious delays, major inefficiencies, cumbersome procedures, outmoded practices and poor quality communications systems as contributing to the backlog of cases to be heard in both <Col N="145" /> criminal and civil areas.  This chaos gives increased potency to the argument that justice delayed is justice denied.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill establishes a Courts Service which will have the function of managing the courts and its functions are defined in section 5.  I will not go into detail on these as the Minister has already outlined them.  I have no doubt they are of tremendous significance and will prove an invaluable part in the successful and smooth working of this new service.  Subsequent Parts provide for the establishment of a board to determine policy and appoint a chief executive officer responsible for the day to day operations and management of the service.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a clear recognition and acknowledgement by the Minister that the arrangements which have existed since the 1920s, whereby the administrative infrastructure of the courts lay with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are simply not tailored to meet the demands and requirements of a modern democracy. Recent events in the courts, which regrettably did little to enhance confidence in the courts system, bear stark testimony to the urgent need for radical administrative reform.  I do not want to go into any greater detail on that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to establish a board in the Courts Service as provided for in Part III of the Bill.  Like other Members, I am impressed with its composition which is wide ranging and provides for a broad range of expertise.  It comprises of judges from all courts, from the Supreme Court to the District Court, with a good non-legal counterbalance and a consumer representative.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn and others questioned the definition of a representative of consumers of services provided by the courts.  I am not in a position to give a definitive view as to who that person should be or what category of person should be considered but the decision to include such a person widens and broadens the representation. The presence of an ICTU representative and an administrative/financial expert on the board is equally welcome.  Such a broadly based aggregate of interests and expertise will ensure a proper balance is struck and maintained between the internal efficiency needs of the service and its primary role, which is the common good in the discharge of a court system of justice.  In this context, it is important to recognise the safeguard in section 9 of the Bill, which ensures that no power or function conferred on any member of the board or on the board itself can at any time interfere with the independence of a judge in the exercise of his judicial duties.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us an historic milestone in terms of court legislation, his anti-crime package and in upholding and promoting the public's right of access to the courts, whether the people involved are victims of crime or feel aggrieved at the hands of public or private corporations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this significant, historic and long overdue Bill.  The setting up of the board is the result of an initiative of the previous Government and it is good to see the current Administration take the proposal on board in its entirety.  The Minister indicated that it represents the start of a trend of setting up independent agencies to run not only the judicial system but also, for instance, the Probation and Welfare Service. That would have a beneficial effect, as will this Bill.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the legislation because it is considered and based on several well written reports. I join the tributes to Mrs. Justice Susan Denham for her work and initiative in this regard.  The legislation is well thought out; it knows what it wants to achieve and it does so.  It compares favourably in that regard with the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill which we discussed yesterday &mdash; that was neither well thought out nor studied adequately.  In contrast, this is a fine Bill. As I said, the Bill is long overdue.  In his opening remarks, the Minister said: &ldquo;In recent years a dramatic increase in the number of cases coming before the courts has placed a very severe strain on the administration of justice&rdquo;.  I take it he is making a direct connection between the increased business of the courts and the establishment of this service.  While the service should have a beneficial effect on the running of the courts, the third report of the working group &mdash; entitled <i>Towards the Courts Service</i> and issued in November 1996 &mdash; states:</P>
      <P>The establishment of an independent courts service is an historic move representing unfinished business since the establishment of the State.  In the 1920s under the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann and legislation, the structure of Government was altered and the administrative infrastructure for the courts was placed mainly with the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>It is now the 1990s, which shows how long overdue is this legislation.</P>
      <P>It is overdue in other senses also.  By placing the management of the courts in the hands of a board we are sending a signal that we trust an independent body to do this job.  We are also acknowledging that the Courts Service needs a chief executive and a considerable number of staff to run it.  Now that the desirability of efficiency and good management is central to the thinking of Government and private institutions, it is good to see such thinking emerge from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> Some people see the provision of good buildings for working and living as a frill but it is much more important than that.  The Minister was right to mention accountability and responsibility in his speech.  It is crucial that those who have dealings with courts and the justice system &mdash; whether they be full-time staff or those with occasional reference to the system, such as jury members, unfortunate victims or witnesses &mdash; find it a satisfactory experience.  However, people's current experience of the court system is far from satisfactory and much of this has to do with the management of the Courts Service.  This legislation, providing for the initiation of an independent board with a chief executive, is therefore welcome. I have no doubt that the new board will do its job well but even if it only half does its job, it will be an improvement on the current position.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned court buildings; the quality of some of these is extremely bad, which sends a negative signal to those with reason to use the system.  In the run-up to the divorce referendum it was drawn to the attention of the then Minister, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, on more than one occasion that people involved in family law cases find themselves in difficult and unamenable surroundings. This is often their only contact with the court system and this urgent matter must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Bill ring-fences the Four Courts building and the Minister mentioned its historic and cultural associations.  That building is the most public manifestation of our justice system but if I had my way I would take all court operations out of that building and place it in a modern, streamlined building. This may attract criticism from those who practise in the building but I approach the matter from a consumer viewpoint.  The Four Courts is an extraordinary place; it is intimidating and difficult to find one's way around.  Both as a member of a jury and in my occasional work there as a journalist I found the facilities appalling.  Should we not remove court operations from that building and view it for what it is, a fabulous, historic building with heritage associations?  We could put the operation of the courts into a modern building designed for the purpose and which would have the facilities needed for judges, court officials, the media, witnesses and juries.</P>

    <Title>Hospital Waiting Lists: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Minister for Health and Children for his failure to take the necessary steps to eliminate hospital waiting lists as promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I wish him well in his portfolio, which is not <Col N="148" /> an easy one.  I do not wish simply to condemn because I am aware of the nature of the problem of waiting lists as a former chairman of the board of a voluntary hospital.  I was involved in the merger of two hospitals in the Cork region and I was very conscious of the need to ensure that the hospitals worked better and provided a better service.  I am sure the Minister supports such aims having heard him speaking in a similar vein in Cork.</P>
    <P>There are areas of health care where people do not seem to receive an optimum service, in particular cardiology and hip replacements.  With regard to cardiology services I am concerned, as a result of a report I read, that there are more consultant appointments in the Eastern Health Board region than in other regions.  In the Southern Health Board area consultants do not seem to be appointed on the same ratio basis as in the eastern region.  That is unfair to the people who need the services.</P>
    <P>That said, it is a good long-term policy to have more consultants.  The more quickly patients can see consultants the better because it will result in fewer people occupying public and private beds. I am aware of people who have had to wait from two to four years for cardiac surgery.  I realise it is a difficult health care issue but the comparisons for the southern and western regions with the eastern region are unfavourable.  In some cases public beds in a voluntary hospital were occupied for 16 to 18 weeks by patients waiting for cardiac surgery.  That is a long period to have a public bed tied up unnecessarily.  With the cost of a bed being occupied for such a period the patient could be sent anywhere in Europe for treatment at a saving.</P>
    <P>The patients had to stay in hospital for such an extended period because the cardiologist could not take the responsibility of letting them go home.  It is unfair that these public beds which are needed for other patients cannot be made available to them because the cardiac patients cannot be treated.  I do not make the point lightly but it is a fact.  In the Southern Health Board area the cardiac and hip operation services being provided are tying up beds unfairly for the hospital staff and especially for the patients who may need the beds more urgently.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister address the issue of comparing the work of the health boards and the voluntary hospitals?  We should consider whether enough money is being given to the voluntary hospitals compared to the health boards.  Is too much money being spent due to health board policies which could be better spent through the voluntary hospitals?  I feel strongly that this issue merits greater consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the upgrading of voluntary hospitals we should be greatly encouraged by the development of St. James's Hospital in Dublin.  It is a credit to all involved.  Such a facility is needed in the south, west and north-west areas.  St. James's Hospital is a credit but that is because of <Col N="149" /> the number of consultants available.  Decisions can be made and operations can be done very quickly.  The 24 hour service provided at St. James's Hospital is not available in other regions and it should be.  The facilities are available in other regions but they are not used to their full extent.</P>
    <P>We have managed to tackle waiting lists in many areas.  With regard to hip operations, for example, the problem was tackled to a certain degree by sending patients to Belfast for treatment. People laughed at that approach when it was suggested but it has been a great success.  We should not be afraid to consider availing of services provided in other regions or countries.  If such an approach works why should we keep a patient in bed for 16 to 18 weeks at a cost of about £770 a week?  That patient could be treated elsewhere at less cost and money could be saved. Serious consideration should be given to eliminating waiting lists as promised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  Although the Minister has allocated an extra £12 million for waiting lists based on the post-budget figures, £9 million of which has been provided already, the total amounts are still disgracefully inadequate. Patients are dying because of an insufficiently funded health system.  The figures I am using have been gleaned from newspapers, hospitals, the Minister in answers to parliamentary questions and interested personnel.  More than 30,000 people are awaiting necessary medical treatment. People can be waiting up to ten years for life saving heart surgery, while cancer patients are waiting up to four months for radiotherapy.  Up to 20 per cent of heart patients die before they are reached on hospital waiting lists.  There are 1,600 adults and 150 children awaiting heart surgery. The problem has become so bad that heart patients from the west are being referred to Britain for surgery in an effort to alleviate the problem.  It is sad that the further a patient lives from Dublin the longer they have wait for surgery.</P>
      <P>Maurice Neligan, a leading heart surgeon, stated in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Thursday, 4 December, that &ldquo;a recent review of just 250 patients found 47 died awaiting surgery.  That is 20 per cent.  If you extrapolate those figures to the waiting list as a whole, well in excess of 100150 people have died awaiting treatment over the past five or six years&rdquo;.  I was at the funeral yesterday evening of a priest awaiting heart surgery.  I am not saying he died because he was awaiting surgery, but the operation was supposed to take place on Friday.  Mr. Neligan also stated that the heart unit in the Mater Hospital urgently needs the capacity to do 500 extra heart operations per year.  The hospital currently carries out 15 to 16 operations per week.  I cannot dispute these figures &mdash; we must believe them as they come from a leading heart surgeon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> An OECD report does not make good reading in revealing that the share of national income devoted to health services in Ireland has dropped by 5 per cent and that Irish health spending as a proportion of national income is less that the average of our EU partners and other major industrialised countries.  The situation is so acute that the health services could easily absorb the country's entire budget and still require more funding.  I do not expect the Minister to immediately address this but it is an extraordinary figure.</P>
    <P>I was appalled by the numbers on waiting lists. The longest waiting list included 6,592 people waiting for ear, nose and throat procedures; 1,299 patients are on waiting lists for hip replacements, over 500 for more than one year.  Other problem areas include orthopaedics, general surgery, vascular surgery, ophthalmology, gynaecology and urology.  All these areas need to be targeted for additional funding.</P>
    <P>There are 1,600 patients on the cardiac surgery public waiting lists, over 70 per cent of whom have been waiting for over one year.  According to the Minister's figures, there are 902 patients on the Mater Hospital's waiting list, 502 on St. James's, 64 on Cork University Hospital's and 109 on Crumlin hospital's.  Over 10,000 patients on hospital waiting lists for medical and surgical treatment have been waiting for longer than the Government's target maximum period of one year.  Over 505 children are on hospital waiting lists for longer than six months, the maximum target period set by the Department of Health and Children.  Those aged 85 years and over will increase by 50 per cent by 2006 and the advent of expensive, high-tech treatments will mean the problem will get worse in the future.</P>
    <P>I question the Department's proposed policy &mdash; I wonder if the Minister is still pursuing it &mdash; to introduce changes in the funding of waiting lists by only providing funding for hospitals which show their waiting lists are caused by excess demand rather than inefficiency.  This will only serve to penalise patients on the waiting lists of hospitals judged to be inefficient.  They will have to wait longer for treatment or travel to another centre.  I call on the Government to use the funding to identify the inefficiencies rather than compound the problem by withdrawing critical services, because the most likely result of this policy is that more patients will die.  There is an urgent need for improved management structures throughout the health service in order to get the best from those working in the service in an efficient and effective manner.  The Department of Health and Children must review its funding in this area.  The needs of the patient's health and wellbeing must not be overshadowed.  It is scandalous that so many are needlessly suffering and dying due to the lack of a coherent and proper health strategy.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the figures of the Mid-Western Health Board for acute hospital services and in-patient waiting lists <Col N="151" /> up to 30 December 1997.  There are just two patients on the cardiology waiting list because there are no cardiology services in Limerick. There are 98 patients on the dental waiting list. There is concern about people working in the orthodontic area who are not specialists while some orthodontic specialists who have the required qualifications cannot get into the system. I believe the orthodontic service of Ireland is extremely concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly look at the figures from the regional hospital where there are 924 public patients on waiting lists for between three and 12 months and 901 on waiting lists for over 12 months.  In St. John's Hospital, Limerick, there are 182 patients on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take a particular interest in attention deficit disorder which is common in the Limerick area &mdash; although not overly so &mdash; where up to 10 per cent of children are sufferers. Parents and support groups have been to the fore in the Limerick area in raising awareness of this issue and I hope the Minister will provide the necessary expertise and immediate funding to allow the Mid-Western Health Board to set up a pilot programme for the assessment of children suffering from it.  I do not have time to discuss what the disorder means for parents.  The health board is aware of a number of children showing symptoms of this disorder in the mid-west.  There is an immediate need to assess four teenagers for funding which will enable them travel to the learning assessment centre in West Sussex.</P>
    <P>The problem will not go away and I appeal to the Minister to ensure information is given to teachers which will enable them alert the health authorities and general practitioners to the problem. General practitioners and the medical profession in general need information to allow them help the parents of children who suffer from attention deficit disorder.  Sufferers are known as children with a hidden handicap and there are many children who have this handicap who have not yet been diagnosed.  We must investigate this issue and funding must be provided to establish an expert group in the mid-western region where some work has already been done.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can make inroads into the waiting lists of the regional hospital and St. John's Hospital in Limerick, and throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1: To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the recent initiatives taken by the Minister for Health and Children to reduce waiting lists and supports his policies to channel waiting list funding to best effect&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised that this motion should be tabled so early in the life of this Seanad.  The Minister, hardly a wet week in Hawkin's House, is being <Col N="152" /> berated for the misdeeds of his predecessors and their lack of attention to certain areas.  However, it is the right of Members to table motions as they wish.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to some points raised by Senator Cregan, the thrust of whose argument was that health boards in the east are favoured over other health board areas.  I hope I am not misinterpreting him but the majority of problems are in the east.  Most of the population is there and the demand exists.  I do not suggest demands are not placed on health boards in other areas, but they are not as large.  Ministers must take cognisance of the facts as they are presented to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan also raised the general point that perhaps it is time to consider the work of health boards.  They are in the health care delivery area and after more than 30 years, it is time to consider their operations.  A review of the Eastern Health Board is taking place at present. Health boards are good at dealing with specialist and general hospital care.  However, they do not have a good input when it comes to community care.  They are too far removed from community care on the ground.  We should consider re-establishing the old health authorities in Dublin and Cork.  They would be better at delivering community care in terms of district nursing and palliative care services in homes.  However, this is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman quoted at length an eminent cardiac consultant in the Dublin area.  However, as he said, people who are not on waiting lists also die.  It does not change the position.</P>

      <P>We can argue about long waiting lists, but I was interested to learn that the Department of Health and Children is considering not just the lists but the waiting time.  This area should be examined and followed up.</P>
      <P>Certain areas, such as cardiac surgery, demand high support services.  They are expensive and involve many staff.  However, other areas involve equal skills but do not need massive funding for beds.  In a recent initiative, the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin substantially reduced its waiting list for cataract surgery by using hotel rather than hospital beds.  Patients were operated on in the hospital and accommodated in adjacent hotel beds for the 24 hour follow up period.  This did not involve a large capital expense but it reduced the waiting list for cataract surgery by over 100 in a week.</P>

      <P>We must put matters in context when we discuss waiting lists.  According to Department of Health and Children figures for <Col N="153" /> 1947, 25 per cent of deaths were due to heart disease, 15 per cent to senility and 9 per cent to cancer. The 1995 figures show that 24 per cent of deaths were due to cancer and that heart disease still accounted for 25 per cent of deaths despite all the research and advances made over the years.  A dent has not been made in the number of deaths due to cardiac disease.</P>

      <P>Many years ago I was a student of dentistry in Dublin.  In those days, a dentist's job involved extractions and fitting dentures. However, the then Minister for Health, in the face of opposition in the Supreme Court, introduced fluoridation.  There is now a new dental industry.  Children no longer have teeth extracted and the need is for orthodontists.  There were three orthodontists in Dublin 30 years ago.  Now it is the major subspecialty of the profession.  The point is that if one problem is solved, another is created in the future.  I do not suggest that problems should not be solved; I do not want children or adults to have painful teeth.  However, when a problem was eliminated through fluoridation, the science or art of orthodontics was created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">

    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter into which the Senator can get his teeth.  The Fitzgerald report, which was issued 30 years ago, forms the basis of the structure of our hospital services. It is time to produce a new report.  The Department of Health and Children should meet professionals, examine the current position and consider what problems will arise in the future.  For example, people have healthier lifestyles and are living longer.  There have been amazing advances in maternity services.  Children weighing only two pounds or less when they are born now survive.</P>
      <P>We must consider where pressure points will arise in the future and address them before they overtake us.  As the Secretary of the Department of Health and Children said, the tolerance level for long delays in accessing services and long delays when people reach them and tolerance for anything other than appropriate care and respect will reduce steadily as the economy grows, people become better educated and an awareness of what constitutes good health care becomes widespread in the population.  This is the fundamental problem facing us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children increased health spending this year by 11 per cent to £3.1 billion.  This is 20 per cent of total Government spending.  It is an amazing amount of money and will increase in the future.  As another speaker said, where do we call a halt because the basic issue is the allocation of resources?  On a parochial matter, I welcome the £25 million development plan for the Mater Hospital.  This <Col N="154" /> will be a great initiative in the area I represent.  I also welcome the launch by the Minister of the Irish Hospice Foundation Palliative Care Service. One does not have to be a doctor to realise that this is a growing area of health problems.</P>

Senators will be aware that this problem existed before I became Minister for Health and Children and that it is unlikely to be resolved easily.  Successive Governments have grappled with it and none can claim to have come up with a speedy solution.</P>
      <P>The existence of waiting lists is a serious problem for patients and their families.  In addressing it, however, it is important to remember that waiting lists are not peculiar to Ireland; they are one of the major issues facing hospitals and health systems throughout the world.  It is easy to look at waiting lists and criticise Governments for not reducing them more quickly.  It is much more difficult to put in place a structured, carefully targeted set of initiatives which will help to address the problem rather than acting merely as a substitute for real action.  This is what I have done.</P>
      <P>When I took office at the end of June, I decided to take stock of the waiting lists area.  I wanted to determine how to use the money available to the greatest possible effect.  In particular, I wanted to avoid a situation where money might be allocated without any real assessment of its impact.  With these factors in mind, I decided to take the following steps, which have been passed on to health boards and hospitals by my Department as part of the allocations process.</P>
      <P>First, I made sure that hospitals would be notified immediately of the exact funding available to them during 1998 for waiting list work.  This is a valuable step forward.  In previous years hospitals were not informed of their waiting list funding until as late as June or July.  Hospitals will now be able to plan their activity, including waiting list procedures, from the beginning of the year. Second, I instructed that the service plans to be prepared by health agencies should specify clear targets for waiting list activity during 1998.  It will be the responsibility of the chief executive officer or hospital manager to ensure that these targets are achieved and to take corrective action as necessary.  Third, I indicated that hospitals should pay particular attention to waiting times rather than waiting lists alone.  This is vital because the rate at which the waiting list is cleared is of much more practical concern to patients than the size of the waiting list on which they appear.  Fourth, I asked that where agencies have not already done so, they should now designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work so that the system is streamlined and resources available are used to the best possible effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also emphasised to health boards and <Col N="155" /> hospitals the importance of validating their waiting lists.  If this is not done, we risk not having a clear and up to date picture of the current situation. There is a danger that some patients will be incorrectly included on a waiting list due to validation problems.  My Department has recently reminded hospitals of the need to exclude certain categories from their lists, such as patients who have received treatment elsewhere; patients who, on the basis of clinical judgment, no longer need treatment; and patients who have been placed on a waiting list in anticipation of their needing treatment at some future stage.</P>
    <P>These initiatives are a practical response to the problem of waiting lists.  They are based on a careful assessment of the problem and on a realistic response to it.  The original motion proposed by the Fine Gael Senators sets out to condemn me for &ldquo;failure to take the necessary steps to eliminate hospital waiting lists&rdquo;.  The initiatives that I have just outlined to the House demonstrate fully that this claim is simply not true. There is no doubt that the initiatives which I have announced will take some time to make an impact on waiting lists and waiting times, but Senators on the other side of the House can hardly claim that I have failed to take the necessary steps to address the issue.</P>
    <P>In addition to the initiatives that I have described I am happy to draw Senators' attention to the fact that I am allocating 50 per cent more to the waiting list programme in 1998 than was done by my predecessor in 1997.  I have allocated £12 million for waiting list work in the coming year; £9 million has been allocated already and the balance of £3 million will be allocated in the near future when I have had an opportunity to review the situation in relation to waiting lists for cardiac surgery.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I am not simply throwing money at this problem in the hope that it will be solved.  Not only have I substantially increased the amount of money available, I have also ensured that it is allocated on the basis of a rigorous analysis of how to achieve the best possible outcome for patients.  To this end the available resources were allocated for 1998 having careful regard to waiting times rather than the length of waiting lists alone; the principles of health gain and social gain as set out in the health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>; and the need to direct money towards a small number of selected target specialties.  I am conscious that spreading the funds among too many specialties may mean that little progress is made in any area.</P>
    <P>I have undertaken that the causes underlying waiting lists in particular areas will be assessed.  It is not sufficient to allocate money where waiting lists arise &mdash; we must identify the reason for the emergence of a waiting list in the first place.  With this and other factors in mind I will shortly commission an independent evaluation of the waiting list initiative to examine how it has performed <Col N="156" /> since its introduction in 1993 and to identify other possible areas of improvement and development.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that I share their concerns about the serious problem of waiting lists.  I want to alleviate the problem for patients and their families by putting a realistic and workable set of initiatives in place.  The steps I have announced, and the 50 per cent extra funding in 1998, will not of course resolve the problem overnight &mdash; it would be foolish to claim that but I strongly believe that what I have done represents the correct way forward and will yield positive results in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Fine Gael position outlined by Senators Cregan and Jackman, I do not expect them to agree with me.  However, I expect them to be consistent.  Senator Jackman did not describe last year's national allocation of £8 million as disgraceful.  An allocation of £12 million is now being made available.  I remind the Senator that when the so-called adequate allocation was made to the Mid-Western Health Board, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, allocated £424,727 to the waiting list initiative.  I will allocate £689,000.  I remind Senator Cregan that the Southern Health Board was allocated £410,182; I will allocate £593,000.  I confirm to midlands colleagues that last year their health board was allocated £400,713 for its waiting list initiative; this year it will be allocated £580,000.  The North-Eastern Health Board was allocated £357,000 in 1997; it will be allocated £520,000 in 1998.  I could go on.  The figures have increased because of the significantly improved allocation.</P>
    <P>I do not expect unanimous approval, but I expect consistency.  It should be acknowledged that this is a serious attempt to seek to improve the situation.  Anyone who knows anything about modern health care provision will know that we will always have waiting lists.  However, I am carrying out an independent evaluation, increasing the allocation by 50 per cent and then putting practical measures in place.  Those in hospitals and health boards are being put on their mettle to validate the waiting lists and to concern themselves with making real progress in the specialties required.</P>
    <P>In relation to cardiac surgery, the previous administration proposed increasing numbers by 500.  I am preparing a cardiovascular strategy emphasising waiting times so that people in time will not have to wait more than six months from the time they are diagnosed as needing heart surgery. I intend to implement a plan over a period of years to show how that will be done on the capital and revenue sides.  That is a far more comprehensive way of dealing with one of the biggest causes of premature mortality in the country.  My predecessor, to his credit, brought forward a national cancer strategy.  My strategy relates not only to cardiac surgery but to the need to improve cardiology facilities and lifestyles.  It is lifestyle which determines social and health gains.</P>

      <P>This side of the House has no problem in acknowledging that the Minister is doing something, but we are concerned that not enough is being done.  We have a very serious problem with waiting lists.  A man came to one of my clinics in Cashel last week who was told by his doctor 12 months ago that he needed a hip replacement operation which he has not yet had.</P>
      <P>I was never a member of a health board, nor am I a doctor.  I do not claim to be an expert in this area.  However, the public is concerned that they must wait so long for operations which will give them a decent quality of life.  We boast of the Celtic tiger, but no politician can boast of doing a great job when people must worry for months while waiting to enter hospital.</P>
      <P>Last week there were increases in outpatient charges from £12 to £20.  The public inpatient charge also increased by £5. There were 20 years of strife in my constituency of Tipperary South between Cashel and Clonmel about the location of a sector hospital in the county.  That argument caused bitter divisions, not on political lines but between the two towns.  Two years ago a decision was reached, with which I did not agree, to locate the hospital in Clonmel.  Some people involved in that argument over the years, including some medical experts, made the point that smaller hospitals give a great service to the community.  I wonder if we were right to close down some of those hospitals.  The closure of St. Vincent's Hospital in Tipperary also caused a great deal of concern.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Fitzgerald report. I wonder if that is the best way to progress. Smaller hospitals are very homely.  Perhaps the Minister might examine the argument in favour of retaining smaller hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I have heard this debate so often in my professional life that my eyes almost glaze over at the mention of it.  I commend the Minister for his grasp of the issues and his reply.</P>
      <P>In my experience, waiting lists are the most fallible measure of health services.  Waiting lists are comprised of so many different elements that they tell us very little about the performance of the service.  It is true that people die on waiting lists, but the question is whether they die while they are waiting or because they are waiting.  The waiting time is a better measure.  It is necessary to develop some sort of performance indicators for the hospitals and health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister in trying to cope with infinite demand for finite resources.  One of the difficulties is that people want to advance on every front at the same time.  There is a feeling that the State should be able to provide the same level of care in all the services for everybody.  I am afraid that is no longer possible and the Minister must prioritise.  It would be better to focus resources and expertise on a small number of conditions, such as cardiology, cancer, hip joint <Col N="158" /> replacement and cataracts.  The Minister is wise to concentrate resources on the units which perform most efficiently.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker asked if it would be better to have many small hospitals, to which the short answer is no. There is a move towards the concentration of resources and extremely scarce expertise.  I would rather have my head opened by someone who does three such operations a week than someone who does three a year. Hospitals, surgeons, nurses and ancillary staff develop that expertise.  If the Fitzgerald report had been implemented at that time, the Minister would be in a better position now.</P>
    <P>It does not necessarily mean the death knell for the local hospital.  Such hospitals have a role, but there is a great deal to be said for seeing the entire hospital structure as a system in which a few high tech medical centres are the equivalent of the intensive care ward.  Technological advances mean that diagnosis and a great deal of treatment could be centralised.  There is no doubt that the concentration of services and interaction of medical professionals, particularly in cancer and cardiology treatments, provide better outcomes for patients.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the extent to which day procedures could be encouraged.  The number of surgical procedures which can be done on this basis is increasing &mdash; it is 30 per cent in Canada but is still quite low here.  I had two cataract operations last year.  I went in at 12.55 p.m., came out at 1.55 p.m. and went home at 3.30 p.m.. The use of day procedures frees up beds and hospital space.</P>
    <P>There is an argument for blitzing waiting lists for procedures such as heart operations by going outside the country.  I am not sure if the Belfast hospitals have much spare capacity.  A couple of years ago the western health board in Northern Ireland had its operations done in Oxford.  It suited the patients, worked very well and was highly preferable to being on a waiting list for a long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has grasped the essentials of the issue.  It might be worth his while to look, as a previous speaker suggested, at the structure of the health boards.  I am involved with a hospital in Belfast where the split by the health board between purchasers and providers was extremely helpful.  It sharpened up both parts and put hospitals on their toes.  It also meant that the health boards were surveying the health of their populations and creating their demands accordingly.</P>
    <P>There is no absolute answer to waiting lists, although Departments, Ministers and hospitals do their best.  There is a need, however, to concentrate resources on the areas which provide a return and I commend the Minister for so doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is entirely appropriate and I welcome the fact that the Minister has come to the House to discuss it.  Health <Col N="159" /> care is always a priority and concerns people of every age, every family and every area.  It is extremely important to provide a fair and adequate service across the country.  This motion deals with the problem of waiting lists, which arise in areas of serious concern.  For example, the number of outstanding heart operations in all hospitals, especially those which specialise in this area, is very serious.  The list has increased dramatically and there are reports of a number of people who have died because they did not get surgery on time.  That unsatisfactory situation must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Recommendations and appeals have been made to the Department regarding the provision of a proper transplant service but it has not reacted properly, despite the fact that it impinges hugely on those directly involved &mdash; the patients and their immediate families &mdash; and causes serious suffering and disruption.  This could be avoided.  The Minister is in a unique position to see the personal suffering involved and to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Some eight health boards are accountable to the Minister.  There are varying practises within each, some of which are commendable and others which can be criticised.  The Department should examine the discrepancies in the services provided from one health board to the next.  For example, many people who have moved from Dublin to County Clare under the rural resource development scheme find huge differences between the services provided by the health boards in the Dublin area and the Mid-Western Health Board.  It appears the former provides a better and wider range of services, including more specialist services.  This issue must be addressed.</P>
      <P>A recent report dealing with the women's health strategy, launched by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, recommended that a pilot scheme be established regarding the provision of maternity services for people in isolated rural areas.  The Minister should address this.  He should request the Mid-Western Health Board to establish a pilot project in County Clare for a proper maternity service because there is no such service in the county.  It was removed by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Hanlon, in the late 1980s.  Unfortunately, there are no Clare babies &mdash; they are either Limerick or Galway babies.</P>

      <P>The members of those teams were born in Ennis and were Clare babies. People from the Loop Head peninsula who have been offered a mast have no proper health service facilities.  A woman going into labour has to travel a minimum of 70 to 80 miles to a hospital that provides a maternity service.  The Minister should recommend that the Mid-Western Health Board establish a pilot scheme to provide a maternity <Col N="160" /> service in a small hospital to monitor its effectiveness. We might then have more Clare babies.</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty between the private and public services regarding the provision and location of mamographic testing for women.  There is a mamographic unit in the general hospital in Ennis, thanks to local voluntary funding.  However, in parts of the country some women must wait three to four months to avail of the service.  This can give rise to situations of life and death.  It must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Many older people are still awaiting hip replacements.  The Minister's predecessor was successful in reducing the waiting lists in hospitals across the country, but it appears to be increasing again.  The Minister rightly said that the reasons for waiting lists needs to be addressed.  There is a need for greater scrutiny in the health services regarding day to day management between the administrative and professional staff and the various interest groups involved.  When the services of a public hospital are provided to specialists for their use they should be for the benefit of public patients in the first instance.  Private patients can use other private hospitals.  The Minister must examine this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1993 to the end of 1997 a total of £58 million was provided to address the problems of waiting lists.  Fair minded people must concede that the Minister is taking the correct course of action.  Given the low inflation figures, which the Government is sustaining, I was amused to hear that while the provision of £8 million was sufficient in 1997, £12 million is not enough for 1998.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the Celtic tiger.  That must have been a toothless animal when the Minister's predecessor was in Government because he could find only £8 million.  In the short time he has been in office the present Minister has found an additional £4 million, an increase of 50 per cent.  There is therefore no merit in this motion.</P>
      <P>There was a waiting list of 39,423 in March 1993.  Yet, despite the input of £58 million from 1993 to the end of 1997, it amounted to 29,069 in March 1997.  The Minister was correct to say that it is not enough to throw money at the problem, because money alone is not resolving it.</P>
      <P>When it becomes apparent that inroads have been made new cases tend to be added to the lists to replace those who had received a service.  It is similar to digging a hole in a field with a high water table; the more that is dug out the more water seeps in.  It may also be expedient for some to have waiting lists.  For example, there may be a percentage for the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> A sustained effort to reduce waiting lists will not address the underlying reasons for their emergence.  I congratulate the Minister on his approach in this regard.  Long waiting lists could be the result of inadequate staffing or equipment, poor management of hospital facilities or a combination of such factors.  Providing money is only a stop gap measure unless the underlying causes are addressed.  Further analysis is required in this regard.  This problem can be addressed by targeting the limited available funds at a small number of selective specialties, setting specific objectives in relation to waiting times and ensuring that lists are properly validated.</P>
    <P>Of the £8 million allocated in 1997, £1.7 million was used for cardiac surgery.  The remaining £6.3 million funded 8,300 procedures.  The Minister referred to the increased allocations to various hospitals.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has increased the 1997 allocation of £400,713 to £580,000 for the health board in my area.</P>
    <P>The principles which apply to the allocation of money for waiting lists must be examined.  In the past money was directed towards a small number of selective specialties because little or no progress would be made if it was spread over too many areas.  There was an increased focus on waiting times rather than waiting lists.  Longer lists do not present as great a problem if they are created at a relatively quick rate.  Patients are only concerned about how long they must wait for treatment; the number of others waiting is of little concern to them.  The ultimate aim is to eliminate waiting times of longer than 12 months for adults and six months for children.  Emergencies and urgent cases must be treated on a different basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the criteria for 1998. He said agencies would be notified of the funding for waiting lists at the beginning of the year.  This will allow health boards to plan their strategies. It is clear that throwing money at the problem is not the answer; the underlying causes must be tackled.  There will be an increased focus on waiting times as well as waiting lists to ensure that children do not have to wait too long for treatment.</P>
    <P>This motion is unfair.  The Minister has paid attention to the problems of all health boards, including that in my area which received £580,000 this year.  He gave £0.305 million to Tullamore General Hospital and £85 million to Portlaoise General Hospital for the development of additional services.  The hospital in Longford-Westmeath received £25,000 for epidural services and we also got £1.5 million for the opening of phase 2A.  Members in the Lower House beat drums about this but funds were not provided in 1997.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the great job he is doing.  He may not be old with grey hair and a beard but he would give Santa Claus a run for his money in terms of his performance.</P>

      <P>This debate is totally focused on money as if the Minister could solve the problem by firing money at it.  I am glad he said we must identify the reason for the emergence of a waiting list in the first place.  I have raised two issues with the Leader on numerous occasions which will result in waiting lists getting longer no matter how much money is provided.  The first is the situation regarding non-EU graduates who staff a large number of our peripheral hospitals, particularly in such specialties as obstetrics, orthopaedics, psychiatry, paediatrics and accident and emergency.  They are having serious problems with temporary registration in this country.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council felt it had to bring in an English language test and certain standards for non-EU people.  However, we have not faced up to what the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> described this week as &ldquo;a looming medical manpower crisis&rdquo;.  It is not exaggerating because only three non-EU nationals have put their names down to sit this exam in December.  I do not know what we will do when we gradually run out of such people, some of whom are in senior registrar posts and doing great work to reduce our waiting lists.  I know we can bring people in from other EU countries but they may have trouble with the English language, although they would not have to sit an examination.  We may have trouble with them in some specialties as well.  There is an urgent need to address this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new university exam costs an entrant £475. This could rise to £1,000 when travelling expenses, accommodation, etc.  are taken into account.  It will cost them less to do the same exam in England.  Many excellent graduates came to this country from Asia, India and Pakistan to do training courses for six years because they were not required to do this exam until recently. This was not because they were no good but because it was easier to get in.  I and many other consultants believe they will vote with their feet now and go to England.  This will create a serious problem as they will not be part of our health service.  They have come here to do training courses but they have also done an enormous amount of work in the health service.  We are <Col N="163" /> seriously underestimating the problems we will have from 1 January onwards.</P>
    <P>There may also be a problem getting them to come here because we only allow them temporary registration for five years.  Many postgraduate training courses in surgery or orthopaedics are for six years.  What will they do about their fellowship if they are only registered for five years?  This is a serious problem which is not being addressed and which will cause us trouble in the near future. They have been the backbone of the service in the peripheral hospitals.  When they are gone, the Minister can provide whatever money he wants but there will be no one to do the operations.</P>
    <P>The Tierney report stated that we should have a consultant provided not a consultant led service. What has happened to this?  We get into difficulties such as that with hepatitis C. To begin with the Blood Transfusion Service Board had too few consultants because of an embargo.  At one stage it was staffed only by Dr. Walsh and Dr. Lawlor, who were present on a temporary basis to set up a bone marrow transplant unit.  This led to a very serious problem in the service.  There were hardly any haematologists in the country.  We have eight new haematologists coming on board but it is suggested that we need 19.</P>
    <P>Are we to have a consultant provided service or not?  If we are going to go on with a consultant led service let us forget the Tierney report and go on with what we are doing.  I am alarmed by the Ministers's continuous references in journals and newspapers to a sub-consultant grade.  Is this going to be a career grade for non-consultant hospital doctors trying to progress to consultant grade, or is it going to be a less well-trained or experienced grade which fills in for consultants?   If these doctors are as well-trained and experienced as consultants then why not make them consultants?  We have to decide what sort of service we wish to have.  It is not only about money. A great deal of effort, time and thought must go into this and on deciding in which direction we are going.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes's comments on the Fitzgerald report.  It was a pity this was not implemented.  A patient is better off in a place where doctors are performing an operation three times a week rather than three times a year.  We have to question why there is such a different success rate for the treatment of cancer around the country.  We need to look at these issues on an international as well as a national basis.  The time spent waiting for treatment is not the only issue, it also involves what treatment one is waiting for.</P>
    <P>I hope I have given the Minister some issues to think about.  We need to look at the problem of the well-trained, non-EU people we are going to be without and also the number of consultants.  I agree with looking to Northern Ireland to ensure that we integrate the two services.  There are periods of slack from time to time.  For example, we are performing liver transplants on patients from <Col N="164" /> Northern Ireland and they are performing hip replacements for us.  This is a good idea. However, I urge caution about going further afield, except in selected cases.  This is not so much for the sake of the patient or because of the cost involved.  If the illness is serious, funding may allow for only one person to go to the UK.  This is hard on the rest of the family.  The more we keep treatments within the island the better.</P>
    <P>We could integrate an enormous number of specialist services.  Garda Ben O'Sullivan went to Northern Ireland to have his shoulder reconstructed after being shot by the IRA in Adare. We need only one such trauma unit on the island. I hope the Minister will take on board some of the points I have made.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment that Seanad Éireann &ldquo;notes the recent initiatives taken by the Minister for Health and Children to reduce waiting lists and supports his policies to channel waiting list funding to best effect&rdquo;.  The Minister listed the various allocations which have been made for 1998.  These allocations speak for themselves.  I was surprised that this motion came before the House as the Minister has only been in office for five months.  The Estimates have only gone through most Departments during the past few days, so the timing of this motion is wrong.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a record of hard work and a common sense approach.  He will face the challenges of his portfolio.  I am extremely confident with Deputy Cowan as Minister for Health and Children.  I congratulate him on his appointment. We are fortunate to have such a young, energetic and enthusiastic Minister.</P>
      <P>Senators have given examples in support of the amendment.  I welcome the massive allocation of funds to the Midland Health Board.  Last year the figure was £400,000, this year it will be £580,000. This is a terrific increase to assist the board to reduce waiting lists.  However, I wish to mention the 1,600 who are waiting for heart bypass surgery. I am involved with the charity associated with Dr. Maurice Nelligan and his team in the Mater Hospital.  Many people are alive because of the expertise of this team.  If a second theatre was operational, it could take 500 people off the waiting list each year for the next three years.</P>

    <P>As politicians we might be tempted to ask what price is a person's life worth.  However, one cannot put a price on life.  The second theatre might be located in Galway or elsewhere.  Senator Hayes stated that investment should be directed to where experts are performing these operations on an hourly basis.  That second theatre would cost approximately £10 million.  The fund-raising charity has stated that it will match every pound donated by the Department.  Given that 500 people could be taken off the waiting list every year, perhaps the Minister and his Department could put some of this money in place at the next budget.  An extra £3 million will shortly be allocated <Col N="165" /> to cardiac surgery.  This is a priority for the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>We do not have a lung transplant facility in Ireland even though we are technologically ahead of most countries.  We have two trained lung transplant surgeons in the Mater Hospital &mdash; Dr. Maurice Nelligan and Dr. Freddie Wood.  An enormous number of patients suffer from respiratory problems, much of which stems from cigarette smoking.  I was more than an ordinary smoker but I kicked the habit 15 years ago. However, we must address this problem.  We have the experts who can train a new generation of surgeons.  This should be encouraged and we should provide a lung transplant unit.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his allocation of £1.5 million to the hospital in Longford-Westmeath in order to open parts of the new wing.  I also congratulate Deputy O'Rourke, who initiated the project when she was Minister for Health.  There was much discussion in the midlands about the allocation of funds for this project but no money was provided in the 1997 budget.  I was astounded by that, as were two colleagues of mine who work in the media and with whom I have close contact. The credit for this must go to the Fianna Fáil Party which has shown commitment to the general hospital in Mullingar.</P>
    <P>My final point concerns those waiting lists which relate to elderly people in rural areas.  In the budget the Minister for Finance made provision for nursing homes to come under the same tax heading as the hotels sector.  I welcome this development.  Families or individuals who have been successful in life and are living in rural areas or villages can, in conjunction with the health boards, help to establish such nursing homes, provide employment and eliminate the waiting lists for the elderly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, who lives in the same constituency as myself.  I welcome the fact that he has been in attendance for a substantial part of the debate because the issues under discussion are extremely serious.</P>
      <P>The waiting list initiative, as formulated in 1993, was intended to focus an annual share of the national health allocation on the reduction of waiting lists in respect of two targets.  In the case of adults, the initiative was intended to ensure that no adult was on a waiting list for any of the defined specialties for more than 12 months, or in the case of children for more than six months. While the number of people on a waiting list varies at any particular time, the pattern of allocation since 1993 shows that while it is not enough to throw money at a problem to solve it, a problem cannot be solved without the allocation of funding.  In that context I welcome the fact that the Minister has increased the allocation for the waiting lists initiative from £8 million this year to £12 million in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative is extremely good and I compliment Deputy Howlin, who, as Minister for <Col N="166" /> Health, was responsible for its introduction.  It is a good idea to withhold part of the budget allocation and tender for bids from hospitals, health boards and health agencies to see what is the best value for money which can be obtained in tackling the waiting lists in specialised areas rather than its being absorbed into the general Health budget.  I note the Minister's commitment to continuing the waiting list initiative and I welcome the process of fine tuning he hopes to undertake in the next year.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, £58 million has been allocated to the waiting list initiative.  With the £12 million allocated in 1998, this represents a special additional allocation of £70 million.  It is necessary that this be sustained.  The targets set are realistic and they are what the public expects.  We should ensure that the money is supplied and that the system is capable of applying it to targeted areas to ensure that the 12 month provision in respect of adults and the six month provision in respect of children are achieved.</P>
    <P>There are questions regarding whether I was a member of the Midland Health Board.  Perhaps my membership was the shortest of any in the history of the State.  However, I agree with colleagues on the opposite side of the House who are members of that health board that the additional allocation for our area in 1998 is welcome. That money will be put to extremely good use in the three general hospitals there.</P>
    <P>In the same way as he secured an additional allocation in respect of this waiting list for next year, will the Minister consult the Minister for Finance to see if a Supplementary Estimate or additional funding can be provided to tackle the waiting list for mental handicap services in the midlands and other areas?  An additional £7 million has been provided this year, but that is not adequate.  Everyone agrees that anyone waiting for a day or residential place should be able to obtain one.  Yet each Member can provide examples of cases where such places could not be provided.  One of the most effective ways of providing those places is through extending the system of community residences that health boards and voluntary agencies have initiated in the past five years.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of a case which has been brought to the attention of a number of public representatives in our area during the past two months.  This case involves an old age pensioner who is in very bad health and is trying desperately to find a place for their adult mentally handicapped son.  To date the health board has not been able to provide that place.  I would like to see all health boards secure an additional allocation and I urge the Minister to see if the Minister for Finance can provide such funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fully aware of the plight of the elderly, particularly in County Offaly.  I am waiting with expectation and confidence to see what allocation will be provided in this area.  Work has already begun in respect of Riada House in Tullamore. <Col N="167" /> The Minister has given prompt consideration to the situation in Birr and I hope that these areas will receive good news when the capital allocation is announced.</P>
    <P>With regard to the financial allocation for Health, I have already asked the Minister to consult the Minister for Finance to see if additional money can be obtained for the mentally handicapped. Will he also discuss with the Minister for Finance the agreed imposition of extra charges for public users of the health service?  A person who does not have a doctor's letter of referral will now be charged £20 instead of £12 and the charge for a public bed has been increased from £20 to £25, with an annual ceiling of £250 instead of £200.  I do not believe those charges are justified.</P>
    <P>Contributors to the system are mainly PAYE workers who are already paying a health levy of 1.2 per cent.  People believe they have already made a contribution towards the public charge for health services and the Minister for Finance should be able to find the money to cancel the announced increase.  He had plenty of money to distribute last week to those in our society who are well and who will never be placed on a hospital waiting list because they can afford private healthcare.  It is disappointing for the ordinary taxpayer that despite their health contribution and the major money they pay into the system, they are now going to be charged more for the services provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children is not a man to hang back when seeking to obtain something and I am confident that if he discusses the issues of the handicapped and the additional hospital charges with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, he will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  It is my intention to speak in favour of the amendment to the motion.  I commend the Minister for his input into last week's budget to ensure that the health services received a greater allocation of funds, £3.6 billion &mdash; 11 per cent more than they received last year under the previous Administration. The increased allocation relates particularly to people with disabilities, who have been ignored for too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion condemns the Minister for Health and Children for not eliminating hospital waiting lists.  If the problem were that simple and one person could be blamed, I would support the motion. Unfortunately, things are not as simple as they appear.  If we blame the Minister for the waiting lists, we should also blame him for road traffic accidents and the injuries and fatalities from them each year.  We could also blame him for the number of people who develop heart disease requiring hospital beds and surgery.  However, we must be realistic.  As far as I am concerned, this Minister or any other Minister cannot eliminate hospital waiting lists.  The bottom line is that we <Col N="168" /> will always have hospital waiting lists and there are a number of reasons for this.</P>
    <P>As soon as we take somebody off a list, another person will automatically go on it.  That is a fact of life.  There have been terrific advances in orthopaedic, plastic and cardiac and neurosurgery in recent years.  In my health board area there has been an almost 50 per cent reduction in the waiting list for hip replacements.  However, there is a down side.  Because of medical advances, we are now performing knee replacement operations, so the list is endless.  There will never be a reduction in waiting lists as long as that is the case.</P>
    <P>A hospital usually has four theatres and possibly ten to 12 surgeons, but there are only five days in a week.  No matter how much money is allocated, we can accommodate only a small number of surgeons.  I commend the previous Fianna Fáil administration which allocated a specific amount to waiting lists in June 1993 resulting in a reduction.  We can only reduce waiting lists for a short period because they will rise again as soon as the allocation is spent.</P>
    <P>There is another reason for the extent of waiting lists.  A person may be ready for surgery at 9 a.m. one morning; but if there is a road traffic accident or if a baby is born with a heart condition, those involved will automatically and rightly get priority.  Are we to ask the person involved in the road traffic accident to wait because elective surgery has been scheduled?</P>
    <P>People undergoing surgery for cardiac problems need specific and specialised nursing care. We must decide where our priorities lie.  We have terrific medical and nursing staff and anybody on a waiting list for cardiology treatment is cared for. If a person is on a list, they will receive the relevant treatment while waiting for surgery.</P>
    <P>The number on the waiting list in Crumlin Children's Hospital, in which I had a specific interest until recent months, has apparently risen by about 40 in the past year.  This increase has perhaps been incorrectly explained by the media in recent months.  Part of the reason for the increase in the list for cardiac surgery is that a cardiologist was temporarily assigned to Crumlin Children's Hospital which allowed the review and assessment of children to take place.  That did not affect the number awaiting surgery but it meant that those on the list got the best treatment available. Patients receive better treatment if they are diagnosed.</P>
    <P>We must reduce the number on waiting lists and that is why I support the amendment to the motion.  This is the first time innovative proposals have been made and I commend the Minister in this regard.  In 1987, when Fianna Fáil was in Government, tough decisions were made in relation to the health service.  Those decisions were not popular at the time but they have led to the improved health service we have today.  It does not surprise me that it has taken until the appointment of the Minister to deal with this issue.  The Minister has shown a commitment to <Col N="169" /> reducing the waiting lists by allocating £12 million in the budget.</P>
    <P>I fully support the idea of hospitals being informed of their allocations early in the year because they can only spend when they know of their allocation.  I support the Minister in relation to specialties because it is only when we have a certain amount of money that we can have a real impact.  I commend the Minister on bringing forward these proposals.  On a more parochial level, I thank him for increasing the allocation to the North-Eastern Health Board, in which I have an interest, from £357,000 to £520,000.  I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody doubts the Minister's intention to provide a better medical service for all and to reduce waiting lists.  There are waiting lists for local hospitals and waiting lists for regional hospitals.  I am particularly concerned about national specialties and the cardiac waiting list.  I am a member of the North-Eastern Health Board which has no cardiac speciality and, therefore, patients must go to Dublin.</P>
      <P>Last week I called to the house of a lady in her forties who is waiting for over 12 months for major heart surgery.  This lady has a serious problem with the valves in her heart &mdash; it is a rare condition.  She has been on the priority waiting list in St. James's Hospital since last February, but that list has not moved.  The same number of people, or even more, are on that list now as in February.  The surgeon is so busy that he or she can perform only three or four operations per week on people on the public waiting list.  If this woman is not on the emergency list, she will not be operated on because the surgeon is unable to perform more surgery.  The local hospital is doing its best for her.  This lady's mother, who lives with her, spends the night awake listening to hear if she is still breathing.  I feel badly that this woman's mother must live under those conditions. There is nothing of which I am aware that the North-Eastern Health Board can do about it.</P>
      <P>We have the best cardiac surgeons in the world and they do magnificent work.  We need to hold a conference on cardiac waiting lists and meet with the specialists, the health boards and the Minister's staff to come to an arrangement to clear priority waiting lists.  It is a disgrace that this waiting list has not moved since last February.  At the end of the day, politics and community are about people.  In the budget the Government identifies priorities, but people are still waiting for cardiac surgery &mdash; the newspapers stated one gentlemen has been waiting six years for surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My comments are not meant as political criticism of the Minister.  As a community, we must get together to solve these problems and provide these people with these necessary lifesaving operations now.  If we cannot do so with the available resources and existing consultants, let us send the patients abroad or buy in the specialists.  That is where the money must go.  We must find the <Col N="170" /> money to do it so that people like the lady in Drogheda to whom I referred can lead normal lives, to which they are entitled.  Through no fault of her own, or of the surgeon who wants to operate on her, or indeed of the Minister, it is still not happening.  That is the core point.  The ordinary man in the street would not have objected if the Minister for Finance had allocated an extra £20 million to clear hospital waiting lists.  I am not saying that he should not have given it to the GAA, but there would be a much louder hurrah if it went towards the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>This is a very caring society.  We work as a community, particularly on health matters.  I know from the North-Eastern Health Board that this view is held across party lines.  People want to arrive at a solution and I think they are entitled to one.  I am happy that the Minister is present to listen to what I am saying and I hope something will come of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance put a tax on illness in the budget.  He said that people must pay more for a hospital bed and that is wrong.  We should adopt different values.  The taxpayer is prepared to pay more for essential medical facilities which the State is unable to provide at present.  I commend the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome my friend, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to the House and support the amendment to the motion.</P>
      <P>There are, and have always been, hospital waiting lists.  The amount of money which would be required to clear those waiting lists would be substantial, but I welcome the way the Minister is setting about it.  In his speech he outlined in great detail his proposals to tackle the existing problems.</P>
      <P>Senator Tom Hayes referred to the increased hospital charges.  Judging by the few occasions on which I had to take people to accident and emergency, I think the Minister is right to take steps to increase the charge by a small amount.  It will ensure that people will take minor ailments to their GPs and not block up accident and emergency facilities in hospitals.  I have seen people attend accident and emergency units with very minor ailments simply because it was the cheap way out, so I commend the Minister.  If we want to address the problems in accident and emergency, people will have to go to their GPs with minor problems.  If the GP thinks it is necessary, he or she will send them on to accident and emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the increased allocation to the Midland Health Board and the other health boards.  In particular, I, as a member of a health board, welcome his allocation at this time of the year, because in the past we always wondered how much we would receive.  At least now we know how much we have to spend; it has been spelt out by the Minister and we must live with it.  In addition, we have it on 1 January, not <Col N="171" /> on 1 April or 1 May, as has happened in the past when very severe steps had to be taken to try to balance the budget.</P>
    <P>My health board always managed to balance the books in the past and we may have suffered in the long-term as a result.  I hope that the Minister and the Minister for Finance might be in a position to help us out over those problems from which we suffered by living within our budget.</P>
    <P>The increase in capital funding is necessary. One cannot increase throughput in hospitals with outdated equipment and facilities.  The Minister's increased capital funding will set about solving that problem, maybe not this year but over the next couple of years.  Some people who are on waiting lists are making unreal demands.  People must be reasonable.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes commented on high tech medicine.  People who are in a position to pay or who are covered by medical insurance are going to the high tech hospitals.  That is why regional hospitals should have facilities so that staff can carry out these specialist procedures on a regular basis.  That will improve the situation in all health board regions.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is well aware of the waiting lists for the aged.  I welcome the Minister for Finance's commitment to enable the development and extension of private nursing homes to ensure provision for the aged who are unable to get into private nursing homes or public hospitals, who are on waiting lists or who are creating serious problems at homes where people are unable to look after them.  I compliment the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>I am in no doubt, having regard to the Minister's outlined criteria for the allocation of waiting list money, that he will ensure a reduction in the waiting lists over the next couple of years.  As many speakers said, there will always be waiting lists; but I look forward to those waiting lists being reduced substantially in the future.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his Ministry and look forward to working with him in the Seanad in the future.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children and wish him the very best of luck in office.  No doubt he will do an excellent job and put all his energies into improving the health services for everybody.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he has put in place certain frameworks to reduce the long waiting lists.  He has taken steps to ensure hospitals are notified immediately of the exact funding available to them during 1998 to reduce waiting lists.  This is a good initiative as it is only right hospitals be made aware well in advance of the funding they will receive so that they can plan ahead.  I welcome this.  As regards the other aspects, the Minister is mainly juggling with words and is replacing waiting lists with waiting times.</P>

      <P>I welcome the additional funding but one hospital with a long waiting list is Mayo General Hospital.  The surgical area has 1,490 people on a waiting list for the past 12 months, the medical section has 480, urology has 400, dermatology has 210, orthopaedic has 2,255 and gynaecology has 215.  Those are outpatients. There are 180 inpatients in surgery and 105 in gynaecology.  That is only in Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar.  I am sure it is the same for all hospitals throughout the country.  There is a great need for additional funding and much work must be completed if the amount of time people spend on waiting lists is to be reduced to a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>Some £24 million was put in place by the previous Government for the badly needed phase 2 of Mayo General Hospital.</P>

      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on his prompt action in addressing this issue.  Too many people are waiting too long for hospital procedures.  It is unacceptable and the Minister knows that.  The Government is prepared to do something about it.  Some £8 million was allocated to this area in 1997 and a further £12 million has been allocated in 1998, of which £9 million is for general procedures and £3 million is for cardiac surgery.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also addressed a number of principles which allow the allocation of funding to make the most impact and that is what the amendment is about.  The money is being directed into certain areas.  The Minister has concentrated on waiting times as opposed to waiting lists and he has set a target to eliminate waiting times of longer than 12 months for adults and six months for children.  This is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Health Board has received its allocation of waiting list funding and it is extremely grateful for it.  It received it earlier than normal and the timing has allowed it continue the work it agreed with the Department in August and to carry out additional work.  It is important <Col N="173" /> this precedent be continued and the Minister stated his intention of doing so.</P>
    <P>The motion asks if recent initiatives taken by the Minister reduced waiting lists.  I can state as a member of the Western Health Board that on 15 August the Minister notified the board of its increased allocation of £600,378.  This has allowed it to nearly complete its target of 409 procedures: 150 ENT operations, 159 hip operations and the remainder in other procedures.  A reduction of 409 is significant.  The Western Health Board has also been allocated £125,000 to address the cardiac services needs in the area.  This will remove 50 patients from the open heart surgery waiting lists as they will benefit from angioplasts.  The £1.5 million in additional money allocated to the national waiting list means another 50 Western Health Board patients will benefit from the initiative in the open heart surgery area.  The 100 patients removed from the waiting lists is another specific example of results and represents a reduction in terms of both the time individuals wait and numbers.</P>
    <P>I do not deny this is not enough.  It is never right to say to any man or woman needing open heart surgery that they must wait.  The Minister knows that and we in this House also know it and we are doing something about it.  The 1997 waiting list initiative is a start and the 1998 waiting list initiative is a continuation of it.  Like any prudent and far-sighted Minister, Deputy Cowen is commissioning an independent study of this initiative to seek to establish if there is a better way to address this problem and I commend him for that.</P>
    <P>Part of the difficulty with waiting lists is that we have an older population which means more people need hip and knee replacements.  People are also living longer so a hip replaced 20 years ago is being replaced again and this is an additional challenge.  I applaud and commend the Minister for his creative, practical and imaginative initiatives to address the challenge.  It will be some time before the impact of his initiatives is felt.  I also welcome the cardiac strategy and plan the Minister is putting in place and I remind him of the great and urgent need for cardiac surgery in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to his predecessor, Deputy Noonan who, I remind him, put capital investment into the midwestern region, Limerick especially, to improve the plant of the regional hospital.  The Minister stated we did not provide the same funding as he did, but he should remember that Deputy Noonan concentrated on plant in the first instance.  One can have many lists and policies as regards waiting time but, if the plant in which to perform operations does not exist, one is going nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the Minister streamlines and uses effectively the resources within the Department to continue the cancer initiative Deputy Noonan started.  When different Ministers assume office, <Col N="174" /> they sometimes feel they must plough a new furrow. I have had particular experience of this in education.  I hope the Minister continues with Deputy Noonan's initiative on cancer detection and treatment.  I also hope he takes on board the women's health document and ensures it reaches fruition.</P>
    <P>I would have liked the Minister to address the point that funding would only go to hospitals which showed their waiting lists were caused by excess demand rather than inefficiencies.  That may not be the Minister's policy but it appears to be the Department's policy.  It penalises patients who happen to be on the waiting lists of hospitals which seem to be inefficient.  They would either have to wait longer for treatment or travel to another centre.  It is the Government's business to identify inefficiencies rather than compound the problem by withdrawing critical services and I feel extremely strongly about that.</P>
    <P>It is easy to make a distinction between lists and waiting times.  As of last September some 924 patients have awaited surgery for between three and 12 months at the Regional Hospital, Limerick, and the orthopaedic hospital at Croom, and another 901 patients have waited for more than one year.  The Minister said he would examine the lists to see who should be on them and would concentrate on reducing the waiting time.  I applaud that.  He had a lead-in period and we have the facts until 30 September, but I am interested in what has happened between then and now.</P>
    <P>There is no consolation for the people of Limerick and the mid-west region who are awaiting cataract treatment.  That is a small operation, not in the same league as cardiac surgery; but 284 people in the region have waited between three and 12 months for such treatment and another 185 have waited for more than a year.  Reading is the only pleasure available to some elderly people and if a cataract reduces their ability to read, the problem is extraordinarily immediate because their quality of life has been severely impaired.</P>
    <P>The same applies to hip and knee replacements, for which the numbers are also huge for a small hospital like Croom: 59 patients have been awaiting a total hip replacement and 14 a total knee replacement for between three and 12 months; 97 patients have been awaiting a total hip replacement and 32 a total knee replacement for more than a year.  Many of these patients write to me to ask how long more they will have to wait.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for stating he will adopt a different strategy with health boards, but is he making an inherent criticism of how they have dealt with waiting lists?  While it is the responsibility of the chief executive officer or hospital management to achieve targets, the buck stops ultimately with the Minister.  What is his attitude to health boards who do not meet those targets?   Does he regard that as the problem of the health board chief executive officer or the programme <Col N="175" /> manager rather than his problem?  I would have thought it was a co-operative system rather than there being separate health board and ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>My last point is slightly beyond the context of this motion but there are waiting lists for patients <Col N="176" /> with attention deficit disorder.  The Minister should take immediate steps in this regard and I hope he puts in place a pilot programme as soon as possible, preferably in the Mid-Western Health Board region.</P>

      <P>: At the adjournment of the debate I was speaking about the Four Courts building and I put a view which I have discovered in the interim has a lot of support.  That is to move the courts out of the Four Courts building into a modern, efficient and user-friendly building.</P>
      <P>A culture has grown up around the Four Courts building which does not relate properly to the public, whom the system is supposed to serve. The Four Courts building should send a signal that supports a modern and open system, one which reflects the type of democracy we would like to have and of which the courts are an essential ingredient.  Instead we have a system which is Dickensian in its operation, particularly for the barristers who use the Four Courts.  I cannot understand why the barristers who use the Law Library do not object to the conditions in which they must work.  The conditions of overcrowding were described to me last week &mdash; there is not even space to store personal possessions.  I cannot understand how people can work effectively or provide a proper service to their clients in such conditions.</P>
      <P>The message given by the court system is that it is elitist and exclusive, whether that message is intended or not.  What interest can that message serve in a modern democracy?  A more democratic signal would be sent by a building which was modern, open and efficient, which provided services for families, juries and the media.  This Bill is a move in that direction, but unfortunately it ringfences the Four Courts.</P>
      <P>I welcome this fine, well drafted Bill and I congratulate those responsible for it.  I pay tribute to Justice Susan Denham and the working group on the courts' commission.  I hope it marks the beginning of a new phase of giving responsibility for areas of the justice system to independent boards and the beginning of a more open style of judicial administration in at least one section of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  Most of the essential points have already been made by other Senators.  However, I wish to add my tribute to the work of Justice Denham who produced a readable report of remarkable clarity and force which presents clear conclusions argued with force and cogency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> Previously I was peripherally involved in discussions leading to the similar judicature Bill in Northern Ireland.  It may encourage the Minister to know that Bill transformed the situation there as I believe this Bill will transform the management of the courts system here.  It also enormously improved the morale of those working in the system by giving them a sense of purpose and leadership.  I know of no member of staff who transferred to the courts system who did not feel it was better as a result of the new legislation. Like other Senators, I hope the quality of court buildings, particularly in relation to children's court, can be improved.  Practising in very inadequate circumstances and surroundings takes away from the dignity of the law.  Surroundings should be made inviting for those who find it is a tremendous ordeal to go to court.  An unfriendly and inefficient environment is an added burden.</P>
    <P>I have not noticed the financial provisions of the Bill, but I presume the strategic plan to be approved by the Minister will be costed.  It should include performance indicators such as delays in bringing cases to court.  There is a case for judges to come together to develop a consistency in sentencing but it would be wrong to make this a function of the management of the service.  However, money will be required and it is important that resources are provided to carry through the development of the court systems.</P>
    <P>A Senator said this Bill would bring the Courts Service into the 21st century, which is perhaps over optimistic.  I had the honour last year of being invited to attend a tribunal of inquiry in Sydney.  The development and use of new technology in the courts there was light years ahead of anything in these islands.  It provided an impressive capacity for the retrieval of documents, the exhibition of documents to everybody in the court, and communication from a distance. The resources, but also the expertise, have to be provided to allow this.  I hope the board which will run the Courts Service will have the explicit power to train people and develop and run pilot projects.</P>
    <P>Like others, I have been lobbied by an Irish language organisation which wishes the Bill to include an explicit statement that the courts have a duty to provide a service for those who wish to use Irish.  While such a provision may be implicit in the Bill and the Constitution, it is important that resources be focused to facilitate those who wish to do their business through Irish.</P>
    <P>Would it be worthwhile to place a duty on the Courts Service to co-operate with other arms of the public service, particularly the Garda and prison service?  An enormous amount of time is lost in remands and escorts and there are possibilities in this context for the use of new technology.  I once calculated that we could double the number of hip joint replacements if orthopaedic surgeons were not occupied with court cases.</P>
    <P>I notice immunity is being extended to the Courts Service from the planning process.  The aim should be to reduce rather than increase the <Col N="178" /> number of bodies which are protected from the planning process.  Bodies should have to go through the normal processes which other agencies and citizens have to undergo.  Some courts are operating in protected or listed buildings and it is important that such buildings have the full protection of the planning process.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill which is a remarkable example of concepts being quickly marshalled and of a rapid response to a clear and direct report.  I commend the Minister on the Bill and wish it well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace, to the House and I wish him well in his portfolio.  I regret the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not present.  However, I appreciate that he has already spent the day in the House.  I congratulate him on his portfolio and wish him luck in his Department.  I know he will carry out his duties to the best of his ability.  I also congratulate the Minister on initiating a number of Bills in the House during the week.  In the last Seanad, a number of Bills were initiated in this House and a number of amendments were made to Bills upon which we had some excellent debates.  This House can be a very useful instrument in initiating legislation and the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform realises this.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which contains some very fine provisions, although I disagree with others. The Bill appoints a chief executive officer to run the Courts Service and I welcome this.  It also provides for a structure to run the courts.  I hope it does its business as it is intended to.  There is a great need to streamline the courts which, over the past number of years, have become clogged, resulting in extra judges being appointed. Changes have been made in the structures over the past number of years and I welcome this further change.</P>
      <P>As public representatives we are familiar with courthouses throughout the country, with many local authority meetings being held in them.  A courthouse is a miserable place at the best of times and it is only right that they be brought up to a proper standard of which we can be proud.  I hope the chief executive officer will streamline matters, secure the extra funding which is required from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ensure proper courthouses are put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill provides for lines of direct accountability for the service to the Oireachtas.  Under section 19 the chief executive of the service will be an Accounting Officer and as such will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Minister continued that a wider general obligation on the chief executive to appear before an Oireachtas committee when required by it to account for the general administration of the courts service, including its strategic plan, is contained in section 21.  I welcome <Col N="179" /> those important provisions.  It is democracy and accountability at its best.  Members of the Oireachtas can require the chief executive officer to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts or other Oireachtas committees.  He or she will be accountable to the elected representatives of both Houses.  We should be proud of these sections and welcome them.</P>
    <P>I also welcome a number of other sections with which I will deal in detail on Committee Stage. However, I do not agree with a number of changes proposed in the Bill.  Undoubtedly, they have been brought to the attention of the Minister by previous speakers.  A specific change is that county registrars will no longer report directly to the Minister or the Cabinet and will be brought within the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the chief executive officer.  This is a retrograde step.  The Minister is a lawyer and I am sure he realises that is the case.  Undoubtedly, he has serious reservations about it.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, and the departmental officials will bring a strong message to the Minister regarding the proposal in the Bill to remove county registrars from the direct responsibility of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We must take into account the work of county registrars.  They carry out many functions.  They are responsible for managing courthouses, staff and the enforcement of court orders.  They also have sheriff obligations.  County registrars have quasi-judicial functions and the Minister recognises this fact.  They also have electoral duties and every public representative has made representations to them over the years at meetings in courthouses about electoral registers.  Every county registrar I have known over the years has carried out their functions in an exemplary manner. They have provided a great service to the State and they should be independent of the chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>In their role as sheriffs county registrars must carry out their functions in a certain way.  He or she must use discretion and they have used this over the years.  I ask the Minister of State to make a strong case to the Minister regarding the proposal that county registrars will no longer be directly responsible to the Minister.  County registrars have always carried out their functions independently. They were always answerable to the Minister for Justice and the Cabinet and not to the Department of Justice.  This position should stand.  Their independence is paramount.</P>
    <P>On the basis of his speech earlier, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform believes in and supports the Bill.  However, the Taoiseach obviously does not have confidence in the Minister. On 12 November 1996, when the Taoiseach was in Opposition, he said in the debate on the proposals for a Courts Service put forward by the then Government that it was a peculiar way to show confidence in the then Minister for Justice to take away more than 50 per cent of her <Col N="180" /> responsibilities in one go.  Yet this is what this Bill proposes; many of the Minister's responsibilities will be removed.  On that basis it appears the Taoiseach does not have confidence in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister has confidence in the Bill but what is the Taoiseach's position in relation to the Minister?</P>
    <P>I compliment Mrs. Justice Susan Denham on the report of the working group on a courts commission. However, I have been informed by a number of county registrars that Mrs. Justice Denham gave an undertaking that there would be consultation between her and county registrars before legislation was dealt with by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This has not happened.  The majority of county registrars, if not all, only learned yesterday that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was introducing the Bill in the House today.  This came as a great surprise to them because they were assured there would be further consultation between them and the chairperson of the working group, Mrs. Justice Denham.</P>
    <P>The report states that established statutory positions, such as the Master of the High Court, county registrars, taxing masters and examiners shall be maintained, except where, to date, they had a formal statutory relationship with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That shall change to become a relationship with the Courts Service.  However, the proposal is a major change to the recommendation in the report.  In the Bill, county registrars are removed but taxing masters and others are retained; the country registrars have not been treated according to the recommendations of the working group on the courts commission.  The Minister of State should bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We will table amendments on this matter as it is very serious.  It further complicates the issue when Ms. Justice Denham states she would meet the county registrars, who are disappointed at the lack of consultation.  The county registrars are the fall guys, and the Minister of State and the Department officials should ask the Minister to right the wrong done by this Bill regarding the treatment of county registrars.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister listened to Senators' contributions with interest and I will inform him of contributions he could not hear in person.  He appreciates the level of support the Bill has received and is anxious to progress this important legislation, which will achieve major reforms in the administration of the courts.  The Courts Service provided for by the Bill is a significant step towards ensuring that the courts will be able to <Col N="181" /> provide a quality service for all parties that come into contact with them.  The establishment of the service means we are well on the way to a court system that will be able to meet all demands placed on it as we move towards the new millennium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for being late.  I was dealing with problems in my constituency that Members will be aware of tomorrow.  People are worried because of the Minister for Health and Children's comments over the weekend.  Health and food safety must be a priority for everyone. I compliment everyone from the Minister to the statutory bodies who are dealing with this matter. It is important that top quality food be available to people.  However, there is a contrast between the Minister's statement and An Bord Bia's reaction to that announcement.  People react to politicians' statements, but this is a statutory agency devoted to scientific food safety which looks after food standards.  These matters should be left to that body rather than the Minister, because there are media reactions that cause wide concern both in the beef industry and among consumers.</P>
      <P>The IFA is speaking of the deep crisis the beef industry is in.  We are more dependent on that industry than any of our European counterparts. During the debate on An Bord Bia last week, all Members agreed that we have been very stringent in implementation of rules.  We produce some of the best beef in the world because it is grassbased. I want the Minister of State to alleviate the fears of the consumer, because the consumer is number one and health is very important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Hayes for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The primary duty of the Minister for Health and Children is the protection of public health.  In order to fulfil this duty it is incumbent on him to take immediate action in relation to any risk posed to the health of the people of this county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the statement which the Minister issued on Friday last is as follows: on <Col N="182" /> Wednesday last, 3 December, the UK Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food &mdash; MAFF &mdash; received new advice from the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee &mdash; SEAC &mdash; based on the findings of ongoing research into BSE.  An experiment designed to recheck which parts of cattle may contain BSE infectivity has detected such infectivity in nervous tissue called the dorsal root ganglia which lie within the bones of the spinal column and which would be left with the bone when meat is cut off the spine.  A significant aspect of this research is the detection of infectivity before clinical symptoms develop.  The dorsal root ganglia are not currently covered by the specified bovine restrictions which ensure that all tissue in which infectivity is detected is removed from the human food chain.</P>
    <P>Further new findings, which are still being evaluated, indicate that infectivity may also be found in bone marrow in cattle which are at a very late stage of the disease and are already showing clinical symptoms.</P>
    <P>Although in its advice the SEAC emphasised that the risk to the consumer is very small, the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food decided to opt for the deboning of all beef, whether from home suppliers or imported, before sale to the consumer.  He also decided the bones should not be sold, given to consumers or used in the preparation of food.</P>
    <P>The primary concern and first priority of the Minister for Health and Children in relation to food is to ensure that all food on sale to the consumer is of the highest standard of safety and is fit in all respects for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the UK measures in this area the Minister immediately sought advice to see what implications, if any, this new information might have for Irish consumers. The scientific advice available to the Minister includes that of the CJD advisory group, the Food Safety Advisory Board and the interim Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The CJD advisory group was established in 1996 to advise the Minister for Health on CJD related matters including its surveillance, research strategies and international developments generally in this area. The group is comprised of experts in disciplines relevant to this subject, that is, neurology, neuropathology, public health, veterinary medicine and microbiology.</P>
    <P>Having examined the information available in relation to the latest UK research, the CJD group made a number of recommendations to the Minister which included agreement with the SEAC advice in relation to dorsal root ganglia and a recommendation that immediate arrangements be put in place to ensure that no meat with the backbone be sold to the consumer; that the most practical way of ensuring this is to require it to be carried out at the retail level, that is, by butchers; that bones removed in this way should be disposed of as not fit for human consumption; that the issue be raised at Community level as a matter of urgency; and that there is a need for further <Col N="183" /> information, notably in relation to the findings on bone marrow, to allow for consideration of this issue in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The microbiology subcommittee of the Food Safety Advisory Board will meet on Thursday next to examine the issue and both I and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, look forward to receiving its advice.  The Food Safety Authority will also consider the matter.</P>
    <P>The EU scientific steering committee, which met in Brussels earlier this week, has referred the new British evidence to a specialist subcommittee for consideration and the deliberations of this <Col N="184" /> group will be closely monitored.  The group has already met and issued a recommendation in line with that issued by the Minister, Deputy Cowen.</P>
    <P>Over the coming days and weeks all the scientific advice available to the Minister will be considered and the situation will be reviewed in the light of that advice.  In conclusion, I again stress that the primary duty of the Minister for Health and Children is the protection of public health.  In that regard, his main concern in dealing with this issue is to ensure the consumer is kept informed of any risk to food safety, however small.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 December 1997.</P>
