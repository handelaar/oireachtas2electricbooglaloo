      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her contract with the Dublin School of English and ensure payment of the £36,362 outstanding.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to address the need for second level educational facilities in Portlaoise, County Laois.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to make a statement on the closing of the Port Road in Letterkenny on Easter Saturday night.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the urban renewal scheme to Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator Ross's and Senator Enright's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1 will be taken from now until 1 p.m. and item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. until Second Stage concludes.  I suggest 15 minutes per speaker on item 2, but if Members need more time we can arrange that.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  The recent fishery agreement stated that fishing quotas would be cut by one third. Although the fishermen's organisations seem happy about this, I would like more information other than what we get from the media and newspapers.  Perhaps the Minister for the Marine could come into this House for statements on the fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs our support for the stand taken by the Government with the Chinese Government?  It is an important move forward. We have expressed our concern in this House about human rights in China, from Peking to Tibet, on numerous occasions.</P>
      <P>The Leader should make as much time as necessary available to deal with the Universities Bill as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, I and others have asked for a debate on economic and monetary union on numerous occasions.  A report yesterday stated that a senior banker suggested that Ireland was going to change its currency from a strong to a soft one.  That underlines the need for a debate. I know a special committee is dealing with this matter, but it should be discussed in detail in this House so that we know what fiscal policy should be pursued in advance of European Monetary Union.  If we decide to join European Monetary Union and Britain does not, it will have serious implications for us in terms of our volume of trade with the United Kingdom.  It is important to discuss this matter for those reasons.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Leader about the legislation establishing the food safety board and he said he might have information for me this morning.  Perhaps he could give that to me.</P>
      <P>I understand the heads of a Bill dealing with aggravated damages for hepatitis C sufferers have been circulated.  Will that legislation come before the House in the next few weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I read in today's newspapers that a recently bereaved Dublin man in his 20s is being sent to a nursing home for old people because he is mentally handicapped and there is no other place for him to live.  He is getting day care services in St. Michael's House in Dublin.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Health so that this disgraceful situation can be rectified as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Dardis in asking for a debate on European Monetary Union and on the problems associated with the difference between the Irish pound and Sterling.  This is a matter of urgent debate among commentators.  It appears that while we are strong on parity with the Deutsche Mark, there are serious implications regarding Sterling and the US Dollar.  It would be in our interest to debate this matter and I join in the call for a debate to contribute to the wider necessary national debate.  Incidentally, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, made a clear statement yesterday regarding Britain's intentions on European Monetary Union if the Tories were returned to power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to have a debate on three organisations which have been set up to save the west.  First, the bishops got together and produced <i>Developing the West <Col N="4" /> Together.</i>  Then were was a council for the west, which was to produce a programme for developing the west.  Now there is a commission of the west and we are told that it will receive funding.  All of us are interested to see what will happen.  Ireland is being called the Celtic Tiger and I hope it does not turn out like the Lough Neagh Monster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everybody in this House wants to see what will be done to develop the west.  Are we to appoint one organisation after another?  The people find it hard to believe in anything after a while.  Are we going to con the people of the west with another organisation or is there a real attempt to make a difference?  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be appropriate this morning for the House to pay tribute in a way the Leader thinks fit to the late former President of Israel and very distinguished Irishman, Mr. Chaim Herzog.  Some of us who had the privilege of meeting him knew him as a man of peace who made a great contribution to this State, where he was born, and his adopted country, Israel, both of which he loved with a warm passion.  Those of us would had the privilege of meeting him all too briefly feel aggrieved by his loss.  He was a great statesman.</P>
      <P>I was not here yesterday and lest my absence or silence be taken in any way as a disassociation from the views of the House expressed on the outrageous attack on Senator Norris, I must say, as one who finds himself normally in disagreement with Senator Norris on every possible conceivable issue, that this was an outrageous attack on a Member of this House.  We admire his consistency, courage and understanding in this area. I just wanted to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>I agree with what has been said about the position of the Government in relation to China.  It is unacceptable that a country such as Ireland, whose Government have pursued a consistent policy, is to be hauled in and criticised for expressing its concern on human rights.  I want to be associated with what has been said already here in that connection.</P>
      <P>My final point is a more sensitive one but it is appropriate.  On the big issue of MMDS and the deflector systems in respect of which the Minister has announced a decision in the Dáil, it is only appropriate, at a time when his party is to celebrate its position in Irish life and what it would see as its major role in politics, that I should bring to the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister misinformed this House as recently as 27 February 1997.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated in this House, Official Report, 27 February 1997; Volume 150, column 490, in a speech delivered on his behalf by Minister of State Currie, that the Minister's primary responsibility &ldquo;is to consider the South Coast application.  This process is underway and he will make a decision on the matter as soon as possible&rdquo;.  He went on to state that, &ldquo;in coming to a decision on the South Coast application, he will have regard to the implications of, and for, deflector systems generally&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have finished.  Will the Leader bring this to the attention of the Minister in that he has committed himself in this House to take that decision, first, as his primary and fundamental function and then consider the implications of that decision on the deflector systems generally.  How can he now reverse that decision as has been set out by South Coast Community Television?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader find out from the Minister, who misinformed this House and those involved in South Coast Community Television, why he has changed his view when he said that he would make a decision in respect of its application first and that the issue of deflectors would follow that decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When there are issues of this kind in which a Minister comes in here and states a formal position, surely it is in the interest of the procedure of this House that a Minister would adhere to that and not misinform us or that he would not reject totally what he said a short time later.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleague, Senator O'Kennedy, and others who mentioned the outregeous attack on our friend and colleague, Senator Norris.  In light of the comments attributed to Senator Norris in this morning's newspapers about what might arise if he were to meet his assailant again, will the Leader consider appointing some of the many Government consultants to carry out market research on the possibility of a match between Senator Norris and Steve Collins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader tell the House when the Finance Bill will be debated here?  Will he ask the Minister for Finance if he will now adopt what I am glad to say is now official Fianna Fáil policy in relation to supporting legislation currently going through the US Congress to create a tax-free zone along the Border counties, North and South, which, if and when implemented, will mean many multinational organisations which wish to export product to the north American continent, including Canada and Mexico, could locate manufacturing industry in the Border counties?  This particular piece of legislation, if passed, would prove to be of immense economic benefit to the Border counties.  Will the Leader establish from the Minister if the Government will come on side on this particular initiative, the implementation of which will not cost this country one cent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter which has been raised in the other House but has not been vented properly here to date, that is, the £91,000 paid to a journalist in settlement of a claim arising out of telephone tapping.  One serious matter, the allegation that these transcripts have been destroyed, arises out of it and I hope the Leader will make time to debate the matter.  If they were destroyed, perhaps this was <Col N="7" /> done in contravention of the National Archives Act.  I am aware that the Leader spends much time trying to protect the Minister for Justice from sensitive issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised by Senator Naughten is a matter of great concern to everyone.  I accept the references to human rights <Col N="8" /> violations in China, and the House has discussed human and civil rights violations in various parts of the world.  However, there are as many abuses of such rights in Ireland as occur in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten raised the issue of mentally handicapped adults who are not afforded the facilities to enable them to receive the care they need.  They are forced to enter homes for people suffering with Alzheimer's Disease and various other institutions.  These people are not a minority but they form a small group within the community.  There are large numbers of other people with handicaps of various kinds, including that of old age, who are trying to gain access to institutions where kindness will be afforded to them. It is an abuse and a violation of their human rights that they cannot do so.  With an ageing populations, these people must be cared for, as must mentally handicapped adults, who at present are not a matter of concern to the public at large.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Ministers for Health, Social Welfare and Finance and the community in general to consider the needs of those with handicaps, because those needs are not being addressed?  The question raised by Senator Naughten highlighted one aspect of the requirements of a large group of people about whom the Government and the public do not seem to be concerned at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the acting Leader of the Opposition for his agreement, to today's business.</P>
      <P>I will communicate his comments on the need for further information on fisheries to the Minister for the Marine.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senators O'Toole, O'Kennedy, Finneran and others raised the Government's stance on human rights in China.  The support of the House for that stance would be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for raising the Universities Bill.  This is important legislation and it underwent many changes during its progress through the Lower House.  The Bill now incorporates a great number of amendments put forward by the Opposition and other groups.  At present, it has the support of the governing bodies and the presidents of all the universities and also that of the virtually everyone involved in that sector.  The universities have expressed a grave concern to Members that the Bill should find its way into law, because in many cases, particularly those of Maynooth, Dublin City University and the University of Limerick, there is a need for its speedy enactment.  I want to allow the fullest possible debate on this issue but I also want the legislation to make progress, which it is not doing at present.  Therefore, I intend to make available as much time as needed for Committee Stage of the Universities Bill.  Beginning at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday next, I intend to have an open ended <Col N="9" /> debate on the legislation to see how much progress can be made.  Those are my intentions and I thank Senator O'Toole for raising the point.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis and others raised the possibility of a debate on European Monetary Union.  I have no difficulty with arranging a debate on this important issue and the Minister is willing to come before the House, but it is a question of finding time to do so.  I do not have the information the Senator requested in respect of the Food Safety Board.  The Cabinet's normal meeting on legislation was not held this morning because the Government Chief Whip is accompanying the President on her visit to Sweden.  As soon as the meeting is convened, I will obtain the information requested.</P>
    <P>On the issue of legislation to tackle the hepatitis C issue, I assure the Senator that the Government is making every effort to publish the Bill as quickly as possible.  When it comes to the House, we will sit on a Saturday if necessary to ensure its passage.  The legislation will not be delayed in this House.</P>
    <P>Senators Naughten and Lanigan raised the issue of people with disabilities.  I will convey the important points they made to the relevant Ministers.  Senators McGowan raised a question to which I do not have an answer.  I am not sure whether I am in a position to give an answer even if I obtain the information requested.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the issue of Members being allowed to pay tribute to the late President of Israel.  I propose that at the commencement of business on Tuesday next, before we tackle the Universities Bill, time will be made available to pay tribute to the late President, given his special relationship with this country.  I thank Senator O'Kennedy for raising that issue but I do not thank him for raising that relating to deflector systems.  My sentiments are entirely with Senator Sherlock on that matter and I am certain the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications would welcome the opportunity to cross swords with his old adversary on the opposite side of the House.  I will afford him that opportunity to enable him to win the debate on this particular issue.  The matter raised by Senator Mooney is irrelevant to the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised the issue of telephone tapping.  I listened carefully to the Minister for Justice's statement in the Lower House and I must inform the Senator that those who were making most of the fuss at the outset have been remarkably silent since she placed a number of facts on the record.  I advise the Senator that only fools rush in on an issue such as this.  Many Members on his side of the House would be very happy if this issue were not aired further.  I will convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister.  I am sure the Minister will be happy to come before the House to answer questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (2), between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) that one lives in or is from a particular area and the other lives in or is from a different area (the `residence ground'),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I asked the Minister if a school could invoke catchment areas as a means of discrimination and he replied that it was not possible because of the definition of reasons for discrimination.  The issue of catchment areas should be addressed by the Department of Education but it is not.  There are schools which invoke the catchment area excuse and refuse access to children from outside the area.  That is wrong &mdash; all children should have access to whatever school they wish to attend provided it has places available.</P>
      <P>Unless a residence ground is included in the Bill, sporting clubs and other institutions mentioned in the Bill may discriminate against a membership application from an individual who is from a certain residential area.  That may not be as uncommon a practice as we may think.  There is a possibility that people from inner city areas, for example, might be refused membership of salubrious golf clubs, not for the reasons given in the Bill &mdash; gender, ethnic minority status, etc.  &mdash; but on the basis of the applicant's address.</P>
      <P>I should have thought of this in relation to the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, because, whether real or imagined, people who apply for jobs feel they may not be considered for them on the grounds of address.  These Bills are related so it might apply through this Bill to employment.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I regret I cannot accept this amendment. Its effect would be to add a new ground, namely the &ldquo;residence ground&rdquo;, on which discrimination would be prohibited.  The Bill is already broad in <Col N="11" /> its scope, but it remains focused.  The adoption of a new ground would require careful consideration and, in particular, a thorough examination of the exceptions which are provided for in the Bill to see what further exceptions would be required because of the inclusion of a new ground.  For example, one might imagine that there should be an exemptions to allow schools or credit unions to cater for persons in a particular locality.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister cannot accept the amendment.  It does not have the same implications as the amendments I proposed to the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, dealing with membership of political parties and trade unions.</P>
      <P>After a thorough review the Minister explained why the amendment could not be accepted because of the need to speak with the groups which might be affected.  In the case of this amendment there is no group with which the amendment would have to be discussed.  It is broad and offers the same force of protection as the other grounds in the Bill.  I do not think the amendment would cause difficulties for any of the bodies with which the Minister consulted prior to the publication of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was tempted to add membership of a political party to this amendment.  I have had the experience of applying for the use of a room to hold clinics in a certain building and, although the consitution of the institution involved stated that it is apolitical, it did not rule out the use of the building for meeting.  However, the board of management of the institution decided that if a room was given to one party it would have to be made available to others.  I did not include membership of a political party in the armendment lest I would be accused of delaying the Bill.  I selected the residence ground because it would not require wide consultation.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister on the school catchment area issue.  I do not know if there is a problem with credit unions.  Although they are set up on a local basis, I presume that credit unions will take membership from anybody prepared to make deposits with them and abide by their rules.</P>
      <P>The amendment has merit and it is unfortunate that the Minister cannot accept it.  The residence ground has been used more frequently as a grounds for discrimination than any of the other grounds given in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree that the amendment has merit but it could not be accepted without exhaustive examination of it implications.  For example, the amendment might mean that a health board would have to cater for people from outside its area.  Another factor to bear in mind is that it is common for many sports clubs to cater for particular areas.  GAA clubs, for example, are based on parishes and that arrangement would have to taken into account.  The implications of such a major alteration by the addition of this new ground would need careful consideration.  I <Col N="12" /> regret it is not possible to take it on board at this point.  The thrust of the amendment could be of merit in many instances.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 16 and 17, to delete subparagraph (ii).</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter on Second Stage and I indicated my concerns about this provision.  The inclusion of is reasonable having regard to the data, or other relevant factor&rdquo; gives too much scope to insurance companies.  On Second Stage I also expressed concern that this might affect the community rating principle and the Minister indicated that it would not.  My party colleague, Deputy McDaid, raised his concerns as a medical practitioner that genetic testing would be used to increase insurance premia.  I understand why there is an exclusion and it is not considered discriminatory to allow insurance companies to behave in a certain way.  I know that is custom and practice.</P>
      <P>I accept the first two parts of paragraph (e): &ldquo;(I) actuarial or statistical data obtained from a source on which it is reasonable to rely, or (II) other relevant underwriting or commercia? factors&rdquo;, although I have problems with the inclusion of &ldquo;commercial factors&rdquo;.  However, the inclusion of &ldquo;is reasonable having regard to the data, or other relevant factors&rdquo; gives insurance companies huge power and does not confer on individuals the type of protection the Bill should confer.</P>

      <P>Senator McGennis proposes to delete section 6(2)(e)(ii).  This provision requires an insurance company which is treating persons differently because of actuarial or statistical data or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors to treat those persons in a way which is reasonable having regard to the data.</P>
      <P>If the subparagraph is deleted we will remove an important safeguard from the customer's point of view.  Without the subparagraph, the insurance company could base its discrimination on the data and factors mentioned in the subsection, but would not have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director of Equality Investigations that the different treatment in question is reasonable having regard to the information on which it is based. I ask Senator McGennis to withdraw the amendment as it would serve only to provide a wide exception for insurance companies or other providers of financial services.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's explanation.  Who decides what is reasonable?  We encountered this question in the definition of sexual harassment.  If an insurance company decides it is reasonable to do something, it does not necessarily mean it is reasonable.  Perhaps I should have phrased the amendment in the same terms as the provision regarding sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that if the subparagraph is deleted the case of the applicant will be weakened.  That is not my intention.  I am worried that an insurance company might interpret the provision to mean that it can penalise somebody or load a premium because it considers it reasonable in view of factors A, B or C.  It gives the insurance companies more flexibility.  However, I accept the Minister's response.  If the amendment weakens the position of the applicant for a service, I am prepared to withdraw it.  I will look at it again.</P>

      <P>This amendment applies to insurance companies.  I read the Minister's contribution on Second Stage with interest.  I could not contribute to that debate because it ended earlier than I anticipated.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue in the House a number of years ago in the context of people with HIV and AIDS.  At the time the insurance industry was discriminating against such people by loading their premia in merely because they had taken the precaution of having an AIDS test.  The then Minister, Deputy Brennan, raised the matter with the insurance companies.  Their attitude was that if anybody took a HIV test, unless they needed to have it to acquire a visa to visit certain countries, it reflected a concern on the part of the individual about his or her lifestyle and the insurance companies were entitled to either load the premia or refuse insurance.  That is a dangerous policy and I am worried about the margin of appreciation permitted to such companies.  I would be concerned about abuse of the limited exemptions if they were used to inhibit people from taking HIV tests.  This could have a negative impact on their health and welfare.</P>
      <P>On the other hand I accept that insurance is a business, the heart of which is a mathematical calculation on the actuarial sums involved in the projection and costing of a risk.  Nevertheless, I am concerned that the vagueness of the phrases &ldquo;other relevant underwriting or commercial factors&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable having regard to the data, or other relevant factors&rdquo; would confer a degree of flexibility on insurance companies if they were unscrupulous &mdash; certain sections of the industry have been unscrupulous in the past &mdash; and might be abused.  That appears to be the thinking behind this amendment.  Can the Minister and his advisers reassure me that this situation is covered or that an amendment can be considered on Report Stage which would tighten the provision to meet those worries?</P>

      <P>The section is properly drafted.  I doubt that the situation mentioned by Senator Norris is relevant.  The amendment would have the effect of removing a proper safeguard for the customer.  These are not matters of discretion for an insurance company.  They are determined by an independent official, the Director of Equality Investigations.  The clause &ldquo;is reasonable having regard to the data, or other relevant factors&rdquo; is included to aid the customer.  Not only must there be actuarial and statistical data on which it is appropriate to rely but it must also be reasonable having regard to the data or other relevant factors.  That is an important safeguard for the customer and it should be preserved in the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 4 and 5, to delete&rdquo;marital status&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I mentioned this matter on Second Stage.  Regulations introduced by the Minister for the Environment regarding schemes for letting priorities instructed local authorities that catchment areas could not be used as a determining factor and that authorities had to accept applications from anybody who arrived in the area.  In my experience as a local authority member, marital status is never taken into account in the case of Dublin city and council lettings when determining an application for housing.  Family size is the determining factor.  It is balanced with the number of rooms available.</P>
      <P>There is no question of a single applicant with three children being treated differently from a family of four which consists of a husband and wife and two children.  The letting of houses is determined by the number of people in a family and the number of rooms available in a scheme of houses or in one house that might become available under what is known as &ldquo;casual vacancies&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister and I were members of Dublin County Council, the authority positively discriminated in favour of single parents with children because those people were not moving up the housing lists.  It had the effect of lone parents with children being treated favourably.  The Minister now states that that cannot be done anymore.  Applications must now be decided on the basis of family size and housing allocated on that basis and on the points system drawn up by local authorities.  There is no reason why marital status should appear in this provision.  It would be <Col N="15" /> wrong to send out a message to local authorities that it should be used for treating people differently.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister said that about trying to ensure a social balance and mix in housing estates.  The case was made in the late 1980s about large numbers of houses being allocated to single parents with no social mix or support and it was wrong for that to happen.  That may be, but including marital status in this subsection is also wrong.  I would prefer local authorities to deal with housing applicants on the basis of need and family size.  Marital status has nothing to do with housing applications.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 deals with membership of the travelling community.  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure travellers are not treated differently to people in society in terms of access to pubs, clubs, educational institutions, etc.  Local authorities construct housing schemes specifically for the travelling community; halting sites are also built.  That is positive discrimination.  The inclusion of membership of the travelling community in this subsection is to ensure local authorities can continue to do that.</P>
    <P>However, I know of large numbers of people in the travelling community who are on normal local authority housing lists.  The inclusion of membership of the travelling community in this subsection will be used by residents' associations in housing estates who do not want travellers allocated houses within their estates to prevent that happening and the law states local authorities may discriminate against them.  I believe the purpose of the inclusion of membership of the traveling community is to allow local authorities to construct specific schemes, but the inclusion of it in this subsection will be used as ammunition by communities who do not want travellers living in their estates.  The provision would be used by those communities to stop halting sites, group housing schemes and the allocation of single dwellings in housing estates to members of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>I may have worded the amendments incorrectly but it is important the Minister and his staff re-examine this and consider my genuine fears about the inclusion of these terms, the travelling community especially.  Marital status does not need to be included as a reason local authorities may discriminate or treat applicants differently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>References in this subsection to membership of the travelling community and marital status, in line with the provisions relating to the other groups specified in the subsection, are positive and necessary.  Local authorities must be able to set aside or designate specific types of needs. accommodation to mcet specific types of needs. Custom built accommodation for travellers or elderly people is a clear example of this.  References to family and marital status are included to give appropriate flexibility to local authorities so <Col N="16" /> they can take into account the overall social mix of the estate in making individual lettings.</P>
      <P>For example, local authorities were severely criticised in the past for having ghettoised single parent families in certain estates.  The thinking regarding social housing has moved away from the purely quantitative aspects &mdash; the number of houses provided.  The need for quality of design and location of social housing is now well recognised, as is the need for appropriate social mix and integration.  The provisions of the Bill seek to guarantee appropriate flexibility for authorities in lettings to ensure they are not in future required to return to practices for which they were rightly criticised in the past.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that this is an enabling measure and does not oblige any local authority to do anything.  It allows them flexibility, where necessary, to organise housing on that basis.  In the circumstances, I regret I cannot accept the Senator's amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I anticipated what the Minister was going to say from his response on Second Stage.  Housing is not constructed for married or unmarried people but for those in need of it.  I refute the need to provide housing for people on the basis of marital status.  Even if a local authority wished to reserve houses for six or seven married people, the schemes drawn up by local authorities are based on need and applicants are awarded points based on the lack of facilities such as bathrooms, toilets, shared kitchens or the number of bedrooms.  Are we saying a that a scheme of letting priorities drawn up by a local authority, which gives Marian McGennis, married and living in private rented accommodation with three children, 20 points, and Mary Smith, unmarried and living in her parents' home in a box room with three children, 25 points&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It leaves the flexibility with the local authority.  It does not oblige them to do anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Minister is saying and that he thinks the provision is positive. I also know that some local authorities which have refused to provide accommodation for the travelling community will not use this positively but very negatively to ensure single parent applicants go to the bottom of housing lists.  Housing is built on the basis of need and not on marital status.  I accept that specific types of housing are built for specific groups in need.  I fear that this provision will mean members of the travelling community who apply for housing will be told they are dealt with differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister.  The provision is there for a positive purpose, but the law can only be read in terms of the wording in the Bill and not on the basis of the intent of the Minister or the reservations of the Opposition spokesperson. It will be interpreted by a judge presiding over a case taken by people to court and I am afraid it <Col N="17" /> will be interpreted very negatively.  I cannot accept the Minister's reassurances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly approve of enabling local authorities to engage in a policy of mixed housing to fracture the ghettoisation which happened before.  Senator McGennis raised the points system.  Dublin Corporation's use of this system had a malign influence on parts of the city. The local community ethos was destroyed when streets were de-tenanted.  When the housing was rebuilt by the local authority, people were brought back in on the basis of a points system. The more points one had the more likely one was to get a house.  This concentrated the most dysfunctional families in good housing without any sense of community or the restraints which an organically developed community displays.  In this regard I applaud the Minister's intention.</P>
      <P>However, I have much sympathy with Senator McGennis.  I accept her argument that there does not appear to be markedly different housing provided for people depending on their marital status. I would be interest to know what differences are considered in terms of layout or location.</P>
      <P>The Minister made an interesting balancing case for the positive use by local authorities of powers to discriminate in favour of the travelling community.  If that argument is accepted in principle, is there any reason for not including the sexual orientation ground, as has been done in other sections of this and other legislation? Would the Minister consider this point?</P>
      <P>I know of cases where gay people were housed by local authorities.  These were mostly men in their late 20s and early 30s.  Invariably they were stereotypical gay individuals and easily targeted. Their lives were made unbearable.  One individual in Thomas Street had excrement pushed through his letterbox, his home was petrol bombed and he was intimidated and attacked by local people.  Eventually, because of the decency of the city manager and the manager with responsibility for housing, I managed to have him rehoused in Donnybrook.  The complex was intended for elderly people.  I said this to him and he replied that he loved old people.  He turned out to be of assistance to the other residents as he enjoyed doing their messages and so on.  He had the protection of the kind of housing provided for the elderly.</P>
      <P>I have a similar case at present.  The corporation's attitude is reasonably helpful in this matter.  If one accepts the Minister's argument that there should be positive discrimination for the travelling community, should it not also exist on the sexual orientation ground?  There have been a number of cases where special provisions would be very useful in order to protect people from attack in certain local authority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share some of Senator McGennis's fears of possible consequences if the sexual orientation ground was included.  When the AIDS virus first struck there were strident voices in many European <Col N="18" /> countries, such as Monsieur Le Pen, who called for those infected to be corralled so that they could not infect the rest of the population. This is an extreme scenario but I would be worried that it could happen if one had a right wing city manager or council.  If the principle can be applied to the travelling community, can it also be applied to the sexual orientation ground?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris is suggesting a variation on this section which would make it read something as follows: &ldquo;Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting a local authority from providing in relation to housing and accommodation different treatment to people based on their sexual orientation&rdquo;.  A local authority would be allowed to provide special accommodation for people based on their sexual orientation.  That would not be acceptable or desirable.  It would allow a local authority to avoid the anti-discrimination provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Local authorities provide a range of different accommodation types for different purposes.  The Department of the Environment points out that to achieve its aim a council would from time to time wish to set aside, for example, houses for the disabled.  We have provided for this.  Similarly, an authority might wish to promote a balanced mixture of tenants in an estate with the objective of promoting a social mix.  Therefore, it might be necessary to set aside houses for categories of persons who might in this instance not necessarily be those most in need on the points basis.  We are allowing authorities to do so if the circumstances demand and if they are minded to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has illustrated the virtue of my case.  Perhaps I am not stating my case clearly enough.  The Minister seemed to be saying that this provision does not impose an obligation on an authority but merely facilitates it to make special arrangements for the travelling community.  Senator McGennis suggested that this might be abused.  The Minister replied that it was only a facilitating measure which would be positively used.</P>
      <P>When I raised the sexual orientation ground the Minister paraphrased the Bill and said that the effect of my proposal would be to say that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a local authority from providing different treatment to different persons.  Exactly.  I recognise the possible inherent dangers.  I am aware of situations where it has been in the interests of gay people to be given different and selective treatment and not to be confined on the basis that one has 23 points therefore one must go to St. Philomena's House, Attracts Mansions or Thomas Street and there one must stay.  I have known of a number of people, fewer than ten, placed in local authority housing.  However, because of the context of the housing in a fairly tough area in the inner city, these people were subjected to victimisation, assault, threats of assault and intimidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> The Minister mentioned the travelling community and facilitating flexibility in local authority housing policy.  This facilitation could mean that even though subject X, who happens to be gay, does not have the 35 points required to place him in a particular kind of housing because of the difficulties he is experiencing and his sexual orientation, local authorities can breach their own points system.  There may be a danger in the Minister's argument for the inclusion of the travelling community, although there is also a positive side to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend taking up Committee Stage of this Bill discussing these points.  I know the Minister is anxious to deal with the Bill as expenditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>Families are differentiated in this Bill.  I know the Minister does not believe this, just like Senator O'Toole will passionately claim the Minister does not support another section.  I do not believe there are different types of families.  The family unit, whether married, single, composed of children or gay, is a family.</P>
      <P>Those of us, including Senator Gallagher, who are candidates in the general election are aware there is a crusade abroad against single parents.  I support the policy that grew out of the previous Government, which my party was a member of and which supported lone parent families so they could achieve their full potential.  That is the basis of the social legislation and social welfare system that is in place.  A head of steam is building up to try to reserve this.  The argument is being made that it is all right to pay single parents for one child and one mistake is fine.</P>
      <P>Politicians are human and vulnerable.  Some of us are weak and some are strong.  Who knows what the composition of local authorities or this Parliament will be after the next election?  I accept that housing allocation is an executive function carried out by the management of local authorities.  However, policy in local authorities is decided by the membership.  I do not want to call people right wing &mdash; I could just as easily say homophobic.  If groups of elected representatives in local authorities are subjected to pressure, some bend and some maintain their stance on an issue.  Local authority members can be lobbied sufficiently and hard enough by groups and communities.  For example, someone decided to table motions in local authorities throughout the country calling for a referendum on abortion.  This was the beginning of the trickle.  Every local authority was told to sign up or it would be cast in a particular light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a group such as Christian Solidarity asks local authorities to only provide houses to people who are in what are preceived to be normal family units of husband, wife and children, local authority members can buckle and belt.  They devise policy.  A local authority may decide its housing policy will be that houses being constructed or casual vacancies which arise will only be given to <Col N="20" /> those with a particular marital status.  I hope my fear is unjustified and that it will not happen.  In the run up to the election, we have seen how we have feet of clay.</P>
    <P>We apply to the Minister for the Environment for a couple of million pounds to construct a group housing scheme for travellers.  Then it emerges in the media that these houses cost £70,000 when the average cost of a local authority dwelling is £35,000 or £40,000.  Those who wish to oppose that kind of development in their area may approach a willing local authority member and ask them to change the local authority member saying that they are fine houses and many families need housing.  I have grave fears about the inclusion of marital status and membership of the travelling community in this section.  It may be interpreted in a negative manner.  I will not pursue the argument further.  It is a weakness which may be exploited.  I know that is not the Minister's intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address an additional question to the Minister.  With his legal skill and intellectual dexterity I am sure he will be able to provide an answer.  If he does not, I have no doubt his honesty will compel him to confront the situation.  My question is a simple test.  Can the Minister explain the difference in principle as it applies to the travelling community on one hand and the gay community on the other?  There is balance in the argument on one side or the other, but it is the same whether we are dealing with the travelling community or gay people.  There is a danger in this amendment and the Bill.  Can the Minister explain the difference in principle between the two?  He has made a substainable case for his point of view but not one which is absolutely 100 per cent.  It is a matter of judgement and I am sure the Minister will agree.  There is a potential danger, as Senator McGennis has indicated.  What principle is applied and why is it different?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (3) (b) (i), to delete from and including &ldquo;or it refuses&rdquo; in line 33 down to and including &ldquo;of the school&rdquo; in line 37.</P>
      <P>I want to address the issues I raised on Committee Stage.  I listened carefully to the Minister's Second Stage reply.  The best I could say about it was that it was absolutely specious.  It made no attempt to address the issues I raised.</P>
      <P>I find it extraordinary for a Minister to seriously say that a Member referring to the Constitution quoted selectively from it.  I have dealt with lawyers for many years and I checked with two constitutional lawyers to ask if they ever quoted the Constitution <i>in toto</i> in support of an argument.  Both said they had not and that the only way to deal with an issue is through selective quotation.  The Minister responded by saying that I quoted selectively from the Constitution.  There is no other way to refer to it in dealing with specific issues.  The only time one can deal with the Constitution in its totality is when comparing it with a constitution of another country.  I expected more from the Minister and I felt his response was not a serious one.</P>
      <P>The Minister said I apparently wanted Protestant schools to be overrun and swamped.  I may offer an interpretation of the Constitution as the Minister has done on a regular basis in court.  I presume when he selects from a piece of legislation in support of a client that he does not necessarily agree with what is contained in the legislation, that it is used only as a supporting argument.  I would argue about many Articles of the Constitution.  I did not write it and have given my views on it on many occasions.  Saying that my correct interpretation of the Constitution might create a problem for Protestant or other schools is not addressing the argument.  I did not raise that issue or express any desire that that should happen and I am unaware that it would happen. If this is the correct interpretation then the Constitution should be changed if we want a different result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked why I referred only to religious schools and not to schools for those of different nationality or national origin.  The only reason I did not refer to such schools is that I could not find any supporting sections in my selective consideration of the Constitution.  Perhaps the Minister knows something I do not.  Perhaps the entire section needs to be changed rather than simply the two aspects to which I drew attention.  Will the Minister say whether I should have referred to the issue of national origin?  It was specious of the Minister to raise this <Col N="22" /> issue.  It is like the old trick of saying a Senator said something he or she never said.</P>
    <P>The point at issue is whether it is correct for the State to legislate along the lines that an educational establishment is not culpable of discrimination &ldquo;if it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination&rdquo;.  Can a child be refused admission to a school on the basis of its denomination and where enrolment would be considered a problem?  In other words, is it all right to refuse admission to a child on the basis of maintaining the ethos of the school?  This involves all sorts of assumptions.  I know schools of particular denominations where the ethos has been maintained and respected over generations despite the fact that the teaching staff are of different denominations.  I find the idea that the enrolment of a four year old child could damage the ethos of a school most offensive.  I would like the Minister to explain how this is possible.  I would like to see how the beliefs and background of a child or a number of children can affect the ethos of a school.  The ethos is established by the board and the owners of the school.  I do not understand how it can be changed by a four year old, particularly when the rules for schools specifically provide for parents to remove their children from religious instruction if they so wish in accordance with the Constitution.  If the Constitution and the rules allow this to happen there must be an assumption that the enrolment of pupils differing in denomination from that of the school is not a threat to the ethos of the school. This is the only logical and sane interpretation.</P>
    <P>I wish to again place on record my views on this matter.  Section 8 (3) of the Bill purports to give schools the right to refuse to admit pupils on the grounds of denomination.  This flies in the face of parents' rights to choose the ethos of their children's education and as such, it is unconstitutional.  Parents have a right to make decisions about the education of their children.  They have a constitutional duty to make the right decisions. The Constitution allows for a Catholic parent to send their children to a Protestant school.  The parent can decide on the basis of his or her own experience and educational background whether they want their children to have an education of a different ethos.  They are entitled and required to do this.  Otherwise, they would be abdicating their duties as parents.  Article 42 of the Constitution gives parents that right as primary educators.  A Catholic parent can decide that a Protestant education would be best for their child and the State may not introduce legislation restricting that right.</P>
    <P>Article 42.2 of the Constitution is also clear and unambiguous.  It says parents shall be free to provide education in their own homes, a private school or in schools recognised by the State.  This provision cannot be restricted by religious affiliation.  The Constitution protects the rights of people to practise and impart their religion.  It is unacceptable that legislation should constrain a person's right to participate in religion in any <Col N="23" /> way.  It is offensive to more than one Article of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Constitution says the State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience or their lawful preference to send their children to any particular type of school designated by the State. I submit that there is an equal and opposite responsibility on the State to ensure that their choice is not rescinded.  The State cannot demand children be sent to schools of a particular denomination.  Neither can the State say parents cannot send their children to schools of a particular denomination.  This latter position is in line with the demands of the Constitution, although I cannot support the case with legal precedent. However, it has to be the only interpretation.</P>
    <P>The State and the churches are interfering with the constitutional rights of citizens.  We are going down an extraordinary route.  The vast majority of people have respect for religion and religious practice and ethos.  Every Member of this House and the Dáil, including myself and the Minister, must have a duty and a sense of duty to protect the right of people to practise their religion.  Any interference in that, whether by teachers or anybody else, must be challenged.</P>
    <P>Anybody who interprets what I am saying as in some way anti-religion is completely misreading the situation.  This issue is about religious freedom and choice and not restricting people on the grounds of religious beliefs.  To say to somebody that their child may not attend a school because they are of the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; religion is as bad a form of discrimination as anything we have read or heard about in any other milieu or part of the world.  Segregating children on the basis of their religious beliefs, or worse, on the basis of their parents' religious beliefs, can only be described by a word considered by many people to be an ugly one.  I will not use the word here but we all know what it is. As a pluralist State, we should be ensuring that children learn and grow together.  There is nothing more beneficial to a community than allowing their sense of pluralism to develop and there is nothing more important for children than for them to have a pride in their religion in the same manner as they can have a pride in their culture.  Irish people who go abroad may never have used an Irish word in their lives but when they are in Brussels, Berlin, Bangkok or wherever, they feel a very strong sense of Irishness. They will say &ldquo;Dia's Muire dhuit&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; and they will explain to people what &ldquo;sláinte&rdquo; means.  They find a new pride in their language in a different context.  In similar fashion, I believe religions would grow and become stronger if children and their parents understood other religions.</P>
    <P>There are also practical reasons to be considered in relation to this issue.  The Minister took umbrage at my references to the North of Ireland, and I think he was incorrect in that.  It is fair to say that when children live and are educated <Col N="24" /> together, they will learn more about each other.  We think that because we allow every single religious group to practice and flourish on their own, with walls between them, we have a pluralist society.  We do not have a pluralist society.  Any piece of legislation which restricts interaction between people of different beliefs, backgrounds and political affiliations is bad.  The essence of pluralism can be measured not by the freedom to practice but by the quality of the relationships between people of different faiths and religions.  To introduce into an Equal Status Bill something which allows schools to refuse entry to a child on the basis of his/her religion is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>Wearing my other hat as general secretary of a teachers' union, I can inform the House that it cost my union approximately £3 million to find out what happens when a child is refused entry to a school.  Whoever will have responsibility for implementing this legislation and refusing a child admission to a school had better change their property into somebody else's name quickly. They will not have sufficient money to pay for the costs they will incur.  I can assure the Minister that it will not be a teacher who will refuse admission to a child on the grounds of religious affiliation.  This provision is incorrect; it is a major mistake to allow this into a fine piece of legislation. At the end of the day we will all be ashamed if this legislation is passed.  I urge the Minister to accept my proposal that the words which allow a child to be refused entry to a school on the grounds of his/her religion be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this amendment.  I have some residual sympathy with the Minister.  I can imagine the kind of pressure under which he came from various religious sources.  Such pressure is completely misplaced and reflects an insecurity on the part of the religious authorities both those of my own Church &mdash; the Church of Ireland &mdash; and others.  If religious authorities really believed in the ethos which they proclaim, they would have sufficient trust in it to believe it would survive a mixed school situation.  I find the proprietorial and territorial approach taken by the churches to be quite offensive and in clear contradiction to the message of Christianity.  I am a practising member of the Church of Ireland and am in no way antagonistic to religion.  The New Testament is quite clear on these issues.  Jesus Christ was unambiguous when he said &ldquo;Suffer the little children to come unto me&rdquo;; he did not say &ldquo;Suffer the little Protestants or the little Papists to come&rdquo;.  It is a kind of episcopal blasphemy to seek separate territories because of the insecurities of &ldquo;their Lordships&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The religious group I admire most in this country are the Quakers.  We are going through a period of examining the Famine at the moment.  Few groups distinguished themselves during that period, but the Quakers certainly did.  One of their immediate contributions on coming to Ireland in the late seventeenth century was to establish educational <Col N="25" /> facilities.  For example, they established a school at Ballytore and Newtown school in Waterford.  I would be interested to know what the religious profile of the students there is and I would be extremely surprised if more than 15 per cent were Quakers.  However, the ethos of that school is clearly a Quaker one and students benefit from that.  If the bishops had the kind of confidence the Quakers have in the attractiveness, power and legitimacy of their ethos, they would not be so afraid of opening up their schools to people of different denominations.  They would take the view that their ethos would be so attractive that it would spread in the best possible way without any nasty proselytising.  The very virtues of their position would make themselves clear to the children.</P>
    <P>I support what Senator O'Toole said in relation to the practical concerns of having such a provision in the Bill and the cost that might be borne by anyone who would discriminate in this manner.  Why would a court award such substantial damages?  A court might well be persuaded that there had been substantial injury to the well being of a child.  At the age of four, five, six or whatever children are vulnerable to prejudice.  It is nasty to make children feel different.  One can imagine the feeling of rejection a child would experience on discovering they had been refused admission to a school on the basis of their religious affiliation. Children are not always universally nice little people and one could also imagine the use that might be made of such a refusal by other children in that environment.  To return to the point I was making about the Quakers, I have just returned from Philadelphia where I visited some schools, some of which were Quaker.  In one extremely fine Quaker school there are only two Quaker students.  Swarthmore is a very large university founded by the Quakers and there are only 15 Quaker undergraduates there.  Yet the university flourishes.</P>
    <P>I find the parallel with Northern Ireland to be a useful one.  The situation is not as extreme in the South as it is in the North.  I have no doubt that if there was a greater degree of integrated schooling there, one would not have the kind of polarised sectarian atmosphere which prevails at present.  The Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland are equally guilty in the North of Ireland.  Everything is about property, ownership, territory, power and domination.  The leaders of those Churches should be ashamed, and I say that in spite of the fact that it will lose me votes.  I have been approached by senior members of my Church who are very decent people but who perhaps have not really thought out the implications of segregated schooling. They urged me to support the Minister in this Bill.  If I am subjected to that kind of pressure on social occasions in Dublin, I can only imagine the kind of pressure the Minister and his advisers must have come under.  I urge the Minister to resist that pressure, difficult as it may be to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole has said he feels this provision <Col N="26" /> is unconstitutional and it may well be.  That would be sad, because 95 per cent of this Bill is excellent and a major advance.  I do not believe the Minister wishes to discriminate or has shown a desire to so do.  He has been at the forefront in the fight against discrimination.  However, it may well be that for reasons of political or religious pressure, he may believe that after discussions with these interests this is the best he can do.  It is a dangerous best because, as Senator O'Toole said, it may well be subject to a constitutional challenge.  I raised this issue in relation to other legislation introduced by the Minister, of which 95 per cent was excellent.  My views on whether it was constitutional were not summarily or rudely dismissed, but airily or loftily dismissed.  That legislation has been referred by the President to the Supreme Court and this may happen again with this Bill, particularly after the ground work laid out by Senator O'Toole.  I would regret that because this Bill is, in essence, excellent, but this is a particular difficulty.</P>
    <P>I intended to speak on Second Stage but was too late because I was on the telephone to the Provost and several speakers took less time than I anticipated, which was my fault and not theirs. I went back to my office to complain and bellyache and then went into Senator O'Toole's office where I heard the Minister say Senator O'Toole quoted selectively from the Constitution.  I asked &mdash; although I am sure he would have done so himself &mdash; how else does one quote from the Constitution.  What other way can one quote from the Constitution except selectively?</P>
    <P>I have a partly mixed educational background. I went to the High School on Harcourt Street, where a considerable number of Jewish children went to school.  They added something to the mix for which I am extremely grateful.  I am glad it was not only a narrow Dublin middle class Protestant school.  I am not decrying the virtues of the Dublin Protestant middle class, working class or upper crust, if there is still such a thing.  These children added to the variety of my education. Fewer Roman Catholics than Jewish people attended the school and they were regarded as rather exotic and we were fascinated by them.  I am grateful we had this experience.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record something which is in a way marginal but which may have some small significance.  I was at a dinner party a couple of weeks ago with educated, well-off cultivated people.  To my horror, the Muslim school in Clonskeagh was on the agenda for discussion at the dinner.  One of the people complained bitterly about the provision of State funds for this Muslim school.  In my opinion, a clearly racist and sectarian attitude was being taken and I was extremely surprised and disappointed.  I argued the point with this woman and eventually she closed her argument by asking: why are we paying taxpayers' money when none of our children may attend this school?  She also asked if it had an obligation to educate others who wish to attend.  I <Col N="27" /> found that very interesting and it fits in with this argument.</P>
    <P>I will try to finish on a lighter note.  Senator O'Toole said 99 per cent of the people supported the right to practice their religion.  I encountered a member of the 1 per cent who do not support this right during a court case I witnessed where Hare Krishnas were being had up for a breach of the peace for singing hymns and clashing symbols. The judge was in a fairly comatose condition on the bench.  The Hare Krishnas were unlucky to draw by lot a barrister on the free legal aid scheme who had advanced views on the Constitution.  The constitutional defence he entered on their behalf was that they were simply exercising their right to practice their religion, which certainly woke the judge.  He sat up in the bench and asked what type of defence was practising religion.  He then asked what would happen if everybody did that.  It is a wonderful Swiftian question.  What would happen if people took the New Testament seriously and started to implement it, as they are required to do under the Constitution?  Suppose that we had a Christian foreign policy with advice from the professor of dogmatic theology in Maynooth and other such people.  It is a wonderful Swiftian scenario.</P>

      <P>I could not describe Senator O'Toole's amendment as a modest proposal.  It is a major alteration to the Bill and I think the most significant amendment which will tabled in the light of our proclaimed belief in religious tolerance, in respect for difference and in cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  I know that is contained in the 1916 proclamation and not the Constitution but it forms part of the ethos of the country and should be respected.</P>

      <P>I am like Dame Nellie Melba making my positively final appearances.  My ultimate and concluding remark is that I assume &mdash; perhaps I should not anticipate &mdash; the Minister's response will be partly along the lines that the school must prove it is essential to maintain the ethos so that it is not given a wide power of discrimination.  Let us take the case of the Muslim school.  I do not know but it may say this is a profoundly insignificant religious thing and that it honestly believes, without wishing to cause pain to other people, that they are all infidels and to have an infidel in the school would disturb the balance.  I do not know if it would say that as I am only speculating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was trying to make about selective quotation from the Constitution when I replied to Second Stage was that one cannot discern the meaning of the Constitution from <Col N="28" /> the text alone.  One must also take into account the relevant case law which exists in interpreting and explaining the Constitution.  There is relevant case law in so far as the line of country with which we are dealing today is concerned.</P>
      <P>The words the Senator proposes to delete have been included in order to afford protection to minority religion schools.  They are intended to cover primarily the situation where a minority school, although taking in all the applicants from its own religion, would lose its denominational character if it accepted all the other applicants for which it had or could make space.  It is clear that minority religious schools run a risk of being swamped by majority religion children unless they have such a right of refusal.  I have been advised that such right of refusal is necessary to ensure constitutional conformity.  It is a necessary concomitant of the entitlement to have a denominational school.  Without it, minority religions could not adequately ensure the preservation of the religious ethos in the schools they run.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, having regard to Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution and the relevant case law, that this wording is constitutionally sound and strikes an appropriate balance between the rights of parents on the one hand and those of the denominational schools on the other.  I cannot emphasise enough that this wording does not in any way give any extra rights to schools.  Indeed, Senator Norris mentioned this.  Denominational schools will now have to demonstrate that a particular instance of refusal is essential to maintaining the religious ethos of that school and the school's reasons would be reviewed by the Director of Equality Investigations.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not seek to dismantle the denominational education system of this country. I would point out that representatives of minority religions have made representations about the need to maintain a denominational balance of their pupil intake and have made known their wish that the Equal Status Bill should not have an adverse effect on minority communities.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole's amendment, if accepted, would be inimical to the interests of such communities and would give entirely the wrong signal to people in Northern Ireland &mdash; that in this State we aim to assimilate minorities and that we do not want them to preserve their own identity.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has argued that if Catholic parents decided that a Protestant education would be best for their child, and they selected such a school, that is no more than their entitlement.  It is their right and the State cannot introduce laws that restrict that right.  My response is that a Catholic parent in such circumstances is free to send his or her child to a Protestant school and will remain so.  However, such a school has the right at present not to accept that child.  They might exercise this right, for example, if they consider that the admission of more Catholic pupils would be inconsistent with their mission of providing education to their own co-religionists in the ethos of their own denomination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> All that section 8 (3) (b) does is to recognise this legitimate right.  It gives no additional rights to school management.  In fact, it has a potentially restricting effect in that schools may have to justify their decisions to the Director of Equality Investigations, which they do not have to do at present.</P>

      <P>I can readily understand that the religious ethos of a school could be undermined by a large influx of children of a different religious faith.  Over 90 per cent of the people of this State are Roman Catholic.  If we accept Senator O'Toole's proposal, in the long-term, or perhaps even the medium term, one could expect that what now are schools serving minority denominations would typically have a Roman Catholic enrolment so large that they could no longer be said to cater specifically for the denomination they were established to serve.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole does not object to the first part of section 8 (3) (b) (i) which gives schools the right to exercise preference for a co-religionist over a person belonging to another denomination.  But this would also be, in the Senator's terms, a denial of the constitutional rights of the parents of the excluded pupil and is a distinction or discrimination based on religion.  I do not think his view on this is consistent with his objection to the part of the paragraph which he proposes to delete by his amendment.</P>
      <P>I was amazed at the facility with which Senator O'Toole can read out Articles of the Constitution and tell us unambiguously what they mean.  This is not a useful way of proceeding.  One must also have regard to how the Constitution as a whole has been interpreted by the courts.  This is what the Attorney General did in examining this particular provision and he has cleared it.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these words are not only constitutionally acceptable but absolutely necessary to ensure compliance with the Constitution. They respect the pluralism of our society and safeguard the position of minority religion schools.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would ask Senator O'Toole to consider further and withdraw this amendment. The section in question was agreed unanimously by the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  I have no possibility of accepting the amendment because, apart from the policy aspect, the legal advice I have been given is that it is absolutely necessary from a constitutional point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has understood the point of my argument.  He may well be right in saying that there is an inconsistency in what I have said about allowing the preferential treatment to remain and only proposing that the other part be deleted.  I have said that in relation to the previous Bill where we used the question of religious denomination to be an acceptable or desirable criterion.  That may well be the case.  I <Col N="30" /> do not know the answer but I left it there for a precise reason.  Where one place is left in a school for space, health and safety reasons, and there was a choice between two children &mdash; one of the denomination of the school institution and the other of a different denomination &mdash; it would be reasonable to allow the authorities to say it was more desirable for them to make this decision, all other things being equal.  It was on that basis that I allowed the section on preference to stand.</P>
      <P>As regards the fact that the Minister says this has been cleared by the Attorney General, I know it has been and I know the precise terms under which it was cleared.  The Attorney General was faced with a copy of the document which was agreed to by the religious authorities about the management of schools.  In that there was an agreement with the Protestant religions that they would have &ldquo;the absolute discretion in determining the admission of pupils&rdquo;.  As long ago as last October I pointed out that was unconstitutional. I was told at that stage that legal advice was being taken on all sides by the State and by the Protestant churches and that this was acceptable.  It was eventually referred to the Attorney General's Office and, though no public statement has been made about it, and in no formal way has it been communicated to me, I know the Attorney General concurred with me and came back with a clear view that having absolute discretion was not acceptable.  He is now putting forward a new line which happens to be precisely what is in this legislation.  In other words, &ldquo;where that refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school&rdquo; has been added to the right to refuse.  I am quite clear that that came from the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>I have more knowledge of case law on admissions to schools than probably anybody in the country.  I have read the advice of various eminent senior counsel as far back as 15 years ago, including the current President of the State, Mr. Justice McCarthy, who was tragically killed some years ago in Spain, and Mr. Justice Barrington.  I have discussed this matter over a period of 20 years.  I have very good reason to know the case law dealing with this matter as I have had to sign the cheques which paid for mistakes my union made in not recognising it.  I take those matters very much into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find a number of things extraordinary and I would like to have a clear answer from the Minister on them.  The Minister says that currently primary schools have the right to refuse people on religious grounds.  I do not know and have never known that to be the case.  I do not know where the Minister has found that.  I have read it in newspapers but I do not know any rule or legislation concerning it.  I have never heard of it happening, although it is something I have heard Members representing the Government &mdash; but not the Minister &mdash; say at various stages has happened.  I asked every religious denomination for an example of where it occurred but they could not find one.  I know of no time in the history of the State where a child has been refused admission <Col N="31" /> to a school on the grounds of religion.  If the advisers tell me it has happened, I will resubmit this amendment on Report Stage because that is incorrect.  I will not allow the House to be misled on this matter because I want honesty.  That power does not exist.  I have heard commentators say it can happen, but it has not happened. People say there is a right to do it, but no one has shown me that right.</P>
    <P>The Minister's interpretation of the impact of children's enrolment in schools is extraordinary. During his reply he referred to the religious ethos and, on two occasions, the religious character of the school.  I assure the Minister that the religious character of a school is not determined by the religion of its children.  He also said these schools cannot cater only for these children.  I did not understand that was the Bill's intention or that the State was working on the basis that schools could cater only for one denomination and that was what we were seeking to protect.  That goes against the logic of the Minister's earlier explanation and against parents' right to make a selection.</P>
    <P>The religious character of a school is determined at assembly time in the morning, by the local holidays it takes to coincide with religious feasts of the particular denomination, by its response to the Angelus bell and by the religion taught during the religious knowledge class.  I could go on <i>ad nauseam</i> about how the religious character of a school is dealt with but I would not be able to say the children's religion had anything to do with it.  They are influenced and informed by the religious character of the school; they do not determine it.  That is a curious line of logic which does not hold up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister that parents have an additional right in this regard.  As regards this Bill and section 37 of the Employment Equality Bill, the community has found an acceptable balance where people recognise and respect each other's needs, where action is taken against a teacher who is undermining the ethos of a school and where problems in relation to the religious character of the school are dealt with.</P>
    <P>Over 50 per cent of children in many Protestant schools are Catholic yet they are still Church of Ireland schools.  There was a time when convent or monastery schools were determined by the fact that the principal and staff were of a particular religion.  When they ran out of numbers, they introduced lay teachers and soon there was only a religious superior as principal of a religious school.  The staff and principal in many of those religious schools no longer belong to the particular religious order, yet they are still classified as convent or monastery schools.  The Catholic Primary School Managers' Association has a list of schools which are classified as monastery and convent schools on the basis of their character and religious background.  Making judgments on the basis of a child's religion does not hold up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> I will not push this amendment to a vote but I will resubmit it on Report Stage.  I ask the Minister to take further advice on it so that it can be taken on board.  There is no right for children to be refused admission to a school on the grounds of their denomination.</P>

      <P>In page 15, subsection (1) (a), lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;nationality or ethnic or national origin,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While I accept there may be reasons for allowing a club to discriminate on the grounds of religion, age, etc., I cannot understand why &ldquo;nationality or ethnic or national origin&rdquo; is included as a reason for refusing membership of a club.  Does this mean clubs for white people only will be permitted to continue to refuse admission to anyone who is not white?  I do not understand how &ldquo;nationality or ethic or national origin&rdquo; could be interpreted as anything other than an apartheid measure.  I accept that clubs, such as youth clubs and Catholic boy scouts clubs, might not be considered to be discriminating clubs on the grounds of religion and age, but &ldquo;nationality or ethnic or national origin&rdquo; could be interpreted in the worst possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that a club could not be a registered club if its principal purpose was to cater for persons of a particular nationality or ethic or national origin and if it wished to restrict membership to persons of that group.  I am puzzled that Senator McGennis tabled this amendment because her party colleague, Deputy McDaid, proposed an amendment during the discussion of the Bill at the Select Committee on Social Affairs which would have had the effect of exempting from the provisions on registered clubs a club comprised of a recognisable minority such as nationality.  In his contribution he said he wished to cover clubs which might be set up for those of French, Italian or Bosnian nationality, for example, so that they would be able to retain their specific identity as minorities without being discriminated against by outsiders.  When I assured the Deputy that the existing provisions in section 11 (a) (1) covered this situation, he withdrew his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to allow people to have registered clubs for a particular nationality or ethnic or national origin.  Nationality or ethnic or national origin does not refer to their colour or race.  These clubs will cater for minorities and nobody could reasonably object to their existence. <Col N="33" />  We are all familiar with the many Irish organisations which exist in Britain, the US and other countries to which Irish people have emigrated.  When Ireland is the host country, we should be correspondingly tolerant of persons of another nationality or national origin, and that is the purpose of this provision.</P>

      <P>I spoke of sanctions on Second Stage and said that this was the most appropriate way of ensuring that clubs did not discriminate.  However, section 12(1)(b) states that &ldquo;the club shall not be provided with the use of publicly-owned facilities that are intended for recreation&rdquo;.  That means that publicly owned facilities which are not intended for recreation can be made available to a discriminating group or club.

The <Col N="35" /> Minister stated on an earlier amendment where I wanted to provide for a &ldquo;residence ground&rdquo; that he felt he had gone as far as was necessary and that if he had expanded the provision and provided too many other categories, we could go on forever.</P>
      <P>It is simply necessary to state in this subsection that a &ldquo;person shall not sexually harass or harass (within the meaning of subsection (4) or (5)) another person&rdquo; although the Minister may want to describe that other person as the victim.  There is no need to describe the victim as a student who &ldquo;has applied for admission or avails or seeks to avail of any service offered ...&rdquo;.  This Bill deals with educational institutions, social clubs, etc.  To keep it tight and complement the Employment Equality Bill, I would keep it simple and not include all the stated categories.  If the Minister wishes, he may also include &ldquo;(the victim)&rdquo;, which would strengthen it.</P>

      <P>The sexual and other harassment provisions of this Bill apply to areas generally corresponding to those in which discrimination is prohibited.  The prohibition of sexual and other harassment in the Employment Equality Bill is similarly confined to the context of employment. The revised form of the Senator's amendment would have the effect of bringing all sexual and other harassment, irrespective of the area in which it takes place, within the scope of the Bill. This would be outside the scope of this Bill as provided for in the long title.  It would duplicate the Employment Equality Bill and would be very difficult to enforce since it would cover sexual and other harassment in all spheres, public and private.  I regret in the circumstances that I can not accept the amendment.  The sexual harassment provisions relate to the spectrum of issues covered by the Bill and that is standard procedure.</P>

      <P>Could the responsible person use the defence that he or she was unaware of the occurrence of sexual harassment?  I can visualise situations taking place in youth hostels, clubs, etc., where such a person may quite reasonably be unaware of the occurrence of sexual harassment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the situation of the responsible person, particularly in the case of a large establishment.  Let us consider the case of the director of a youth hostel catering for 200 to 300 people where sexual harassment may have occurred in a shower cubicle, for example, and the director, or the responsible person, may be reasonably unaware of its existence.  In such a situation he or she would not have taken practical steps because they were unaware of the necessity to avoid this particular circumstance.  Could the fact that he or she took due and good care that sexual harassment did not occur be taken as a defence?  I recall an old phrase which states that ignorance of the law is no defence.  Would a person in the situation to which I referred be vulnerable on the basis of pleading ignorance of an occasion of sexual harassment.  Is such a plea not regarded as a satisfactory defence?</P>
      <P>With regard to the general principle of sexual harassment, I did not have an opportunity to contribute on Second Stage but in his contribution the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The definitions of sexual and other harassment were substantially amended in the Dáil following changes to the Employment Equality Bill.  The provisions of the two Bills are &mdash; in essence, if not in actual wording &mdash; the same. Sexual harassment is defined as an act of physical intimacy, a request for sexual favours or an act or conduct with sexual connotations, which is unwelcome and could reasonably be regarded as sexually offensive, humiliating or intimidating, or where a <i>quid pro quo</i> element is involved.</P>
      <P>I believe the amendments to which the Minister referred were made in the Upper House.  I highlighted the unwelcome nature of acts of sexual harassment and the <i>quid pro quo</i> element involved.</P>

      <P>With regard to Senator Norris' point about sexual harassment, it would depend on the particular facts in each case.  If the owner of a premises had no knowledge that sexual harassment was taking place and could not have been reasonably expected to know what was occurring, the plea of ignorance would be a defence.  On the other hand, had there been a sequence of events and the person took no action, even if they were unaware of the occurrence of a particular incident, they could be held to be liable.  The thrust of subsections (2) and (3) is that if the responsible person was aware of incidents of sexual harassment and did not take reasonably practicable steps to stop it, the question of liability could arise if a particular incident, of which they had no knowledge, occurred.</P>

      <P>In page 18, subsection (1), line 39, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I stated that there had been an extensive lobby by members of the Centre for Independent Living who protested at the gates of this House but could not gain admission to the Chamber because there is no access to the Public Gallery other than the staircase.  That made the case for accessible entrances to buildings more graphically than could any Member of the House. The thrust of the Centre for Independent Living's lobby involved access to public transport.  As it stands, there is no bus service throughout the country is accessible to people with wheelchairs. <Col N="38" /> The representatives of the centre also made the case that it would be less costly and more economic to operate buses which can be lowered to pavement level to allow access, even for those who are mobile.</P>
    <P>Section 19 states that after the enactment of the legislation the Minister may, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, make regulations.  I am concerned that use of the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; will not give the required strength to the provision and I propose that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be substituted.  From experience I believe use of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; involves an obligation whereas &ldquo;may&rdquo; means that the matter remains at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The amendment would strengthen this section and place an onus on the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to cater for the absolute right of people with disabilities to access to public transport.  In turn, this would allow them the right to access to employment.  Statistics and information about people with disabilities show that they are the most discriminated against in terms of employment.  The two are not unconnected, because if one is immobile one has very little prospect of gaining employment.  Few people with disabilities are in a position to afford private transport.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to retain discretion on this matter; it should be made clear that he or she has a responsibility to ensure the rights of people with disabilities.  We are not discussing the replacement of an existing bus fleet; our concern is that, when it falls to be replaced, a certain percentage of that fleet must be replaced with accessible public transport.  Rail stations and bus terminals must also be made accessible to the disabled.  I will be glad if the Minister agrees to this minor amendment.</P>
    <P>I will not argue with Senator Norris, who has been very supportive, but I take issue with comments about the religious aspect of this legislation and the Employment Equality Bill.  During the debates on both Bills, Independent Members stated that amendments relating to provisions on religious issues are the most critical, important and substantial.</P>

    <Col N="39" />
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first legislation specifically devoted to credit unions for over 30 years.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide a statutory framework for the development and growth of the credit union movement and to enable credit unions to provide an enhanced range of services to their members.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the general welcome given to the Bill by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  The league is the representative body which has guided and overseen the development of the credit union movement since its foundation, a role it has carried out and continues to fulfil with diligence and integrity.  The achievement of the league in presiding over and guiding the extraordinary growth of the credit union movement is truly remarkable.</P>
      <P>In its journal, the league has described the Bill's highlights as including &ldquo;provision for more flexibility on withdrawing shares and deposits, for allowing people under 16 years to join credit unions, for loans to be made for periods longer than five years, for a credit union to participate in a savings protection scheme, for statutory fraud, dishonesty insurance and to allow credit unions provide `additional services&rdquo;'.  I will return later to some of those matters, as I will to addressing important concerns also articulated by the league.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to present this important Bill to the House.  The need for the new Credit Union Bill is due entirely to the tremendous success which credit unions continue to enjoy in meeting the financial needs of their members.  Credit unions are now such an integral part of Irish society that it is hard to believe that they were unknown in Ireland 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>In 1958 the first credit union was formed here and by the following year there were three credit unions comprising 200 members with a modest sum of £415 in members' shareholdings.  As financial co-operatives, the initial credit unions were formed under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1913, but such was their success and growth in the succeeding years that it quickly became apparent that they needed a separate statutory base.</P>
      <P>This led to the enactment of the Credit Union Act, 1966, which remains the principal legislation governing credit unions to this day.  The 1966 Act deals with the basics of credit union establishment, organisation, operations and supervision.  It outlines the conditions for the registration of a credit union by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and sets out the qualifications for membership of a credit union.  It provides for the rules of a credit union to be approved by and registered with the registrar and establishes the general provisions relating to a member's shares and deposits in the credit union.  The Act allows the credit union to borrow money and to make loans available to its members, subject to certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It deals with the powers, functions, duties and constitution of the credit union's board of directors and its supervisory committee and establishes <Col N="40" /> the manner in which they report to the credit union's membership and are subject to the members in general meeting.  The Act also provides for the keeping of books of account by credit unions and for their audit, and it established the Credit Union Advisory Committee, which has been a source of independent advice on credit union affairs to successive Governments for some time.  It will be clear from this outline of the 1966 Act that many of its general features are being retained in its successor.  With the support of the statutory recognition afforded by the 1966 Act, the number of credit unions grew from the existing three in 1959 to 336 by 1969.  The number of credit union members reached 169,000 in that year and shareholdings exceeded £7 million for the first time.  In a little more than ten years, credit unions had become firmly established in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The next legislative landmark was the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1978, Part III of which dealt exclusively with credit unions and specifically with providing updated powers of supervision for the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  This became necessary because of the continuing success of the credit union movement in expanding the number of credit unions, its overall membership and the savings base.  Part III of the 1978 Act was a response to the fact that the 1966 Act provided the registrar with little or no powers to exercise any meaningful role in supervising a credit union once it had been established.  For the first time, the 1978 Act gave the registrar the power to inspect and investigate a credit union's affairs and, where necessary, to direct a credit union to suspend the acceptance of shares, deposits, loans and payments in certain specified circumstances.  It also enabled the registrar to call a special general meeting of a credit union and to appoint a person as one of its directors.  Many of these provisions are replicated in the Credit Union Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Throughout this period credit unions continued to grow and prosper, and by the end of the 1980s there were more than 500 credit unions throughout Ireland.  In addition, credit union membership passed the one million mark, and the value of shareholdings amounted to £650 million.  It was at this time that a general consensus began to emerge within the credit union movement itself that a new and wide ranging Credit Union Bill was required.  This led to the establishment of a working party comprising representatives from my Department, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Credit Union Advisory Committee and the Irish League of Credit Unions to identify the parameters for this new legislation.  The Bill before the House is consistent with heads agreed on the basis of the working party's conclusions.</P>
    <P>If it was felt that legislative change was required in the late 1980s, it is even more urgent in the second half of the 1990s.  Many credit unions are now offering services to their members that were never envisaged in the original legislation, and there is clearly a need to provide a <Col N="41" /> proper statutory basis for current credit union operations as well as establishing a framework for the future development of the credit union movement in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>With a sum of £2 billion currently invested in the more than 430 credit unions based in the State and notwithstanding the record of credit unions and the league in protecting members' savings, there is also a need to update the supervisory powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies since the last legislative change in 1978.  The purpose of this Credit Union Bill, therefore, is to consolidate all existing credit union legislation and to provide an updated framework for the development and regulation of the credit union movement in the future.  Unlike the 1966 Act, which continued to rely on provisions in the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts as far back as 1893, this Bill for the first time constitutes a stand alone measure for credit unions.  It repeals the 1966 Credit Union Act as well as those parts of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts which formerly dealt with credit unions.</P>
    <P>There are many positive features to the Bill, and it important at the outset to outline what these are.  First, the Bill supports and protects the essential ethos of the credit union movement. Credit unions are non profit-making financial cooperatives; they exist only to serve their members and their members' community.  They provide a mechanism for redeploying the savings of credit union members to benefit and support the financial needs of other members of their community. This has been achieved down the years through a largely volunteer and part-time workforce in the best traditions of community self help.  All members of the movement, regardless of whether they are actively working in their credit union, arehelping their community by investing their savings in that community.</P>
    <P>A second positive feature of the Bill is that it provides a framework for the development by credit unions of additional services beyond the traditional ones of savings and loans.  For example, a number of credit unions are now selling insurance products and providing foreign exchange, and there is an increasing desire on their part to exploit the opportunities afforded by technology for the development of an ATM network, for example.  The provision of this framework in the Bill addresses a long-standing demand of credit unions which are anxious to provide both improvements in service and a greater range of services for their members.  Many credit unions have shown commendable initiative in starting to provide additional services on a pilot basis, but credit unions in general are conscious that a lot of work lies ahead in bringing their services up-to-date.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Bill adopts new limits for loans and savings, whether they are held in the form of shares or deposits.  Under existing legislative provisions there are distinct limits for shares and deposits.  In the Bill before the House a combined savings limit per credit union member is set at <Col N="42" /> £50,000 or 1 per cent of the credit union's total assets, whichever is the greater, provided that no more than £20,000 is in the form of deposits.  A positive change in the area of loans is the removal of the maximum loan period of five years contained in the 1966 Act.  The new Bill enables up to 20 per cent of credit union loan funds to extend beyond five years and up to 10 per cent of loan funds to cover periods exceeding ten years.  The limit on individual loans under the Bill is £30,000 or 1.5 per cent of the total assets of the credit union, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the financial limits for savings and loans have attracted a lot of attention since the Bill was published.  However, the limits in the Bill have been changed since publication in response to various representations I received from the credit union movement.  At the same time, the new limits remain faithful to the fundamental principles I am anxious to protect.</P>
    <P>The strength of the credit union movement lies in catering for the personal financial needs of its members.  Credit unions are not banks or building societies, and they should not become such.  It is my view and that of the Government that credit unions should continue to meet the needs of their members and should not seek to diversify their activity into corporate or other commercial business.  The most effective means of achieving this is to cap the amount of savings and loans which apply to individual members of a credit union, just as limits were a feature of the Credit Union Act, 1966, and its associated regulations.  Based on figures supplied to my Department by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Irish League of Credit Unions, I believe these new savings and loan limits meet the current needs of credit union members while providing generous scope for future growth.  In round figures, the average shareholding of a credit union member in 1995 was in the region of £1,000.  The average amount such a member had on deposit was about £100.  The average loan to each member borrowing from a credit union was some £2,000. When these are considered by reference to the minimum ceilings of £50,000 and £30,000 per member included in the Bill for savings and loans respectively, it is clear substantial scope is given for the future growth of the savings base and loan book of credit unions generally.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Bill includes a number of modern legislative provisions to support the credit union movement.  First, updated provisions are included relating to the arbitration of disputes between a member and his or her credit union.  Secondly, the Bill makes improved arrangements for amalgamations or transfers of engagements between credit unions.  It also translates into credit union law the arrangements relating to winding up in companies legislation, subject to appropriate changes.  The Bill also adopts the administration concept found in the Insurance Acts.  Finally, the Bill allows for examinership.  In this latter area, it adopts a number of the recommendations made <Col N="43" /> in the Company Law Review Group Report of December 1994.  Although these changes have yet to be implemented in company law, they are included in this Bill as evidence of the Government's firm commitment to a state of the art Credit Union Bill.  I will elaborate on these changes later.</P>
    <P>A final significant feature of the Bill to which I wish to draw the attention of Senators is the updating of the supervisory arrangements for credit unions.  I have already indicated this work is discharged by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and his staff, who are attached to my Department.  I mentioned earlier the registrar already has certain powers in this area under existing legislation and these are being maintained and updated as necessary in the Bill.  In response to the desire of credit unions to expand the range of additional services which they may offer, the registrar is being given new powers to enable him to satisfy himself as to the capability of the credit union to undertake the additional services which it wishes to offer, where such services have potential consequences for the finances of a credit union or the savings of its members.  In conjunction with the wider scope of this Bill relative to existing legislation in such new areas as administration and examinership, the registrar is also being given a role in such areas to facilitate the orderly regulation of credit union affairs.  I add that the registrar's decisions are subject to appeal in the High Court, so as to ensure he cannot overstep the powers to be given to him in the Bill. Finally, the registrar is the State's supervisory and regulatory watchdog in this area of the financial and monetary system.  He is to credit unions what the Central Bank is to banks and building societies.</P>
    <P>Having outlined what I believe to be the significant elements of the Bill, I now turn to describe in more detail for the House the provisions contained in each of the 14 Parts of the Bill.  Part I covers the first five sections of the Bill and contains a number of standard preliminary provisions.  Part II, comprising the next 20 sections, outlines the conditions for and procedural provisions relating to the registration of a credit union and its rules.  It also deals with amendments to a credit union's name and registered rules.  It also establishes the conditions for membership of a credit union and provision is made for a member's withdrawal or expulsion.  A right of appeal to the courts is provided against specified decisions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the credit union.  In this part also, a member may nominate in writing to the credit union a person or persons to become entitled to his or her property in the credit union on death and necessary consequential and procedural provisions are stipulated.  Where no nomination has been made, the board of directors has discretion, within certain limits, to distribute or make payments from a member's property in the credit union to persons whom the board judges proper to receive it in the <Col N="44" /> event of the member's death or mental disorder or disability.</P>
    <P>Part III, which deals with the operation of credit unions, covers sections 26 to 52 inclusive and sets out a number of the key parameters within which credit unions must operate.  It starts by specifying that a credit union may do anything consistent with its objects, subject to the right of a member or the registrar to apply to the High Court to restrain a credit union from doing any act or thing which it has no power to do.  The general provisions relating to savings in the credit union include that the amount which a member may invest may not exceed £50,000 or 1 per cent of the credit union's total assets, whichever is the greater; the dividend on shares may not exceed 10 per cent per annum; different interest rates on deposits may be set from time to time and the credit union may require minimum withdrawal periods of 60 and 21 days for shares and deposits respectively.</P>
    <P>Subject to certain conditions, borrowing by a credit union is permitted.  It may also make a loan to a member, subject to a ceiling of £30,000 or 1.5 per cent of its total assets.  A maximum interest rate of 1 per cent per month shall be charged on the amount of loan outstanding.  Certain limitations on the period of loan offered also apply. A credit union or a person acting under its authority may make, accept or endorse a promissory note or bill of exchange; make, vary or discharge contracts and acquire land for the sole purpose of conducting its business.  A credit union may, in addition, invest its surplus funds in a specified manner and establish a special fund for social, cultural, charitable or community development purposes, subject to certain conditions.  It must also meet certain requirements with respect to the establishment of a reserve, its participation in a savings protection scheme and the maintenance of insurance against fraud by its officers, etc.  Subject to the agreement of its members and the registrar's approval, a credit union may provide additional services to its members.  However, a credit union is prohibited from offering loans subject to a condition that a member shall avail of an additional service.  A right of appeal to the High Court is provided against decisions of the registrar in this area.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the management of credit unions and extends from sections 53 to 76 inclusive.  It specifies, for example, the general functions and duties of the board of directors, the supervisory committee and other officers of the credit union and it outlines a number of associated procedural requirements.  Provision is made for the manner of their election, appointment, resignation, suspension and removal, for the remuneration of the treasurer and the payment or reimbursement of expenses to other officers.</P>
    <P>In this Part of the Bill a general prohibition operates against any officer participating in a decision in which he has an interest and against any officer or voluntary assistant disclosing any information relating to the affairs of a credit <Col N="45" /> union.  Officers and voluntary assistants who have receipt or charge of credit union funds may be required to provide security and they shall be required to account for their actions.</P>
    <P>A credit union is also required to maintain a register and duplicate register containing certain specified information relating to its members and officers.  It must also make available for inspection by its members an abbreviated register containing certain particulars from the register.  On the application of 30 members, the registrar may appoint an accountant to examine the books and documents of the credit union.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill sets out in sections 77 to 83, inclusive, the arrangements for the notification, convening and conduct of the credit union's initial organisation meeting, its subsequent annual general meetings and any special general meetings.  The registrar, a body administering a savings protection scheme or a qualifying group of members may require the holding of a general meeting.</P>
    <P>The credit unions' tradition of one member one vote, irrespective of the size of the member's shareholding, is confirmed and the right of members to demand a poll on the questions before a general meeting is protected.  The registrar may also attend and be heard at a general meeting.  The requirements for the adoption and commencement of special resolutions are also specified.</P>
    <P>Part VI comprises sections 84 to 106, inclusive, and contains a number of important provisions relating to the control and supervision of credit unions by the registrar.  It specifies that his role is to protect members' funds and the financial stability of credit unions generally.  To that end, he is given power to require credit unions to comply with certain specified ratios.  He may also issue directions in relation to advertising by credit union interests.  In specified circumstances, the registrar may issue regulatory directions to a credit union in relation to the conduct of its affairs, subject to a right of appeal by the credit union to the High Court.  The registrar may also invite the court to confirm a regulatory direction, to prohibit a contravention of the Bill or to cease the provision of the additional services offered under Part III.  While such regulatory directions are in force, winding up and other specified proceedings may not be initiated except by leave of the court.</P>
    <P>In addition, the registrar may appoint an authorised person to inspect the books and documents of a credit union.  Under specified conditions, he may appoint, on his own initiative or at the request of 30 members, an inspector to investigate its affairs or call a special general meeting. Matters relating to the conduct of such an inspection or investigation, the subsequent report and possible prosecution proceedings are also dealt with.</P>
    <P>On foot of an inspection or investigation, the registrar may appoint a director to the board of a credit union or suspend or remove from office one or more directors or members of the supervisory <Col N="46" /> committee.  The registrar may also suspend or cancel the registration of a credit union.  In these cases, a right of appeal to the High Court is available to the person(s) concerned.</P>
    <P>This part of the Bill also imposes obligations on the registrar.  For example, he is required to prepare and maintain a public file on each credit union and the Minister may prescribe fees for the exercise by the registrar of his functions under the Bill.  Certain administrative provisions relating to the classification of information and the delivery of documents are also included.  The Minister may authorise assistant registrars to perform the functions of the registrar, who is required to produce to the Minister an annual report which shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill covers sections 107 to 124, inclusive, and deals with the accounts and audit of a credit union.  It specifies the financial year of a credit union, the accounting principles to be followed, the keeping of proper accounting records and the maintenance of adequate control systems.  It establishes the duties of the directors in relation to the format, content and audit of the annual accounts and the report to members.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in this part for the election, appointment, resignation and removal of the auditor of a credit union and for the notification, convening and conduct of general meetings relating to the auditor.  His rights to obtain access to information and his duties to report to members on the state of affairs of a credit union are also included.  The registrar may also require the auditor to report to him on specified matters.  Officers and voluntary assistants of a credit union are required to give the auditor every assistance in the preparation of his report.  In addition, the credit union is required to make available a copy of its annual report and accounts to the registrar and to its members.</P>
    <P>Part VIII, comprising sections 125 to 127, inclusive, deals with the resolution of disputes and complaints relating to credit unions.  It provides that disputes between a member or former member and a credit union shall be settled in accordance with its rules, which decision shall be binding on all parties.  In certain circumstances a member may apply to the District Court to settle the matter.  Provision is made for the application of the Arbitration Acts to the settlement of disputes and for the making of ministerial regulations relating to the establishment of a credit union complaints investigation scheme.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill, from sections 128 to 132, inclusive, provides for the amalgamation of two or more credit unions and establishes the necessary procedures for the approval of the terms of the amalgamation by special resolution of the members and for registering the rules of the successor credit union.  The procedures include the preparation of an information statement by the credit union for its members, the application to the registrar for confirmation of the proposed amalgamation, the publication of the necessary notice and the subsequent distribution of any <Col N="47" /> funds to members.  Similar provisions are included in this part where a credit union proposes to transfer its engagements to another credit union.</P>
    <P>Part X sets out in sections 133 to 136, inclusive, the arrangements for the winding up of a credit union.  It provides that the registrar may in certain circumstances apply to the High Court for an order to wind up a credit union.  It also provides that a credit union may be dissolved in accordance with the Companies Acts by members or creditors.  An instrument of dissolution is required to contain specified information and shall be sent to the registrar for registration.  The credit union shall be dissolved from the date of advertisement of the dissolution, subject to a right of application to the High Court by a member or other person having a claim on the credit union's funds.  The registration of such a credit union may only be cancelled after the fulfilment of specified conditions.</P>
    <P>Part XI, covering sections 137 to 141, inclusive, applies to credit unions the concept of administration which is found in the Insurance Acts. The intention is that a credit union administrator would be appointed where a credit union was being mismanaged rather than necessarily having serious financial difficulties.  Provision is made for the appointment by the High Court, on the application of the registrar, of an administrator, or provisional administrator, to carry on the affairs of a credit union as a going concern.  The effect of an administration order on a credit union is stipulated and various procedural matters, including the termination of administration in certain circumstances, are dealt with.</P>
    <P>Part XII proposes to apply the option of examinership to credit unions and extends from sections 142 to 170, inclusive.  Senators will recall that the first 1990 Companies Act introduced the concept into Irish law and it has since been frequently used to save companies which have found themselves to be in serious trading difficulties. The Company Law Review Group in its first report in 1994 made a number of recommendations to improve the examinership process.  The principal recommendations made by the group which are now incorporated into this Bill are: that the petition to the court for the appointment of an examiner must be accompanied by the report of an independent accountant on the credit union's affairs; the court must satisfy itself that there is a reasonable prospect of the survival of the credit union as a going concern before it decides to appoint an examiner and the general time period for examinership should be reduced from three months to 70 days.</P>
    <P>The examinership part of this Bill provides for the appointment by the High Court, or in certain circumstances by the Circuit Court, of an examiner to a credit union if it appears that there is a reasonable prospect of survival.  A petition to the court may be made by specified persons and must be accompanied, <i>inter alia,</i> by the report of an <Col N="48" /> independent accountant containing certain information.</P>
    <P>In exceptional circumstances the court may allow the petitioner a period of no more than ten days for the submission of the report to the court before the petition is heard.  A credit union shall be deemed to be under the protection of the court from the date of presentation of the petition.  The effect of such protection on the status of a credit union is described and the court may make such orders as it thinks fit where a receiver or provisional liquidator already stands appointed to the credit union.</P>
    <P>The powers of an examiner are defined in this part, and specified persons are required to cooperate with him in his work.  In consultation with members and creditors, the examiner shall prepare for consideration by the court a report containing proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement.</P>
    <P>The court may also hold a hearing where evidence exists of a substantial disappearance of credit union assets.  Various procedural provisions are included related to the appointment of an examiner and the court's adjudication of his proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement.</P>
    <P>Part XIII deals with offences and civil proceedings in sections 171 to 179 inclusive.  It outlines the general provisions relating to offences which may be committed by credit unions, their officers and other persons for contravening the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The final part of the Bill, Part XIV, provides in sections 180 to 189 for the maintenance of the statutory Credit Union Advisory Committee, for the making of ministerial regulations under the Bill and for various matters relating to records, documents and notices.  This part of the Bill also includes for the first time statutory recognition of the Irish League of Credit Unions as the major representative grouping of credit unions in the country by providing that the Minister and the registrar are required to consult with the league on various matters relating to the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this extensive summary that the Bill before the House is a lengthy measure.  That is putting it mildly.  I said at the outset of my remarks today that the Bill's overall structure and content is attributable to the extensive consultation process which took place between Government and the credit union movement itself over a number of years.  It is unique in my experience that any economic sector should have been given the freedom to develop the legislative blueprint for its own future.  The movement has therefore had a major formative influence on the Bill before us today.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Bill late last year, I have received extensive submissions from the Irish League of Credit Unions and the statutory Credit Union Advisory Committee, as well as a host of credit unions, individuals and other interested parties.  Many valuable comments have <Col N="49" /> been made, and I endeavoured in our debate on the Bill in Dáil Éireann to take on board as many of the suggestions as possible.  The four month period since publication of the Credit Union Bill has therefore proved to be very beneficial in helping me to improve a number of the Bill's provisions and in particular to address the concerns of the credit union movement about some of its details.</P>
    <P>Aside from the issues of savings and loan limits and the statutory recognition of the Irish League of Credit Unions which I have already spoken about, there were concerns that the Bill involved a measure of &ldquo;intrusive regulation&rdquo; of credit union affairs.  The first point I would make in response is that any financial institution which looks after other people's money must be subject to effective regulation.  The increased powers being given to the Registrar of Friendly Societies are designed to ensure that appropriate and speedy action can be taken in a problem case.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I have amended the Bill since its publication to extend the right of appeal to the courts from his decisions, to shorten or impose new time periods within which he must act and to remove altogether from the Bill unnecessary references to his involvement in credit union affairs.  I believe that these represent a serious response on my part to these credit union concerns.</P>
    <P>In a similar vein, I should also add that a number of credit union interest expressed concerns with the offences and penalty provisions of the Bill.  I have since amended the Bill to effect a significant reduction in the terms of imprisonment applicable to offences committed under the Bill.</P>
    <P>A series of other more technical amendments have also been incorporated in the Bill before the House taking into account many more detailed comments made to me in recent months, both inside and outside the Oireachtas.  I said on its publication that the Bill was in good shape, primarily because of the expert contributions which the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the credit union movement had made in its preparation.  I believe that the Bill is now in much better shape arising from the extensive consultations which I and my Department have had with various parties in recent months.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to meet all of the points made to me, in some cases because the suggestions made involved a measure of contradiction. It is not surprising that in a movement of over 1.5 million members there should be some measure of disagreement as to the best way forward.  In other cases I have not been able to respond for sound legal reasons following consultation with the offices of the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General.  In certain instances, I have taken a particular policy position which ruled out some of the more uninhibited ideas for future credit union development.</P>
    <P>In particular, I want this Bill to maintain the fundamental ethos of credit unions as community self-help institutions.  In addition, I want to see <Col N="50" /> them remaining as important providers of personal finance to their members, which banks and building societies have tended to neglect.  I particularly do not wish to see credit unions chase corporate business, whose commitment to credit unions would generally extend no further than the bottom line.  This of necessity implies that some differentiation between credit unions and other financial institutions must be maintained in this Bill, and this has been done.</P>
    <P>I remain anxious that the registrar, should have appropriate supervisory controls over credit unions as they develop and expand their range of services, and I have secured Government approval to additional resources to help him in his expanded role.  Credit unions have an excellent track record of security for their members' savings, and I want to see this continue.  The registrar must be accordingly able to act where necessary to resolve any emerging difficulties arising in any individual credit union and thereby to preserve their excellent reputation as sound community based financial institutions.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased this Bill is before the House.  I have listened attentively to the Minister. This Bill has gone through a long process in Dáil Éireann.  There is an anxiety on this side of the House, particularly in my party, that the Bill should have a speedy passage here.  The credit union movement, the league and the members of individual credit unions who have been in touch with me are worried lest impending political events should cause any lengthy delay in the passage of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has rightly said, and I think it is agreed by all parties, that the credit union movement has been one of the most extraordinary and spectacular successes in Irish life in the past 50 years.  It is incredible that only 40 years ago the concept of credit unions was virtually unknown. Over 40 years, the credit union movement has provided Irish people with an exemplary service in every way.  It is an extraordinary monument, not just to its own success but the energy members of the credit union movement have put into it.  The way the movement has grown, developed, flowered and flourished is also an extraordinary tribute to Irish voluntarism.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, in 1958 there were 200 members and £415 of savings.  There are now 530 credit unions on the island, 1.8 million members and almost £2 billion in savings.  It is worth our while remembering that the kind of scandals, failures and problems which have been such a distressing feature of other parts of financial services have never been experienced by the credit union movement.  Their record in this regard is an exemplary one, which the Irish banking and financial industry can only try to emulate and feel more than a little jealous about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 427 credit unions affiliated to the league.  They provide an unparalleled level of financially based, user friendly services to people in <Col N="51" /> all parts of the country.  Travelling through Ireland one can see towns which have been abandoned by the banking industry and experienced the death of post offices but still remain cores of credit union activity.</P>
    <P>The service provided by the credit union movement is unique.  First, it is community based, which is extraordinary in the days of crass commercialism.  Second, it is not fundamentally focused on profit.  Service is the objective rather than the bottom line.  This is something which privately and publicly owned banks cannot compete with.  Third, an extraordinary level of voluntarism is still based in the credit union movement.  It is extraordinary to look at the scale and level of service provided by credit unions when one considers the backbone of that movement is voluntarism.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the credit union movement I find praiseworthy and which is an essential element in its success.  The credit union service is not in any way elitist.  It is user friendly, a character exemplified by a sense of neighbourliness.  It serves people who would not use banks.</P>
    <P>Credit unions also encourage frugality, which is sometimes considered conservative but which is praiseworthy.  In particular, it encourages frugality among people on low incomes who do not necessarily have a high propensity to save.  This helps people regulate their financial affairs in a way none of the commercial banking services does.</P>
    <P>Credit unions provide a valuable service to young and old people.  Young people are encouraged to become involved in the movement, partly through the positive attitude taken by credit unions to younger people in comparison with that of banks or commercially oriented bodies.  In particular, I welcome the service credit unions provide for the elderly, especially those in rural communities.  The movement is trusted by these people.  They feel unthreatened by their credit unions and they are encouraged to deposit savings with them rather than hold income at home. The credit union fulfils a very important social function which other financial services are not fulfilling.</P>
    <P>Banks have often abandoned rural areas and too often we have seen the demise of post offices. In many parts of the country credit unions provide the only available financial services.</P>
    <P>One aspect of credit unions in recent years which we all celebrate is the monetary advice and budgetary service.  This is a very valuable service, particularly for those who in the past found money lenders, who operated usurious rates with ruinous effects on the lives of people, were their only recourse in times of difficulty.  Credit unions, with the support of Government and other social agencies, have stepped into a major gap which emerged in recent years.  All members of credit unions are entitled to our compliments and gratitude for doing this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> Credit unions have made modest demands for changes to this Bill.  They have sought an increase in lending limits to 2 per cent of the assets of the union.  Having listened to all the arguments, I cannot understand the reticence on this matter.  Credit unions have also asked that the league be given more statutory recognition.  It should become the co-ordinating and controlling body. The Minister knows my views on self-regulation. I have not been a supporter of it in the past, but we have to examine the track record of the credit union which has been exemplary in comparison to other areas of life where self-regulation is present.  We could find credit unions more trustworthy in this regard than, for example, banking or some of the so-called liberal professions.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have also argued for equality of membership and for the clause on non-qualifying members to be removed.  I do not understand, and neither does my party, the reluctance to meet these modest requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister has cogently indicated his reluctance to extend the lending limits.  His view is that credit unions are not banks or building societies. The Minister is correct in this &mdash; they are entirely different bodies.  Therefore, it is not valid to make comparisons with banks and building societies. Credit unions should be seen as a <i>sui generis</i> body providing a unique service.  For this reason the Minister has argued for a cap on loans.  The figure suggested by him is not a constraint if it is judged against average loans.  However, the capping figure has the potential of becoming an inflexible and unnecessary constraint.  I recognise the work the Minister has put into this Bill but he is, surprisingly, showing as excess of conservatism, a conservatism which is novel, given the Minister's past pronouncements on other issues.  It also hints at a degree of mistrust of the unions which is not warranted by the history of honest and prudent management which has exemplified the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have proved their maturity and trustworthiness and have argued cogently for an increase in new limits.  In its magazine, <i>Review,</i> which has been circulated in preparation for the annual general meeting of the movement, the league says it has provided detailed data to the Minister based on a survey of 427 affiliated credit unions in support of its case.  The survey shows there is a substantial number of loans over £20,000, the limit in the Bill as initiated, and a significant number of loans over £30,000.  One hundred and thirty two credit unions gave loans in excess of £20,000 and 60 have loans over £30,000.  In addition, 293 credit unions have loans between £10,000 and £20,000.  This suggests that the cap will prove an onerous restraint on credit unions.  I agree with the league that the low cap on loans proposed in the Bill could mean that 81 credit unions will have to restrict certain services to its members.  The survey suggests that these 81 credit unions are already facing caps.</P>
    <P>The regulation arrangements outlined by the Minister and the role he has identified for the <Col N="53" /> Registrar of Friendly Societies seems to be excessively conservative.  The <i>Review</i> is interesting in this regard.  It writes about the constraints ensuing from even the modified arrangements being made for the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  We are reluctant to delay the passage of this Bill but we may have to return to this matter on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I agree with the views of the league that that kind of regulation from the top down is inappropriate to a community based organisation.  The movement is essentially community based and it would have been good to have had this recognised in dealing with the issue of regulation.</P>
    <P>The third issue raised by the league and individual credit unions concerns equality.  It is an important issue and I think the Minister recognises this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed concern about commercial lending by credit unions.  I do not wish to misinterpret the Minister, but I found this portion of his contribution puzzling.  We should leave the credit unions to exercise prudent discretion in the manner in which loans are made.  I know of many small businesses which have been saved by commercial loans from credit unions.  I am anxious that the views of the Minister should not impede this important source of funding for people who wish to start their own business.</P>
    <P>The response of the banking community to this Bill has been churlish in the extreme.  I have listened to some of their arguments; some of the banks have argued that some credit unions have made imprudent loans.  That is a choice argument coming from a banking community which supported, for example, the Goodman empire and which has been involved in many imprudent loan arrangements through the years.  The banks have been arguing strenuously about the real APR which is effectively charged by the credit unions, saying that it is too high.  That, coming from a banking community which imposes charges for banking services on Irish people and which is totally out of line with other EU countries, is also choice.</P>
    <P>The banks' hostility to the credit union developments into the mortgage market is very difficult to understand.  I cannot see how the credit union movement could possibly pose a threat. They have also argued that the credit union movement enjoys special tax arrangements. There are many special arrangements in place in the banking community which also constitute special arrangements, not least cartel arrangements which were allowed to operate for many years in the banking sector.</P>
    <P>The banks should mature and &ldquo;chill out&rdquo; a little.  There is a place for banks and there is also a place for credit unions.  Individual credit unions and the Irish League of Credit Unions are anxious that the impending general election should not impede the legislation in any way.  I share that view; it is important that the Bill should not be delayed.  The Minister can be assured that we will do everything we can do <Col N="54" /> allow the Bill proceed as speedily as possible through this House.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement, which has served Irish people so well, is due to hold an AGM, representing its fortieth year in service, on 26 and 27 April.  I would like to extend my good wishes and those of my party to the movement.  I hope the Bill will be in place at that time and will meet the movement's requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, have been awaiting this Bill for years. This comprehensive and detailed Bill effectively incorporates five or six Bills under one title.  As the Minister said, it is a state of the art Bill.  This fine piece of legislation is a monument to the Minister, his officials, the Irish League of Credit Unions and the credit union advisory committee. When the Bill was first published, quite a number of contentious issues arose.  From that point through to Committee Stage of the Select Committee, substantial amendments were accepted by the Minister.  Last night in the Dáil, the Minister again accepted a huge number of amendments which leaves us with very little to say.  It is difficult for us to criticise the Bill or to prepare amendments as all the contentious areas have been dealt with by the Minister.  He must be complimented for that.  The Bill before the House today has been substantially amended and improved and has received the acceptance of the credit union movement across the country.</P>
      <P>The history of the credit union movement and the manner in which it has blossomed over 40 years is interesting.  If one looks at the development of the movement from its foundation to the present day one must ask how and why it has managed to attain such a firm foothold in Irish communities.  The answer lies in the fact that it is a movement of the people and by the people which responds to the needs of the real people. The credit union in every town and village provides a service to people whom the banks would not remotely entertain.  That is the significant difference between the banks and the credit union movement which is effectively a co-operative.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement has provided an effective service to people who, in many instances, are disadvantaged and do not have major assets.  Such people are given an opportunity by the credit union movement to improve themselves and their lifestyle.  There are 38,500 members in the credit union movement in County Clare.  The movement does not treat people as customers, it treats them as fellow members who co-operate with each other.  That is why it has been so successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few bad debts arise in the credit union movement primarily because of the local knowledge, information and contacts.  People recognise that if they default on loans, they and their families might be held in low esteem by the credit union which would not augur well for them in the future.  The credit union movement has provided loans to people whom the banks would not even <Col N="55" /> consider &mdash; social welfare recipients, people on low income and women.  Credit unions were providing loans to housewives long before the banks would entertain them.  They are to be commended for showing foresight and judgment long before other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement is not a banking movement and the Minister has struck the right note in this Bill.  He is wise in seeking to ensure that credit unions do not move into the corporate sector.  The credit union movement is a non-profit making organisation.  The proposition by banks and other institutions that a case be made for taxation and so on in relation to the credit union movement is extremely unwise.  The credit union movement is in a different league to the banks.  It collects money from people and provides them with money on a non-profit making basis.  The work they do is of huge advantage to the community.  That must be borne in mind at all times.</P>
    <P>During the meetings we, as public representatives, had in our various constituencies, a number of issue were raised in relation to the Bill and the Minister addressed all of them in the Lower House.  He has addressed the issues of loans, shares and deposits and that it very commendable.  I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has responded to the representations which have been made to him over recent months.  He has accepted the views of the credit union movement and its members.  He has allowed the credit union movement to move into the next century in a befitting manner and has given it the opportunity to provide additional services.  The Minister mentioned the number of loans and the average amount of money on deposit in 1994.  That speaks volumes about the credit unions.</P>
    <P>A case was made about intrusiveness and there was a real concern in the credit union movement about the level of intrusiveness the Bill would cause.  I am delighted the Minister has responded to that section in a wholehearted manner by removing the unnecessary references to the registrar.  The people working in the credit union movement, be they full-time, part-time or voluntary workers, are honourable, decent and highly motivated people.  Their record speaks for itself and there is no need for any major policing of them.  There is a need for guidelines, regulations and control.  That is acceptable but there is no need for over-intrusiveness and the Minister has acknowledged that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State responded positively by removing the unnecessary references to the registrar in section 33 on borrowing powers.  He also provided a greater right of appeal to the courts as regards the registrar's decision, which is welcome.  The time period within which he must act under sections 14 and 49 have been shortened, which is welcome. The provision allowing the registrar to give dispensations to credit unions from requirements under sections 27 and 35 is commendable.  The <Col N="56" /> time limits within which the registrar must act are extremely welcome.  This area which worried people has been dealt with to the satisfaction of the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>Before I came into the Chamber I received a phone call from the credit union movement on the Bill as it stands.  Its response was heartening and the Minister of State and his Department must be proud of what they have done during the debate.  The movement said the Bill was positive and that all the fundamental issues had been addressed.  It expressed its admiration for the Minister of State and said it had seen democracy at work in that the Minister of State listened to the views of Deputies from all sides on Committee and on Report Stages in the Dáil and accepted and tabled amendments to respond to their views.  The movement said the Bill will allow it to grow and develop into the 21st century and to expand its services.  Overall, it is extremely pleased with what the Minister of State and his Department did during the debate in the Lower House.  It said it would be unfair to highlight any matters of concern at this stage and felt there was no need to pursue further detail in terms of amendments to particular sections.</P>
    <P>This reflects positively on the manner in which the Minister of State handled the legislation in the House and on the future of the credit union movement, which is well equipped to move into the 21st century.  The Bill provides support, guidelines and direction and protects the interests of the movement and those of its members.  It is one of the finest pieces of legislation to come before the House in recent years and the Minister of State and his staff must be complimented on a good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but it will be hard to follow the extreme compliments paid to the Minister of State and his staff.  This is significant legislation which is overdue and which has been discussed at local level.  There was conflict as to whether these so-called &ldquo;road shows&rdquo; should take place.  Credit unions in cities and towns outlined to local and national representatives areas of concern and I am glad the Government took account of a number of issues raised and amended the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is obvious the credit union movement has been a spectacular success.  The movement has grown in stature and status, as has the amount of money on loan.  Some £1.8 million or £2 billion is on deposit in 530 credit unions throughout the country.  Coming from County Kilkenny, I am extremely grateful for the work which St. Canice's Credit Union, in particular, has done.  It allowed people who were unable to get bank loans to borrow money for family holidays.  The credit union gave the loan on the basis of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which credit unions have directed funds away from the cowboys of the lending industry, that is, those who tout house to house giving loans at exorbitant rates of interest to people who may need an extra bed or other <Col N="57" /> furniture.  Without the credit unions, these cowboys would make more money than they do at present.  The rates of interest they charged people who were under pressure were considerable.  As people got further into debt, they had no way to pay the interest, not to mention the loans, and found themselves in serious difficulties.  Banks did not help people having trouble making ends meet.</P>
    <P>The lending process which the credit union movement has developed is exemplary.  It understands people can get into financial difficulties and that some might not fulfil the necessary credit status investigations.  The movement has done something which the banks did not want to do or were not capable of doing.</P>
    <P>Credit unions pay personal attention to those who invest or borrow from them, which has paid off.  Banks have moved away from personal attention and want plastic to take over from people. The major banks have no personal contact with those who do business with them.  Although the credit union movement has grown in size, it pays personal attention to people, which is necessary.</P>
    <P>There is a need for regulations because the money involved has grown considerably.  The movement and those involved in lending and investment must be regulated by means other than self-regulation.  Self-regulation, as an exemplar, would be all right but it does not work.  We have seen it in the legal profession and in so-called financial institutions in which insurance brokers became financial advisers to the detriment of the people involved.  Self-regulation would be the best way to deal with matters if we lived in a society in which everything was exemplary or correct.</P>
    <P>The service to the community that credit union members offer is something we should look to in every other area of life.  The Irish League of Credit Unions must be complimented on the way in which it has brought together various units throughout the country.  What this supervisory organisation has done is an example of how to do business within a group of ordinary citizens who in general are doing a job without pay as volunteers.  Professional people also work in many bigger credit unions and they do a tremendous job establishing personal contact with those with whom they deal.</P>
    <P>The League of Credit Unions remains concerned that there is still some way to go on the issue of self-regulation.  I agree with the suggestion that self-regulation is the way to go, but there are problems with it.  Such problems have arisen in many other industries, particularly where finances are concerned.</P>
    <P>The proposal that the High Court should be the first line of appeal is a matter of concern for the movement.  This Bill deserves to pass through the House in the shortest possible time, but we must also remember the fact that we are dealing with a major industry.  The Bill addresses the credit union movement as an entity in financial life that has to be complemented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> I will not deal with the details of the Bill except to say that I am delighted it recognises the work of the credit union movement over many years. The movement has taken much of the burden off hard pressed people in the past.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be flexibility in the amount people can lend or place on deposit with credit unions.  There are distinct limits for shares and deposits.  The Bill sets the combined limit per credit union member at £50,000 or 1 per cent of a credit union's total assets, whichever is greater, provided that no more than £20,000 is in the form of deposits.</P>
    <P>I am glad the maximum loan period has been removed because this gives a chance to people who might want to purchase or take a share in a house or deal with a longer term arrangement than the existing five year period.  We do not want credit unions to become competitors to building societies, even though banks now have a bigger percentage of the home loans market than buildings societies.  I would not like to see credit unions becoming home lenders because of the long-term lending involved &mdash; 15 years plus for a house loan &mdash; and the amount of money that would have to be tied up in them.</P>
    <P>There can be occasions, however, when the credit union might be involved in financing homes, in particular where a person might be turned down by another lending institution due to a small shortfall in income or savings.  There is scope in the Bill to help those people.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for examinership, but I am not too sure how well examinership has worked. Many companies have availed of the examinership system, but how many of them have succeeded in doing anything other than providing a lot of money for auditors or the examiner?  How many companies have been saved through the option of examinership rather than receivership or liquidation?</P>
    <P>As well as allowing for examinership, the Bill also takes on board a number of recommendations made by the Company Law Review Group.  The concept of examinership has possibly worked to the advantage of certain major international companies in their secondary areas of operation; but I wonder if it has worked to the benefit of workers in certain companies which in the past would otherwise have gone into receivership or liquidation.</P>
    <P>In many cases it appears all the examinership has done is to put a lot of money in the hands of lawyers and accountants.  I would like the Minister of State to tell me whether there has been a successful examinership which has helped the workforce.  Can the Minister of State say whether the examinership option has been of benefit to a company's investors and directors, other than being of benefit to the legal or auditing professions?  I would like to know what his feelings are on that matter.</P>
    <P>The updating of supervisory arrangements for credit unions is both necessary and welcome. There may be slight flaws in the Bill, but many of <Col N="59" /> the flaws that were in the original Bill have been amended.  The Bill is welcome and over time changes may be made to facilitate the genuine needs of the credit union movement.  In particular I would like to ensure that the Irish League of Credit Unions receives the recognition it deserves both within the Bill itself and within the ambit of the financial services sector.</P>
    <P>The ATM is a fact of life but I hope credit unions will remain person friendly and not plastic friendly as many of the other financial institutions have become.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation.  This House does not have much work to do in this regard because all the work has been done at this stage, particularly with the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  I congratulate the Minister of State for getting near the end of the line.  He has put a tremendous amount of work both into the preparation of the legislation and the changes that were made during the debate on Committee and Reports Stages in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We were lobbied when the drafting seemed to be taking forever and a day, but eventually that was completed and the Bill came before the Oireachtas.  All the work has been worthwhile. We now see legislation that will give proper legislative recognition to the work of credit unions and will put into law the various regulations necessary to ensure the movement can move forward into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Many Members referred to the work and growth of credit unions.  The credit union movement belongs to the people.  It is not concerned with making a profit, it is non-sectarian as it operates in the 32 counties, and its ethos is to serve people without benefiting from it.  Figures published last September showed the number of credit unions and members in each constituency.  The ratio of volunteers to full-time and part-time employees is approximately 7:1.  That illustrates the nature of the credit union movement and the fact that many people give their time free to advance its aims.  As many speakers said, it has helped people of limited income for whom the banks do not cater.  This movement should be congratulated for the difference it has made to the lives of a large number of people.</P>
      <P>There is little work to be done on this legislation.  I also got a telephone call this morning from the Irish League of Credit Unions to say it was happy with the way the Minister responded to its concerns and that it hoped the Bill would be enacted as soon as possible.  I operate on the principle that if something is not broken, it should not be fixed and if something has been fixed, it should not be rebroken.  We should enact this legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main changes relate to the limits on the amount of a loan a credit union may give.  The inclusion of a percentage is important because there are big and small credit unions.  This allows big credit unions to lend larger amounts of money <Col N="60" /> than smaller ones.  These amounts must be related to the assets of the credit union.  I also agree with what has been said about changes in regulation. No credit union objects to regulation or to the role of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  Self-regulation is already built into the system, so the State and the registrar must supervise and regulate its activities.  However, they must not become involved in the day to day management of credit unions.  The registrar must be free to intervene whenever necessary to ensure everything is organised properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister consulted widely and he has satisfied those who raised concerns about this Bill.  It will allow credit unions to give additional services to the people, which is right, given the way they spend their money.  In the past people kept their wages in their pockets until they needed to use them.  However, our financial affairs are a little more complicated so it is important for credit unions to increase their services.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the credit union's involvement in the money advice and budgeting service.  The Minister for Social Welfare said in Ennis it was his intention to allow social welfare payments to be paid directly to a credit union account as soon as the necessary amended legislation is put in place.  That will probably facilitate the interaction between the money advice service and credit unions.  I know from dealing with individuals who have problems handling their household budgets that the credit union helps them to control their limited income.  It also means that people who have difficulty paying their bills will be able to sort out their financial affairs.  It is not easy for anyone on a limited income to pay bills but at least this service gives them support.  Credit unions should be congratulated for the role they have played.</P>
    <P>The detail in sections 4, 5 and 6 is important. It copperfastens the way credit unions operate, particularly in relation to the tradition of one member one vote, in relation to confidentiality and ensuring that someone does not participate in a decision in which they have an interest.  It is important that this is enshrined in legislation so there is no doubt about the way the system operates.</P>
    <P>I join with those who congratulated the Minister for introducing this legislation and responding to the concerns expressed by the Irish League of Credit Unions, individual credit unions and by Members of the Dáil and Seanad.  I hope the legislation is enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I can congratulate the Minister but he must be commended for the way he has dealt with this legislation and the degree to which he has taken on board the legitimate concerns and fears of the Irish League of Credit Unions and the movement in general.  The movement has been looking for this Bill for the past ten years or more.  The need for the legislation was self-evident in view of the huge growth in the movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> I will not catalogue the figures and facts put before this House and the other House about the growth of the credit union movement, the number of its members and the size of its savings except to say they and the degree to which the movement has flourished since it was founded are impressive.  The credit union movement, more than any other movement in Irish society, highlights the degree to which self-help can transform society and the degree to which a genuine commitment to local co-operation, community care and self-help can mobilise something into a major national achievement and job creation exercise.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise the huge voluntary contribution by people who serve the credit union which allows it to be more flexible and better than the Associated Banks.  It is important that the distinction between the credit union movement and the Associated Banks continues and that, within the distinct ethos enjoyed by the credit union movement, it is able to offer and expand its services and increase the range of options available to its members and in certain circumstances to compete with the banks.  The point was made by many speakers that people on whom the banks cast a cold eye have found a home in the credit union and have been well looked after. Indeed, I can recall instances where businesses have been able to succeed as a result of support from the credit union when the banks would not have anything to do with them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes the Minister has made to the Bill but there are a few improvements which could still be made.  In fact, I would have gone even farther than the credit union movement in terms of some of the limits which have been increased and improved in the Bill, but I welcome the changes in broad terms.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Bill is enacted quickly before the election but none of us knows when that will occur.  I know that the Minister's Labour Party colleague had some views on that matter but I am sure the Democratic Left, being a distinct party in Government, might not yet have formed an opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Sherlock for his assistance in this matter.  I am sure he will let me know when the day comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill which was published before Christmas was deeply flawed and it has been improved.  The lobbying involved was one of the most successful exercises undertaken by a national movement of any size.  It was responsible and clear.  It is important in a democracy that that type of activity should take place.  I know it can be tedious for Ministers and officials but it is important and the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Many of the reasonable requests made by the league have been incorporated in the improved Bill and much of what was adopted at the special <Col N="62" /> general meeting in Limerick was incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The most significant improvements are the limits on the savings and loans and the recognition of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  Other issues have been cleared up also and there is the area of new services.  I still take the view that something could be done with regard to the registrar and the regulation of the movement.</P>
    <P>The system must take into account the huge diversity within the movements, the fact that there are small and large credit unions.  To introduce new figures rather than the national ones which have been well rehearsed, the credit union in my town, Newbridge, County Kildare, has £15 million in assets and 13,000 members and it has grown by 40 per cent within the space of a few years.  Such growth would be regarded as a huge success in any commercial operation.  In County Kildare, there are 52,000 credit union members and £54 million in savings.  Depending on the which figures one reads, there are 1.6 or 1.8 million credit union members in Ireland so it is one of the most important national movements.</P>
    <P>It is worth stating the vision of the credit union movement which I was given recently: credit unions will satisfy the social and economic needs of their members with dignity and integrity by offering, in the co-operative manner and on a not for profit basis, full financial services for everybody in the community who wishes to join.  That summarises well their ethos and underlines why the legislation should be flexible and take their views into account.  It is important that the Bill is enacted quickly and that the credit unions are allow do the things they wish.</P>
    <P>The question of self-help is hugely important. My party leader has been criticised for saying that the Progressive Democrats want to help people who want to help themselves and if any movement underlined that philosophy, it is the credit union movement.  That has been its history.  The people achieved remarkable things on a co-operative basis and I would underline the voluntary effort involved.</P>
    <P>A magnificent new 10,000 square foot credit union building was opened in Newbridge last September and we are very proud of it.  If an individual credit union is of a scale that it wants to provide an ATM on the side of its buildings, that should be a matter of the board of the local union.  In such matters, which I would regard as domestic management, neither the Registrar of Friendly Societies nor anybody else should intrude to an unwarranted degree, and that relates to additional services and the provisions in the Bill with regard to how such matters are to be handled.</P>
    <P>There is the question of non-qualifying members under section 17(4) and we may look at that on Committee Stage or on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The movement is relieved at the degree to which the Bill has been improved.  One of the things which needs to be stressed &mdash; and I suspect it has been &mdash; is the low level of bad debt or <Col N="63" /> defaulting loans in credit unions.  It is curious that in circumstances in which one might expect a larger rate of default than in the associated banks, the reverse is true.  That says something about the ethos of the movement and the way it has been managed.  It probably has something to do with deriving from, and being part of, the community and accepting obligations to the community through the movement which have not always been evident in the associated banks.  There is also the point, which has been well made, that some private individuals who handle large sums of money have left their clients high and dry and that the credit union movement has been a model of how things should be done.</P>
    <P>The main thing is that the legislation should be flexible, the movement should be able to continue to grow and flourish, it should be able, within the regulations to offer a full range of services and the necessary prudential discretion should be available to them on big and small loans.  I could speak at length on this Bill but I would just be repeating what has been said in the Dáil or by other speakers here.  I endorse the points made by most of the speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a good Bill as a result of the considerable dialogue between the Minister and the people responsible directly for delivering the service in credit unions. That is a good thing because the legislation must reflect the views and aspirations of the people who deliver the service.  They know best.  I commend the Minister for giving such consideration which has resulted in an acceptable Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a modernising Government and the Credit Union Bill is modernising legislation.  The last legislation governing credit unions was passed in 1966 when the financial landscape looked very different from today.  It is hard to imagine that, with the growth of the credit unions over the years, it took so long to introduce legislation.  In the interim, technology has galloped ahead.  ATMs have become commonplace, as have paperless transactions, and the financial services market have been globalised.</P>
      <P>There has long been an urgent need for updated legislation to facilitate credit unions and strengthen their social role.  The Bill seeks to level the financial playing field while retaining the unique ethos of credit unions.  It provides that members of credit unions will have access to a similar range of services available to customers of other financial institutions, while updating the regulatory framework governing credit unions. At the same time, the Bill ensures that a local credit union will not simply become another bank or building society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Credit Union Bill will help facilitate diversity.  Credit unions are, quite literally, the people's banks.  For many households they are the main financial institution used and they provide a lifeline in circumstances where people might otherwise <Col N="64" /> have to have recourse to predatory moneylenders.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left has consistently highlighted the plight of families trapped by money lending. In Government, we have promoted practical measures to deal with this issue, ranging from the Consumer Credit Act to this legislation and to the massive expansion of the monetary advice and budgeting service which falls under the remit of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  In addition, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill contains a section with stiff sanctions aimed at aggressive and intimidating debt collection.  It is extraordinary how commonplace this problem has become and it must be tackled.  However, I am sure the credit union movement will attract people by making it easy for them to save money.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the inclusion of the term &ldquo;in accordance with the registered rules&rdquo; in section 32(3)(b) does not increase the flexibility of the section and that decisions on withdrawing shares when an outstanding liability exists should be delegated to credit committees which are better equipped to make judgments, given that they issue loans in the first instance.  People must be encouraged at all times to continue to save money.</P>
    <P>I seek clarification in respect of section 51.  Reference was made to the Minister for Social Welfare's statement on 4 April when he said:</P>
    <P>It is intended to make it possible to pay social welfare payments directly to a credit union account as soon as the necessary amended legislation has been put in place.  The possibility of a user friendly bill payment system through the credit union can then be considered.</P>
    <P>Section 51 contains no reference to this matter &mdash; the Minister of State referred to it during his contribution &mdash; and I am not aware that it is dealt with in any other section.  I do not know whether section 51 was amended in this regard but, if it has, I stand corrected.</P>
    <P>My final point is a minor one and concerns changes of address.  I am informed that this provision might not apply in rural areas as much as it will in urban areas where people retain links with the locality in which they grew up.  These are not contentious matters but they may require consideration before the Bill is eventually enacted.</P>

      <P>Chuirim fáilte roimh an mBille and roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach.  I welcome the Minister of State who will soon be taking a holiday on the Dingle peninsula.  The House is scheduled to take Second Stage of the Bill today and a request was made that we should deal with all Stages.  As party Whip, I consulted the Fianna Fáil Members who stated that it would be better if Committee Stage were taken at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday as planned.  The credit unions are anxious to see the Bill enacted and the Opposition <Col N="65" /> will not delay its progress.  The Minister will receive every co-operation from this side of the House to that end.</P>
      <P>Like most Members who contributed to this debate, members of my family and I belong to our local credit union.  As I stated on a previous occasion, the credit union in Dingle was only established within the past four to five years but it has been very successful.</P>
      <P>There are major differences between credit unions and banks.  With credit unions one is doing one's business with people involved in the local community who know families and are aware of their problems.  Banks differ from credit unions in respect of their consideration of requests for small loans and they issue blanket refusals without being aware of the full circumstances. However, it is possible that those operating credit unions are involved in other local voluntary organisations and know the familial circumstances of people seeking loans.  Credit unions are important because they help to drive moneylenders off the streets.  Properly run credit unions cater for people's needs in a very personal manner.</P>
      <P>I welcome a number of important changes incorporated in the Bill.  For example, people under 16 years of age will now be allowed to open savings accounts in credit unions.  I recently spoke to a woman who stated she was embarrassed by a bank's refusal to open an account for her son until she obtained proper identification.  She tried to explain to the bank officials that the boy in question was her son and everything was above board but many obstacles were placed in her path.</P>
      <P>Young people should be encouraged from an early age to save money and respect its value.  In Greece and Crete, people open bank accounts for their children soon after they are born.  Any money children receive on birthdays or other special occasions is deposited in their bank accounts for use in later life.  Young people should always be encouraged to save money and the credit union is the obvious place for them to do so.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to ATM machines and, if it is permitted under the provisions of the Bill, I have no objection to credit unions putting these in place.  I am aware of many people who had to go to the credit unions to borrow money to cover their credit card debts.  It is easy to be issued with a credit card and because high credit limits are readily granted it is easy to overspend.  People often have to borrow elsewhere to cover the debts incurred.  I would be wary of credit unions providing credit card or ATM card facilities. They must be strict about the withdrawal or credit limits involved.  Over the years the credit unions have solved the problems of many people who have overspent with credit cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine most credit union loans are short-term and do not involved very large sums of money.  They provide a useful means to help people in trouble.  Many people experience financial problems related to different events, such as first communions, confirmations or weddings and they need money to help tide them over in the <Col N="66" /> short-term.  The credit union is the obvious place to go because, especially in rural areas, the people working in the credit union would be familiar with the members.  As I said, those working in the credit union are often involved in other local voluntary organisations and are aware of the needs of families.  They tend to be fairly flexible in their approach.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see credit unions operating in the same way as the banks or building societies. I would prefer to see the credit unions continue to operate as they do at present with the improvements which they have sought.  The Minister of State has gone a long way to respond to the changes required by the credit unions.  Perhaps it is because I am my party's Whip, but I have received many letters in relation to this Bill which have indicated to me the worthiness of the credit unions and the respect in which they are held.</P>
    <P>We will not delay the Bill unduly.  We will examine it between now and Committee Stage and we may have amendments to propose at that time.  If we receive representations from the credit unions we will do our utmost to facilitate them.  The Bill is comprehensive and requires examination.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the compliments paid to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  They are well deserved because, in keeping with his attitude to other legislation he has brought before the House, he has indicated a willingness to listen to constructive criticism aimed at improving the legislation.  His willingness to listen to points of view is recognised on all sides.  There have been many representations on a limited number of proposals in the Bill.  However, it is a comprehensive Bill which comprises 189 sections and five Schedules.  It is not often that Bills of such size come before us.  From the outset the greater part of the Bill was recognised as necessary.</P>
      <P>I join in praising the contribution the credit union movement has made to the wellbeing of many people.  It is a substantial movement, with about 1.5 million members.  From its inception it has focused on providing credit facilities for many people, some of whom are in the low income bracket and who would not find other financial institutions as willing to meet their requirements. It has created among its members an important instinct for saving.  In his usual common sense way, Senator Fitzgerald gave us the example of the difficulties which confronted a mother and her son when trying to open an account in a bank. He also pointed out that the service provided by a credit union is a local service based on local knowledge of the clients in the community.  This is part of the valuable contribution which credit unions make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received many representations on this Bill from the credit union movement.  It was pointed out that the credit union carried out an effective lobby on this Bill, as was its entitlement. However, many of its concerns were based on misunderstandings.  I attended a meeting recently in County Clare at which over 200 members of the credit union movement were present.  Distinct from other lobby group meetings which one is <Col N="67" /> called upon to attend &mdash; I often have reservations about the wording of the summonses one receives &mdash; the credit union members did not come to the meeting to harangue the public representatives but to express their concerns.</P>
    <P>We engaged in a positive and constructive discussion and there was evident willingness on their part to accept our reassurances on certain points.  When we thought we could only give them a conditional reassurance before checking it out further, they were willing to accept that.  I compliment the people who attended that meeting on the constructive manner in which they presented their concerns and accepted our willingness to pursue the questions they raised.</P>
    <P>This morning I discussed the Bill with the people who attended that meeting.  They said the Bill as passed by the Dáil addressed the fundamental points they had made.  It was a positive measure and they were happy with it.  The Minister of State will be happy to hear that they also expressed their admiration of him.  Any Minister would welcome such admiration because it is not always the case.  They believe the legislation will allow the credit union movement to expand and develop its services.  That is an amazingly positive reception from an organisation that had substantial concerns only weeks ago.  As a result, it is a pleasure to welcome and support the Bill in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis made a point that merits consideration.  The credit union movement provides a financial service to people on low incomes.  The level of default by members of the movement, in comparison with the level in the wider financial services sector, is amazingly low.  I agree with the Senator that one of the principal factors contributing to the low level of default is the ethos which underlies the credit union movement and the spirit of co-operation it engenders among its members.  The low level of default is a vindication of the service it provides for people, many of whom would not receive such a service from other financial institutions.  It is a credit to the movement and to the people who work in it.</P>
    <P>The ceiling on shares and loans, which was a matter of concern, has been dealt with to the satisfaction of the movement.  The movement was also concerned about the powers conferred on the registrar under the Bill.  Some of that concern was based largely on misunderstandings and the Minister of State has moved to eliminate or meet the movement's fears.  This morning I was told that it was one of the fundamental points which had been addressed to the movement's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The movement also had a problem with regard to the disposal of property.  The Minister of State has addressed that in section 41 and the movement is happy with his response.  He has also gone further in extending recognition to the Irish League of Credit Unions and in acknowledging its expertise in the important areas in which it operates.  The new section 181 accommodates that recognition.  The movement was concerned about penalties and offences.  The Minister of <Col N="68" /> State has extended the circumstances in which these would arise and these changes are acceptable to the movement.</P>
    <P>No critical voice has been heard about this Bill in the House today.  Senator Fitzgerald pointed out that the concluding Stages are ordered for next week.  Otherwise, I doubt that anybody would have criticised the House for passing all Stages today.  However, we are not at liberty to change the Order of Business, much as I would like to dispose of the Bill since there is no indication that further amendments will be proposed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister of State for meeting the concerns of the credit union movement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate on this important legislation.  The tone of their contributions and their gracious remarks are appreciated.  It was clear they had held many discussions with representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions and that they had personal knowledge of the operation of credit unions in their local communities.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with Senator Roche's analysis of the role of credit unions.  However, he reopened the question of the limits imposed in the Bill.  He described them as an inflexible and unnecessary restraint.  This is an important point which has been debated both inside and outside the Oireachtas <i>ad nauseam.</i>  Senator Roche appeared to suggest that there ought not to be ceilings on either savings or loans.  That is not consistent with his argument that it is important to protect the ethos of the credit union movement.  If there are no limits or ceilings, there is a temptation to pursue commercial lending and to enter the business of house loans and mortgages. Once that is done, some if not all credit unions will become what building societies were not so long ago.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan referred to other considerations, such as the fact that credit unions enjoy a different tax regime from conventional financial institutions.  It is right that they do because they are non-profit making organisations.  As Senator Dardis said, they are self help, mutual organisations working for the local community on the basis of its savings.  It is proper they are exempt, for example, from corporation tax, and that differentiation is important.  If Senator Roche's argument were carried to its logical conclusion and loans were allowed to be made available as if the movement were a conventional financial institution, great pressure would be brought to bear on the Minister and it would be very difficult to resist demands that the movement be treated similarly in other respects, including taxation. That would have the effect of transforming it into another limb of the conventional financial services sector and it would no longer be different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main focus of credit unions has been meeting the personal financial needs of their members. Senator Fitzgerald described it as people who get into trouble and need to be bailed out in the short-term, or people who need finance for the <Col N="69" /> purchase of a car or something similar.  That is the main area and the new limits enable a credit union to respond to the argument made in the other House about a person in a local authority dwelling who avails of the tenant purchase scheme being able to raise finance from a credit union where a building society or a bank may not be so forthcoming.  It is an exceptional case but it is right it be provided for.</P>
    <P>The figures are illuminating.  Averages do not necessarily prove anything but the average figures, largely agreed between the league and the registrar, suggest the average deposit is about £100, the average shareholding is £1,000 and the average loan £2,000.  There are exceptions to that, but not to the extent Senator Roche suggested. Some 0.04 per cent of the membership have loans in excess of £30,000.  The situation should not be exaggerated.  It is right we should acknowledge the primacy of the bona fide credit union member where his or her investment tends to be in shares rather than in deposits.  The aggregate formula we have devised in terms of investments of £50,000 or 1.5 per cent of assets is about right.  That argument is generally accepted at this stage.</P>
    <P>Some Senators, such as Senator Taylor-Quinn, acknowledge that if the movement were to go full-bloodedly into the corporate sector in terms of commercial loans, etc., credit unions would not be what they are.  Explicit provision is made in the legislation to allow credit unions to devote some of their resources to community development objectives, be it small enterprise, community enterprise, etc.  Positive encouragement to do that exists.  We should not get confused.  Up until now, credit unions have been able to give loans to micro-enterprises under one guise or another.  There is a world of difference between that and being able to give loans to some of the major companies which Senator Ross reports on so elegantly and eloquently and in such a balanced manner every Sunday.</P>

      <P>As Senator Howard said, self-regulation is probably the other major topic which has emerged in the debate so far.  I thought Senator Roche favoured self-regulation.  I am of the same mind as Senator Lanigan that there is an argument for self-regulation because it is important with any organisation dealing with substantial amounts of members' funds that we are happy with the regulatory regime which applies, especially with regard to occasional developments in other areas of the financial services sector.  The credit union movement may say this does not relate to it and that it is different.  That is true. However, there has been substantial deification of and gracious remarks about me, about which I am very pleased, and similarly about credit unions and their members.  It would make us believe there are 1.4 million saints in the movement.  I am more sceptical than that and, notwithstanding the best efforts at self-regulation and at leadership in the credit union movement, it is prudent to provide for regulation, and the registrar is a suitable mechanism to prudentially provide <Col N="70" /> for the supervision of members' funds.  The current occupant of the office has immense experience in the area and has acquired considerable knowledge.  He has had a major formative influence on the construction of the Bill and has a good relationship with credit unions.  This augurs well for the future and the continued growth of the movement.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan raised the efficacy of examinership and the appropriateness of the provisions in the Bill.  I do not argue with him that some professionals attending on examinership are paid too much as that is manifestly the case.  Professionals are generally paid too much.  However, it does not mean examinership has failed.  The Senator asked for my opinion, which is that examinership, by and large, has worked well.  It has staved off creditors for a valuable period to allow a certain number of companies to get their act together, show that they had a future and gave them a respite.  That has been valuable.</P>
      <P>These sections seek to import into the Bill some of the recommendations of the report from the Company Law Review Group &mdash; for example, to apply the test of a reasonable prospect of survival for the enterprise or credit union concerned. That is a reasonable test.  It is proper that the enterprise concerned should have a reasonable prospect of survival.  Once that is the case, examinership is a useful instrument and can be beneficial to companies who have encountered temporary difficulties or difficulties for exceptional reasons.  The same could be the case in the credit union movement.  I am not sure how relevant the measure is in the case of credit unions.  I tend to believe that the registrar would have noticed the alarm bells before that stage.</P>
      <P>Members of the Opposition are expecting a general election.  I see no reason why we should have an election, given the performance of the Government and the economy.  If they insist on believing that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point was raised about the High Court being the point of appeal.  We had this debate in the other House and my advice from the Attorney General's office was that, in certain types of decisions of which the registrar is seized, he is sitting in a quasi-judicial role and has the status of a District Court.  Therefore, the appeal line from the District Court is to the High Court.  That is not the case in other administrative situations where the decision of the registrar can be appealed to the District Court.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock raised the issue of social welfare payments being lodged to credit union accounts.  Discussions have been taking place between the Department of Social Welfare and the Irish League of Credit Unions on this point. I do not know where these discussions stand.  I can assure the Senator that there is nothing in sections 48 to 52 to impede such payments.  The matter raised is more appropriate for Social Welfare legislation.  I imagine that that is the thrust of the discussions taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> Senator Sherlock also raised the term &ldquo;non-qualifying members&rdquo; used in section 36.  Loans to non-qualifying members which do not exceed the value of savings can be dealt with by the credit committee or credit officer under section 36(5). As a result of the additional risk factor for loans above the amount of savings of such members, the board of directors will decide.  Their decision will be informed by the views of the credit committee.</P>
    <P>The common bond in credit unions is a key distinguishing feature relative to banks and building societies.  If members both inside and outside the common bond are treated equally, the banks will be able to claim that credit unions are no longer a special case and will push for a level playing field in areas such as taxation.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock also raised section 32, which deals with withdrawals.  My advice went against linking loans in section 35 and withdrawals in section 32.  I see no difficulty in the board of directors getting the credit committee's advice before making its decision.  Unless a loan is above the 4:1 standard ratio, any member continuing to save will be able to withdraw his savings.  This is important in respect of Senator Roche reopening the issue of the caps.  No one mentioned the fact that the legislation allows the Minister to raise the ceilings by order if they are considered inadequate.  In this case the registrar has the power to change the 25 per cent figure to which Senator Sherlock referred.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the mainstream of members' transactions.  It also provides for the exceptional event.  For example, where someone receives accident damages which they wish to deposit in a credit union or where members who are co-workers wish to purchase a house in the Dingle peninsula.  That is a long-term objective of my own.</P>
    <P>The registrar has a certain discretion and the Minister has the power to make orders to raise the ceilings.  I cannot accept the argument that this Bill is overly restrictive.  It provides for the inevitable continued growth of the credit union movement.  The movement is one of the outstanding successes of modern Irish life and the co-operative sector.  It will continue to grow.  The Bill provides a framework in which the movement can offer a new and enhanced range of services.  It will allow the movement to avail of new technology and it places the emphasis on service to the customer in a non-profit making organisation. There is no doubt but that the movement will continue to grow and prosper.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their considered contributions.  It would have been even more helpful if we had been able to take all Stages today.  It is right that the league is being accurately reflected in terms of its wish that the Bill be finalised in advance of its annual conference scheduled for 25 and 26 April.  That has no bearing on any other dates or events people may anticipate.  Any other events pale into insignificance by comparison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I know he will thank me for patience in waiting for him.  The matter I am raising is a sorry tale about the Minister for Education failing to fulfil a contract to the Dublin School of English to ensure the payment of over £36,000.  The Minister will dispute this, but there is an underlying problem with matters of this sort &mdash; that small businesses such as the Dublin School of English cannot afford to be bullied by large Departments such as the Department of Education.  This bill is undoubtedly in dispute, but the delay in resolving it is unforgivable.  The problem dates back to last summer.  There have been exchanges of letters. Sometimes it has taken up to three months for the Department to even reply to letters written in good faith by people who are owed as much as £36,000.</P>
      <P>I cannot emphasis more strongly to the Minister that a bill of this sort is a large amount of money to a reasonably small business and badly affects its cashflow.  The least which can be expected is prompt replies and responses to questions.  If there are objections and queries about the Bill, they should be put up front straight away.</P>
      <P>In this case the school is out of money since last summer and the dispute appears to be that the Department is implying that the school of English, which taught English to a group of Bosnian refugees last summer, did not supply it with full enough attendance records.  As a result, the Department is delaying the payment of this bill. This seems to be the kernel of the dispute.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, in the middle of this problem stands the Refugee Agency.  The agency, which has been in touch with both parties, refers every query made to it by the Dublin School of English to the Department of Education, who in most cases refuses to reply.  Much of this is a brick wall situation, with delays of months.  The school of English has now sent bill after bill to the Department and is now charging interest which will eventually cost public money if it is agreed and settled.  However, the delay has continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute, which I am led to believe is about the attendance record, is not fair to the Dublin School of English because the Refugee Agency was fully aware of the attendance records at all <Col N="73" /> times.  Reports of the attendance record were sent to the agency at all times.  There is an attempt to blame the Dublin School of English for some sort of incompetence, of which it is not guilty.  The Refugee Agency received reports of attendance and course progress reports.  One group of children who were taught English in July and August, 1996, were based in Cappagh, and a bill of £10,000 for that has remained unpaid.</P>
    <P>I do not understand that, even if the Department of Education has a case to make, which I do not believe reading the facts, why has it not paid part of the bill and said it does not know how many people attended these courses?  Why did they not pay some of it, leave the matter in dispute and resolve it through an arbitrator or some other way?  It is unfair to put up a big brick wall.  Invoices have been sent to the Department at all times.  The Department has implied the school is charging incorrectly, which is completely unfair.  The Refugee Agency has been kept informed and there is a case for the Department to answer.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister puts the boot into his civil servants who are in charge of this matter and ask them why this delay has taken place.  They should get on with it, send the Dublin School of English a cheque for amounts not in dispute and resolve the issue of attendance records immediately.</P>

      <P>On 16 April, 1991, the Government decided that special services for English language training should be made available to all refugees who require it for a period of at least one year, within two years of their arrival in Ireland.  Overall responsibility for the day to day care of the refugees was assigned to the Refugee Agency.  My Department has, through three public tendering processes, invited applications from EFL &mdash; English as a Foreign Language &mdash; agencies to provide English language tuition for refugees in order to fulfil its obligations arising from this decision.</P>
      <P>The Dublin School of English was one of the agencies selected for contract following the 1993 and 1995 public tendering processes.  The costs associated with the provision of these classes are met by my Department following the submission of claims by the agencies concerned.  The agencies also meet the pupil transport costs on public transport and are reimbursed subsequently by the Department following receipt of the invoice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Refugee Agency keeps the adequacy and efficiency of the service provided by agencies under constant review.  This includes examination of individual reports at the end of each period of instruction.  In October 1996, following consultations with the Refugee Agency, a number of issues were identified relating to the operation of the contract by the Dublin School of English which gave my Department cause for concern. Following preliminary consideration of the issues raised the school was advised by a letter dated 18 December that a number of matters relating to amounts invoiced to the Department required detailed examination before outstanding invoices <Col N="74" /> could be authorised for payment or a new contract awarded.</P>
    <P>On 19 March a comprehensive letter was issued to the school outlining the points at issue in order that the Department could further progress its examination.  The school responded in a letter dated 21 March 1997.  This letter is being considered by my Department in conjunction with the Refugee Agency.  Consideration of the case is at an advanced stage and until the Department has concluded this consideration it is not proposed to make any further payments to the Dublin School of English.  In assuring the Senator that the Department will endeavour to bring this issue to a conclusion as a matter of urgency I wish to place on record the need for the Department to satisfy itself that public moneys are properly expended and accounted for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of second level educational facilities in Portlaoise on the Adjournment.  It is an urgent matter and I wish to voice my concern over present provisions.  As the Minister is aware, Portlaoise is a growing town with an expanding population and there is a demand among parents, pupils and teachers for improved educational facilities.</P>
      <P>A decision was taken in 1981 to proceed with building a new vocational school in Portlaoise on a ten acre site purchased for this purpose.  Planning work proceeded and working drawings were prepared by Laois vocational education committee and lodged with the Department of Education.  Building of the school was ready to go to tender in 1987.  Similarly, a new Christian Brother's school was sanctioned in 1985 and it was also planned to upgrade and modernise the Presentation Convent.  These are three excellent schools.</P>
      <P>The then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, imposed a solution on Portlaoise amalgamating the three schools into one.  This solution did not receive public acceptance.  Pupils, teachers and parents disagreed with this approach.  Deputy O'Rourke's failed initiative for an amalgamated school must now be rejected by the Department.  There are three thriving schools in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proper way forward is the development of the three schools in Portlaoise with substantial <Col N="75" /> investment in each of them to facilitate either substantial addition and refurbishment or, if necessary, the building of new schools.  This latter course is necessary in the case of the vocational school.  The original vocational school was the old technical school built in 1907 and extended in 1914.  Part of the Christian Brother's school dates back to 1860.</P>
    <P>Parents, pupils and teachers are confused and concerned over what is happening.  Pupils in Portlaoise are entitled to the same educational facilities as every other pupil in Ireland.  I appreciate that the Minister is busy, but I ask him to visit the schools in Portlaoise to see at first hand the inadequate facilities under which pupils and teachers work.  There is a lack of recreational and canteen facilities and the situation regarding other facilities is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>There are three great schools in Portlaoise but they need urgent attention and a sizeable injection of capital.  The vocational school has in excess of 300 pupils with a further 500 attending night courses.  Approximately 430 pupils are attending the Christian Brother's and in excess of 500 attend the Presentation Convent.  A number of pupils are being bussed from Portlaoise to different schools.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister not to be bound by past decisions which have been rejected by the people.  I represent the constituency of Laois-Offaly and I have visited all towns in that constituency.  The school facilities in Portlaoise are not of the same standard as those in other towns in the constituency.  Parents, pupils and others have been very patient.  We are facing an election and I hope the present Minister is returned to that post.  Irrespective of who is in Government &mdash; and I hope the present Minister is returned to office as he will listen to what I am saying &mdash; I hope everything is done to ensure that the facilities urgently required in Portlaoise are provided. If the Minister visited the town he would accept the merit of what I am saying.</P>
    <P>There has been no movement on this issue for ten years.  In that time there have been some minor improvements but there is a lack of capital investment which must be rectified at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Enright for raising this important issue.  I would like to outline the situation relating to accommodation in the post-primary schools in Portlaoise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three post-primary schools in the centre &mdash; the Presentation Convent, St. Mary's Christian Brothers' school and the vocational school.  The Department has received applications for additional permanent and temporary <Col N="76" /> accommodation at the Christian Brothers' school. These applications are being processed at present and the Department will be in contact with the school authorities as soon as a decision has been made.  Similarly, an application has been made by County Laois vocational education committee for additional accommodation at Portlaoise vocational school.  The vocational education committee will be contacted about this as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>An application has also been received from the Christian Brothers' school for funding to eradicate an outbreak of dry rot at the school.  This is a recurrence of a problem which arose in 1990 towards the resolution of which the Department provided funding.  So as to ensure that the problem is dealt with comprehensively, a consultant's report has been obtained and is being examined by the Department's technical staff.  The school will be contacted as soon as a decision has been made on the extent of the work to be carried out and on the question of funding.</P>
    <P>As is usual in a multi-school centre such as Portlaoise, where the question of significant capital investment arises, the Department will also need to examine the organisation of existing educational provision in the town.  This is necessary in order to maximise future educational opportunities for children of post-primary age in the centre and to ensure that capital is invested in the best possible manner.</P>
    <P>The Department will be in contact with the management of the post-primary schools shortly, to discuss these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says the Department of Education will need to examine the organisation of existing educational provision in the town, does he mean it is intended to maintain and retain the three schools, as I am advocating, in the town?  Would the Minister or his departmental officials have an opportunity to visit the town and meet the principals of the three schools?  I recommend that a major change in policy be adopted with regard to the schools in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make the Senator's views known to the Department and the Minister and I will ask her to take the appropriate action.  The Department is examining the organisation of existing educational provision in the town and any future arrangements which must be made in order to provide an adequate programme of second level education in the town and the surrounding areas.</P>
