      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, in light of the identification by the media of the nine Liberian refugees who were allowed ashore on Tuesday, 25 February 1997, to ensure all personnel working in the media in Ireland will not repeat such a life threatening exercise.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to immediately sign the necessary Commencement Order for the Control of Horses Act, 1996; complete and publish the regulations in regard to the identification of horses; provide the necessary funding for local authorities to implement these measures and finalise agreement on the provision of funding to support the proposed equine centre for Cherry Orchard, Dublin 10, and remove the barriers to the commencement of this project.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction and provide the necessary funds for the construction of a new national school at Clontuskert, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Mullooly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide immediate sanction for the board of management of Lanesboro community college, Lanesboro, County Longford, to advertise the proposed school extension for tender so that work on the project can commence in early summer 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the new school project for Gaelscoil Mhichil Ciosog, Ennis, County Clare.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her contract with the Dublin School of English and ensure payment of the £36,362 outstanding.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senator O'Toole and Senator McGennis and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2, 3 and 31, motion 24.  Item 1 will be taken without debate and item 2 will be taken after item 1 until 1.30 p.m. with 20 minutes per speaker.  Members may share time if they wish and the Minister will conclude not later than 1.15 p.m.  Item 3 will be taken from 2.30 p.m. until 6 p.m. and this will be followed by Private Members' time from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Item 3 will resume at 8 p.m. until 10 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been a positive trend in recent weeks.  Last week the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, announced a policy in relation to waste.  I thank the Leader for furnishing a list of the legislative programme until Easter.  We look forward to the Litter Bill which will soon be debated in the House.  However, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, recently asked the four local authorities in Dublin to introduce and implement a waste policy before November. It is strange that the Minister asked the four local authorities to introduce independent advice on a waste policy for Dublin and for the Minister of State to announce an incinerator in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I identify with Senator Wright's sense of bemusement about the Government's <Col N="495" /> strategy of accepting Private Members' motions. It is laudable and it is fooling me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader raise with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment the recent statement by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises body which described up to 50 per cent of unemployed people as social misfits?  That is irresponsible and extraordinarily degrading and insulting to a group of people who find themselves without work.  I do not suggest that 100 per cent of people in any category are perfect but one could find as many social misfits among employers as anywhere else.</P>
      <P>It should be anathema and unacceptable to every public representative to describe up to 50 per cent of people who work in a tyre company in Ballyfermot or a clothing company in the west who suddenly find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own as social misfits.  I want the House to make that position clear.  I am not requesting statements on this issue at this point because I want to hear if the Minister will respond.  However, the House has a duty to preserve the dignity of people who find themselves unemployed.  Social misfits, whether they are employed or unemployed, need to be dealt with but it is unacceptable to dismiss people in such a demeaning way just because they are unemployed. The Minister should ask ISME to withdraw such an insulting statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments. It is important to debate economic and monetary union following the Taoiseach's statement last night in Brussels regarding an unequivocal commitment to European Monetary Union and the single currency.  Item 20 on the Order Paper is statements on economic and monetary union.  There was a previous discussion but there must be a meaningful debate on this issue. Reservations have been expressed about what will happen if Britain remains outside and Ireland joins.  This would have major implications because Britain is our largest trading partner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended a conference at which the Taoiseach stated that the debate on this issue had concluded. I must inform him that it has not even begun in earnest because this matter is extremely important and will have profound implications for Ireland.  I agree with the Taoiseach that there is a certain political imperative and desirability in joining EMU.  However, we must address the economic consequences of doing so and we cannot <Col N="496" /> divorce the political reality from its economic counterpart.  It is time there was a meaningful debate on this matter to tease out the issues in detail.</P>
    <P>When is it intended to resume Second Stage of the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Never.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Daly for that information and I am glad someone is prepared to answer questions addressed to the Leader.  Last week Senator Enright was very helpful in answering questions and Senator Daly is doing likewise today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the statements on sport conclude this afternoon or will the debate be adjourned?  It may be difficult to include all speakers before the Minister of State replies at 1.15 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also intended to raise the matter to which Senator O'Toole referred but not in any combative sense.  ISME made a rather silly statement which has now been withdrawn but its spokesperson got himself deeper into the mire when asked to categorise &ldquo;misfits&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>He stated they were people with &ldquo;mental problems&rdquo; who, in normal society, were called &ldquo;patients&rdquo;.  ISME needs to consider the problem of unemployment and the need to seek work in a sensible and sane way and not make stupid statements about people's ability to find employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the issue of European Monetary Union to which Senator Dardis referred, I express concern at the tone and manner of comments made yesterday by the EU Regional Affairs Commissioner, Monika Wulf-Mathies. She seemed to imply that EU structural and cohesion funding would end in approximately two and a half years time.  This is a very serious matter and the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach should appear before the House to provide reassurance that we will not give up the fight for structural funding.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware that there are large parts of the country, urban and rural, where poverty remains a reality.  Would he agree that Ms Wulf-Mathies' comment about &ldquo;manna from heaven&rdquo; was condescending?  Would he also agree that any entitlement this country has to EU funding is a matter of contract and entitlement arising from the Maastricht Treaty?  Will the Leader consider inviting a senior Minister to appear before the House to clarify the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments of Senator O'Toole and others regarding the ISME statement which was subsequently withdrawn on this morning's &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;.  It is extraordinary that a body such as ISME could use the term &ldquo;social misfits&rdquo; to classify a large sector of the population.  Apart from the use of language, however, there is an underlying acceptance on ISME's part that a large section of those out of work are unemployable.  This is a cause for concern and representatives of trade unions and the unemployed would not accept that such a large sector of the population could be deemed to be unemployable.  That puts a slant on employment policy and it is extraordinary that a body such as ISME issued that statement.</P>
      <P>We should aim to provide employment and train people, as a matter of policy, to reach a level of skill which would facilitate their obtaining employment.  I would be disturbed if I thought a body such as ISME, which represents a large group of employers, believed that a sizeable proportion of our society was unemployable.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any plans to introduce legislation to deal with the substantive issue of abortion and, if not, has the Government any plans for a meeting between the party leaders to stop this matter becoming a political football?  I remind the House that Fianna Fáil's recent failure to come up with a form of words for its press statement indicates that it is unlikely to be any more successful at the umpteenth shot to provide a wording for a constitutional amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am not as short on sense as the Senator, particularly in relation to his idiotic question about Monika Wulf-Mathies who is attempting to assist this country and who indicated that a proper approach would be made to scale down the money we receive as a result of our success.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader agree that this House should be pleased and proud that we have received the Europa Nostra prize for the restoration of the Turner greenhouses in Glasnevin since it was partly as a result of an Adjournment debate in this House that the money was initially released? The Government printed a stamp with these greenhouses on it for European Conservation Year, apparently unaware that eight years ago the greenhouses were closed because they were dangerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to thank Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has given an unequivocal commitment to membership of European Monetary Union.  As Senator Dardis and others said, it is essential to have a discussion on this issue because it means we are totally committed to joining European Monetary Union, irrespective of what happens.  Most people are committed to playing a constant and vigorous role in Europe through European Monetary Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is our commitment unequivocal regardless of whether the economy is maintained in a disciplined fashion?  Does it mean that because this Government is in a position to boast as a result of the disciplines introduced by the Government of which I was privileged to be a member to allow us to qualify for European Monetary Union&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government continues to concede to every demand and to spend money as it has done for the past couple of weeks and months, does it think the Taoiseach can give an unequivocal commitment to membership of European Monetary Union?</P>

      <P>I welcome last week's announcement by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  This decision is a milestone in proposals for dealing with waste and we should have a debate on how it was made.  Many comments have been made by members of all parties who do not know what they are talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>When we debate the Buckley report on the remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas will the Leader include the latest Buckley report on the remuneration of senior executives in the semi-State sector?  We should have a debate on what we regard as reward for performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>As we approach an election it might seem appropriate for politicians to run away from the Buckley report because of certain comments that have been made.  This is a dismissive and disgraceful report.  Those who prepared it have no concept of the work done by elected representatives.  We should have a debate on it before or after the election.  The media will attack us for seeking what we feel to be our rights as workers.  The small group who will take solace from the Buckley report are those who constantly attack politicians.  These people should be confronted.</P>

      <P>I have asked several times for a debate on the National Roads Authority.  Overpasses and underpasses are being built everywhere. However, there is only one bridge going into Waterford.  It takes three hours to get from Kilkenny to the hospital on the far side of this bridge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statements that will be made on sports policy.  However, there has been a delay in acting on the White Paper on mental health.  The Green Paper was published in 1992 and the White Paper in 1994 but nothing has happened since.  This is not an easy matter on which to legislate.  Mental health is the Cinderella of the health service.  Those affected are the forgotten members of society and the sooner we have a debate on this issue the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader ask the Minister for Defences to clarify Government policy on the organisation and management of the Air Corps and the Naval Service?  Recent reports have suggested that a review is imminent and there has been much speculation on what this may mean for the two services.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has adopted a new procedure of publishing provisions of the Finance Bill prior to the publication of the Bill itself.  I understood the Government procedures for the publication of legislation set down that no information on the contents of a Bill would be divulged in advance of the publication and circulation of that Bill to Members of the Oireachtas. The procedure adopted by the Minister for Finance was also used last year and is most unusual in that it sets out clearly some of the areas to be covered by the Finance Bill to be published later. However, it does not indicate what the overall result of the Bill will be, and that procedure is most unusual.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Finance as it will lead to confusion unless Government procedures are complied with as they always were.</P>

      <P>A number of Senators raised the question of waste disposal; there will be an opportunity to discuss this matter when we take the Litter Bill.  However, it might not be fully relevant and a specific debate would be useful.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and others raised the ISME report.  The remarks, as reported, were insensitive and crass and I am glad they were withdrawn today, although it raises a question about the thinking behind that type of remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Dardis and O'Kennedy raised the question of a debate on European Monetary Union.  In light of the Taoiseach's statement yesterday that would be helpful and I will try to arrange one for shortly after Easter.  Senator Dardis also asked about the Second Stage debate of the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997.  The Minister will be making the annual visit to the troops in the Lebanon until Easter but I expect the Bill to be taken as a priority immediately after Easter.  A number of Members want to contribute.  I am very interested <Col N="501" /> in Senator Daly's role in the origins of the Bill, given that Fianna Fáil brought it in, signed it, ratified the international conventions and are now standing on their heads.</P>

      <P>I look forward to a vigorous debate on that Bill.  Senator Mulcahy raised economic and monetary union and Structural Funds. This Government will fight for the strongest possible deal for Ireland and I am glad of his support in this matter.  I join with Senator Norris in sending congratulations on the Europa Nostra prize for the restoration of the Turner greenhouse and I am glad this House played a part in that.  There are no plans for legislation or a referendum on abortion.</P>
      <P>Senators Lee and Lanigan raised the Buckley report.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges considered this briefly yesterday and will be considering it again next week.  I have no difficulty with a debate on it if Members think it would be useful.  The committee from this House made a detailed, careful, prudent and modest series of proposals based firmly on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  That submission was treated in a dismissive and derisory way in the report and the arguments used in dismissing the case were specious.  Many people feel angry about the way the case was dealt with rather than the result because there was a lack of intellectual content in the handling of the case.</P>
      <P>I will try to arrange a debate for Senator Lanigan on the National Roads Authority.  I see his problem.  Senator Maloney mentioned the White Paper on mental health.  The legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation but it is a difficult Bill with long sections.  However, it has been given priority by the Department of Health.  I will try to get clarification on the policy on the Air Corps and Navy for Senator Daly.  I am not aware of the point he raised in regard to the Finance Bill but I will make inquiries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach and the Members of Seanad Éireann for providing me with this opportunity to discuss Irish sport and to share our views and opinions on this area which is central to the lives of the people in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The development of Irish sport has now reached a critical and exciting juncture as we review and critically analyse progress to date and put in place our plans and vision for the future.</P>
      <P>Modern sport is facing many challenges and is experiencing radical and fundamental changes. Sport came into the ownership of the ordinary person about 100 years ago and, indeed, most of our sports organisations, structures, rules and regulations were introduced and codified around that time.  In general terms, sport has continued to expand and flourish in a relatively stable environment over that period, but in the last few years it has experienced what can only be called a revolution.</P>
      <P>Many of the old traditions and practices have been questioned and overturned.  New pressures and demands have had to be faced from within sport itself.  Major external forces such as the influx of money and the demands of international media have resulted in sport having to cope with an entirely new environment of professionalism and commercial realities.  All this means that sport and its organisations and structures must be strengthened, organised and co-ordinated so that it can effectively operate in this rapidly changing environment.</P>
      <P>The needs of the high performers, the demands of the international media, the expectations of the public, the urgent requirement to retain the core principles of ethics and fair play in the face of such pressure and the essential role of the volunteer in sport must all be addressed and balanced in our present day sports provision.</P>
      <P>Sport needs its heroes and its champions. Young people and children, in particular, need the role models and the stats who will inspire and encourage them to succeed in their chosen sports. Our top elite athletes, individuals and teams must be given every opportunity to develop and to achieve at the highest levels of national and international sport.  The ordinary person who just wants to take part in sport for fun, for recreation or for socialisation must also be provided with the means of taking part and of achieving a level of participation or achievement appropriate to his or her wishes and abilities.  The increased participation in sport and physical recreation of all our people, young and old, must remain at the very core of our interventions and inspire our policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sport plays many roles in our society.  Success at national and international competition excites the interest of our communities and our nation; thankfully, we have had many examples of that in recent years.  Success raises morale, enhances <Col N="503" /> national prestige and provides great entertainment and enjoyment.  Regular participation in sport provides personal enrichment and rewarding social experiences as well as the benefits for the mental and physical well being of the individual and the nation.  It provides an identity and a sense of unity of common purposes for our towns, villages and communities in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>Sport can play a unique role in combating drug abuse and crime by providing young people with interesting and challenging opportunities and counteracting the problems of isolation and social exclusion.  I am convinced that sport, recreation and youth services are the greatest preventative element in the fight against crime and drugs for young people.  Resources invested in sport is money well spent and prevents the need for even greater investment in prisons, prison officers and gardaí, as well as health services, but most importantly it reduces the level of human misery and heartache.</P>
    <P>Sport also plays a key role in our economy.  My Department published the results of a study, &ldquo;The Economic Impact of Sport in Ireland&rdquo;, some years ago.  This report highlighted the major contribution which sport plays in the economic life of our country in terms of investment, employment, goods and services, as well as income from tourists coming to Ireland for sport and recreation.</P>
    <P>Employment in sports activity is in excess of 11,000 both full-time and part-time personnel, representing more than 8,000 full-time jobs. When the media, travel and tourism in sport are added, this figure increases to an estimated 18,200 full-time equivalent jobs.  Sport and its related activities account for around £560 million or more than 2 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>When all these factors are taken into account, when the demands and complexities of modern sport are appreciated and when one realises the range of benefits which participation in sport brings to our community, it is clear that sport requires to be taken on board as a serious and essential area of national provision.</P>
    <P>Sport development can no longer be left to drift along in a loose, unco-ordinated fashion.  It is too important and too complex for that.  On becoming Minister with responsibility for sport and youth services, I was struck by the fact that there was no clear or coherent plan for the development of Irish sport.  While a great amount of excellent work was being done and the funding of sports organisations and the provision of facilities had significantly advanced over the last couple of decades, it was clear that a national strategy for the future was long overdue.  Therefore, over 12 months ago I appointed Olympic medallist, John Treacy, to chair a sports strategy group which set about the preparation of a national sports plan which would help map the road ahead for the next ten years or so.  The reason I did so was the fragmented and disjointed approach to <Col N="504" /> sport.  I wanted a new plan to ensure that funding for sport was used to its optimum value; that attractive opportunities would exist for participation in sport and so that avenues were open for sports people to develop their talents to full potential.</P>
    <P>As Members know, after 12 months of dedicated work, this first ever national strategy for Irish sport was published on 18 February 1997. The strategy group carried out the most detailed and fundamental review of every aspect of the funding, organisation, administration and requirements of Irish sport.  This is a strategy that was not written by a few people in an office.  An unprecedented level and range of consultation was carried out during the 12 months or so of its preparation.</P>
    <P>The national sports organisations were consulted, as were Departments, state agencies, vocational education committees, local authorities and clubs, groups and individuals at local level.  Over 300 written submissions were received and political parties were also consulted.  In the truest sense, this strategy has been written by the partners in sport and by the people.  It is not the John Treacy plan or the Allen plan as it has been described since its launch by one sports leader.  It is the people's plan.</P>
    <P>The strategy report, <i>Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland</i> is a very detailed and comprehensive document addressing all aspects of sport from local level and the needs of the individual to national and international structures, as well as the requirements of the top international competitor.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to indicate the six main strategies which make up the overall report&mdash;sport for young people, recreational sport, high performance sport, sports facilities and natural resources, sports training and development and co-ordination of sport.  The following principles guided the development of the strategy: people-centred focus, equality, partnership, quality, accountability, volunterism and sustainability.</P>
    <P>In the course of the wide consultation one message came across loud and clear in every part of the country.  This was the need to address the low levels of participation of children and young people in sport.  Concern was expressed about the inadequacies of school sport and physical education in our schools.</P>
    <P>The need to increase the number of people taking part in recreational sport and physical recreation&mdash;sport for all&mdash;was also raised as a priority issue.  It is essential that we provide everyone with the opportunity to take part in and enjoy recreational sport supported by trained and well informed personnel, both volunteer and professional.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long tradition in high performance sport at international and national levels. Our national games have played a very special, strategic, leading role in our community.  The strategy has identified the need to strengthen the work and the organisation of the NGBs, the <Col N="505" /> range and quality of coaching and facilities and the early identification and ongoing support of our outstanding sports people.</P>
    <P>There has been great progress in the provision of all types of sports facilities in recent years. However, in too many cases facilities are being provided in an unco-ordinated way and are funded on the basis of expressed demand rather than a rational plan.  This has led to over-provision and duplication in some areas and under-provisions in others.  The strategy proposes ways to provide quality sports facilities in the right place at the right time.  These facilities should be well managed, accessible and widely used and should be sustainable to both the user and the provider.</P>
    <P>The strategy also addressed the ways needed to develop a network of trained volunteers and professionals working harmoniously and successfully in all aspects of the sports sector, creating new jobs while building on the volunteer traditions of Irish sport.</P>
    <P>The sports co-ordination strategy is the vital link which brings all six strategies together in one co-ordinated plan.  This is to ensure that all our agencies, organisations, Departments, local communities and clubs as well as the private sector can work together in a cohesive way to provide opportunities for all, including people with disabilities and those living in areas of economic and social disadvantage, to participate fully in sport. To help bring all of this together, it is proposed to strengthen the role and impact of the Irish Sports Council to enable it to co-ordinate the potential which exists within sport and to provide a leadership role as well as a clear voice for Irish sport. The Government has given its approval to my Department to prepare legislation to establish the Sports Council on a statutory basis.  My Department is now in the course of preparing a memorandum for Government with the outline heads of a Bill.</P>
    <P>The strategy report has outlined a number of measures to be put in place to get the implementation of the six strategies I outlined under way. As I said at the launch of the plan, plans are made to be implemented not to be left to languish on a shelf.  I have announced a 12 point implementation programme.  I announced the appointment of John Treacy as Executive Chairman of the Irish Sports Council.  John, with the council and the sport section of my Department, will set up the structures and programmes for the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>I accept in principle the need for a statutory sports council on the lines recommended by the strategy group and I am putting in place the necessary arrangements for the drafting of legislation to appoint the council on a statutory basis. The existing Sports Council represents a broad range of sports, key NGBs and other related areas.  This council will play a central, pivotal role in the development of policy and in the implementation of the strategy, as well as providing a voice and leadership for Irish sport.  It will direct <Col N="506" /> the development of a cohesive partnership with the Irish sport sector, Departments and agencies, national and international organisations and the private sector.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Sports Council was set up in June 1996.  It succeeded Cospóir, although it was a smaller group and it was representative of all of the main interests in Irish sport.  The common link between the strategy group and the Sports Council was John Treacy, the chairman of the strategy group.  I was anxious to signal my commitment to implementing the plan by appointing him chairman of the Sports Council.</P>
    <P>A women in sport group will be set up immediately to report on and address the key issues impacting on Irish women and their involvement in sport.  I am concerned at the high level of falloff in the participation of women in sport from the age of 16 onwards.  This was highlighted in a study carried out by the Department.  There are impediments to the participation of women in sport beyond that age at participatory, management and administrative levels.  These issues were highlighted at a conference held in Brighton about two years ago and by a number of women's groups which I have met.</P>
    <P>There are 35 sports organised on an all island basis and there is a need for an all island approach to the promotion and development of sport.  A number of programmes are already being put in place in the area of recreational sport and children's sport.  There is a need for closer co-operation in the areas of high performance sport and in facility provision.</P>
    <P>I announced in February that a representatives of the Sports Council for Northern Ireland would be appointed to the Irish Sports Council to ensure an effective level of co-ordination at the highest level of policy development.  I am informed that the Sports Council for Northern Ireland selected its representative at its meeting yesterday.  There is a need for an all island planning group to co-ordinate and develop sports policy.  This has been happening for over 12 months because the Sports Council for Northern Ireland had a representative on our strategy group and we have a representative on its equivalent.  There is and will be further co-ordination.</P>
    <P>I will announce the introduction of an anti-drugs in sport programme, which will include a testing and an education programme in co-operation with the Sports Council for Northern Ireland which has expertise and experience in this regard.  It is important that we avail of its expertise and experience.  I will also establish a group to report on and address the key issues affecting the participation in sport of people with a disability.</P>
    <P>As part of a range of new initiatives in high performance sport a player/athlete carding system will be introduced which will provide access to funding, training facilities, sport sciences, medical back-up, physiological testing, coaching and career guidance and development.  It is disturbing that many top athletes who have represented <Col N="507" /> Ireland at Olympic Games and other competitions find themselves without a career at the end of their playing days.  Career guidance for our budding athletes is essential.  A holistic package of support services will be available for the first time for our top athletes.  The role of the National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick will be enhanced to enable it to develop this and other services in consultation with the national governing bodies of sport.  Greater resources are being allocated for this enhanced role.  There will be increased funding for outstanding and elite sports people this year.</P>
    <P>Special attention will be paid to strengthening the role and effectiveness of the national governing bodies.  Strategic planning services will be provided for them so that they can develop effective plans and initiatives for the future development of their sports in co-operation with my Department, the Sports Council and the National Coaching and Training Centre.</P>
    <P>My Department, the Sports Council and the National Coaching and Training Centre will work hand in hand with the national governing bodies in the development of their outstanding and elite squads as well as their coaching, competition and training needs.  The special role and needs of players involved in team sports, including our national games, will also be given special attention.</P>
    <P>Up to now our sports facilities have been developed on the basis of expressed demand.  This lack of a co-ordinated approach has resulted in some areas of the country being under-provided in terms of facilities, other areas being over-supplied and duplication in many places.  The role of ILAM&mdash;the Institute for Leisure Amenity Management (Ireland)&mdash;will be enhanced so that it can play a full part in preparing a national plan for the development, provision and management of sports facilities in consultation with the Sports Council and my Department.  A national inventory of facilities will be carried out to identify the country's needs and requirements.  With this information and plan we can ensure that we have the right facilities in the right place at the right time.  The national governing bodies will be consulted closely at all stages so that their priorities and needs in the provision of training and competition facilities will be clearly identified.  The startegy report has highlighted the need for training facilities for all sports as a priority matter.  In this context I am investigating the need for a 50 meter training pool for Irish swimmers.</P>
    <P>A technical support team will be appointed to implement the individual strategies in the areas of recreational sport and youth sport as well as training and development.  Recreational sport is a priority; two recreational sport officers will develop and co-ordinate programmes to implement the strategy measures to increase participation in recreational sport and physical activity.  These people will be appointed by public <Col N="508" /> competition; it will not be, as some described it, &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The national survey, already published, on participation in sport and physical activity will provide a basis and a baseline for the measurement of the effectiveness of future interventions.  Comprehensive programmes will be developed targeted at the different life stages.  The recreational sport strategies will be implemented in partnership with local sports facilities.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the Sports Council for Northern Ireland, a number of cross-Border initiatives on recreational sport will commence shortly.  Also in association with that body, an all island training programme geared at those organising or leading recreational sport will be put in place.</P>
    <P>The importance of sport for young people was raised as a priority for attention by most of the groups and individuals consulted during the preparation of the strategy.  Two national sports officers will be appointed, by public competition, to develop and co-ordinate special programmes and initiatives.  A consultative forum will be established involving all key agencies to address issues of sport for young people involving the home, school and community.  There is an important role here for the national governing bodies and their clubs at local level.</P>
    <P>A special qualification for coaching young people in sport will be developed and three age-specific sports programmes will be developed with the key agencies.  With that, a promotional and educational programme campaign will be introduced to inform the community and clubs on the principles of the <i>Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport in Ireland,</i> published last year.  Local sports development officers will be appointed on a pilot basis at local level in specific disadvantaged areas to promote sport for young people and develop sport as a catalyst for social inclusion, crime prevention and job creation.  A sports training and development officer will be appointed to develop a comprehensive training and development plan for volunteers in Irish sport to include the development of a qualifications system, because without such a system there is no evaluation.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the importance the Government has placed on the need to develop Irish sport, it has provided £1.6 million in this year's budget to enable work to commence on the implementation of the strategy.  This funding will enable me to put in place the structures and systems necessary so that the key elements of the strategy can be put into effect without delay.  The provision of this £1.6 million, in addition to the money already allocated in the Estimates, is a clear and positive sign of the Government's commitment to sport and to all those organisations, clubs and individuals at all levels who contribute so much to our country and to our social and community development.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the national sports plan provides a new deal for Irish sport.  It provides a place in <Col N="509" /> the decision making process for everyone involved in sports policy and development in Ireland.  It is based on consultation and on sharing and this spirit of openness and transparency which typified its preparation will also characterise its implementation.</P>
    <P>The plan has been widely welcomed by sports federations and clubs and there has been an unprecedented demand for copies.  Sports organisations and clubs realise that working with the structures outlined in the plan will enhance sport in Ireland.  There have been critics, but they are in a minority.  Nevertheless, if the administration of sport does not change, it will be changed by external forces.  Change is always painful for some, but we need everybody on board, working together in an effective and cohesive way so that all resources are optimised and athlete support and governing bodies are strengthened.  Unless everything is right in the administration of sport and unless there is full co-ordination of resources, services and talents, we will not be at our best.</P>
    <P>The sports strategy offers a unique and unprecedented opportunity for all interests to work in partnership and harmony, and in an open way, for the future development of our sport, our communities, our nation's health and well being and, most important, for the good of our young people and children.  I look forward to the contributions of Senators and to sharing views and concerns on this most important facet of Irish life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister of State has initiated this important debate on sports, sporting strategy and the future for sport. He suggested that we now have the first strategy report on Irish sport.  However, in January 1987, Deputy Aylward, acting on behalf of Fianna Fáil, presented a strategy for sports and recreation.  The two are intertwined and unless we provide facilities for both, no strategy will work.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is incorrect to suggest that it is only within the last 12 months that sporting strategies have been analysed.  In doing so, he denigrates many people who over the years have attempted to evolve strategies which would give cognisance to all the elements in sport, recreation and leisure in Ireland.  A number of civil servants who have worked in his Department in the past are knowledgeable of the problems and the potential in all areas of sporting life in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about bringing sport back to ordinary people.  Page 22 of the document entitled <i>Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland</i> shows the Minister of the State at the top of the targeting structure, followed by the All Ireland Planning Forum, the Irish Sports Council sports section and, at the bottom, the schools, vocational education committee and co-ordinators. I hope this pyramid is intended to start at the bottom and work to the top because a problem with Irish sport over the years has been too much concentration on the top.  Unfortunately, clubs, coaches, athletes and volunteers are marginalised on the same page.  I also hope that when <Col N="510" /> the report is implemented there will be many changes to the way the targeting area is organised.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>Modern sport is facing many challenges and is experiencing radical and fundamental changes.  Sport came into the ownership of the ordinary person about a hundred years ago...</P>
    <P>What does he mean by this latter remark?  With regard to the GAA, the game of hurling originated from a limited number of people.  In the 18th century a match took place beside Brompton Abbey on Brompton Road in London for £1,000 per man and they competed for the hand of a lady.  In north Kilkenny a match took place between an earl from Kildorrery and an earl from south Kilkenny.  It was a combined fair and hurling match and was attended by 55,000 people. The earls' huntsmen used whips to keep the peasants off the field of play.  The fee was £1,000 per man and they hurled for the hand of a lady.  Hurling came into the ownership of the ordinary person about 100 hundred years ago, but it is the only sport of which I know where that happened.</P>
    <P>Modern sport has not changed very much. Much of what happens in people's lives is determined by what happens before they are four years of age.  When one looks at children between the ages of nought and four years one can see the potential leaders and followers developing from that very young age.</P>
    <P>The traditions and practices of sport have not changed very much.  What has changed is the organisation of professional sport, which is at the root of many of the arguments in Ireland and internationally about the role of sport in society. International professional sport is detrimental to the aims of the Minister of State and everybody else.</P>
    <P>I competed in the Cork city sports in 1958. According to the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> 29,000 people attended those sports at the Mardyke.  The total sum of the admission fees paid by those people would not pay the fee demanded by one élite athlete to compete in Cork today.  The demands of élite athletes are one of the reasons for the decrease in the number of sports meetings.</P>
    <P>This report is pandering to the needs of élite athletes by the provision of a carding system which will give them access to more formalised funding.  One helps people who are struggling to get involved in business by giving them an education and a little help&mdash;one does not continue to help them once they have achieved their aims in business.  Similarly, I do not think one should continue to help those who have achieved their aims in sport.</P>
    <P>The Olympic Games are becoming a farce and a major opportunity for advertisers.  They no longer have anything to do with sport but instead are about advertising and the prestige of countries. That has not just developed in the immediate past but began when Hitler decided that the great white race was going to take over the <Col N="511" /> Olympic Games.  Thankfully, Jesse Owens made certain that Hitler did not get the results he wanted.</P>
    <P>Athletes who earn millions of pounds per year now decide whether to go the Olympic Games on the basis of which tournaments are taking place on the international circuit at that time.  It is time for the Olympic Games to be down-sized and to return to what they were intended to be&mdash;a sport for all in which participation was more important than the winning of a medal.  The president of the International Olympic Committee is the greatest dictator in the world.  He has more power and money at his disposal than possibly 90 per cent of countries.  The International Olympic Committee has nothing to do with sport.</P>
    <P>International athletes are very selective about where they compete.  They would prefer to win a grand prix, where they are competing for seven bars of gold or for an appearance fee, rather than compete in the Olympic Games.  The world Championships, which take place every two years, are much more important than the Olympic Games to élite athletes because of the appearance fees and prize money.  Fair dues to them, in a sense, because they have a short life in athletics and they must maximise their earnings.</P>
    <P>The questions which we need to address in Ireland must be addressed from the bottom up. We must examine the situation in schools which has resulted from the huge demographic changes. The Minister referred to the area of women in sport.  I could be called sexist for suggesting we must take that in all its contexts.  One of the problems in the development of sport, recreation and society is that while a gender balance is being imposed on various boards there is no gender balance in the teaching profession.  Over 80 per cent of primary and pre-primary teachers are women. They do a fantastic job and I am not criticising women's teaching abilities.  However, there has been a decrease in the participation in sport of primary teachers, and what participation there is usually occurs in the area of individual rather than team sports.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has suggested that the percentage of PE teachers in schools is much too low and that PE teachers should not have to teach other subjects.  We must examine the issue of employing PE teachers to teach PE and sports only, rather than just regarding PE as what used to be called Sokol drill.  In the old days the Christian Brothers aped the Nazi youth movement in claiming that a fit body created a fit mind, which was a load of rubbish.  Forcing people to shake banners all over the fields of Ireland did nothing to create a sporting atmosphere, but it showed that the Christian Brothers and teachers had the pupils under control. Unfortunately, that turned many people off sport and recreation.</P>
    <P>There is not enough consideration given in this report to the many voluntary bodies and the huge number of people who are involved in sport and recreation.  There is too much emphasis on the <Col N="512" /> organisation and funding of sport.  If we do not have a huge input from voluntary people, sport at the élite level will decrease and the targeted area will disappear.</P>
    <P>The most successful sporting organisation in Ireland is the GAA.  Irrespective of what anybody might think about it, it is not based on a strategy which comes from the top.  The GAA strategy has always come from the bottom and it has never been unwilling to change.  Micheál Ó Hehir, who unfortunately died recently, conducted an interview in Belfast when the ban on participation in what were than called &ldquo;foreign games&rdquo; was lifted by a Waterford president, Pat Fanning.  He was vehemently opposed to the lifting of the ban but, as a member of a democratic organisation, he went along with its wishes.  He still has a feeling that it might have been the wrong decision but he accepted it.  The GAA's style of democracy has to be looked for in other sporting and recreation organisations.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has suggested that each county should have a sports recreation co-ordinator. There is a suggestion in the Minister of State's strategy that that would happen.  This is essential as local authorities are one of the bigger providers of sports facilities.  Every time there is a major development they have an input because 10 per cent of land has to be set aside for leisure facilities.  In the old days that land was the bog or the quarry on which a builder could not build. However, local authorities are now cognisant of the problems associated with building huge housing estates and providing leisure facilities.</P>
    <P>The strategy also addressed the ways needed to develop a network of trained volunteers and professionals working harmoniously and successfully in all aspects of the sports sector, creating new jobs while building on the volunteer trateers at the base level of sport have done the ditions of Irish sport.  One problem is that volunteers at the base level of sport have done the work and when success has been attained it is taken over by professionals, the Government or the media.  If the Minister of State goes to his own hurling or rugby club, he will find dedicated people organising their respective clubs and they can organise seven teams to play at different times on a Saturday or a Sunday.  If the Minister of State wants to provide training, he should pay them.  However, once they are paid, he will run into major problems.</P>
    <P>Rugby in Ireland has deteriorated in proportion to the amount spent in rugby clubs providing such leisure facilities as bars, dance halls, squash and handball courts, etc.  Too much time and energy go into the organisation and provision of funds for the club while too little goes into the provision of playing facilities and the development of players.  This also happens in other sports.</P>
    <P>Athletics has been an area of contention for many years and it is unfortunate that the Olympic Games are the pinnacle for these people.  The Olympic Council of Ireland was not a democratic body.  Nobody knew who ran it until athletes were being selected for an Olympic Games.  This has <Col N="513" /> changed and it is more democratic today.  Now sporting bodies have the right to name their representatives to the council and elections take place.  In the past, one had to be asked to join the OCI.  That was not democratic and it did not allow for the participation in the Olympic of minority sporting groups.</P>
    <P>Our international successes have never come easy and never as a result of major organisation. In many cases success came about through the dedication of athletes and those looking after them.  Dedicated parents were out with their sons and daughters in the cold and rain on winter afternoons and this dedication combined with local organisation produced these athletes.  When Ronnie Delaney was in training for the Olympics, he was riding a bike in Kilkenny selling Hoovers. However, when he went to Melbourne he won the 1500 metres.  He did not need a sports Minister to organise his career.  Chalky White did not need a 50 metre pool.  Michelle Smith has moved to Kilkenny and is training in the municipal pool from 5.30 a.m. to 10 a.m. every day.  There is a need for a 50 metre pool in Kilkenny if she is going to live there as she would attract many people to the area.</P>

The percentage of money allocated to sport by the national lottery does not meet its needs.  Will the Minister of State or his successor ensure national lottery funds are provided for sport and recreation?  This will not impinge on the health services because money will not have to be put into the drug abuse programme.  If money is put into sport and recreation in the first place, the problems associated with drug abuse and various other anti-social problems will be eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, on this comprehensive document which is long overdue.  Ireland has a long and proud sporting tradition which is deeply rooted in the richness of our culture.  The national <Col N="514" /> games have played a major role in the building of local community structures for sport and in fostering a sense of pride and spirit of rivalry on a parish, county and provincial basis.  The national games and international sport provide great occasions for celebrating excellence and achievement and promote a sense of pride in being Irish. Successful Irish sports people provide excellent role models and sport creates a spirit of respectful co-operation among the people of this island.</P>
      <P>Sport provides great satisfaction and enjoyment for Irish people of all ages and backgrounds. Sporting talent is an important part of the human potential of Ireland and everyone should have the opportunity to make the most of their talents.  These benefits combine to form a potent and positive force in modern Ireland.  The purpose of this strategic plan is to provide a clear blueprint for the development of Irish sport from 1997 to 2006.  The strategy seeks to bring all elements of sport together in a cohesive way for the benefit of all those involved as participants, coaches, leaders and administrators.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the report are to develop an active culture in sport, put an effective organisational structure in place and provide pathways and opportunities for individual fulfilment in recreational and high performance sports.  These are worthwhile objectives and I particularly welcome the plan to encourage more young people and the public to take up sport.  Much more must be done to promote and develop a life long interest in sport among young people because their future health and well being is critically linked to a positive sporting culture.</P>
      <P>Resources must be invested in promoting healthy lifestyles and education and training for parents, teachers, coaches and sports leaders. Future developments in sport for young people should be planned in the context of the home, the school and the community at large.  The introduction of a new physical education curriculum at primary level and a revised syllabus at second level should be welcomed in addition to the possibility of physical education as a leaving certificate option.  Consideration should be given to the provision of this option for leaving certificate students as sport badly loses out to academic subjects at this level of education at present.  From this point on young people lose interest in participating in sport.  The appointment of two sports officers with the objective of co-ordinating the implementation of the sport for young people programmes is essential if we are to succeed in encouraging young people to get involved in sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a great social aspect to young people becoming involved in sport and sporting organisations.  In urban areas it keeps youths off the streets and away from the social ills of drugs and crime.  Sadly, this is also becoming a factor in rural areas and the problem is growing daily.  The Department of Justice and the prison system can only do so much and our objective must be to stop these problems arising in the first place.  The <Col N="515" /> development of the sports strategy will go a long way in helping to overcome these problems in society.</P>
    <P>Involving more young people in sport will have the knock on effect of increasing the demand for facilities for recreational sport.  Young people becoming involved in sport will encourage their parents to become more active.  As the younger generation get older, they will also require these facilities.  However, if resources and facilities are not in place to enable individuals to take part in sport for social, health or recreational purposes, this will be a futile exercise.  Sports facilities and the resources to run them must be freely available to the public to encourage them to try sport.</P>
    <P>Run down swimming pools with no proper facilities will not encourage people to take up swimming no matter how many medals Michelle Smith wins.  Whether there is a 50 metre pool in Dublin, Cork or Belfast, it will not encourage people in Ballaghaderreen, Granard and many other rural areas and towns to take up sport.  High quality 25 metre pools in every town are required if we are to have more Michelle Smiths on the podium in Sydney in the year 2000.  Therefore, we must provide quality sports facilities in the right place at the right time.  They should be well managed, accessible, widely used and sustainable to both users and providers.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that local authorities will have a role in developing strategic plans for sport and recreation.  They will be encouraged to identify the sports facility requirements for their areas in partnership with the local sports groups.  I welcome this initiative because nobody knows the sports requirements of a local area better than the people of the locality.</P>
    <P>An area which has been neglected up to now has been the development of our natural resources.  The development of national marked ways and local short walks in addition to an inventory which identifies major areas of national interest and rights of way for outdoor pursuits would be a great asset to the tourism industry.  It would bring tourists to parts of the country which were not exploited in the past.</P>
    <P>Sports related activity generates in excess of 11,000 full and part-time jobs, representing more than 8,000 full-time equivalent jobs.  When sports spending on media, travel and tourism is included, it raises the figure to over 18,000 full-time equivalent jobs.  Sport is estimated to contribute over £66 million annually to the Exchequer through PAYE and PRSI levies. Therefore, it is a vital cog in our economic development but it is under-utilised at present. The report will help to change that trend with proper funding in place.  A bigger slice of the national lottery cake must be secured to ensure that sport reaches its full potential for the people and gives its full benefit to the economy, locally and nationally.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the comprehensive document, the issue of pay to view television has not been <Col N="516" /> considered.  The Minister said that if administration of sport does not change, it will be changed by external forces.  A prime example of that is BSkyB, which signed a contract with the Rugby Unions of the southern hemisphere.  A consequence of that is the professional era in Rugby Union.  BSkyB also dictates to sports bodies the times at which soccer matches take place in England.  We can do as much promotion of sport and issue as many reports as we wish, but it is a futile exercise without live sports coverage on television.  We saw the effect of Ireland's success in the soccer world cup in encouraging young people to take up the game.  It is vital to the development of sport in Ireland that terrestrial television covers all major sporting events to ensure young people get involved in sport and sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and thank the Minister. Given the tremendous work he has done since his appointment, I am sure he will get the portfolio again after the election.  The strategic plan suggests it will be a senior Ministry, which will give sport its rightful place at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Naughten for sharing his time and I welcome the Minister.  I congratulate him for doing something important.  He has brought vision, energy and understanding to his portfolio and we saw the results in recent years.  The report is his most important work to date and it is widely accepted as such.  Given the activities of his Department, his vision is shared by his officials and that augurs well for the future.</P>
      <P>Sport has evolved in an unco-ordinated fashion.  Other speakers mentioned the voluntary and organisational input of various groups, such as the GAA and soccer and athletics organisations. Each has done its own thing and organised itself on a national basis.  They have done a marvellous job in many cases and the GAA is the outstanding example of how a group can organise itself and provide facilities in every parish. However, other groups have had much more difficulty achieving that.  For example, in parts of the country with which I am familiar, people involved in athletics have not managed to provide the type of facilities they require, although the community games have been in existence since the 1960s and athletics has been practised and supported in parishes throughout Ireland for generations.</P>
      <P>Former great athletes, such as Felix Sherry, gave years of service to the development of athletics in parts of County Monaghan. I considered him a hero when I joined the community games organisation. He gave his time training athletes in the Truagh area of County Monaghan and did a marvellous job.  He achieved some fantastic results but without any resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the GAA's faults is that it was somewhat narrow minded in the way it developed its resources, pitches, etc.  That organisation rarely if ever considered the needs of the wider community, particularly those of athletics organisations. <Col N="517" /> Thankfully, however, it is beginning to adopt a broader vision.</P>
    <P>I hear a mobile telephone ringing, which must mean that Senator O'Toole is in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not Senator O'Toole, it is his clone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly looks like Senator O'Toole.  GAA clubs rarely provided running tracks, which would have been a simple addendum to the development of football pitches.  This happened in some areas but there was no co-ordinated national effort to provide running tracks in conjunction with playing facilities.  That was an omission and probably occurred because of the small resources available at the time.  However, it would have made a great impact on the development of athletics.  I am glad that such development is beginning to take place.  Local communities developing proposals for the provision of sports facilities have broadened their vision to an extraordinary degree and a single playing pitch can now be used for a variety of sporting activities.</P>
      <P>Another problem which existed in the past was the lack of sports facilities in schools.  I ran a school for a number of years which did not have a playing pitch or gymnasium and was dependent on the local community.  It was often difficult to train sports teams because the local GAA club had only one pitch, and at times we were forbidden to use it while it was being prepared for the championship season.  As a result, we could not train the Gaelic football and soccer teams before a crucial match.  That problem remains in existence to some degree and I am glad it is recognised in the report.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for communities to provide the facilities required within their defined areas such as centres for the development of sport, playing pitches and additional grounds and amenities.  Will the Minister initiate research into the relationship between students' involvement in sport and their academic achievements?  I know of no research in that area, but from my experience in education I could surmise the results of such research.  In my opinion, which is supported by information I gathered in the past, people involved in sport tend to be highly motivated in general and become academically successful. However, I also discovered that parents tend to withdraw when their children become very involved in sport.  They ask whether too much time is being spent on sport and not enough on academic interests.  There is a conflict in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers are also wont to worry in the run-up to examinations.  They tend to become concerned about the involvement of certain students in sport who may be obliged to miss a lesson in order to represent the school in an important match.  I believe if this issue were researched it would emerge that there is a correlation between involvement in sport and general motivation in other areas.  Sport has a general motivating effect <Col N="518" /> on one's attitude to education, etc.  While working as a teacher I noticed that students who would normally have dropped out of school became motivated by their fellows in an unusual way when they became involved in playing on or supporting a football team.  I know some students who, where it not for sport, might otherwise have dropped out of school but they remained to complete the leaving certificate and went on to lead satisfying lives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment, vision and understanding which the Minister of State has brought to the area of sport.  However, I ask him to fight a battle for funding because the economy is growing at an enormous rate.  When times were bad national lottery funding had to be used by many Departments for different reasons.  I recognise that the economy is now growing at an unprecedented level and it is somewhat facetious to call on the Minister of State to fight the battle for funding because he is already doing so.  However, the House should support him in this regard and recognise the importance of sport in keeping people out of prison, encouraging them to remain in school and improving the general quality of their lives.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise the grave need for continued and increased investment in sports facilities throughout the country.  Although the Minister of State recently invested relatively large amounts of money, he, his officials and everyone else is aware that this funding represents a mere drop in the ocean in terms of nationwide requirements. I hope that the Cabinet and the decision-makers decide that youth in sport should receive increased funding as the economy, which provided such funding to other Departments in the past, grows.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will continue in office for a long period because he is the first individual to bring the kind of vision, planning and understanding necessary to this brief.  He has achieved something of great importance and it is only correct that he should receive the opportunity to proceed with and conclude his work in the interests of Irish sport.  The people of Ireland recognise the Minister of State's achievements and he has vast support for his proposals.  I wish him well in their implementation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about a matter that is crucial to Irish life and education and I congratulate the Minister of State on the quality of the report.</P>
      <P>A vote of congratulations must be given to those who put forward the name of John Treacy of this job.  Everyone who stayed up late one night in 1984 to watch him compete in the Olympic marathon is aware of his tenacity, determination and stamina.  However, we also recognise his extraordinary ability to define and design goals, to which he attaches detailed planning and assessment of methods to achieve them, and his development of strategies.  It is clear that Mr. Treacy imported his attitude to sport into the preparation of this document.</P>
      <P>This is a good document and I would welcome its implementation.  It has a number of flaws to which I will refer, but I do so only on the basis that naturally one tends to focus on things one would like to see changed.  It is very progressive that the document recognises the Brighton declaration on women in sport.  The document also recognises something which is not stated often enough, namely, whereas they can be treated equally in sport, women and men have different needs, particularly in terms of the education system. That is made clear in the document and I commend it to the Department of Education.  It was unnecessary to describe Mr. John Treacy as chairman rather than chairperson or Cathaoirleach because it gives the wrong impression.  I ask that it be changed because it does not fit well with the UN and Brighton Declarations in terms of creating role models.  However, I do not want that small quibble to take away from the report.</P>
      <P>I want to focus on the report's positive elements but I also want to raise certain crucial issues.  We must have different arrangements for young women or girls and young men or boys.  I ask the Minister to keep that in mind.  We need people, such as the inspectorate in the Department of Education, teachers, etc., to produce positive results.  It is also important to have discussions with the colleges of education because that is where it begins.  We are talking about developing teaching skills and about teachers being prepared to introduce young people to sport.  People who teach gymnastics, for example, must learn a skill.  I would like primary teachers, colleges of education, the inspectorate in the Department of Education and an INTO representative to work together to set up a programme. The NCCA is setting up a programme, to which I am favourably disposed, but resources will be needed to implement it at school level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Physical education cannot be introduced in primary schools without access to a general purpose room, a pitch or a hard area.  I do not want to reduce this debate to one about the lack of resources at different levels of education.  Nevertheless, it would be disingenuous and illogical not to refer to this issue.  If pupils want to do physical education on a cold wet wintry Friday afternoon, they must have proper indoor facilities.  Two-thirds <Col N="520" /> of primary schools do not have a general purpose room and post-primary schools are only marginally better off.</P>
    <P>I recall my first week teaching in Rolestown national school in Senator Wright's constituency. I was appalled to find there was no football team. I tried to get a football team together but there were no resources for jerseys or a football.  If the local club, Fingal Ravens, had not heard of our predicament and given us a second hand set of jerseys and a couple of footballs, we would not have succeeded in forming a team to which there has been great commitment.  It took a couple of year's commitment by myself and a number of other teachers to get people to move from Gaelic football, which is a man's game in north Dublin, to athletics.  It is easier nowadays with role models such as Sonia O'Sullivan, John Treacy and many others.  It is important not to suggest ways forward unless we are prepared to help people to make the change.</P>
    <P>The overall goal of the report is to involve more young people in sport at all levels and to encourage them to develop a life long interest in it.  Many young people will never find success in sport but they could learn how to move properly. An old phrase in Kerry and Cork was, &ldquo;he has no use of his body&rdquo;, which means he cannot walk properly.  There was a time when our grandmothers made us wear braces or walk with books on top of our heads to straighten our backs.  This was an attempt to develop posture.  It is important that sport relates to more than just enjoyment.</P>
    <P>I am more interested in children becoming involved in sport than in how they perform.  At one stage if people were not interested in physical contact sports, they had no other choice. However, people can now choose gymnastics and non-contact sports which are crucially important. Many children do not find success in academic subjects or in public speaking and they may be no good at football or hurling, but they may be extraordinarily skilled in basketball or athletics &mdash;such as the high jump, the long jump or the triple jump.  I know from experience &mdash; there is no teacher who would not support me&mdash;that the child who finds success on the sports field will be transformed in the classroom.  The person who was a bully last year will be looked up to as a role model and as an expert at the high jump or the long jump; he will respond differently and have different needs.</P>
    <P>The philosophies underpinning discipline and bullying do not take account of the fact that success is crucial to a child's self-esteem and confidence. That is why sport is important in the school curriculum and playing games is only part of it.  The game was always the fifth part of the lesson on physical activity.  It was the time when the children put it into effect &mdash; chur i bhfeidhim mar a glaoamhar ar an uair sin.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report although I have not read it in detail.  I look forward to speaking to my colleagues in the education area.  I would welcome an invitation to the INTO to become involved <Col N="521" /> because we are committed to developing this area.  It is important for people to come together to develop structures which will work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for sharing his time.  I agree with everything he said, which might be a cause of concern to him.  I welcome the report which is a model in terms of the extensive consultations and the speed with which it was published.  Given the amount of work which went into it, this is impressive.  I hope it will enhance the profile of sport and the place of sports policy in this country.</P>
      <P>Although we thought we knew a little about sport, we will learn a lot from this report about our current and future positions.  The general principles underlying it are sound.  I also welcome the gender proofing, even if the title of chairperson was not included.  I am also struck by the emphasis on access to sport for people with disabilities. Independent of the pride we all took in the performance of our Special Olympics team, one of the most commendable features of this report is that it takes cognisance of the needs of people with disabilities.  I agree with Senator Lanigan that there is too much of the top down tone about this, despite the consultation.  There need not be any exclusivity between top down and bottom up, it is a matter of getting the balance right.</P>
      <P>The GAA is the most extraordinary, voluntary, amateur sporting organisation in the world.  It does not matter what one thinks of the politics of the organisation, it has been a sporting phenomenon. One would not want to lose the enthusiasm, energy and local ideals Senator Naughten spoke of which have been essential to the GAA's success. We should learn from this home grown success and not think that we must always look abroad for inspiration.  Michael Cusack has come in for a lot of criticism in literature, however, one of his driving motives was to bring sport to the people.  That was a subversive sentiment at that time.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the ordinary person who just wants to take part in sport for fun or recreation must also be provided with the means for taking part.  I also agree with him about the unique role that sport can play in combating drug abuse and crime and that resources invested are well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has suggested a dozen priorities for the allocation of resources.  These will not be achieved on the budget that is available.  The Minister talked about the appointment of local sports development officers on a pilot basis at local level in specific disadvantaged areas to promote sport for young people and develop sport as a catalyst for social inclusion, crime prevention and job creation.  He also stated that the Government allocated £1.6 million in the budget for these structures.  There is no comparison between the ambition of the objective and the amount of money spent by the Government.  How much will be allocated for sporting development in the area <Col N="522" /> programmes which come under EU funding?  The resources are not adequate for the job which needs to be done, given the centrality of emphasis on sport as a means of combating social deprivation. What scale is envisaged and how central is the sports dimension to the area programmes? I suspect this has not been adequately appreciated up to now.</P>
    <P>At the elite sporting level it seems bizarre that we do no have a 50 metre swimming pool.  The report states that we have 95 swimming pools. This is grossly inadequate for the size of the population.  Swimming pools help to break down class barriers and ought to be a crucial part of an infrastructure for civilised recreation.  No Government can say it is serious about a sports programme unless it announces an extensive, specific building programme.</P>
    <P>Government intervention is necessary in deprived areas where there has to be a top down approach.  One of the reasons these areas are deprived is that they do not have the energy, resources, ability or perspective at ground level. The GAA has had an intellectual input, conceptual capacity and financial resources partly due to the input of teachers.  This is lacking in deprived areas.  We should not get in the way of voluntary activity.  However, we should focus resources on areas which do not have a similar, voluntary infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Since we have great potential for developing recreation and sport, it is important to establish a hierarchical approach to priorities.  The Minister's intentions are admirable but we do not have the resources to achieve them.  Political decisions will have to be made in terms of deciding priorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that sports development can no longer be left to drift along in a loose, unco-ordinated fashion; it is too important and too complex for that.  He said he was struck that there was no clear, coherent plan for the development of Irish sport.  I agree with this.  To my shame I was not aware of the work of the sport section of the Department of Education until he brought it to the public's attention.  Raising the profile of this section is the first step to achieving the results one wishes.</P>
    <P>Reading this section of the Minister's speech it appeared that it was a microcosm of national performance.  There have been marvellous individual performances from wonderfully dedicated people.  However, much more could be achieved if we had a strategy and framework and the drive that comes from consistency.  I welcome the Minister's contribution and this report.  I trust that we will go forward in the context of sustainable development.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents and teachers have always been involved in organising sport for young people.  We must congratulate teachers who have performed this task outside their normal working hours and <Col N="523" /> without being paid.  The Minister's plan finally recognises the role that is being played by parents and teachers.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a sports mad country.  I remember getting up early in 1956 to listen to the commentary on Ronnie Delaney running in the Olympics in Melbourne.  I also remember coming to Dublin in 1959 to watch Johnny Giles play his first game for Ireland and score the winning goal against Sweden.  That was the year after Brazil beat Sweden in the World Cup.  I came to the Down v Offaly game in the 1960s.  Those were fabulous times.  I won a medal in the all Ireland Hospitals Final in Croke Park in 1967.  One never forgets these events.</P>
    <P>For 12 years I worked with children in Gaelic football and soccer.  The role of volunteers is very important.  I congratulate the Minister of State on these first steps.  If this is to be called the Allen plan, the Minister of State deserves it because he is the first person to try to do something about this situation.  There is much in the strategy I agree with.  There are other areas in which improvements could be made, but the spirit of the report is right.  It intends to advance matters for the good of everybody.</P>
    <P>There are bad aspects of sport that need to be addressed.  In last year's All-Ireland final one saw fighting among the teams.  A lot of young people look up to someone like Paul Gascoigne and there was a big response to his beating his wife when drunk or in bad humour.  These are horrible aspects of sport that cannot be ignored, although sport is ultimately for fun.  My postman is Danny McDaid, who ran in two Olympics for Ireland. He had no athletics track in Letterkenny so he ran over the hills and fields.  He is now heavily involved with the local athletics club on a voluntary basis, putting in many hours there.  These are the people we must praise because they do a tremendous job and children look up to them. There was very little help or training for those people and the Minister of State has addressed that issue.</P>
    <P>Success is uplifting in any county.  I was working in a psychiatric hospital when Donegal won the All-Ireland final in 1992.  There was a great feeling of euphoria for two moths after the game and the rate of admissions to the local psychiatric hospital dropped dramatically because every one was in good form.  It was a major achievement and the feel good factor was unbelievable.  Six weeks before the Ulster final, an old man was brought in with severe depression and we could do nothing with him.  A young man from his town played a blinder in the Ulster final and won the man of the match award.  After listening to the game, the old man was discharged the following day in fabulous form.  That is what sport can do for people.</P>
    <P>The report makes reference to drug abuse.  The major abuse among schoolchildren and in sport is drinking.  Drugs are not as great a problem here. Too much attention is given to the drinks companies <Col N="524" /> and too much emphasis is placed on drinking. Unless we address that matter soon, it will introduce young people to hard drug abuse.  Children are drinking from between 12 and 14 years of age and it is sometimes a culture in sports.  If young people win a competition, one will find a number of them drinking behind a wall before the evening ends.  That drink culture and the advertising of drink must be looked at.  I congratulate the Derry City soccer club because recently they ran a campaign in support of the Northland centre for alcohol rehabilitation.  They carried that insignia on their jerseys for two years and there was an unbelievable response to it. Unfortunately, they wore Smithwick's on their jerseys for two years after that.</P>

      <P>We will wait and see.  Tourism is also mentioned in this document.  Sport has a lot to offer in this area, especially golf.  There are large numbers coming to the country to play golf and they bring their spouses.  The Minister of State in his speech said that there are 8,000 full-time jobs involved in sport, with possibly 11,000 involved overall.  When one considers the services that have to support the sports facilities the employment is probably more than that.  A figure of £560 million has been mentioned, but with the Minister of State's approach that could be doubled in a two to three years.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the national strategy group set up by the Minister of State because it has brought in the views of all sides on sport.  While people may criticise the document, it is the first step to a co-ordinated approach to sport and I congratulate everybody involved in it.  I will call it the Allen plan because the Minister of State deserves respect for what he has done.  He goes out of his way to be present at sporting occasions and is very approachable if one seeks help or lottery funding for a facility.</P>
      <P>When one mentions high performance athletes one thinks of Michelle Smith and Sonia O'Sullivan. I mention a girl about 15 miles from my town, Bridie Lynch of St. Johnston, who won the only gold medal Ireland took in this year's Special Olympics.  The only facilities she can use are in Letterkenny, where the track is not great and she is to be seen doing much of her training on the roads.  Despite that she won a gold medal.  Sadly, her sight has failed but she is up with some of the best so-called normal athletes.  She is to be congratulated and the Minister of State's plan is to help people like that.  The disabled are getting very involved in sport, and those nurses and coaches who work with them are very interested in seeing better facilities provided for them.  This plan is moving in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also commend the community games, which is a 32-county organisation.  For years they have done unbelievable work for community relations north and south of the Border.  I am familiar with <Col N="525" /> the Ulster situation, where finals can be held in Donegal one year, Cavan the next and Derry the year after that.  Sport is good for cross-Border relations.  Schoolboy soccer is very organised in the Donegal-Derry area.  The Ulster League has participation from North and South, which is good for ongoing relations and should be commended.</P>
    <P>The report mentions recreational sport, and this must be the first time we have looked at people who are not involved in sport.  Those like myself who are considering retirement need to consider walking or some activity.  There should be a planned approach to this, such as an area for people to jog or walk around.  If people decide to take that opportunity they need to see there is support for them.  If they decide to start walking at 50 they should be able to go and get a programme that suits them rather than having to do it themselves, perhaps having a heart attack.  I commend the Minister of State on the inclusion of recreational sport.</P>
    <P>With high-performance sport, one is again looking at the Olympic stars; but the people who have missed out should be considered.  We have had tremendous athletes but we have lost out because of the lack of facilities and coaching, on which issues the report is very strong.</P>
    <P>I also commend the Minister of State's antidrug strategy.  However, the Minister should not take his eye off the ball in relation to the drink situation; it is of great importance when it comes to young people.</P>
    <P>The plan should look at provincial and county situations as well as the national one.  Every county is not going to have its own first class facility.  That is not possible in a country as small as Ireland.  In relation to my own home town, the Urban District Council in Letterkenny recently bought 37 acres of prime land with the intention of developing it as a sports facility.  Perhaps the next time the Minister visits Letterkenny he could have a look at the land and take a message back to the sports strategy group to see what can be done to upgrade the existing facilities.  We are competing with Northern Ireland, facilities across the Border in Derry are vastly superior to what we have in Donegal.  We have a number of clubs in County Donegal, one of which is the Finn Valley athletic club.  They went to Cork last Sunday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair play to you.  Clubs are invited to competitions in Europe, but because they have to raise funds on a voluntary basis they do not have the facilities or the financial assistance in Ireland to enable them to participate. They lose out because of that.  ILAM are another group with which Roddy Gaynor is involved.  Mr. Gaynor visited Letterkenny recently to view the sporting facilities which we have; he has offered to help us in relation to those.  Perhaps with the <Col N="526" /> assistance of Mr. Gaynor and the Minister, we can find a way to move forward.</P>
      <P>Sports councils are also very important.  It is important that each county would have its own sports council which would bring all the various sporting groups together and ascertain their views.  If we adopt a planned approach we will not have a mish mash of developments going on in different places with separate groups wanting to have their own space.  If the proper approach and facilities are available, people will travel to take advantage of them.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the training agencies in his report.  One has to commend FÁS and the local soccer clubs in this country for the way in which they have co-ordinated the approach in relation to soccer; young players are brought on board for a year at a time and are coached by qualified coaches.  The GAA in Donegal employed one coach a number of years ago; they now employ three because of the high level of interest from schools and young people in general. Young people want to pursue careers in soccer or Gaelic games and if qualified coaches were employed, they would receive proper training.</P>
      <P>I think it is very important to keep volunteers involved in the area of sport.  They have been important throughout the years and have received absolutely no financial reward for their work.  I am not saying they should be paid, but I do think it is important that people who volunteer their services and have a good attitude to sport should be kept involved.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's plan.  Sports co-ordination, through the linkage of various groups which the Minister spoke about, is the right way forward.  I would like the Minister to look at the situation in relation to drink and advertising in the area of sport.  I would like to see more attention being given to people with disabilities in relation to sport.  I welcome the Minister's views on co-operation with Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Sport gives tremendous satisfaction and enjoyment to people of all ages.  It is a means of education and a means of discipline for young people at an early stage in life.  I hope the Minister succeeds with his plan and I wish him success when he becomes a Minister with responsibility for sport solely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Minister's document in the House today. I also welcome the fact that my own party has also recently produced a discussion document in relation to the future of sport.  All Governments to date have paid lip service to the area of sports funding.  The Minister's document is tremendous in its aspirations.  I do not intend any disrespect to the Minister but in a reply he gave to a recent Dáil question he said that in the last year about £15 million and 16 per cent of lottery surplus was the total figure provided for sports expenditure. The reason for the establishment of the national lottery in the first instance was the development of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> The Minister's suggestion and that of my own party that there should be a Minister for Sport is one I totally agree with.  This would be compatible with the development of many other issues in our society.  I believe that a sports ministry would be cost effective.  We have already seen the kind of tourism development which happens through sport.  Earlier today I listened to the chairman of Bord Fáilte talking about extending the tourist season.  There is no better way to extend the season than through sport.  In my own constituency an extraordinary number of hotels have been built in recent years because of the investment in golf by Bord Fáilte and other agencies. We are now reaping the benefits of that. There are many other facets of sport which could be developed in order to extend the tourist season. On an economic basis, the development of such an idea would be an absolute winner.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area of health, I think the development of a proper sports policy in this area would also prove cost effective.  I hope we have the opportunity to have the Minister back in the House again before the summer for a longer debate because I know many Members would like to expand on some of these issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney mentioned the relationship between sport and crime, drink and drugs.  One cannot put a price on what volunteers are doing on the ground in every local community in a wide area of sports.  They contribute to the quality of life we all enjoy in our towns and villages.  The efforts of individual people, day in, day out in driving young children to and from matches, training them and so on has a tremendously beneficial effect.  I welcome the Minister's efforts in relation to encouraging volunteer participation.</P>
    <P>I would like to see tax breaks and tax incentives provided in this area.  The Minister's scarce resources should be used to develop sports at a local level.  At the higher level of sports achievement, I hope the Minister can come up with some tax incentives to develop better facilities.  When one sees what has happened in the Temple Bar and Custom House Docks area with regard to the incentives provided for urban renewal, one wonders why similar incentives cannot be provided in the area of sports facilities.  If the Minister offers the right incentive, he will find the right kind of investment.  If not, we will still be here 20 years from now looking for a national stadium, a national swimming pool or some other facility. Over the period of three or four years, several parts of Dublin which were falling into disrepair have been rejuvenated because the right tax incentives were offered.  Dublin, the capital of social activities, is now the envy of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>That has happened over a short period of time and I have no doubt that if the proper incentives were put in place we would have the national facilities we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> I want to commend the Minister's efforts in relation to the development of minority sports. The idea of a &ldquo;house of sport&rdquo; is a fantastic one and should be developed.  There are many kinds of minority sports and it is very difficult for people involved in these sports to get funding or sponsorship because they do not have a profile. My brother would kill me if I did not mention that the Minister is a cricket supporter and hopefully will continue to be.  The Minister's efforts in relation to cross-Border co-operation in the area of sports are very praiseworthy.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of training basketball teams for 16 years on a voluntary basis and of travelling throughout Europe and the world with them.  It was embarrassing to see the facilities in other countries as compared with the very basic ones here.  Perhaps the Minister in his summing up could give his own views as to whether he would be willing to encourage the Government and the Minister for Finance to allow investors into the area of sport.  I supported one such proposal for which Fingal County Council has given permission. With private investment of up to £400 million and £25 million from the State we could provide several national centres, indoor arenas and a stadium.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil discussion document, which I was involved in drafting and which I fully support, points out the ludicrous planning laws which allow for up to 3,000 houses to be built without any commitment to community facilities.  In my constituency I have been involved in proposals for the development plan.  More and more people object to 3,000 houses or 200 or 300 houses being built&mdash;as has happened in Dublin and Cork&mdash; without account being taken of the need for recreational facilities.  Fifteen or 20 years later State services are dealing with all sorts of problems in these areas.  The basic cry from public meetings, attended by 1,000 people or more, is for a small hall or somewhere to meet.  Within the planning laws and the development plan reviews the Department should be encouraging a commitment by developers to provide basic community facilities for new developments.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to criticise the Minister, it is unreasonable to suggest that what is outlined in the sports strategy and the Fianna Fáil discussion document can be achieved with the resources available to the Minister at present.  It is not possible. I am aware of the level of applications received by the Department for national lottery funding, each as deserving as the other but, at the end of the day, there is a small cake to give out. No Government has given the type of resources needed to develop sport.  I cannot understand how every Minister and Government talks in glowing terms about the value of sport but gives it a secondary status in budgetary considerations. The only way to secure the resources needed for the development of facilities and to ensure that our top athletes are provided for is by having a sports Minister in the Cabinet.  This would <Col N="529" /> emphasise the importance of sport in terms of economics, tourism, health and crime.</P>
    <P>During the Olympic Games or world games the pressure is on the Minister to provide funding and facilities but resources are scarce.  Schemes can be introduced to help the Michelle Smiths.  Companies and individuals should invest in sports people as they do in property.  The Department's scarce resources should be allocated to encouraging and developing participation at local level.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in achieving his aims and I hope we will have a chance to elaborate further on this matter.  The contributions have been supportive of the Minister.  I would like the Minister to bring forward plans for tax incentives and reform of the planning laws.  There are certain parts of the city where there are between 3,000 and 5,000 houses accommodating 20,000 to 30,000 people with not even a hall to meet in never mind an area big enough to play a game of basketball.  That is wrong and we can change it by introducing legislation and insisting that the Minister has a role in ensuring basic facilities are provided for the development of sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Wright for sharing time.  I have a direct interest in this issue.  I have participated in sport but when I was young such facilities were minute compared to today.  I did the marathon three times in comparatively inglorious times but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I believe the classical maxim, <i>mens sana in corpore sano.</i>  A balance between social, intellectual and physical prowess is necessary for the proper development of the individual and the State.</P>
      <P>I have been involved with DISC&mdash;the Dublin International Sports Council &mdash; and it has not always seen eye to eye with the Minister.  I am impressed that the most recent edition of its newsletter, Discuss, volume 1, No. 2, March 1997, gives a ringing endorsement to the Minister's plan.  There are slight variations in what they would like to see.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this and the excellent discussion document they produced.  Some of the ideas may be far fetched, such as a Dublin Olympics, but it is useful to look at their detailed report.  Even if holding the Olympics in Dublin is not in the immediate future, we should not exclude it completely. If we make a commitment to provide first class facilities we may attract major international events which would have an enormous impact.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated what this kind of impact is and few of us may have realised this.  He said sport and related activities accounted for around £560 million or 2 per cent of GDP.  This is a grey area as the actual amount is £225 million rising to £560 if all related areas such as tourism are taken into account.  Two per cent of GDP is a very significant amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago I visited the Czech Republic. The Minister for Defence there told us they were committed to an increase of 0.5 per cent of GNP on military spending.  This was regarded as an <Col N="530" /> enormous amount of money.  Therefore, although 2 per cent seems small, it is a very considerable sum and indicates how important sport is economically as well as culturally and health wise.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the need for an all-Ireland approach to the promotion of sport.  That is very important.  It is one way in which the divisions on the island can be healed.  However, I see a practical difficulty.  Does it mean that British lottery money will be allocated to all-Ireland projects south of the Border?  If money was made available by the national lottery, would it have to be for projects south of the Border?  Will there be any really flexible negotiations?  It would be a wonderful, imaginative departure if this kind of co-operation could be achieved and it would prove a major force for sports facilities if funding from another jurisdiction were available. However, I am not sure this is practical or possible.</P>
    <P>The national lottery was originally envisaged as a sports lottery.  However, the terms are so wide that, as somebody said recently, the Minister could punt it all on the grand national without being impugned.  There is nothing to stop him doing that, and that is a pity.  We need dedicated resources for sport.  They should be dedicated and clear.  I speak as a beneficiary of the theft of lottery money from sport to cultural matters.  Every group needs funding but it seems to me that money should go to sport from a lottery which was established for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I notice the reference to a 50 metre training pool.  Why not build a real, international swimming pool?  The Minister knows perfectly well what I mean.  I am talking about a matter I raised here, the interest in an international swimming hall of fame.  When three gold medals were won at Atlanta, it is not enough to have a tentative proposal for a 50 metre paddling pool.  We need the real thing and we will give the Minister every support in his battles to get approval for this type of facility.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Wright when he said that we need a Minister for Sport at Cabinet level.  The Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Government side for facilitating my wish to speak on this matter.</P>
      <P>I welcome this important report.  John Treacy and his colleagues are to be congratulated not only on its content but on the fact that it was produced in just over a year.  That is quite an achievement on their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made criticisms about the circulation of reports on the Order of Business and this is one of those to which I referred.  It is important that <Col N="531" /> we, as Members of the Seanad, receive copies of reports when they are published, that we actually see reports and know their contents when we ask for them to be debated.  The report was circulated within the past few days but that could have been done earlier and that is a matter the Minister might think about in future.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the report are very laudatory and nobody could take particular exception to them, but implementation will be the measure of its success.  Previous reports have mouldered on shelves in Departments and not been acted on, so we look to the Minister and his successors, whoever they may be, to implement this report.</P>
    <P>The question of funding is central.  In that respect it is possible to look on the funding of sporting facilities as good investment apart altogether from its benefits to athletes or spectators. There is a capital benefit to the country and it is this: if moneys are invested in state of the art facilities, particularly of an international calibre, there is the capacity to generate extra tourism revenue and thereby pay for these facilities. There is a good case to be made for a joint approach by the sporting bodies, private enterprise and the Government to the funding of the capital costs of some of these facilities.  The World Equestrian Games spring to mind as an example of where facilities at Punchestown, County Kildare, will be improved and there will be a huge influx of foreign revenue from tourism which can only be beneficial to the country.  It is to the credit of the Minister and Nissan, the sponsor, that the project has been saved.  It is a very valuable project and I am glad the event will take place.</P>
    <P>Angling should be considered a sport.  It has enormous tourism potential and capital costs are low provided the waters and the basic facilities are protected.</P>
    <P>As to the matter of a 50 metre pool, I agree with Senator Norris who, said that there was much congratulatory talk in the Seanad when Michelle Smith won three gold medals and it was right to congratulate her but the international swimming hall of fame proposal must be resolved. The Minister in a reply to my Dáil colleagues on 14 November said that following receipt of the strategy group's report this year, he would be in a position to make recommendations to the Government on the question of the provision of a 50 metre pool.  We look forward to an early decision on that matter.  A training pool is not the right answer.  If we have facilities of a proper international calibre, it will attract people to the country and that will be of economic and sporting benefit.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the national lottery and the way in which that funding is allocated and I would agree with some of the comments which were made in that regard.  When one considers the number of leisure centres which are springing up all over the country, it is obvious that it is possible to build sporting and leisure facilities <Col N="532" /> which operate at a profit.  If it were not possible, private enterprise would not do it, so there is a message there for us.  There is an obvious need for partnership between local authorities, Government and the private sector to develop the type of facilities required.  Kildare County Council owns swimming pools but it does not seem to able to operate them at a profit.  It is not a good idea to have 25 metre pools all over the country.  They will not be used and they will operate at a loss.  Everybody wants them until they are erected and then you find out how many people actually use them.  There seems to be some lack of conjunction between the demand for swimming pools and the number of people using them.</P>
    <P>On the question of facilities, I have been involved with the IRFU for 25 years.  I have refereed rugby football to a senior level and I am fairly familiar with the way the IRFU hierarchy operates.  Its great benefit of course is that it is an all-Ireland body and that has led to greater understanding and helped the peace process. However, I am worried about the degree to which the corporate sector is becoming dominant.  I think I have missed three internationals since 1958.  I started buying ten year tickets 20 years ago when it cost me £150 for a seat in the lower west stand at Lansdowne Road.  I accept the reality that money must play a part in sport and we need it as a source of funding; but to renew that ticket for three years will now cost £1,250. There is something wrong with that.  It is actually having an effect on the performance on the field. I have had corporate bankers sit beside me at important five nations' championship rugby internationals and talk business throughout the entire match.  That is not satisfactory.  I do not know what the Minister can do about it.  The reality is that money talks and it buys the seats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am about to make.  The report talks about a lack of co-ordination. Surely it should be possible to have a national stadium.  Parc des Princes, which is to be closed, has been talked about and the national stadium in Cardiff &mdash; not Cardiff Arms Park &mdash; is to be turned around 90 degrees and a new stadium built.  But there is a capacity in Ireland, between the IRFU, the FAI and, ideally, the GAA &mdash; because it is a summer sport and rugby is a winter sport &mdash; to build a national stadium of a calibre which will allow people to go to a game at reasonable cost.  The lesson from Paris is that Parc des Princes is a municipal stadium and it is shared by soccer and rugby.  It holds matches on a weekly basis.  That is how those facilities can be made viable and the ordinary punter can have access to them.  There are no corporate boxes at Parc des Princes and there never will be.  I do not know about the new stadium which is being built near Charles de Gaulle Airport, but corporate boxes are springing up in the other stadia.  That is a matter to which the authorities must attend; <Col N="533" /> how do we get into those facilities young people who want to go and see their heroes play?  All the seats at the front of the stands at Murrayfield were reserved for school children last Saturday. That is how children become involved in sport. They can look up to sports stars but they must not be corralled into one corner of Lansdowne Road.</P>
      <P>Finally, there is the matter of the IOC and how the funding will be distributed.  What happened at Atlanta, where Sonia O'Sullivan was seated with these people who were arguing about what happened and who did what, was an absolute disgrace. The Minister is familiar with the matter and he knows the story.  It is indicative of several bodies where the internal politics of the organisation totally overwhelm their commitment to the sport, their delivery of service to the sport and what they should be doing for the sports people and the spectators.  There is as much and may be more politics in sport as in these Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the document and the debate in the community at large on the question of sport.  Given the limited time available I will concentrate on women's participation in sport.  I welcome the highlighting of the issue of the involvement of women in sport in the document and its proposals in that regard, including a task force, research, the encouragement of the adoption of a code of equal opportunities for women and the development of programmes to ensure the greater involvement of women in all aspects of sport.  We must ensure these proposals are not just aspirational.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the sporting culture is not as strong among women as among men, although there have been superlative performances by women in swimming and athletics, in particular Sonia O'Sullivan, Catherina McKiernan and Michelle Smith.  In many other sports, such as soccer and rugby, women are only now beginning to participate.  The GAA does not have a very high level of participation by women but is probably better in this regard than the other two football codes.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State must ensure that a good level of funding is applied to training, coaching and other facilities for women.  For example, in soccer clubs that have a women's team, it has to wait until all the matches for the other teams, from senior to junior levels, have been scheduled before it can use the playing pitch.  It is important that women get equal priority for coaching and facilities.  This will not happen by accident, but only by design.</P>
      <P>Women of my age did not generally have great opportunities to participate in sport and many of them are now taking up activities such as swimming, aerobics or hill walking and getting great enjoyment from them.  It is very important that today's young girls have the opportunity to participate in sports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the points made about building a 50 metre swimming pool.  Every effort should be <Col N="534" /> made to get funds for it.  It does not have to be located in Dublin and I will support the bid by the National Coaching and Training Centre at the University of Limerick.  I also support Senator Dardis's point about different sports sharing facilities so that the best possible facilities might be obtained at local and national level.  The local sports fora that are proposed may be effective in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions which I found informative.  There was a wide consultation process in the production of the policy document but issues were raised in the debate which will give us food for thought.  The document was described as aspirational but it is also functional.  I am committed to implementing it and I think it can be implemented in total with existing resources and some additional funding which need not necessarily come from the public sector.</P>
      <P>I thank the officials in the Department, who were very supportive of the idea of a root and branch examination of sport and related issues.  I decided that a plan should be formulated because I realised that the resources available were not adequate to fund sport.  Just as a businessman without a plan would not get money from a bank, a Minister without a plan would not get the resources needed to fund sport.  The plan has been formulated and the structures are in place to implement it.  An additional £1.6 million is available to fund the expertise and the structures needed for the implementation.  The policy is functional.</P>
      <P>There is a misapprehension that only a limited amount of funding is available for sport each year.  The document indicates that there is approximately £150 million worth of Government spending on sport across a range of Departments. The Department of the Marine supports sailing and other marine activities, the Department of Defence supports equestrianism and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, through FÁS, puts a large amount of money into coaching and other sports-related activities.  We had to quantify the resources available and decide on the optimum method to invest them.</P>
      <P>I would not agree that the plan will operate from the top down.  Page five of the document indicates that the goal of the policy is to develop a healthy broad base from which the system may grow.  I am committed to investing in sport at community and club level.  This will ensure that the best will rise to the top if they wish and, at the same time, tens of thousands will get enjoyment from sport at community and club level.  If there is talent at that level we will have structures in place to support those who want to get to the top in sport.  The plan is broad based and it deals with the elite sports people as well as young people in sport and sport in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the issue of exclusion.  In response to Senator Lee, in particular, <Col N="535" /> I would point out that through the urban initiative which deals with some areas in Cork and Dublin cities and some of the initiatives related to the task force on drugs, resources are being directed from areas other than sport and the Department of Education.  With regard to tackling exclusion and drug abuse, resources are being drawn in from other areas.  There is a realisation that the problem of drugs and crime among young people can be tackled in a preventative way rather than by building more prisons and employing more prison officers.  We must employ initiatives to prevent the problems arising and investment in those initiatives would reduce the need for spending on other services.  One guiding principle is the protection of volunteerism, because without those adults who drive young people to matches, 52 weeks a year, sport would collapse.</P>
    <P>Sport has the potential to raise even more tourism revenue.  Our tourism season is now extending to nine months of the year, mainly because of the development of our fishing, golfing and other leisure activities.  I am sorry that because so many issues were raised, time only allows me to deal briefly with them.</P>
    <P>I applaud what the GAA has done.  It gave us back our national pride in its early days and has always reacted to the changing needs of Irish society.  It is in the forefront of the development of coaching systems.  From its own resources the association employs 80 development officers/coaches and invests £1 million per year in coaching structures alone.  The GAA's work must be recognised, not just in terms of sport but in keeping our young people occupied.  I also acknowledge the association's input into the development plan and it is represented on the council in the person of Mr. Mulvihill.</P>
    <P>As to DISC and the 50 metre pool, the strategy group's terms of reference included investigating the need for coaching, training and development and the provision of facilities.  I agree with its proposal that we should have a 50 metre training pool.  When we have the resources and the luxury to develop a 50 metre competition pool, coupled with a hall of fame or museum as proposed by ISOF, I would be delighted to provide it and I hope someone will.  In the context of the resources currently available, my priority is for the provision of facilities at community and club level and for the development of coaching and training.  If we start from that principle, I believe all the other things will follow.  That is why the Treacy group proposed a 50 metre training pool and I will investigate that proposal as quickly as possible.  The suggestion that such a pool would be a paddling pool shows a lack of understanding.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten mentioned the challenge which pay television poses to sporting organisations, and although that is not part of the report I believe I should respond.  It causes me concern that the international media can now seriously impact on sport.  When a sport organises itself, it <Col N="536" /> will be reactive rather than pro-active; one major organisation had international convulsions because of the impact of the international media. I raised this issue during our Presidency because I felt it had to be dealt with in a pan-European way, rather than by each country reacting on its own.  Having said that, we have set up a working party between the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Enterprise and Employment and my Department to look at the issues involved.  In conjunction with that, the matter is now being dealt with at European level and I hope detailed proposals on this major problem will be made sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Women in sport is one of the key issues in the report and the impediments and obstacles to their involvement at participatory, administrative and management levels must be examined.  These were highlighted by the Brighton conference two years ago and by a number of women's organisations I met.  The women's group will be set up immediately and will be representative of women's organisations, women in sport, the Special Olympics and the Sports Council.  I will ask them to report within a maximum period of one year and we will take the matter from there.</P>
    <P>As a gesture of my good faith on this matter I recently announced an initiative on camogie to show that my Department and I are interested in promoting women's sport, and camogie is one of our indigenous sports.  Some months ago I announced that every camogie club in the country would receive a set of helmets.  That might seem a small matter but it is a big one for individual clubs and for parents who want to get their children involved.  I hope we can have a further initiative this year.  The core issue of overcoming the impediments will be tackled quickly.</P>
    <P>The only people who can claim success are the organisations, the athletes and their families and supporters.  No Minister or sports leader should claim the success of the individuals who have brought honour to this country.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Naughten, I am concerned about the lack of facilities for young people at parish and community levels.  The demands total over £500 million and the requests for grants total about £48.2 million, but my budget is £6 million per year.  One of the first things we are doing is to ensure the facilities currently available are being used to their maximum potential.  Where there are impediments to accessing the facilities we will seek that they be tackled.  Many excuses are given for closing facilities from Friday to Monday and after 5 p.m.  One such excuse is insurance.  While that is a problem, I believe it can be overcome by flexibility and openness between the managers of facilities and the clubs and organisations who wish to operate them.  I have seen numerous examples of clubs taking out their own insurance and as a result gaining access to facilities.  There may be a demand for a facility costing £500,000 while a facility not far away is closed for much of the time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> There are a number of outdoor pursuit and education/adventure centres; they are excellent projects and there have been requests for funding for further centres.  I have asked a review group to address the question as to when an outdoor pursuit centre is an education or sports centre and when it becomes a tourist attraction.  On receipt of the group's report, which it will issue soon, I will make a decision quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter said involvement in sport often conflicted with academic achievement but I do not believe there is a conflict.  People who become involved in sport are highly motivated and disciplined and academic achievement follows. However, sport and physical recreation activity do not receive accreditation in the education system and as a result are devalued.  This matter is addressed in the report and will be dealt with as quickly as possible with regard to the NCBA.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole's assertion that sport should be extended to include body movement and flexibility and that such activities should start almost from the cradle.  I have seen in New Zealand models and examples of programmes of physical recreation from the day the child is born and involving both parents.</P>
    <P>The task force on drugs, raised by Senator Lee, will be put in place immediately in conjunction with the Sports Council of Northern Ireland. Senator Maloney referred to drink and sport and drink advertising.  The drinks industry provides major investment in and support for sport.  There must be a limit on the type of advertising that takes place and there is a sensitivity regarding this among the drinks manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The huge tourism potential, referred to by Senator Maloney, can be marketed even more in our quest to get the Ryder Cup for 2005.  The quality of our courses and infrastructure will be a major selling point.  The bid is with the authorities and the group appointed to continue with it is meeting today.  We must not be complacent, despite the favourable responses.</P>
    <P>On the question of sports for those with special needs, the Special Olympics have been getting support.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has embarked on an initiative to bring them to Ireland in 2003.  An all party group is working on it.  If they are brought here it will not only put Ireland on the sporting map but will also act as a target for those who are handicapped in different ways but who can enjoy sport.  I was privileged to attend the Special Olympics in New Haven last year when I saw the pride and honour felt by young people in representing their country. Great commitment was also evident at the Para-Olympics which were held last August in Atlanta after the Olympic Games.  They were very successful.</P>
    <P>Senator Wright raised the issue of tax incentives and the involvement of the private sector in the development of sports facilities.  This is dealt with in the report.  Once the structures are in place all the relevant ideas will be put to the test. <Col N="538" /> I am confident that with imagination and flexibility we can attract substantial private sector investment.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised a number of points which I have answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>How about talks with the IOC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have offered the IOC a major role in the decision making process set out by me in the implementation programme in the plan.  It has been invited to participate in the high performance strategy group, which will be the decision making group regarding funding for elite athletes.  It has also been invited to participate in a broader decision making process, which I hope it will accept.  It will now enjoy a broader input to the development of sport in this country than hitherto.</P>
      <P>I hope we will all co-operate in a positive manner in addressing the needs of the most important people in sport, who are our athletes at all levels. I also hope that there will be a positive response from the IOC, as there has been from most of the federations that have contacted my office since we published the report.</P>
      <P>While there are questions regarding the working of the mechanics of the new system, my concern is for the welfare of those participating in sport.  Our actions will show that our priority is with them.  Getting more people involved in sport at community and parish level is also a priority. The strategies I have set out will ensure this.  I thank all Senator who contributed to this debate, to those who formulated the report and to the officials in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), lines 24 to 39, to delete the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;disability&rsquo; means the impact on an individual of a duly recognised physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment which affects or substantially reduces their prospects of securing, retaining and advancing in employment; and' physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment' means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the total or partial loss of a person's bodily or mental functions, including the loss of a part of a person's body, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> (b) the presence in the body of organisms causing or likely to cause chronic diseases or illness, or</P>
    <P>(c) the malfunction, malformation or disfigurement of a part of a person's body, or</P>
    <P>(d) a condition or malfunction which results in a person learning differently from a person without the condition, or</P>
    <P>(e) a condition, illness or disease which affects a person's thought process, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or which results in disturbed behaviour,</P>
    <P>and shall be taken to include impairment which presently exists, or which previously existed but no longer exists, or which may exist in the future or which is imputed to a person;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware, from having looked at the amendments, that we are going over some ground which has already been covered in the Dáil; nevertheless, it is important that we tease out these matters in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I referred on Second Stage to the disquiet among professional organisations involved in the care of people with disabilities about what they perceived as the overly medical definition of disability in the Bill.  I propose to insert into the Bill a statement that disability means &ldquo;the impact on an individual of a duly recognised physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment which affects or substantially reduces their prospects of securing, retaining and advancing in employment&rdquo;. That is followed by a list defining &ldquo;physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment&rdquo; which is already contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I stated on Second Stage that CARE, the association of the parents and friends of mentally handicapped people in Kildare, expressed the opinion that everybody regarded the definition in the Bill as unsuitable and unworkable, particularly in the context of employment.  The members of CARE and of other associations dealing with mental and other handicaps are very anxious that the definition should be amended to a more functional definition of disability.  An alternative definition was sent to the Department which had the backing of ICTU and IBEC.  The chief executive of CARE told me that if the Bill were passed with the medical definition of disability unamended it would be likely to be used in other legislation and that the overall situation would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to view the amendment sympathetically. I am sure he is aware of the alternative amendments proposed by some organisations and I am not saying that this amendment is the only way to deal with the matter.  However, the fundamental point is that the existing definition is a purely medical one which is too restricted and <Col N="540" /> limited.  The amendment seeks to insert a broader definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been helped in the development of this definition by two main sources.  The first is the constructive contributions of interest groups and individuals on the question of a definition of disability for the Bill.  The other source has been the experience in other countries with disabilities legislation.</P>
      <P>When I first looked to develop a definition of disability, I sought to achieve a suitably broad provision.  My intention was to address prejudice in respect of any disability, present, past, future or assumed.  The definition of disability which I have provided in this Bill offers a high degree of clarity and can be practically applied in the legal context.  If I had been preparing a policy document or a sociological report I probably would have opted for a different definition.  I am, however, preparing legislation and I want the definition to be effective and to place within its scope as many people with disabilities as possible.</P>
      <P>When I looked at definitions of disability in other jurisdictions, for example, in the US Americans with Disabilities Act, I was struck by the focus on capacity to perform work.  On examining its application in practice I found that it was underpinned by very extensive medical considerations in the form of regulatory definitions and guidelines.  I was also concerned by the potentially restrictive nature of concepts such as &ldquo;substantially limits one or more major life activities&rdquo; which are central to the US Act.</P>
      <P>I can see, of course, that such a focus, which is replicated in the UK Disability Discrimination Act, 1995, is targeted at the protection of people with more substantial disabilities.  Such persons must be covered by the Bill.  However, I also wanted to ensure protection for persons with lesser disabilities, or none, who can also be subjected to unequal treatment in employment because of prejudicial attitudes related to their condition, or their perceived condition.  For that reason, I was attracted by the Australian definition which has been adopted in the Bill.</P>
      <P>A number of concerns have been raised, however, about the implications of applying the definition in the Bill.  Essentially, the concerns centre around the danger that such a definition will lead to widespread application of medical assessments by employers.  As I mentioned, the approach in other countries, such as the US or UK, to a legal definition of disability in anti-discrimination legislation has not obviated the need for supplementary medical regulatory provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to clarify the real experience of applying a definition such as the one in this Bill, my Department has been in contact with the Australian authorities who have had in place a similar definition since 1992.  The experience of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Australia is that the definition has <Col N="541" /> been widely accepted and that it has not resulted in the introduction of inappropriate medical assessment.  They deliberately avoided any attempt to introduce a definition which would lead to intrusive assessments.  The aim of the Australian authorities, like my own, has been to allow for the widest possible inclusion under their Act.</P>
    <P>It is commendable, as Senator Dardis is proposing, to want to give protection under the Bill to persons whose impairment has a serious disadvantageous impact on their employment prospects. However, the Bill gives this protection under the present definition.  It would diminish the value of the Bill considerably if the definition of disability, while encompassing people with more serious disabilities, excluded from its scope completely people with less serious disabilities.  I am anxious to ensure that many others whose impairment, past, present, future or assumed, has no impact on their capacity to undertake employment will also be able to call on protection against irrational prejudices.  I hope Senators will agree with this approach and that Senator Dardis will withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis' amendment, although the Minister has given a reasonable explanation of the technical reasons he does not feel compelled to accept it.  However, he seems to accept some of the reasoning behind it.  I have received a number of communications from people in this area, although I did not put down an amendment on the matter.  Their clearly expressed concern was that the definition of disability exclusively followed a medical model. They felt this was very limiting and were particularly concerned about the social impact disability might have and they wished to have this included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>They also spoke about the importance of the environment in which they worked.  I wish somebody in this building would take note of that.  I am beginning to get a cold; I do not know why the House is like a greenhouse.  These are not the most inspiring conditions in which to work nor is the telephone ringing in the pocket of one of my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters raised by Senator Norris are not covered by the Bill.  The discussion has gone on at length as to whether the proposal put forward by Senator Dardis or the narrower definition in the Bill is more acceptable.  I have looked closely at the wording and I am very concerned. There is a narrowness as well as the looseness in the definition in the Bill which I will attempt to explain.  I am attracted to Senator Dardis' amendment because the definition of disability means &ldquo;the impact on an individual of a duly recognised physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education service has spent 30 years trying to convince various authorities of the special needs of children to the point where it becomes very difficult to do so and the Minister's Bill does <Col N="542" /> not make it any easier.  The long title of the Bill refers to access to vocational training which is related to education; I have an interest in this.</P>
    <P>Section 2(1)(e) states that disability means &ldquo;a condition, illness or disease which affects a person's thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or which results in disturbed behaviour&rdquo;.  On reading the various clauses of relevance, disability means &ldquo;a condition which affects a person's emotions&rdquo;.  Somebody falling in love could find themselves being described as being disabled by this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The same words are used in Senator Dardis' amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that Senator Dardis takes the precaution of putting in a lead in clause which refers to the impact on an individual and duly recognises impairment.  The example I gave could not be regarded as an impairment.  There is a need for a lead in of that type and to deal with such general issues.  The question of emotional dysfunction is important.  I agree with the Minister that people who have emotional difficulties need to be covered.  I have taken this example to show him that the words used in an attempt to be narrow are loose in certain situations.  The reason the Minister has given for it is to hold it to a definition that is narrow, confined, restricted and therefore, can be implemented.  There is a great deal of logic in that but it does not do that.  The lead in in Senator Dardis' amendment, that the impact on an individual of a duly recognised physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment, is important.  Will the Minister consider this before dismissing the amendment?  It adds substantially to what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis.  The definition would be very wide if it were to read a condition which affects a person's emotions. Senator Dardis' amendment in one respect is more focused because it is a duly recognised impairment which affects or substantially reduces an individual's prospects of securing, retaining and advancing in employment.  That secures the Minister's objective more effectively than the definition in the Bill.  Did the Minister say that what he proposes in this Bill is the Australian definition which has been chosen in preference to other definitions?  Has there been an opportunity to compare the functioning of the legislation in the various jurisdictions which the Minister considered as distinct from comparing the phraseology in the Acts?  Can one say how satisfactorily the legislation has functioned in the different jurisdictions?  Is this preferred in a comparative vacuum in terms of consequences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference between my objective and that of the Minister.  The objective is to ensure people with disability are given the opportunity to seek employment and are not disadvantaged in any way.  I am surprised that all the <Col N="543" /> expert groups in this area appear to be unanimous in what they suggest should be in the Bill and I cannot reconcile that with the resistance to the views of the expert groups.</P>
      <P>It has been drawn to my attention that there are three alternative definitions.  ILO Convention 159, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Disabled Persons, 1983, which was ratified by the Government in 1996, states that &ldquo;a person with a disability means an individual whose prospects of securing, retaining and advancing in employment are substantially reduced as a result of a duly recognised physical, physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment&rdquo;.  The UK Act, referred to by the Minister, defines disability as &ldquo;a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on a person's ability to carry out normal day to day activities&rdquo;. People who have a disability and those who have had a disability but no longer have one are covered by the Act.  The third definition is that disability means &ldquo;any person with an impairment of a physical, sensory, mental or intellectual nature who faces obstacles to participation on equal and equally effective terms with all others in all aspects of life of the community&rdquo;.  That is the draft resolution of the European Council on equality of opportunities for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>A wide spectrum of opinion supports what I say and I am surprised that there appears to be a resistance to the unanimity of view which exists within the organisations caring for people with mental disability in Ireland and which is reinforced by international conventions and laws. The Minister referred to significant mental disability. CARE has placed severely mentally handicapped people in employment in supermarkets and other businesses in Newbridge.  The experiment has been highly successful.  Superficially, one might have said, as recently as five years ago, that it was not possible to do that but it has hugely beneficial effects on the patients, their families and the businesses in which they have become involved.  When there appears to be such unanimity among the caring organisations and a coherence between the various definitions, my main problem is that it is not taken on board in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no unanimity of the type suggested by Senator Dardis; it does not exist.  I had a lengthy meeting with the Disability Federation of Ireland, one of the major organisations catering for people with disabilities whose chief executive is Mr. Roger Acton.  Initially, the federation took a position relatively similar to the line taken by Senator Dardis in the amendment.  I went through that form of definition, which it also put to me, in detail and pointed out its difficulties and shortcomings from the point of view of people with disabilities.  The federation understood the point I was trying to make and went off <Col N="544" /> to consider it.  I received the following letter, dated 20 November 1996:</P>
      <P>Re: Employment Equality Bill, 1996.</P>
      <P>Dear Minister,</P>
      <P>I am writing to you in relation to our meeting last week when we discussed in detail certain aspects of the Employment Equality Bill and in particular the definition of disability for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have now had an opportunity to discuss this issue with my colleagues and members of my board.  We have considered very carefully your arguments in support of the definition as described in the Bill which we find to be persuasive. Given that we are all working together to enhance the employment opportunities of people with disabilities, we feel on reflection that we can now accept the definition as outlined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have arranged to have a copy of this letter sent to the Social Affairs Committee for their information.</P>

      <P>I am so overcome by his campaign so far that perhaps I am thinking too far ahead.  I disagree with his statement that the definition in the Bill is too narrow and narrower than the definition espoused by Senator Dardis.  He mentioned looseness in the Bill.  I fundamentally disagree with him on both issues because the reverse is the position.  The broader definition is the provision in the Bill and the narrower definition is the one espoused in good faith by Senator Dardis. I understand his reasons and I am grateful to him for tabling the amendment because it gives us an opportunity to discuss this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lead in to the provision, which some Members consider a desirable aspect of the definition, relates to the meaning of disability. Some doctors may recognise a condition while others may not recognise it.  The amendment states &ldquo;duly recognised&rdquo; but my definition does not include that term.  Senator Dardis' definition continues &ldquo;which affects or substantially reduces their prospects&rdquo; of obtaining employment.  I do not mind whether their prospects of obtaining employment are substantially or only a little reduced.  The protection of the Bill must extend to a person whose prospects of employment are only somewhat and not substantially reduced, as my definition would require.  One can envisage a <Col N="545" /> situation where a person has a scar which is unsightly.  One could argue that it does not affect their capacity to work.  However, they would be omitted by Senator Dardis' definition because their capacity for work would not be reduced at all, let alone substantially reduced.  Those people require protection.</P>
    <P>The basic distinction between our positions is understandable.  The politically correct wording of Senator Dardis' amendment, although it may be desirable, would be suitable and appropriate in a social report or a learned analytical document. However, the document before the House is not a social report.  It is primary legislation and my objective is to provide the protection of the Bill to the widest possible range of people who need it.  That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Various criticisms have been made of the definition.  However, the one criticism which has never been made is the one I would accept, that is, if anybody criticises the definition contained in the Bill on the basis that it omits an important category of people who will be denied the protection of the legislation and who must be included. I would be most concerned if a shortfall in the definition on that account was pointed out. However, alternative definitions, such as the UK and ILO definitions, which I considered in great detail, omit a huge number of people who are given protection by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis' definition would omit people whose prospects of work are not substantially reduced.  I do not want to do that.  I want to provide the protection of the law to any person with a disability, regardless of whether it substantially, moderately or slightly reduces their prospects of employment, if they are discriminated against on that basis and can establish that to the satisfaction of an equality officer.  These are my reasons for sticking with the definition and I remind Senators that this is a legal document which is not intended to assuage anybody's feelings.  Its intention is to provide legal rights and protection to every person who may need it.  I must have great caution and resist any suggestion of reducing the accessibility of the Bill to the people I seek to protect.</P>

      <P>I have a great weakness for social documents and analytical persuasions which the Minister finds irrelevant in these circumstances. I wish to make a number of points arising from his response.  I also want to be fair all round and to ensure that nobody can be discriminated against on the grounds of any disability. However, I want to strike the fairest possible balance from employers' and workers' points of view.  I have an open mind on this matter in light of the arguments which have been made.  It is important to tease out these aspects as extensively and in as much detail as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the Minister's points on the general covering clause, I do not understand the meaning of &ldquo;duly recognised&rdquo;.  He made a fair point in that regard and I would drop the term if I thought <Col N="546" /> the rest of the phrase was worthwhile.  Perhaps Senator Dardis intends a different definition but the amendment refers to disability, meaning &ldquo;the impact on an individual of a duly recognised physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment which affects or substantially reduces their prospects...&rdquo;.  The Minister made a fair point about the phrase &ldquo;substantially reduces&rdquo;. However, the phrase used in the amendment is &ldquo;affects or substantially reduces&rdquo;, not &ldquo;affects and substantially reduces&rdquo;.  I suggest that the term &ldquo;substantially reduces&rdquo; could be removed and the amendment would then read &ldquo;which affects their prospects&rdquo;.  That would cover people's disabilities be they slight or substantial and the general thrust of the qualification would remain.</P>
    <P>I wish to query the meaning of the term &ldquo;condition&rdquo; used in paragraph (e) as distinct from that of &ldquo;illness or disease&rdquo;.  If the term &ldquo;illness or disease&rdquo; is removed, the paragraph reads &ldquo;a condition which affects a person's thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or which results in disturbed behaviour&rdquo;.  That is an extremely broad definition.</P>

I suspect the phrase &ldquo;a condition&rdquo; opens the possibility of legal action in a number of cases.  I accept and agree with the Minister's desire to be as inclusive as possible. However, I wonder if it is beyond the bounds of legal definition to find a phrase which is not so vulnerable to challenge?</P>

      <P>The Senator also inquired about the American experience regarding definitions.  My Department has been informed by Mr. Bob Silverstein, an adviser in the US Senate, that the case law made by the Americans With Disabilities Act has excluded a considerable number of people from protection because of the requirement to prove an impact on the person's functioning.  My amendment would provide protection to those people who have been excluded by the approach taken in US case law.</P>

      <P>The subject of disability was widely discussed following the publication of the Bill.  To be fair to the Minister and the Government, the Bill was sent to the National Social and Economic Forum for its observations.  Were those <Col N="547" /> observations taken on board and are they incorporated in this definition?  I attended an Irish Congress of Trade Unions conference at which concerns were raised about dyslexia as a disability. Will the Minister confirm that paragraph (d) covers people suffering from dyslexia in terms of discrimination?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Two substantial issues have emerged during this debate.  I am glad the Minister highlighted the point that there is a looseness in the Bill.  However, one must consider the ridiculous interpretations which can be used at certain levels.  As the Minister stated, the Bill is a legal document.  On previous occasions I supported the Minister when people stated that the language used in the Bill was inaccessible.  I pointed out it is a legal document and the language used is not intended to be accessible because such a document requires legal interpretation.</P>
      <P>Having said that, however, I return to my earlier point about &ldquo;a condition which affects a person's emotions&rdquo; which is too loose a definition. Many winners of the national lottery might be disabled in the sense that winning a large prize affects their emotions.  That is on one end of the scale, but consideration must also be given to issues on the other end.</P>
      <P>I concede the Minister's valid point that there is a weakness in the amendment in respect of the term &ldquo;a duly recognised... impairment&rdquo;.  I also believe the use of the word &ldquo;condition&rdquo; is too loose and the section must be dealt with again on Report Stage.  I urge the Minister to indicated the he will reconsider the matter.  Valid issues have been put forward and we want to get it right.  No one is attempting to pull a fast one.  The word &ldquo;condition&rdquo; is too loose in its usage and the term &ldquo;duly recognised&rdquo; is unclear and has created difficulties for many educationalists since 1953 in attempting to describe the problems people experience through their conditions, disorders etc.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis' use of the term &ldquo;impairment&rdquo; creates a certain direction while people will argue that the Minister's use of the phrase &ldquo;illness or disease&rdquo; could be framed somewhat differently in politically correct language.  I put it to the Minister that two significant issues have arisen during the debate on the amendment and I ask him to consider them further before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I support the point raised by Senator O'Toole that it is everyone's intention to ensure that the legislation is good, will be improved if necessary and must secure people's rights under law.  It is important to tease out these matters, and the debate emphasises the fact that we have concentrated on areas on which we might otherwise not have concentrated in respect of the word &ldquo;condition&rdquo;.  I had also intended to raise the issue of dyslexia, to which Senator McGennis referred, and other conditions.  In some cases medical opinion might be divided as <Col N="548" /> to whether a condition actually exists.  I merely wish to explore that area with the Minister, whose reply has allayed some of my fears about the intention behind the wording.  I will await his next reply before considering whether to progress to pressing the matter to a vote.</P>

Are there cases where the manifestation of a disorder might not be regarded as a &ldquo;condition&rdquo; by the medical profession? There seems to be a grey area regarding what is a &ldquo;condition&rdquo; in medical terms.

I do not know the medical answer because I am not a medical person.  The phrase, &ldquo;doctors differ and patients die&rdquo;, could be applied in this case in that there could be disparities of opinion in particular situations.  My definition is meant to be widely based because my objective is to ensure that people who need the protection of this legislation and are reasonably entitled to it are not denied it for definition reasons.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), lines 6 and 7, to delete the definition of &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;sexual orientation&rsquo; means preferences for sexual behaviours which are not prohibited by law;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment attempts to define sexual orientation. I understand the Minister did not wish to use a definition which involved listing either excluded or included sexual behaviours or orientation groups.  The definition he has included is heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual, which is based on New Zealand law.  This was either suggested or supported by GLEN.  However, the equality campaign contacted me and it suggested its preference for the definition, &ldquo;&lsquo;sexual orientation&rsquo; means preferences for sexual behaviours which are not prohibited by law&rdquo;.  I like that for its clarity and also because it gives coherence to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 seeks to amend section 16(4) which states: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring an employer to recruit, retain in employment or promote an individual if the employer is aware, on the basis of a criminal conviction of the individual or other reliable information, that the individual engages, or has a propensity to engage, in any form of sexual behaviour which is unlawful&rdquo;.  The Minister has already included a form of words similar to that which I am proposing.  It seems there would be a legal and stylistic consistency involved if we were to include a definition which is subsequently enshrined by implication in the law.  Amendment No. 2 states: &ldquo;&lsquo;sexual orientation&rsquo; means preferences for sexual behaviours which are not prohibited by law&rdquo;, while the Minister uses the phrase &ldquo;engage, in any form of sexual behaviour which is unlawful&rdquo;.  These seem to be similar but that is coincidental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 seeks to delete &ldquo;other reliable information&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;on the basis of a criminal conviction or information from designated public bodies&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister, who sought to widen the Bill in his earlier definitions, will be persuaded to narrow it because it is open to wide interpretation.  What is reliable information? From what source does this information come?  Could it be construed as third party information from a subjective judgment by a reliable person implementing this?  Could it be a type of visionary information &mdash; a message from one of the persons in the Trinity?  This might be and in some cases is regarded as reliable information. <Col N="550" /> This is so vague and wide it could be susceptible to abuse.  The Minister should make it clear and specific.  It should not read &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; in a subjective sense, but &ldquo;on the basis of a criminal conviction [which is clear and factual] or information from designated public bodies&rdquo;.  In other words, the Minister must determine the reliability of the source of the information and he must be certain about it.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 14 seeks to achieve a different objective from that in amendment No. 12.  Why does section 16(4) refer specifically to &ldquo;sexual behaviour which is unlawful&rdquo;?  If somebody intends employing a person who has a criminal record for murder or a similar serious offence, that should also be taken into account.  I propose to delete the word &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; because any form of unlawful behaviour should be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris's amendment on sexual orientation.  I am also concerned about section 16.  To insert &ldquo;other reliable information&rdquo; amounts to a busybody's charter.  We must be extremely careful not to discriminate against a person based on what someone said.  I am aware that a balance must be struck, but people who might be vulnerable must be protected. If one combines a &ldquo;criminal conviction&rdquo; and &ldquo;other reliable information&rdquo; with &ldquo;a propensity&rdquo;, we are broadening it further.  It is too wide to suggest that we could have reliable information that somebody has a propensity to do something. I am interested to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis's amendment seeks to delete &ldquo;sexual&rdquo;.  However, if that is deleted and &ldquo;other reliable information&rdquo; is left in, it would be even more damaging.  If the word &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; is deleted, which it should be, it would be essential to delete the words &ldquo;other reliable information&rdquo; because it would open the door and allow people to make allegations against others and, as a result, the latter would be discriminated against.</P>

      <P>Section 16(4) states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring an employer to recruit... an individual if the employer is aware, on the basis of a criminal conviction of the individual or other reliable information, that the individual engages, or has the propensity to engage, in any form of sexual behaviour which is unlawful.</P>
      <P>If people do not engage in these acts they cannot be unlawful.  If we were all judged on a propensity for unlawful behaviour how many of us would pass that test?  This is a very loose formulation of words.  It invites someone to spread rumours about a personal enemy.  I am also concerned about the words &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; and &ldquo;a propensity to engage&rdquo;.  One cannot have a criminal conviction based on a propensity, so who determines the reliability of information on a propensity? Whatever the intention of this wording there are potential negativities which are disturbing in terms of civil liberties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris has tabled an alternative definition for &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo;.  Notwithstanding the merit of the definition, I am not convinced that it is preferable to the existing definition.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was originally published I was reluctant to attempt a definition of sexual orientation in the absence of a legal model elsewhere in Irish law.  However, having listened to the arguments of Deputies and following representations by the NESF, GLEN and ICTU, among others, I have decided to bring forward the current definition.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that Senator Norris's proposal successfully avoids listing forms of sexual relations or behaviour.  However, it does so by reference to what is not prohibited by law.  I resisted such an approach when preparing a definition as I did not wish to associate sexual orientation with prohibited unlawful behaviour.  I sought to focus on the inherent sexual orientation of a person whether they are sexually active or not.</P>
      <P>I was also impressed that the references to specific and widely recognised forms of orientation ensured a degree of clarity for the definition which the Senators amendment would not appear to achieve.  In the circumstances I would request the Senator to reconsider this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a logical and legal difficulty with Senator Norris's definition.  The definition in the proposed amendment recognises one sexual orientation, that is, the sexual orientation comprising of all sexual preferences not prohibited by law.  This definition will make section 6 of the Bill defunct so far as outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.  This is because that section was constructed to allow a person establish discrimination by showing that there exists less favourable treatment between individuals based on differences in sexual orientation.  If it is defined in law that there is only one category within the sexual orientation ground, the possibility <Col N="552" /> of a comparator for the purpose of showing less favourable treatment is ruled out and discrimination could not be established under section 6.  Perhaps these logical and legal difficulties with the definition will help to convince Senator Norris to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>I considered Senator McGennis's amendment in the Dáil.  At the time I explained that, given the definition now included in the Bill, there is no need to qualify section 6(2)(c).  Section 16(4) clearly protects employers and clients, including children, from sexual abuse.  The definition of sexual orientation sets out forms of sexual orientation. Neither can be used to defend persons who admit to being a paedophile or who have a conviction for an offence involving the sexual abuse of a person under the age of 18 in work situations which involve access to, or control of, minors.</P>
    <P>It is undesirable to associate the term &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; with unlawful behaviour as does this amendment.  I appeal to the Senator to review her proposal and be assured that the protection she seeks has been provided for elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 16(4) of the Bill, as amended in the Dáil, encompasses both of the instances which Senator McGennis is seeking to cover in her amendment.  Section 16(4) encompasses the admission of a person that he or she is a paedophile as well as persons who have been convicted of sexually abusing a minor.  Section 16(4) would also exclude from the scope of the legislation a person who has a history of paedophilic activity but no convictions, as well as any person who has been convicted of statutory rape.  I appreciate the Senator's concerns to ensure adequate protection for that very vulnerable section of Irish society &mdash; children.</P>
    <P>I have sought to achieve a similar effect in section 16.  My approach to this issue has been to distance the concepts of sexual orientation and sexual behaviour under the Bill.  I hope that Senators will agree to withdraw their amendments and allow the matter to be tackled in the Government amendment.  I would like to thank Senators Dardis and Norris for their amendments and affording me another opportunity to reconsider the issue of reliable information.</P>
    <P>No one who has lived in Ireland over the last five years can be in any doubt that legislators must be acutely aware of the need to ensure that full protection against abuse of our children or other vulnerable groups must not be compromised in bringing forward new laws.  I acknowledge that the term &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; might be regarded as insufficiently tight.  At the same time I am faced with the dilemma that perpetrators of abuse, against whom we want to protect children and others, are known to cleverly disguise their tendencies with devastating consequences. Obviously, heresay or loose comments about an individual are not reliable information. However, given the importance of voluntary interests in care services, it would be unwise to rule out the possibility that reliable information <Col N="553" /> might be available from such sources.  Many of these voluntary interests provide professional services.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in view of the open nature of the labour market, the proposed amendment would seriously limit the prospect of securing information on abuses from authorities or other competent sources abroad.  Irish employers involved in care services have been made increasingly aware of the dangers in this area and their recruitment and selection techniques are adapting to meet these dangers and to ensure that the high standards of care associated with Irish care services are maintained.  In all the circumstances I am reluctant to drop the existing text on reliable information and I would ask that it be retained accordingly.</P>
    <P>For the same reasons I am reluctant to follow Senator Lee's proposal to delete the reference to &ldquo;propensity to engage&rdquo;.  I accept the inherent difficulty in using this terminology but do not apologise for seeking to be extra cautious in this very sensitive area.  Ultimately, one can resort to the Director of Equality Investigations to resolve disputes in this area about reliable information or &ldquo;propensity to engage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis's amendment proposes to broaden the scope of the section beyond sexual behaviour and I was very interested in the Senator's rationale for that amendment.  When I amended section 16 in the Dáil I sought to protect an employer from having to employ, or retain in employment, persons who engage in unlawful sexual behaviour.  While it could be argued that nothing in the Bill would require an employer to recruit or retain such a person in employment, I was satisfied that such is the nature of this behaviour and given the devastating consequences for victims, an explicit provision was warranted. Senator McGennis wants this provision extended to cover all unlawful behaviour.  There may be merit in such a proposal but I would not like the very explicit protection against unlawful sexual behaviour overshadowed because we have cast our net too widely with the provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed and courteous reply.  I did not hear all of it so I may misinterpret him, but I cannot misinterpret his courtesy.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is important because Senator McGennis introduced an amendment related to paedophilia and there is sometimes confusion in the public mind about homosexual behaviour, bisexuality and paedophilia.  My amendment is much clearer and defined legally because it refers to sexual behaviours which are not prohibited by law.  The practice of paedophilia is clearly covered by my definition, as are other behaviours which are disapproved of strongly by society and held to have a damaging impact on persons engaged in them.  The amendment also fits in with further sections of the Bill which target the Bill precisely on the area where it is supposed to function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> Accordingly, I urge the Minister to reconsider. I will not press this to a vote now as I reserve the right to reintroduce this or a similar amendment on Report Stage.  That gives the Minister time to consult his advisers on whether he can accept this amendment or a variation of it.  If the Minister comes up with a formula that meets the situation, then so much the better.  The present wording is quite reasonable, but the wording of my amendment is better.  It is part of the function of this House to refine the focus of legislation, although I accept that the broad outline of this legislation is good.</P>
    <P>I feel stronger about amendment No. 12 and the Minister has strengthened that by accepting one needs to focus on what is &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo;. In an access of sentiment, with which I concur &mdash; although it is dangerous to allow too much of it &mdash; he spoke of child sex abuse.  That is an argument as much on my side as the Minister's if one looks at it clinically.  There have been repeated cases where apparently convincing information was brought by reliable sources against parents that proved subsequently to be incorrect, false or injudicious.  The Minister spoke of the devastation of the victims, with which everyone sympathises.  What about the devastation visited upon parents who are falsely accused by what Senator Dardis described as busybody neighbours?  I favour concerned statutory bodies being included in this and my amendment covers that.  My amendment suggests that &ldquo;other reliable information&rdquo; be deleted because there is a question mark about what is &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo;; that is, capable of a subjective judgment.  The words to be substituted are: &ldquo;on the basis of a criminal conviction or information from designated public bodies&rdquo;.  One presumes these would include health boards, social workers, etc.  Their information would be taken into account by my amendment, which meets the Minister's concern.  As it stands, the Bill does not meet my concerns because I do not know what constitutes &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; in all circumstances and in every institution or situation of employment in the country.  We have seen considerable and whimsical discrimination on the grounds of prejudice and we will not enter a brave new world when this Bill passes.  Prejudice will not be cleared away to enable us to start from &ldquo;year zero&rdquo; by this Bill.  We will have a world where there is still prejudice, discrimination, suspicion and mischief-making.  In those circumstances it is highly dangerous to leave a phrase as vague as &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; in the Bill without nailing it down on the basis of criminal conviction or information from designated public bodies.  That covers the Minister's anxieties, which we all share.  No Member wants to provide a shelter for sexual abusers of children, but equally no Member wishes to expose people inadvertently to situations where, when information that appears reliable turns out not to be so, devastation is visited on those families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> I feel strongly about this amendment but will not press it to a vote.  I will almost definitely reintroduce it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply to Senator Norris, the Minister made a point with which I concur.  He distinguished between behaviour and orientation, saying it would not be sensible to use behaviour to describe orientation.  Behaviour is much more than orientation.  However, I am still uncomfortable about the unamended subsection (4) of section 16 and detected a certain discomfort on the part of the Minister when he replied.  He realises some of the dangers implicit in this.</P>
      <P>There is no debate about our desire to protect children from paedophiles but the saying &ldquo;two wrongs do not make a right&rdquo; is appropriate. There is the capacity here to destroy somebody's reputation and we must be very careful to protect young people while also ensuring that reputations cannot be maliciously destroyed.  Senator Norris made the point about parents in England who answered serious charges and were subject to public scrutiny and odium; it was subsequently found that they were not responsible.</P>
      <P>It is a question of finding a balance; I think there is some middle ground here but this matter of reliable information based on a suspicion is one with which I find difficult to come to terms. I suggest that there is some other way of achieving this.  The Minister made an important point about voluntary as well as statutory public bodies having information available to them.  I would be prepared for designated public and voluntary bodies to disclose information, but allowing somebody to make a statement which could then be acted upon would open a Pandora's box.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I too agree with the Minister about the sexual orientation question.  He is correct in saying that a distinction should be made between sexual orientation and sexual behaviour. To follow up on the point that Senator Norris made, there is no confusion in my mind about paedophilia and homosexuality.  I would like to put it on the record that, in the main, the perpetrators of paedophilia are heterosexual.  It was not my intention to imply that there is any link between paedophilia and homosexuality.  I am prepared to withdraw my amendment in so far as the Minister is saying that the definition and the safeguards are related to section 16(4).</P>
      <P>The reason for my proposed removal of the word &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; was that I was not aware that its inclusion strengthened what the Minister was trying to achieve.  The Minister has achieved what I was attempting in my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain gentleman used to live in my area &mdash; I think he is referred to as &ldquo;the Warehouse Man&rdquo; and an unsuccessful attempt was made recently to seize some of his assets.  There are many computer companies in my general area.  What would happen if this man applied to one of these computer or pharmaceutical companies and, under <Col N="556" /> section 16, was willing and competent to undertake the job, but I, as an employer, decided that under no circumstances was I having this particular person in my employ?  Am I not permitted under this legislation &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>If &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; means that, then I certainly have.  I withdrew &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; from section 16 (4) because I was not aware it strengthened the orientation definition and gave protection to minors.  I know the Minister is erring on the side of caution in relation to reliable information.  Senator Dardis' proposal of making voluntary as well as statutory bodies disclose information may be necessary to ensure that nobody is victimised.  The most vulnerable are children and I, too, would tend to err on the side of caution.</P>
      <P>I can sympathise with somebody who is wrongfully accused.  If I, as an employee, were to go the Employment Equality Agency and claim I was discriminated against on the basis of reliable information which had come from a third party &mdash; I know it is in the Bill in relation to Civil Service, local authority or semi-State employment&mdash; that third party information need not be made available at a mediation hearing.  This reliable information might not necessarily be given to the person who is complaining of discrimination.</P>

      <P>I know, but I, as the complainant, am not entitled to be given copies of this additional information; that is my understanding from reading other sections of the Bill.  I suppose the Garda Siochána or the relevant health board could be deemed to be other agencies.</P>
      <P>I totally accept what the Minister is saying about orientation; I am still uncertain of the reliable information clause though I know why the Minister is putting it in.  As an employer, I would not like any employment equality tribunal, agency or officer to tell me I was obliged to employ any man or woman because they were willing to and capable of doing the job, in spite of the fact that they were one of the biggest criminals in the State and that knowledge might be based on conviction or reliable information.  I would like the Minister to tell me if I, as an employer, would be catered for under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 2, I think the Minister explained very well why he is specifically defining sexual orientation.  The NESF recommendations also recommend that sexual orientation be fully defined so as to clarify which groups are being offered protection under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to section 6, if somebody is saying they are being discriminated against on the basis <Col N="557" /> of the definition of sexual orientation which Senator Norris is proposing, then there would not really be any difference between the person alleging they have been discriminated against and the rest of the workforce.  If, for example, somebody was homosexual and alleged they were being discriminated against because of that, if you simply use the definition &ldquo;sexual behaviours which are not prohibited by law&rdquo; that definition probably covers all the other people among whom the person is being discriminated against.  In other words, the allegation is that other employees are being favoured.  I think Senator Norris's proposal removes the protection which is intended in that section.  The Minister explained it better than I.</P>
    <P>On section 16(4), I fully understand Senators' concerns.  If one could get a definition of the various kinds of bodies that could provide the reliable information that would be preferable to having it remain as general as it is.  Section 16(4) says that &ldquo;if the employer is aware on the basis of criminal conviction, etc.&rdquo;; it is not a suspicion it is an awareness.  What we are discussing here ties in with the discussion we had on the mandatory reporting of child abuse.  It is a matter of striking a balance between the rights of the person who may be wrongly accused and the rights of children and the need to protect them.  I concur with Senator McGennis and the Minister in saying that the protection of children has to be paramount.</P>
    <P>One obviously does not want to exclude somebody from a particular job because of information one may consider to be reliable but which may not be.  However, I would tend to err on the side of the protection of children.  For example, somebody might be looking for a job in a school or on a scheme where they would be looking after children and the employer might feel they had reliable information &mdash; not necessarily from the Garda or the health boards because of lack of proof or whatever &mdash; that the person had been engaging in unlawful activity.  If the employer genuinely felt they wanted to protect the children from this person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>Is the Senator relying on feelings? That is unacceptable.  One must have something stronger than feelings in order to deny somebody a job.  There must be evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording in the subsection is &ldquo;is aware&rdquo; and it refers to reliable information, not feelings.  It is an awareness based on reliable information.  If information is forthcoming from a reliable, decent and credible source &mdash; it may not be a statutory body but it may be definite information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We must ensure that legislation is not used in an unintended manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reflect the views of potential creators of employment in relation to amendment No. 12.  While the objective of this Bill is worthy I am concerned that, with the best will in the world, it will result in the taking of steps to avoid litigation, especially by small businesses. This is relevant to survival in business, particularly in a small business which does not have the back-up of a personnel department or reliable lawyers.  We are in danger of creating a whole raft of litigation every time somebody advertises a vacancy.  Take the case of a small business person who places an ad in their window, receives 20 applications and decides on balance to take applicant No. 6.  If we open the doors too widely it is likely that within a short time it will become common place for the other 19 to automatically claim discrimination on the grounds that lawyers advertise &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo;.  This will happen regularly if we make it too easy for non-accepted applicants to sue in the knowledge that they might win.  We must be cautious about making it too easy to sue. The result will be that no advertisements will appear and we will return to the tradition of &ldquo;who you know&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis spoke of the employer and used the term &ldquo;warehouse man&rdquo;.  I am not sure what that meant but I assume&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; should stay.  Senator Norris will disagree when I say the small employer has a gut feeling, a hunch that by taking candidate A rather than B or C they have a better chance of surviving.  If every time the employer advertises they are sued, they will stop advertising.  The anti-discrimination objectives of the legislation will be avoided by those seeking employees because they will not advertise at all.  They will use other ways of finding employees.</P>
      <P>We must be cautious about strengthening this Bill in any aspect.  It is necessary to remember that there are ways around this legislation which will be used by smaller employers in particular who will avoid advertising in order to prevent criticism of them.  When they want to take on a new employee they will use a head hunter.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister not to strengthen the Bill too much and to maintain the term &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; although Senator Norris will say it might not be fair, that it is only a hunch or feeling that a particular person is not right for the job. However, there is less likelihood that the legislation will be avoided through recruitment in ways other than advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn.  In recruiting employees one has to make judgments which can be open to scrutiny.  One of the chief <Col N="559" /> means used by employers in obtaining information about potential employees is through references. These are confidential and very valuable information is obtained through them, allowing the employer judge who is best for the job.  If employers do not look at a broad range of eligible people due to fear of exposure, the result will be discrimination by the back door.  It would create more discrimination than this Bill is seeking to do away with.</P>
      <P>When a position is advertised there may be 50 applicants shortlisted to ten for interview and subsequently shortlisted to three.  References are checked very carefully on the basis of performance with previous employers and not on criminology or any other issue.  That is very reliable information because it is confidential.  If it is to be exposed to scrutiny in the courts you enter a very difficult area where employers will restrict themselves from opening positions to everybody. Employers make a judgment &mdash; and it is only a judgment &mdash; about the most suitable applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about section 16, subsection (4) which says &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring an employer to recruit, retain in employment or promote an individual&rdquo;. It speaks of recruitment, promotion, retaining in employment and requiring an employer to meet these requirements.  An employer cannot promote, retain or employ somebody if he or she is aware, on the basis of reliable information, that there is a criminal conviction for sexual behaviour or reliable information that there is a propensity to engage in forms of unlawful sexual behaviour.  That is the narrow area with which we are dealing.  Everything I have heard about hunches, feelings and intuitions increases my concern.  I do not think they are reliable.  Decent legislation should contain a standard of proof and a requirement to support and justify this type of discrimination. This subsection provides a legitimate right to discriminate. That right has got to be legitimated.  I strongly rebel against this issue of feelings, hunches, sensations and hot flushes.  We should have a requirement for solid proof and not tittle tattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, my amendment is not set in stone and I would accept some of the arguments; but I believe more than ever, having heard the other contributions, that the principle is correct.  I just provided for &ldquo;information from designated public bodies&rdquo; but that can be broadened to include statutory and <Col N="560" /> voluntary bodies which may be designated by the Minister.  The ordinary individual is not inhibited from playing a part in that function for the following reason.  If there is legitimate suspicion on the part of an individual, a neighbour or the parent of another child in a school, let that parent go to the appropriate voluntary body, let it act as the professional filter and let them then be the source of any complaint or inhibition on the employment of this person.  That seems to me to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>Why in this House should we wish to secure a position where, to adapt the words of Senator Dardis, any busybody can wreck the reputation or employment prospects of somebody on information which may or may not be reliable?  Everything that has been said by those opposed to this amendment has indicated that it is a subjective judgment.  He or she feels that this is reliable. That is not good enough as far as I am concerned.</P>

      <P>Hunches, feelings and sensations are not provided for in the Bill.  We are talking about a very different concept indeed.  There is a world of difference between a hunch and reliable information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I must assure Senator Norris that neither is it based on any subjective test.  As I said, hearsay or loose comments from an individual are not reliable information.  If somebody has a complaint, it will be determined at the end of the day on an objective rather than a subjective basis by the equality officer.  That right and remedy is there.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I will concede this much: this has been an extraordinarily difficulty section to encompass.  Senators have had equal difficulty with it, as witnessed by the amendments tabled and the comments made.  For examples, Senator Dardis's amendment referred to &ldquo;information from a health board or a member of the Garda Síochána&rdquo; and Senator Norris's amendment referred to information based on a criminal conviction or from a designated public body.  Senator Dardis in his contribution introduced a new one, a public or voluntary organisation.  Senator Norris went on to say that it could be a person.  This highlights the undoubted difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember &mdash; and this covers the point raised by Senator McGennis and that of Senator Quinn, in particular, which I understand fully and with which I agree &mdash; that this Bill is dealing with discrimination only on listed specified grounds.  So far as the employment <Col N="561" /> of a warehouseperson is concerned, one cannot discriminate against him or her on one of the discriminating grounds set out in section 6. One may not discriminate against him or her on the grounds of sexual orientation, marital status or disability.</P>
      <P>If that is so, why does section 16(4) appear in the Bill?  That is a fair question.  It is there to cover the very special danger in Irish society of paedophilia and injury to children.  We felt that in that sexual context we must make it absolutely clear that extraordinary caution is required here having regard to the way paedophiles operate. That is the reason it is spelled out in the Bill.  It is likely it would be the position even if it was not there, but this is so important that we had to spell it out.  The conclusion we came to was that reliable information &mdash; tested, if need be, in an appropriate case by an equality officer who will take all factors into account &mdash; is the only safe way that one could proceed on an issue like this. Section 16(4) is concerned primarily with the paedophilia situation.  If we have strayed a little from what in any other context would be an objective desirable mean, it is done with the intention of covering the paedophilia situation, which virtually everybody in the House must surely agree requires extraordinary care.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Senator Norris was not here when I replied to his definitional point.  As I explained, and I am sure he will read the Official Report in due course before Report Stage, there are technical difficulties why it would not be possible to accept his amendment in the context of section 6.  It would remove the comparator possibility where sexual orientations is concerned and would present a practical difficulty.  As section 16(4) makes clear, we are talking here about sexual activity which is unlawful.  Sexual activity which is lawful is not within the ambit of the section and I hope that provides some reassurance to him.</P>
      <P>Having said all of that and having regard to what all the Senators said on this group of amendments, I will keep all aspects of the matter under review for Report Stage.</P>

It would appear logical to include it in this legislation.  One could envisage many groups being affected, for example, agnostic Unionists &mdash; which may be a contradiction in terms, although that might be unfair to agnostics.  In a democracy it is important that political opinions flourish and are cherished.  Thus it is important that it would be included with the other categories.  A wide range of categories is outlined in the section and it would seem appropriate that political opinion would be included.</P>

      <P>I support these amendments &mdash; the holding of political beliefs or membership of a political party would seem to be legitimate categories to include.  It would be wrong not to outlaw discrimination on the basis of such membership or belief.  I also feel strongly about trade union membership.  This is not just a theoretical point.  I have received detailed correspondence from a man who was involved in a food processing company which was taken over by a large Irish firm. He was ruthlessly removed from his job on the basis of his membership of a trade union.  He subsequently won a court case and was awarded about £20,000 in compensation.  This case took place in the last 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a body of evidence which demonstrates conclusively that in certain circumstances employers are prepared to discriminate against potential employees on the basis of trade union membership.  The practice should be outlawed.  It is also important to include this provision because there is a move to attract multinational investment <Col N="564" /> into Ireland and, frequently, such firms wish to discriminate on the basis of trade union membership. They want to have union free operations. However, they should not be allowed to discriminate on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the views of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil on this issue which I hope will transfer to recognition of trade unions in the workplace.  This has been resisted in other places in many cases by representatives of those parties.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with the points made by Senator McGennis and Senator Dardis.  It was my understanding that these issues were covered in the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  Will the Minister indicate if that is so?  If not, it is a gap that needs to be filled.</P>
      <P>This country has had a long and bitter experience of fighting for the right to organise and that right has been hard won.  As Senator Norris said, there is not a month when we do not get correspondence from people in different employments suffering in this regard.  I had meetings recently with the employees of a hotel close to Leinster House who were worried if they would be reemployed when the hotel reopened.  They gave me the impression that they would not be reemployed. I am keeping a close eye on the matter and if it turns out to be the case I will raise it again.  It would be unfair on the employers to name the hotel at this point.  However, it would be very unfair on the employees if they were discriminated against in any way.  There are many jobs in which employees have difficulty organising. The catering industry, which is growing rapidly, is a good case in point.</P>
      <P>We need a reassurance from the Minister that the provisions exist already.  If not, I support the amendments.  Although I interrupted Senator Dardis, the points he and Senator McGennis made are valid.  I was not aware that there may be a loophole in this area and I would welcome the Minister's view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is for prospective employees.  The more we do to strengthen this Bill, the more likely it is that avoidance will take place.  Any employer could avoid the legislation by not advertising jobs.  Discrimination on the grounds of political belief or trade union membership are indefensible.  However, an employer could avoid the Bill's provisions by not advertising jobs because he could not then be sued.  The ability of employers to avoid the provisions would mean that everything the Minister and Senators are trying to achieve would not be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of a man who was interviewed for a job and was asked if he would be willing to remove his beard.  He did not get the job and claimed that he had been discriminated against. The equality officer dealing with the case discovered that the interviewer had not kept records of the interview questions and that the interviewer <Col N="565" /> carried out the interview on his or her own.  The legal advice to a prospective interviewer is to make sure all the formalities are observed.  When interviewing a person one enters a legal minefield.  In that case, the person claimed he had been discriminated against because the question whether he would remove his beard could not have been asked of a female.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it could have been but the job was given to a man.  The end result was that the prospective candidate was awarded £750.  The person creating the employment could have had ten cases against him.  If we add these two grounds the Bill will contain 11 grounds on which one cannot discriminate and within months of it being passed many unsuccessful job applicants will claim discrimination.  On Second Stage the Minister said the onus of proof was on the applicant but in the case of the bearded person the onus of proof, in effect, was on the interviewer who claimed he had not discriminated against the person but still lost the case.</P>
      <P>I have stressed this case because if a small employer considers taking on a person and seeks advice on dotting the &ldquo;i&rdquo;s, crossing the &ldquo;t&rdquo;s and negotiating the legal minefield, he will be told not to do the interview without preparing the questions in advance, recording every question and answer, and making sure the interview board has more than one person, with representatives of both genders, various religions and the travelling community.  Every time we strengthen the Bill, such as by adding these two worthy amendments, we will ensure that fewer advertisements for jobs will appear.  Employers will get in touch with acquaintances to appoint people and thereby not be sued.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister not to accept these amendments because, worthy as they are, they will widen the scope of the Bill and cause more court cases and claims.  If they are accepted I will not be surprised if we have to amend the Bill again in a couple of years, if not sooner, because the system will not work.  If he does not accept these amendments, the Bill should be able to sustain itself.</P>

      <P>To answer Senator McGennis, the Bill gives protection against discrimination on one of the specified grounds and whether that results from an advertisement or in any other way is neither here nor there.  Once discrimination is established the person may maintain his or her claim to the equality officer.  To answer Senator O'Toole, the 1974 and 1977 Acts provide protection on the grounds of gender and marital status only &mdash; they are confined in that respect.  The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, already protects dismissal on grounds of trade union membership or political opinion.</P>
      <P>A proposal to add new discriminatory grounds to the nine grounds already provided for in this Bill cannot but be attractive to any Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  I am, therefore, sympathetic to the principle contained in amendments Nos. 4 and 5 tabled by Senator McGennis and Senator Dardis.  The amendments identify political opinion and trade union membership for addition to the existing list of nine discriminatory grounds already provided for and prohibited in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have achieved progress on this difficult Bill because its scope, although quite broad, has yet remained focused.  In giving effect to the commitment to enact legislation which would outlaw discrimination on nine diverse grounds, I have consulted widely, considered the particularities of each specific ground and legislated differently in respect of each while, at the same time, securing progress towards a single, general, coherent anti-discrimination Bill.</P>
      <P>The new grounds proposed by Senator McGennis and Senator Dardis merit similar research and consultation but major issues would fall to be resolved before they could be dealt with in legislation and I would be extremely concerned at any delay which such preparatory work would involve for this Bill.  Decisions would fall to be taken on a range of complex issues, such as the limits on political activity in some branches of the public service, the Defence Forces and the Garda; the extent and nature of exclusions to cater for existing practices which often operate on a party political basis; and questions relating to trade union membership and freedom of association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In bringing forward this legislation, the Government has covered a broad spectrum and is <Col N="567" /> providing anti-discrimination protection to a wide range of groups who had no protection since the foundation of this State.  I do not claim the list is exhaustive but we are already making great strides by providing protection for these nine distinct categories, most of which have not had protection until now.  Other grounds can be considered on another occasion.  I recognise the importance of the issues raised by Senators and believe it is important that the question of extending the scope of the legislation beyond the nine grounds covered in the Bill, including the two grounds sought, should be examined in the short term.  My Department will review the legislation for this purpose and publish a discussion document within the next two years.  The report of the Department's work, due for publication in the near future, will contain a commitment to this objective.  In these circumstances I earnestly request the Senators to put aside these proposed amendments for the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to press it.  I accept what the Minister says but, since he accepts the reasoning and, given his track record, I feel the amendments must be good and should be pressed.  I would be prepared to hold off on amendment No. 4 because of the problems relating to political affiliation, definitions, etc.  We have legislation to provide that dismissals based on trade union membership are unfair, therefore there must be definitions to cover amendment No. 5.  It is fine to bring a case claiming one was sacked on trade union grounds, but the most pressing issue is where a person without a job can never get employment on that basis.  We already have legislation covering dismissal from employment on the basis of trade union membership.</P>
      <P>The Minister explained why aspects of amendment No. 4 are problematic, but he should accept amendment No. 5 unless there are major problems because it is fundamental to what he is trying to achieve.  Perhaps it could be reconsidered on Report Stage.  It is an important issue, especially with regard to the number of multinational companies investing in Ireland who do not appear to be predisposed to employing trade union members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is weaker than his earlier ones.  While it could be argued that all nine categories should be deleted, if they are to be included so should the tenth and eleventh, covering respectively those holding political viewpoints and those belonging to trade unions.  It does not make sense otherwise, especially as it is incorporated in other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's proposal amounts to a deferral perhaps on the basis that it will be forgotten. However, it is better to address these aspects as we deal with the legislation in detail.  If it is considered <Col N="568" /> that their inclusion will improve it, then we should proceed on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGennis is right to press the question of trade union involvement.  It is absurd to forbid dismissal from employment on the grounds of trade union membership while not being prepared to forbid refusal to hire on the same grounds.  I have produced evidence of dismissal in the case of somebody who had recourse to the courts on foot of the relevant legislation and won compensation.  The practice of antagonism by certain employers towards the trade union movement is therefore on record.  A timescale of two years to further consider this aspect is too lengthy.  The Minister should be able to encompass difficulties before Report Stage.  I hope he will do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn is a large and good employer and runs a tight ship.  However, he spoke from the point of view of a small employer, which is not where the problem lies; it is far more likely to be among larger employers.  For example, McDonald's Restaurants of Ireland Limited has a nasty history in many respects, including the refusal to employ trade union labour.  I recall participating in a picket against the company in the 1970s.  These big enterprises should not be allowed to bully their way onto the Irish market and discriminate against trade union membership.</P>
      <P>Many such companies, especially American, will wish to come into this country and discriminate against people in employment.  They make no secret of their dislike of trade unions.  I am, therefore, surprised that the argument has not been made that trade union membership may frighten away some big American corporations; perhaps it is being made under the surface. However, they should not be allowed discriminate in their hiring policies.  While deferring to Senator Quinn's greater experience in the world of business, I suspect it is the bigger companies that would be the most discriminatory in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister whether this aspect was covered in earlier legislation and I thank him for his comprehensive reply.  I accept there are difficulties regarding the question of political beliefs, especially in connection with those working in the Civil Service and various parts of the public sector; for example, the question of constitutionality and the Ministers and Secretaries Act arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person was to be denied access to employment on the basis of his or her membership of a trade union, I, as a trade union general secretary, would be prepared to take any steps necessary to defend that person on the basis that it would be wrong and unjust.  It would be against the views of the public on the right to associate, the right to organise, etc.  Despite the progress made by the social partners over the past ten to 12 years, we have failed to adequately address the issue of <Col N="569" /> trade union recognition.  Failure to deal with it satisfactorily is a flaw in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The Minister's party supports the issue of trade union recognition.  Amendment No. 5 is a small step in that direction.  Many would feel protected by it.  While Senator McGennis agrees with his point on the difficulties of political belief, which infringes on many areas, she is right to call on him to look at this amendment before Report Stage; otherwise those of us who feel strongly on the issue may have to push matters further.  It is of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister must share my view on this matter; I know he does not disagree in principle.  The amendment is drafted in the style of the subsequent parts of the Bill and therefore allows him to include it.  Any reworking on it can be undertaken between now and Report Stage.  In the meantime he should indicate his support for it.</P>

      <P>The original intention of the Bill was to deal with specific sectors of the population who did not have any protection, which is why this listing was chosen.

I gave in that reply my explanation of the genesis of the Bill and the wide range of grounds which it already covers.  One could add additional grounds almost <i>ad infinitum</i> if one had time to carry out the necessary research and consultation.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis asked if there was any basic reason for not accepting amendment No. 5 now. If amendment No. 5 were adopted now it would prohibit all difference of treatment on grounds of trade union membership with no exceptions.  If this ground were to be included, we would have to devise some exceptions.  For example, amendment No. 5 with no exceptions could upset existing arrangements on staff associations in the Garda and Army.  It could also prevent trade unions from giving preference in posts to their own members.  It would, in other words, make a number of acceptable practices illegal overnight. However, as I said, I am sympathetic to its basic thrust and I will undertake a specific review of both these grounds for Report Stage.</P>

Wide ranging consultations will have to be held with the social partners. I have given examples of a number of exceptions that will have to be examined and considered, and there could be others.</P>
      <P>It has been a major effort to bring forward this legislation which covers nine grounds of discrimination.

      <P>In page 13, subsection (3)(a), line 2, to delete &ldquo;65&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;70&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment on behalf of Senator Lee.  This is a very simple amendment which relates to the fact that people can do different jobs at different ages.  As early retirement becomes a feature, the question of compulsory retirement should also be reviewed.  We have always tried in any discussions on this matter in the House to find a balance between pushing people out of their jobs and giving them the option to leave.  This amendment proposes to increase the maximum age limit from 65 to 70 years.  Perhaps there are reasons for this limit to which we have not given consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Lee has focused attention on this issue by tabling this amendment. The demographics of Europe, including Ireland, point to an aging society where, while life expectancy continues to grow, the rate of natural growth in the population is on a downward trend.  This <Col N="572" /> phenomenon is in marked contrast to the very high rates of natural increase in population which were a feature of Irish society prior to the 1980s.</P>
      <P>The existence of a large youth cohort in the population creates a major challenge for society to provide labour market opportunities on an increasing scale.  Where, as has been the case in Ireland, there is already a high level of unemployment, the pressure to find employment opportunities is even more acute.  In this context, some turnover on the labour market has been facilitated by the operation of a generally accepted retirement norm which operates an upper age limit of 65 years.  This is reinforced by a sophisticated and expensive national pensions system which is often supplemented by private means, frequently sponsored by employer contributions.</P>
      <P>I do not consider the time is right to begin to unravel this regime.  That is not to say that persons over 65 years of age should not be considered for employment.  There are already persons over that age actively engaged in employment and this legislation will not change their right to be employed.  However, the question of introducing protection against treating persons over 65 years of age differently on the labour market would interfere with currently accepted labour market practices which facilitate a minimum level of employment turnover including the creation of employment opportunities for unemployed persons and the growing number of young people entering the labour market.  In the circumstances, I appeal to the Senator not to press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions on employment have regularly focused on creating employment opportunities for unemployed or younger people.  I reject the idea that retirement is important in order to create employment opportunities for other people.  The idea of pushing a person out of work or refusing people access to work in order to create employment for a person who happens to be unemployed or younger is not fair.  I do not accept that is a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European demographic trends are a fundamental issue and are being discussed in great detail in at least four countries, namely, Ireland, Italy, Germany and the UK.  The prospect of the liability for the State in terms of pension requirements is huge.  Italy's liability is almost 90 per cent of total pension costs.  In the UK it is being used as one of the arguments against entering European Monetary Union.  The reason I raise those issues is that pension liabilities only come into effect when people are out of the workforce because of retirement or resignation.  It should be an attraction to member state Governments to keep people in employment in order to defer pension liability and, in crude terms, by relating it to life expectancy figures.  Life expectancy figures have increased significantly and there is an overall saving for the State in pension liability.  Every European country faces this problem.  However, I accept it is less of a problem for Ireland.  Germany <Col N="573" /> wonders how it will pay for its aging population. At least in Ireland the population profile is softening in the right direction.  This is an issue on which I might find agreement with the Department of Finance.

Footballers and cyclists who used to receive pensions at 45 have been told they will have to wait until they are 60.

      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), lines 10 to 22, to delete paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and insert the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  both perform or, if both were employed would perform, the same work under the same or similar conditions or each is, or if both were employed would be, interchangeable with the other in relation to the work; or</P>

    <P>The Bill does not make provision allowing comparison for equal pay with a hypothetical male.  It is an issue that the National Women's Council of Ireland raised.  Many arguments have been put forward that if equal pay legislation is to succeed and have real effect where there is a high propensity to use women as cheap labour, it must provide a mechanism for ensuring all women are able <Col N="574" /> to secure what would be the going rate for the job.  Community law does not require comparisons with a hypothetical male and the European Court of Justice has ruled out any comparisons which are not made on work performed by employees of a different sex in the same employment. This Bill will not extend equality legislation beyond our obligations under Community law. There are huge implications for women in industries and businesses which employ all female staff. This amendment is required to prevent the employment of women in lower paid jobs or where some become trapped.</P>

      <P>This was discussed in the Dáil in great detail and the Minister said he was sympathetic to the objective of the amendments. However, he had difficulty producing a formula of words or the formula proposed to him was unsuitable.  I propose that within 12 months of the enactment of this Bill the Minister should introduce regulations setting out procedures for the use of a notional comparator.  The Minister stated he wanted to achieve that objective.  Women in low paid employment simply cannot get out of the poverty trap.  For example, the bulk of workers employed in contract cleaning are women but there is no other job to compare it with.  With the expertise at the Department's disposal, the Minister should introduce a procedure by which the notional comparator can be used to address this poverty trap for women.  Rather than force a set of words which may not achieve the objective, I propose the Minister should address this serious matter within 12 months.</P>

      <P>Under these amendments, Senator Dardis and Senator McGennis seek to introduce the concept of a hypothetical or notional comparator to the Bill; so would I.  However, as everyone is aware through press coverage and otherwise I gave active consideration to this matter when the Bill was being drafted.  I wanted to develop a workable model for a hypothetical comparator because I believe means must be found to gradually dismantle the vertical and horizontal segregation of the labour market.  I looked for a model elsewhere and found that the only one available was in the Netherlands which has been abandoned.</P>
      <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women did not propose a hypothetical comparator. The issues I set out to address when I considered the hypothetical comparator option are complex and are ingrained in the structure of the labour market.  I examined this issue in considerable detail and I consulted widely with the public service, IBEC and ICTU on how it might apply. Unfortunately it did not prove possible to develop a viable model for a hypothetical comparator that would achieve the results intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in Senator McGennis' proposal involving the use of regulation to bring in the concept of a notional comparator.  It is not one which could be accommodated by means of regulation. <Col N="575" /> It does, however, point to other possible options to address equal pay, in particular, the recent EU code of practice on equal pay which the Employment Equality Agency is already examining.  I would give consideration to the possibility of developing a suitable national code of practice of this nature which could be approved under this Bill.  As an approved code, it would be admissible in evidence in equal pay cases taken under the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which could be discussed with the new authority when it is in place.  There are, of course, other options might also be considered.  The new powers of the authority to carry out equality reviews and action plans may provide some potentiality also and helpful insights into practices with regard to pay differentials between men and women in some circumstances.  I regret I am unable to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he wanted to include the intention of the amendments in the Bill but, unfortunately, he was unable to devise a model.  He mentioned the adoption of a code of practice.  Some firms and industries have codes of practice which operate in the workplace. However, unless legislation obliges companies to operate specific codes of practice, it is difficult to ensure that will happen.  The Minister mentioned the operation of a code of practice which would be approved under the Bill and that the new authority might be able to enforce it.</P>
      <P>Can he do anything to ensure a code of practice or a notional comparator could exist in the future?  It is a difficult area but if the problem of women receiving lower pay than men for the same work, without a male comparator, is not dealt with now, I do not know when it will be addressed.  This issue should be addressed &mdash; or at least there should be some prospect of it being addressed &mdash; by the Bill.</P>

Female Members of both Houses have spoken <i>ad nauseam</i> about the need to address certain matters.  I do not intend to delay the legislation to try to achieve the objective of the amendment but can the Minister instruct a body to come up with a formula to meet it?  I do not intend to be obstructive but we should try to do something about releasing women from the low pay trap, which is the desire of all politicians.  I do not want to force a formula on the Minister; perhaps the Department could devise one.  Can the Minister ask a group or organisation to consider this matter and report to the Department within a specific time? He understands the intention of the amendment and perhaps he could give me some hope that something could be done.</P>

      <P>It will not be possible to do anything in terms of devising a system for a notional or hypothetical comparator.  According to my research, that does not exist anywhere.  We tried it and it was extremely difficult.  The only place it was ever introduced was the Netherlands but it did not last.  It was only in operation for approximately six months before it was dropped.</P>
      <P>I indicated that the Employment Equality Agency is examining the EU code of practice on equal pay and I will consider providing a suitable national code of practice of a similar nature. Under the terms of the Bill, that can be given special status in equal pay cases.  This is the road to travel for the moment on this issue.  I signalled that positive intention earlier and I hope it will be considered reasonably satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (2), line 28, after &ldquo;work&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided such agency worker is not so employed for a period of longer than 2 months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section states that if somebody from an agency is employed in a firm and he or she is doing the same work as an employee there, the agency worker does not need to be paid the same rate for the job as somebody who is in permanent employment.  I understand the reasons for that but a specific period of time should be inserted in the Bill because this provision could be open to abuse.</P>
      <P>If positions with a going rate is £200 a week become vacant and a firm can avail of cheaper labour from an employment agency at £130 a week, the practice of employing agency workers could easily replace direct employment.  I accept there is often a need to employ agency workers and I am not attempting to rule that out. However, there is a need for a safeguard to ensure agency workers do not replace permanent staff in a firm.  For example, two people sitting side by side making parachutes could be paid totally different rates for the job.  They could both make 100 parachutes a week but one would receive £200 a week because they are employed by the firm and the other would receive £95 a week because they are employed by an employment agency.  It is acceptable in the short term but as the Bill seeks to protect employees &mdash; perhaps more than Senator Quinn might wish because it is not the Bill's intention to protect employers &mdash; it is necessary to strengthen that aspect.  It is a loophole but I am willing to listen to the Minister if I am incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to make agency workers who are employed for a period longer than two months comparable with non-agency workers.  When the Bill was being drafted I was conscious of the need not to overlook the position of agency workers.  However, I did not <Col N="577" /> wish to interfere with the agency worker labour market to the extent that I made it more difficult to pursue employment opportunities in that sector. I also wanted a degree of legal clarity as to how the agency worker would be treated.  By providing for equal treatment between agency workers, I achieved that clarity and there have been no serious criticisms of that approach in the extensive consultations and submissions on the Bill to date.  However, that does not mean the Senator's proposal is without merit.  In an ideal world, it is probable that I would sympathise with her.</P>
      <P>However, the complexity of the labour market and the value of flexible work arrangements persuade me that agency and non-agency workers should and must be distinguished under the Bill. There is potential for considerable problems if a timescale, such as two months, was introduced. Agencies might seek to rotate their workers before the two months expired and other agency workers might seek to compare themselves with the agency worker who served for more than two months in an employment.  In the circumstances, employment equality for agency workers would be best served by retaining the approach adopted in the Bill, which leaves a comparable position for agency worker with agency worker and non-agency worker with non-agency worker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's point that one agency worker should be paid the same as another.  Can the Minister advise me how I should approach what I am trying to achieve? An employer could skirt the requirements of the legislation by not directly employing people.  Presumably existing workers earning £200 a week cannot be dismissed but there should be a prohibition on employers using agency workers <i>ad infinitum</i> when vacancies arise who would be doing the same work as the remaining permanent employees but earning a different rate.  It is comparable to the position of yellow pack workers which created trouble in its time.</P>

      <P>However, a deduction is made by the agency before the worker receives his or her <Col N="578" /> pay.  In general, agency workers receive considerably less pay than full-time staff despite the fact that they may be doing the same work.  I do not know what can be done about this and I take the Minister's point about introducing a time limit.  I was shocked to discover that firms refuse to be corralled by ensuring that temporary or agency workers are released from employment for a certain period within the time limits set down in legislation.  Much as Senator McGennis might desire it, I do not believe a time limit of two months would provide protection because people might be employed for seven weeks before being released.  I accept the Minister's point but, in general, agency workers are paid less because the agencies deduct a specific amount of their salaries.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 24, lines 8 to 19, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) For the purposes of this Act, each of the following acts constitutes sexual harassment of A by B&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any act of physical intimacy by B towards A, which A could reasonably consider to be sexually offensive, humiliating or intimidating;</P>
      <P>(b)  any express request by B for sexual favours from A; and</P>
      <P>(c)  any other act or conduct of B (including, without prejudice to the generality, spoken words, gestures or the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material) which A could reasonably consider to be sexually offensive, humiliating or intimidating.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A person may perpetrate an act which someone else believes to be unacceptable but the perpetrator may feel their behaviour to be entirely reasonable.  However, the individual on the receiving end would not consider it reasonable. The wording proposed in the amendment was suggested to the Minister by the Employment Equality Agency.  With its record, I would be surprised if the Minister did not find that agency's wording acceptable.</P>
      <P>My primary concern involves the introduction of the reasonable person test to define whether unlawful sexual harassment has occurred.  The Employment Equality Agency made the case that in other areas of law such a test would prove uncontroversial because the experience at issue is gender neutral.  However, the experience of sexual harassment is not gender neutral and it is generally accepted that men and women have different attitudes to this issue and what constitutes sexual harassment.  Therefore, it is important that women's perceptions of what constitutes sexual harassment is fully acknowledged by the law in this area.  For that reason, I propose that the wording be changed to reflect this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone welcomes this important section of the Bill.  When one considers cases which came before the Labour Court in recent years, one realises that people were obliged to endure an enormous amount of victimisation.  My concern about applying reasonable person test &mdash; I believe this refers to an individual on top of the Clapham omnibus &mdash; is that 50 per cent of these people will be men who have a different attitude to sexual explicitness in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was alarmed to discover that some women prefer to address this issue by means other than litigation, which is the best form of redress for women who have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.  A well known journalist, for example, whom I would not describe as an unreasonable woman said it was better if labels, <Col N="581" /> such as bounder or cad, were given to people or if there was a stigma attached to the office rather than resorting to litigation.  That is a facile way of looking at what can be a serious form of distress for women who are often not in as powerful a position as men in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended a conference in Dublin Castle on sexual harassment.  It was stated that women managers rarely suffer from sexual harassment but that women in less advantageous positions in the workforce do.  It was also said that malicious claims are unusual and that people do not generally bring cases for large monetary gain; they just want the behaviour to stop so that they can continue with their job.  Fortunately, in the majority of cases when it is pointed out to the offending person that they are causing great distress to the other person in the workplace, they realise their behaviour must be altered.  It is also important to recognise the sensitivities of the person involved.</P>
    <P>As Senator McGennis said, the Equality Employment Agency has sought to make such a change.  The trade unions also believe a change in this direction would be useful.  No one is saying that most men in the workplace try to make women's lives a misery.  Practices in firms must be seen to be of a certain standard and it must be clear that only certain types of behaviour will be tolerated.  It is important to take the views of the person involved into account.</P>
    <P>Cases before the Labour Court have shown how explicitly offensive behaviour has been in the workplace.  However, most cases are resolved in the workplace.  I ask the Minister to take this into consideration because resolving this issue outside the workplace means that a broad definition is given to a &ldquo;reasonable person&rdquo;.  Malicious cases are rarely taken against a person.  People just want the offending behaviour to stop and to be given an apology.  I ask the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>It is important for a man to say similar things to those said by the female Members of the House.  I endorse what Senator Henry and Senator McGennis said and I emphasise the point about the Employment Equality Agency.  I commend amendment No. 25.</P>
      <P>Section 23 places the onus on the person who is responsible for sexual harassment rather than on the person who is subjected to the harassment to defend themselves.  I have seen people subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace. However, those who were responsible did not think they were doing anything wrong.  It is worrying that these people think this is fair game. Something must be done to address this and to ensure that people who receive unwanted attention have some means of recourse.  I have seen cases where the harassment was regular and sustained and where the person responsible did not think there was anything improper about it, although it was obvious the recipient of the harassment was upset.</P>

      <P>The point I wanted to make about sexual harassment is illustrated in a case in the United States involving President Clinton.  The woman journalist commenting on President Clinton's difficulties made what I thought was a reasonable point that in the case currently thundering its way through court, President Clinton may have behaved with a lack of decorum but his behaviour could scarcely be construed as harassment. However unseemly his behaviour, which I will not describe on the record but with which most Members are familiar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the young woman declined, he immediately desisted from his attentions <Col N="583" /> and accepted that she did not want to get involved.

      <P>Once that position has been established, any further attempt to press a sexual request would appear to be sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>Other amendments with which I am involved are intended to ensure that the test for sexual harassment is objective and does not rely on the subjective view of the alleged victim, but it introduces the idea of a reasonable member of the aggrieved person's sex.  That would leave room for objectivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four options being proposed. We are talking about harassment in the workplace.  It is agreed that this goes on and that it is demeaning and unacceptable and we should have legislation to deal with it, but the question is how do we implement this legislation?</P>
      <P>We need to focus on the options before us rather than on the general issues of sexual harassment. The Bill uses the phrase &ldquo;a reasonable person&rdquo;. If A claims that they were harassed by B the proof is whether &ldquo;a reasonable person&rdquo; would agree that A was harassed.</P>
      <P>This wording is unacceptable to many people and the Minister has heard a number of the objections to it.  These are based on attempts to prove what this mythical &ldquo;reasonable person&rdquo; would agree with.  Senator Norris' amendment speaks of &ldquo;a reasonable person&rdquo; of the same sex as A.  That is a fair way of proceeding if we could be sure of what constituted &ldquo;a reasonable person&rdquo;. This approach is fraught with difficulty.</P>
      <P>Senators Henry and McGennis have tried to deal with this by removing the phrase &ldquo;a reasonable person&rdquo;.  Their suggestion is that if A alleges that she was harassed by B the test should be that A could reasonably feel that she was harassed. This approach is also unfair because it relies on the perspective of the person making the allegation. That would not stand up to fair play and equity.  The tenets of natural justice would not support it and I have difficulty with it.  However, I agree with the arguments made by the Senators and the reasons for their oppositions to the phrase &ldquo;a reasonable person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have attempted to find a middle line between these three.  My amendment states that &ldquo;it would be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;. We do not have to look for the reasonable person or the reasonable person of the same sex. Neither do we have to obtain the view of someone trying to assess the situation from the point of the view of the person alleging the harassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording in my amendment includes the view of the person alleging harassment, someone <Col N="584" /> of a similar sex and of &ldquo;a reasonable person&rdquo;. The question is whether this is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances including those raised by my colleagues.  My amendment offers an objective test which fits the rest of the Bill.  We are all making the same points.  I am simply tuning it more tightly to the principles of natural justice, objectivity and fair play to an individual who feels they are being harassed.</P>

They are possible because she will say maybe or something like that.  However, why the &ldquo;express&rdquo; request? How explicit does a request have to be?  Would &ldquo;tonight's the night Josephine&rdquo; be acceptable. What will be considered offensive?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 strengthens my point.  I mentioned a code of practice in the workplace and that might clarify what we are trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>We had difficulty finding a notional comparator in relation to a previous amendment I put down.  We now have difficulty finding a &ldquo;reasonable person&rdquo;.  My amendment does not say &ldquo;which A considers to be sexually offensive&rdquo;; it says &ldquo;...which A could reasonably consider to be sexually offensive...&rdquo;.  It is not that A has <i>carte blanche</i> to say something is unacceptable and is therefore sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>A third party mediator, Labour Court official or equality officer would have to decide ultimately whether A could reasonably consider something as unacceptable.  People vary; women are not all fragile creatures who cannot cope with these overtures.  Some can take the worst types of sexual harassment in their stride and others find what might be considered mild sexual harassment deeply offensive.  One must take the affected person as the starting point.  There are victim impact assessments in cases of rape and sexual abuse and the impact on the person should be where we begin here also.</P>
      <P>The formula I propose came from the Employment Equality Agency.  They feel it accords with the many Labour Court decisions on sexual harassment. If something is not broken it should not be fixed, and if this is what the Labour Court uses to determine sexual harassment we should stick with that formula.  A reasonable third party may not be the proper starting point to determine what is offensive and we should start with the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of practice is not within the legislation and if the Minister cannot put it in, it should at least be encouraged.  There must be fairness so that people realise certain behaviour is unacceptable.  At a conference I attended on sexual harassment a woman barrister said there is no point in a firm saying to an alleged sexual harasser: &ldquo;Look, you know you are doing this.  We know you are and you know we know.&rdquo;  That person will ask what he or she is doing wrong.  There must be something to say that this behaviour will not be tolerated.  If the Minister cannot put this in the Bill he might encourage the setting up of a code of practice.  That is set up in some larger <Col N="586" /> organisations so that there is something to refer to when there are complaints.  There must be fairness to both sides.  If the person described as the offender feels what he or she is doing is not offensive, it is hard on them if it has not been explained that such behaviour is not tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important features of this Bill is the explicit provision made to ensure that sexual harassment is clearly prohibited. However, the provision has prove to be one of the more difficult ones to draft.  Although it was not specifically referred to in the Employment Equality Act, 1977, there has been a progressive interpretation of that Act by the Labour Court which takes the view that freedom from sexual harassment is a condition of work an employee of either sex is entitled to expect. Denial of that freedom is considered discrimination under the Act.</P>
      <P>However, a sexual harassment case appealed to the High Court put in doubt the liability of the employer for acts of sexual harassment in certain circumstances.  I seek an explicit provision that will provide legal certainty on this issue.  When the provision was being drafted the definition of sexual harassment in the 1992 EU Council recommendation on the subject and my Department's code of practice on measures to protect the dignity of women and men at work were examined. Many representations have been made to me to incorporate one of those definitions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>However, I must have regard to the distinction between guidelines for best practice laid down in those documents and the legal requirements of text in primary legislation.  This highlights the dilemma faced in making legislative provision for this issue.  What arises in sexual harassment relates to the subjective experience of the individual who complains of the harassment.  At the same time, in seeking to apportion liability for such action, statute law cannot easily avoid the use of an objective test.</P>
      <P>The reasonable person test has been incorporated into this provision as a legal way of providing for an assessment of the offensive, humiliating and intimidating nature of any act from the perspective of a neutral observer.  Fears have been expressed that this approach may weaken protection against sexual harassment in Irish law as it may be argued that reasonable persons, in the employment context of the complainant, do not consider the actions complained of to be offensive, humiliating or intimidating.  I do not accept this argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arbitration of what is reasonable would be for the Director of Equality Investigation, the Labour Court or the Circuit Court.  The Labour Court has already adopted a progressive approach under the 1977 Act and there is no requirement for it to interpret this explicit provision in any less protective way by applying a less reasonable approach to harassment than it has to date.  Furthermore, there is provision for approved codes of practice to be admitted in evidence <Col N="587" /> in proceedings under the Bill.  This means that where it appears that the content of such a code is relevant to any question arising in proceedings, the provision concerned must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Given that a code of practice has already been adopted in this area, I expect that approval for a code under the Bill on this subject should be in place soon after the Bill is enacted.  This will reinforce the protective approach currently applied in respect of sexual harassment and will ensure that the good practice profiled in the code will inform the Director and the Labour Court in determining cases of sexual harassment that come before them.  It will also enable due account to be taken of the subjective aspects of acts of this nature.</P>
    <P>Senators Dardis, Henry, McGennis, Norris and O'Toole have raised concerns about the use of the reasonable person test adopted in section 23(2)(a) and (c).  Representations have also been made to me on this text.  The primary concern arising is that the victims of harassment may be discouraged from taking a case.  It has been suggested that many victims of sexual harassment are vulnerable to accusations of being unreasonable and that they might see a reasonable person test as one that might favour more influential management employees who do not regard the conduct as offensive.  As I have explained, I am satisfied that the reasonable person test would not work in this way and would not apply a less protective approach against harassment than currently operates.  Nevertheless, in view of the concerns expressed I will re-examine this provision and the proposed amendments to see if the fears can be addressed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I propose to return to this section on Report Stage.  The amendments before us go further than the reasonable person test.  Senator Henry would like the deletion of the term &ldquo;express&rdquo; in section 2(b).  Senator Dardis wants to broaden the cover in the section beyond sexually offensive behaviour and I will look at these matters on Report Stage also.</P>
    <P>Although I have already indicated my reservations about a proposal for a statutory obligation along the lines proposed by Senator McGennis with regard to the publication of a code of practice on sexual harassment, I will look at this proposal again.  I appreciate the constructive motives behind the proposal and I will reconsider this position.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the genuine concerns of Senators O'Toole, Henry and Norris about the reasonable person test.  I propose to review whether any of the texts put forward as amendments on this issue can be taken on board to some extent or whether a more suitable alternative wording might be devised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reassured to hear the Minister's views on this matter and I am happy to go along with them.  In considering the issue, I would <Col N="588" /> ask the Minister to bear in mind the thinking behind that form of wording &mdash; on which I took legal advice, incidentally.  The question of the reasonable person sounds reasonable, if you will forgive the pun, as a way of dealing with many things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable by definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  It may be reasonable in normal terms.  Someone coming from a sheltered background might for various reasons not be able, to use Senator McGennis's words, to be as robust about some of these issues.  What might be reasonable for the reasonable person might not be reasonable for such a person and might not be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances. That is where the difficulty arises, apart from the other issues which the Minister dealt with comprehensively in his response.</P>
      <P>A similar, but obverse, difficulty arises for me in Senator McGennis's approach.  She is absolutely correct in her arguments against the reasonable person.  However, if, for example, I am alleging that I have been harassed, the test has to be what would be reasonable for me to consider harassment. Somebody would have to get inside my mind to do that.  There is such a variation between people that a more robust person might consider something to be quite reasonable whereas a less robust person might consider it to be utterly unreasonable.  There is a movement there.  Regardless of which of the tests one applies, there is a lot of space for getting it wrong.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris proposed the qualification of a reasonable person of the same sex.  I do not think that advances the argument.  It is a refinement but there is still too much room there.  My proposal was that a reasonable person would be reasonable having regard to all of the circumstances. &ldquo;All of the circumstances&rdquo; would include the issues raised by the Minister and by Senators McGennis, Henry and Norris.  That is a test which could then be applied.  It is a checkable test.  I ask the Minister to give this serious consideration.</P>
      <P>I welcome the openness with which the Minister responded, I think it is very healthy and I look forward to dealing with it on Report Stage. I am not pressing the amendment on the basis of the commitment given by the Minister.  I understand this is a tricky and difficult issue.</P>

      <P>As are we all.  The problem is defining &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  I appreciate the difficulty of establishing an objective standard.  That is at the heart of the difficulty involved here.  What would constitute an objective standard?  That is one of the reasons why, in amendment No. 22, I suggested deleting in subsection 2(c) &ldquo;which a <Col N="589" /> reasonable person would consider to be sexually offensive, humiliating or intimidating to A&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I made the point earlier that where I have seen things of this nature occur, what I would have regarded as entirely unreasonable would have been seen by the person responsible for the harassment as entirely reasonable.  There is a difficulty in finding an objective definition of what constitutes harassment.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris made a point earlier in relation to the matter of an &ldquo;express request&rdquo; and its converse, the &ldquo;implicit suggestion or request&rdquo;. The implicit aspect is actually dealt with in subsection 2(c) where it refers to &ldquo;any other act or conduct&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;.  This is a stage further than the express request and I think the implicit aspect Senator Norris had some difficulties with is covered in that subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for being so co-operative and reasonable in relation to this and other amendments.  On Senator O'Toole's point that we would have to get inside the person's head, that is exactly what we would have to do and there is much established precedent for that.  In cases of sexual assault and rape, a victim impact assessment is carried out which, I presume, gets inside the person's head to establish the level of harm and hurt that person has experienced.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether a reasonable person needs to be a psychologist.  If Senator Norris, on the basis of the jocose statement he made, was the reasonable person adjudicating a case in which I was the employee alleged to have gone to a room where President Clinton saw fit to drop his trousers, I think it would be horrific of him to consider that to be reasonable.  Perhaps we would not find a reasonable person within this room who would agree with doing it that way.  That ties in with the wording of Senator O'Toole's amendment. I have no hang-ups about the wording of my own amendment being accepted, I will be happy to see what the Minister comes back with on Report Stage.  However, I have a slight problem with Senator O'Toole's wording &ldquo;having regard to all of the circumstances&rdquo;.  If one takes the example of the case to which Senator Norris referred, the fact that the girl went up to somebody's room could be considered to have been a circumstance in which she might have considered that she might have been subject to sexual harassment. Because somebody is in a given place at a given time &mdash; if that is what Senator O'Toole is referring to &mdash; does not mean they should expect to be harassed.  The Minister knows what I am talking about.  I will accept any wording which encompasses what we are trying to achieve. Again I thank the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am very heartened by the Minister's reply.  I would support what Senator McGennis has said; how a person feels about what has happened is also important.  I understand the difficulties the Minister has in drafting <Col N="590" /> this legislation.  I hope that, because of this section, people will not start to favour the Circuit Court over the Labour Court.  The Labour Court has been dealing extraordinarily well with these cases over the past years.  I have not heard of many aggrieved parties leaving it.</P>
      <P>As there is only a short delay in getting cases into the Circuit Court, thanks to the appointment of more judges by the Minister for Justice, it may seem preferable to lawyers to take cases to the Circuit Court.  This may cause problems in relation to proceedings being held <i>in camera</i> rather than the assured procedures with which we are familiar in the Labour Court.  I hope there will not be a tendency for that to happen because the victims of sexual harassment might find it far more difficult and expensive to go to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister may be able to find some form of wording which would take into account the fact that taking a sexual harassment case is an enormous thing to do for the person involved.  Very often, among their colleagues, they are labelled &ldquo;nuts and troublemakers&rdquo; or something to that effect. It takes a lot of courage to do this and sexual harassment must be a very serious experience for them and it is very important to consider how the experience impacted on them.  The Minister said he would return to the section on Report Stage. Am I to understand that he will introduce a Government amendment which takes these views on board?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to provide maintenance grants to post-leaving certificate students in this country.</P>
      <P>This time of year PLC courses are launched for the 1997-8 academic year.  This motion is timely because next week in the RDS City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee is launching its open day for all PLC courses for the coming year. I am comfortable with this subject because as a career guidance teacher I steer leaving certificate students towards these courses.  Last year the PLC sector provided further education for approximately 18,000 students; this figure will increase this year.  Courses include outdoor education, hotel and catering, travel and tourism, hairdressing, accounting, technician, health, fitness and leisure management, equitation, animation and music management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> There is a great vibrancy and excitement about the PLC sector.  It fills a niche in our education system.  Students who cannot make up their minds, do not get the points or do not want to pursue an academic course find a solution through pursuing PLC courses.  As the range of courses has expanded, so too has their status. Many of these courses are validated and certified through the NCVEA and lead to third level qualifications through the award of certificates and diplomas.  The courses are dynamic, linked to employment needs and reflect market needs. Most teachers have developed a link with the business world and can, therefore, provide work experience for students, thus facilitating the move to employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has chosen to ignore the plight of PLCs.  Last year the Department estimated a huge drop in PLC attendance and courses.  This was based on the transition year which it was estimated would result in 6,000 fewer courses. However, that did not happen.  The CDVEC did their own calculations and anticipated a drop of 1,500 but that did not happen either.  Course numbers actually increased.</P>
    <P>We have chosen to ignore the concern of PLC students.  Why did the Minister give regional technical college and university students maintenance grants and exclude PLC students?  PLC courses are more geared to a specific area of study for which the regional technical colleges cannot always cater.  Many students were offered a place in an regional technical college but decided on the PLC course because of its specific nature.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated she has abolished fees. However, despite the abolition of fees, the costs of the travel and tourism course, to take one example, are as follows: administrative costs and books, £50; registration charges, £250; NCVEA exams, £25 and external exam fees, £170, bringing the total cost to £495.  The total cost of the health, fitness and leisure management course is £399. These courses can only be found in the public sector of the vocational schools.  The beautician course costs roughly £410 and I have not doubt that there are many other examples.  These charges are in place to ensure the continuance of courses as funding is required to update equipment, provide extra places and accommodate growing student numbers.  These charges must be paid to secure a place on a course.</P>
    <P>There is confusion and it will be evident again next Tuesday when the CDVEC launches its open day.  What are we to do about these charges?  If students take up courses which are not available in the regional technical colleges they have to travel to where the courses are and maintain themselves.  There is no fee for a FÁS course.  Even third level students can get on FÁS courses without paying a fee.  It just does not seem right.</P>
    <P>The PLC sector is now the only public education sector in which students must fund themselves entirely.  Such students must pay for rent, <Col N="592" /> food, books and travel expenses.  Some PLC courses are of three years duration and students are finding it increasingly difficult to survive.  I have spoken to many PLC students and they have told me of the strain they are under.  Indeed, I have known students who have dropped out before they completed courses or who worked late at night in supermarkets to eke out an existence for themselves, often to the detriment of the studies.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the Minister's decision to abolish university fees will save some families up to £2,500 irrespective of their wealth while families of PLC students must pay fees plus maintenance. Is this fair?  I question the equity of that.  The late Christina Murphy summed it up well in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> supplement &ldquo;Education and Living&rdquo; shortly before she died.  She said that we will continue to have a situation where a student from a family with an income of £16,000 will qualify for a maintenance grant to go to Trinity College but a student of a family with an income of £8,000 will get no maintenance grant to go to Ballyfermot Senior College or Coláiste Ide in Finglas.  It would be cheaper to go to university than to take up a PLC course and this is absurd considering that the whole idea of PLC courses was to cater for those who did not have sufficient points to get into university or who were disadvantaged in some other way.  I call on the Minister tonight to respond positively to this motion and to provide maintenance grants for PLC students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Education and Living&rdquo; supplement in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i> contained a most informative feature on post leaving certificate courses.  Many people would have been surprised to learn that the PLC sector provided further education and training for almost 18,000 Irish students last year.  These were all students who had passed the leaving certificate or an equivalent examination and, as Senator Ormonde pointed out, these students were engaged in studies as diverse as child care, hotel and catering, computers, animation, horticulture, engineering, tourism, communications and outdoor education.</P>
      <P>In the early days PLC courses were generally regarded as an option on which to fall back for those students who were not successful in securing a place in the third level course of their choice. That is no longer the case.  Many of the students who opt for PLC courses now do so because of the range and variety of the courses on offer which are not available in other third level colleges.  Of course there are still students for whom the PLC course provides a stepping stone to third level.  It is very desirable that this should continue to be the case and that a certain number of places in regional technical colleges should continue to be reserved for such students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also many students who seek courses, such as pre-nursing or pre-appenticeship courses, which enhance students' chances of pursuing their chosen careers; but the majority of <Col N="593" /> students on PLC courses are there because they see them as employment oriented.  This is borne out by a recent survey of PLC course students which found that the main factor which influenced the students' choice of PLC course and college was the promise of a job at the end of the course.</P>
    <P>PLC courses prepare students for the world of work and this is what is making them so attractive to an increasing number of students.  I understand that PLC students who have completed courses in areas such as computers and computer related subjects are much sought after and have no difficulty whatever in obtaining employment and that demand greatly exceeds supply in these areas. From every point of view the PLC sector has proved to be extremely successful and popular.  It is regrettable, therefore, that PLC students are not eligible to apply for maintenance grants on the same basis as their counterparts in the third level colleges.</P>
    <P>The majority of the bigger PLC colleges, and particularly those which offer the more specialised courses, tend to be located in cities and larger towns.  Students from outside these locations must finance all their maintenance costs, irrespective of their means.  This is most unfair and inequitable. We are not only talking about accommodation costs but also examination fees and the cost of books, personal equipment, travel and all the other costs which arise, especially in the case of students living away from home.  The fact that these students are not eligible for maintenance grants is a source of great hardship for such students and their parents in many cases.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Ormonde in appealing to the Minister to remove this inequity.  The Minister should recognise the sacrifices which many of these students and their parents are making and the hardships which they are enduring.  She should also consider those students who drop out after leaving certificate rather than proceed to PLC courses because of the financial implications of so doing.  If maintenance grants were available to students on PLC courses, many of the students who drop out, and in most cases join the ranks of the unemployed, would enrol in PLC courses. Surely it would make better economic sense if the resources which then go to paying unemployment assistance to these people were used to fund a maintenance grants scheme.</P>
    <P>Because of the non-availability of maintenance grants the majority of PLC students have no option but to try to finance themselves from part-time work.  This is especially difficult for those students who are involved in courses of two or three years duration and these students are at a huge disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> their counterparts in other third level colleges.  Many of them fall by the wayside through no fault of their own.  It is time to address this inequitable situation.  The Minister should without further delay put in place a scheme of maintenance grants for students in <Col N="594" /> PLC courses.  The time has come to stop treating the PLC sector as the poor relation.  PLC students are entitled to parity of treatment with their counterparts in other third level institutions.  It is time to recognise this fact and to act accordingly.</P>
    <P>As the numbers taking PLC courses have increased so too has the range of subjects and the status of the various courses.  There is now a far greater awareness among employers of the potential of these courses than was the case a few years ago.  The aim should be to ensure that every student who completes the leaving certificate will proceed to further education or training.  If this is to happen the PLC sector will have a major role to play, but I am afraid it will not happen unless maintenance grants are extended to students on these courses.  If the financial pressure on such students is not alleviated, some students will still drop out immediately after the leaving certificate and others will be unable for financial reasons to complete the courses on which they have embarked.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this evening that the present situation is unjust and inequitable and I look forward to hearing that she is now prepared to initiate a scheme of maintenance grants for these students who up to now have been discriminated against to a great extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty whatever in sympathising with the proposers of the motion.  I look forward to the day when every post-primary student will be able to go to third level and be entitled to a maintenance grant.  I do not think that will happen tomorrow or the next day, but we must at least aspire to that because, as the economy becomes more sophisticated, we need a constant flow of people with the maximum range of skills.</P>
      <P>I had a meeting at 5 p.m. with people who were talking about developing an industry and they rehashed all the difficulties faced by businesses trying to find suitably skilled workers.  Many jobs are coming on stream at present which cannot be filled and I assume this is because many skilled Irish people are abroad and are not yet ready to come home.  We must continue to develop our education system.  Nobody can criticise the Government for the work it is doing this regard.</P>
      <P>I was delighted when the Minister decided to abolish fees for third-level education because it took a large strain off families and made third-level education more accessible.  I have known many families who could not get a grant and who refused to support their children to go on to third-level education because of the expense involved.  Removing the fees provided equity for the children and has done a great amount of good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great improvement in school buildings over the past few years.  A wide range of measures have been taken to try to provide equity in the system and to keep people in the system for as long as possible, particularly for disadvantaged schools to keep vulnerable children <Col N="595" /> in the system and give them a chance to build a life for themselves.  Nobody can fault the Minister and the Government for their efforts in this regard.  The job is far from finished.  We must continue to develop and grow the system as resources become available.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that some former Ministers for Education are not in the House to answer questions. Perhaps Senator Ormonde would question one of her party colleagues, Deputy O'Rourke, who was Minister for Education during the period of the growth of the PLCs.  Their party did nothing on this matter.  I am sure the Minister will indicate her commitment on the matter and I hope she will be able to deliver on that commitment in the not too distant future.  The amount of funds being spent on this sector by the Department is huge in comparison to the amount spent during Deputy O'Rourke's tenure.  The Minister will indicate the significant amounts involved.</P>
    <P>I assume the Minister will indicate that she would like to provide support for PLCs because they fulfil a valuable role.  The PLCs offer courses of one or more years to students who otherwise might not be avail of any study after the leaving certificate.  The vocational nature of the courses is interesting because they attempt to provide skills needed in the economy so that people will get jobs from the courses.  That is a laudable approach.  Some of the students go on to mainstream third-level education and there are other courses which prepare people to get back into the system, such as pre-nursing courses.  Counties Cavan and Monaghan have one such centre each and they do a marvellous job.  I regularly meet students who attended these centres and they are happy with the courses on offer.  They are also happy to be enabled to redirect their lives which would not be possible if they did not have the opportunity to take the courses.</P>
    <P>The Senators opposite will find that we and the Minister are as committed as they are to the idea behind the motion.  They will find the will is there but that it is a matter of trying to find the resources.  I hope that in the near future a situation will prevail whereby every student who enters secondary school will go on to leaving certificate level and every student who goes to that level will have the option of doing a third-level course.  We should aspire to giving everybody an opportunity to maximise their skills in whichever area they wish to pursue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Ormonde on the research she has done in putting this motion before the House.  Some of my children did post leaving certificate courses in Limerick and I can vouch for the large expenditure involved.  It is particularly expensive for families who live some distance from where the courses are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister has a budget within which she must decide priorities.  Within the limits of the resources available the Minister has done a good job.  There is a need for more <Col N="596" /> resources to be devoted to education.  There is a need to devote more funding to support young people doing PLCs in the transition between school and work.  Indeed, in many cases a lot of students find suitable jobs before the courses are completed.  Hence, in the long-term such courses may not be as expensive as they appear.  In assessing the overall cost of providing these courses I hope the Minister will take into account the numbers of students doing PLCs and the length of time they spend doing the courses.  She will have to decide if she can include funding in her list of priorities.</P>
    <P>It is essential that some support would be given, if not by way of a direct maintenance grant which may be difficult to achieve within the budget available, perhaps a tax concession might be made available.  I paid dearly in this regard during the period my children were doing PLCs. We had to pay substantial amounts in fees, maintenance and travel costs.  It was very demanding financially, yet we could not claim tax allowances on the expenditure.  If it is not possible for the Minister to provide grants for the courses, I recommend she consults with the Minister for Finance so that a provision might be made in the Finance Bill to provide tax concessions.  They would have to be limited and controlled.</P>
    <P>People are increasingly using the PLCs as a means to go on to further education at diploma or degree level and this should be encouraged. The availability of employment is in large degree related to the qualifications of the individual and any investment in this regard would pay off substantially in employment terms and in the overall benefit to the economy.  The PLCs have the advantage of providing courses which may not be available in the mainstream third-level institutions. I can vouch for the work done in McNamara's school in Limerick over many years.  It has been successful not only in training large numbers of young people and allowing them to get meaningful employment in the region but it has also been able to identify the opportunities available, for instance, at Shannon in airlines, freight forwarding and cargo.  One cannot readily or easily tune into a university qualification, although it is possible &mdash; I know many people who, after spending a year or two on a PLC course, have completed degree courses in the University of Limerick or the regional colleges.  Even on her limited budget the Minister can tackle this on a phased basis through tax concessions.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter said Fianna Fáil did not do that when we were in power; I will not get into that but the economy is now in a much healthier state than it has been for years.  When I was in Government between 1987 and 1989 it was not a case of having additional resources and deciding priorities. One went through every budget to find new ways either to curtail the spending of certain Departments or to raise revenue; the latter put me into some difficulty for a while.  Choices were tough and it was difficult to find a way forward. The position is now different because the economy <Col N="597" /> is booming and the prospects are for more jobs in the next few years.  We need to focus on the new opportunities becoming available.</P>
    <P>Everyone welcomes the modern technological development in Killorglin which employs hundreds of people in high-tech industries; the Minister will be aware of that project.  Through the availability of modern telecommunications, there are and will be opportunities available in the most remote areas of Ireland in which we were not involved up to now.  Courses must be available and, above all, families must be able to afford them.  The motion is most important, relevant and timely I believe the Minister will respond positively. Within the limits of the finances at her disposal, I hope she can give resources to start dealing with the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme, A Government of Renewal, provides a clear recognition that education is central to the promotion and attainment of equality and prosperity in society, as well as to societal and economic development.  That is a central theme of the programme.  Education is the most predictive variable of occupational and economic attainment and as Minister for Education I would say it is the most important determinant of an individual's life chances.  In a climate of rapid occupational, economic and technological change &mdash; a point much appreciated by Senator Ormonde, who guides young adults into the world of training and work &mdash; we require a workforce which is adaptable and innovative, with high levels of skill in technical and commercial fields.</P>
      <P>A number of studies have highlighted the need to strengthen the vocational and technical dimension of education programmes, to enhance the position of continental languages in the curriculum and to develop a spirit of enterprise in participants in support of innovation, growth and job creation.  We have no doubt where the opportunities lie.  Major curricular reforms have been initiated within the second level system to achieve this change.  That system is responsible for the education of the young tigers who are contributing to this &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; economy.  The success of post-leaving certificate courses has played an important role in influencing these reforms.</P>
      <P>The post-leaving certificate or vocational preparation and training programme was introduced as early as 1985 to provide appropriate vocational training for young people to bridge the gap between school and work.  The programme integrates training in vocational skills needed for particular disciplines and the development of general skills necessary in all jobs such as interpersonal skills, adaptability and initiative.  It also provides for work experience to give relevance to the skills learned and an appreciation of working life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key feature in the development of the programme was the adoption of an approach which would enable training centres to respond flexibly. Within the vocational skills section programme, options were designed to be sufficiently broadly <Col N="598" /> based to allow entry into a series of possible occupations. Centres were also given the opportunity to adapt a general programme to suit their particular needs, a point mentioned by Senator Daly. As a first step in considering the introduction of a PLC programme, schools were urged to carry out an examination of local requirements and resources in consultation and co-operation with employers, voluntary agencies, trades unions and the training and manpower agencies.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cotter said, there was not much excitement at these beginnings but the PLC programme was allowed to develop into a programme catering nationally for over 18,600 trainees.  Senator Ormonde mentioned some of the skills; they range from horticulture to upholstery, from woodcraft and furniture to video production, animation and even equestrian skills, as well as the more traditional areas of engineering, construction, electronics, computer studies, catering, tourism and business studies.  As the sector developed the courses became more varied and this Government invested money to allow the numbers to develop to this point.</P>
    <P>When the National Council for Vocational Awards was set up in 1991, a structure was established through which the training agencies, manpower authorities, educational interests and industry representatives became involved in designing not just programmes but certification and assessment issues for PLCs.  This ensures consistent high quality standards which are relevant to industry needs on an ongoing basis but also that the education which was available was particularly associated with what I would call the quality mark of the Irish education system.  The work of the NCVA will be further progressed and strengthened through the establishment of TEASTAS, the Irish National Certification Authority, on a statutory basis, to ensure that those who gain certificates and diplomas do not enter a cul de sac but rather their qualifications become part of personal progression and meet the needs of industry.  TEASTAS has been established on an interim basis and a recent report recommended the integration of the certification currently carried out by FÁS, the National Tourism Certification Board and the National Council for Vocational Awards.  There are different avenues of progression and we are establishing a flexibility in that regard.</P>
    <P>National certification is fundamental to enhancing opportunities for students to gain employment or, as has been said, access to higher levels of education and training.  The input of the various interest groups is crucial.  Increased investment in in-service training is essential to the achievement of ongoing quality assurance, and I am pleased to confirm that under the terms of the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development, 1994 to 1997, a threefold increase has been achieved in in-service training at every level of the education system.  The needs of the trainers and the requirements of teachers change over time.  I recognised on my appointment to <Col N="599" /> Marlborough Street that the teaching profession needed investment in its professionalism.</P>
    <P>Ireland's continued economic growth is to a great extent dependent on our success in harnessing the talents of our young population, giving them not only skills but the ability to adapt to the rapidly changing circumstances and demands of the workplace.  I think people now coming into the workforce would expect to have three different careers in their working life. Under the post-leaving certificate programme, schools have developed an excellent range of courses, facilitating a coherent approach to catering for the needs of the students and the regions, ensuring consistency of standards, more efficient marketing and providing a framework for the active participation and co-operation of the business community.</P>
    <P>The planning, development and delivery of quality programmes does not happen overnight. It demands much from providers.  I admire the extent to which schools and vocational education committees have responded to that task.  They have ensured the provision of a high quality vocational education and training system to serve the current needs of the economy.  Their attraction of business opportunities will also ensure that its future needs are also met.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to the development and maintenance of a high quality education system.  This can be measured by the massive increase in budget since I became Minister. Equality of access and participation, relevance and quality assurance are the cornerstones of our educational policy and system, a system of which we are all proud.  Our programme of activity in the years ahead will include considerable investment in tackling disadvantage in ensuring that support services are provided to enable young people at risk maximise their participation in and benefit from schooling; in ensuring that programmes are relevant to fulfil social and economic needs, and that second chance opportunities are provided for those who have missed out in their initial schooling.  Systematic investment in in-service training, certification and assessment and evaluation systems to retain the quality mark will also be provided to ensure a high quality cost effective system.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the important role maintenance grants can play in promoting access to further education and training.  Indeed, when PLC courses were first introduced in 1985, a small grant of £300 per annum was payable to students who participated on the programme, and training allowances continue to be paid as a matter of course by agencies such as FÁS and CERT as part of their approach to vocational training.</P>
    <P>The VPT grant was withdrawn in 1988 as one of a series of budgetary cuts referred to by Senator Daly, but participation on the programmes was not unduly affected.  They have continued to grow in spite of an increase in third level places, improvement in the level of third <Col N="600" /> level grants to eligible students, a decline in the output from the leaving certificate in 1996 because of the impact of the three year senior cycle and the continued competition from courses offering a training allowance.  This represents a recognition of the quality of PLC provision, which was not affected by monetary enticements to other areas of expertise.  Indeed, there was a recognition by the customers, the students themselves, of the prospects for employment that followed from these courses.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education, I took the step in 1995 of abolishing fees payable for PLC courses. This was important in making access to further education more generally available.  There are indications that maintenance and other priorities will be addressed when the population falls and the investment in education continues, which may improve the quality of students' lifestyles. However, given the recognition of the importance of the PLC to students, the absence of maintenance grants has not worked in cutting back on the number of places sought.  Indeed, demand has increased following the recognition of NCVA level two awards for entry to selected courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology/RTC sector. This, the signal of the abolition of the fee and the establishment of TEASTAS secured the future of these courses and the anticipated fall in numbers by the Department did not materialise.</P>
    <P>The White Paper entitled <i>Charting our Education Future</i> sets out a number of important developments which will enhance provision in the PLC sector.  First, there is an overall emphasis throughout on enhancing the quality of provision through investment in in-career development, the focus on the development of school plans and policies and the monitoring of performance against objectives at every level of the system. Second, there is the establishment of a coherent framework for the further education sector, embracing PLC courses, second chance education and training, and adult and continuing education. A framework is being established which will allow the different sectors to develop.  This will ensure a mechanism for the support and development of the sector, for co-ordinated provision relative to needs, appropriate quality assurance arrangements and monitoring of the effectiveness of programmes.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the establishment under TEASTAS of a single national certification system for all extra university vocational education and training, covering both the education and training sectors.  This will ensure the collaboration of education, training and industry interests in the setting of national standards relative to the student and labour market needs, and in the development of programmes and assessment and certification arrangements.  Hitherto, the system was somewhat chaotic.  Given the demand, it perhaps developed too quickly.  We need to secure a framework that will ensure vocational qualifications and provide for progression pathways to higher levels of education and training.  It will <Col N="601" /> provide for the accumulation of credits towards awards so that the system is suitable for either full-time or part-time courses, and will make arrangements for the accreditation of prior learning and work-based experience.  This is one of the most important steps in the developments to promote access to further education and training, to ensure the ongoing relevance and quality of programmes and to make lifelong learning a reality.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the VTOS programme for the long-term unemployed has been expanded significantly in recent years and that there are no longer age barriers to participation on these courses.  Approximately 1,500 trainees are participating on PLC courses.  The Minister for Social Welfare provides a mechanism whereby the long-term unemployed can access full-time PLC and third level courses without loss of social welfare entitlements.  This is another important step in making lifelong learning a reality in an organised way.</P>
    <P>My Department is already expending over £39 million per annum towards the cost of PLC courses, this to a sector that does not consider it gets financial support.  The payment of maintenance grants on a means tested basis would enhance the attractiveness of these courses and there does not appear to be any fall in demand. However, the cost of such an initiative is significant. To provide a means tested student support scheme along the lines of the higher education grants scheme, with no different means of assessment or level of income, would cost in excess of £11 million per annum.  While we should aspire towards this, there is a cost involved.</P>
    <P>Well targeted investment in key areas will serve the needs of Irish society in the years ahead in a climate where there are competing demands for resources.  As Minister, I have secured an increase in annual educational investment of 28 per cent over the period 1993-97.  Yet I cannot meet all demands.  A balance must be struck between competing demands for resources in the education sector, such as funding for the different levels of the system, between initial and second chance education, between student supports, investment in quality assurance, and special measures to combat disadvantage and under achievement.  We are lucky that Senator O'Toole is not here to remind me about the funding of the primary sector, the basis on which our education system is built.</P>
    <P>In the case of PLC courses, it is more important to concentrate on improving the quality of the system.  Investment is being made in national certification and assessment arrangements, programme developments, in-service training for the teaching professions and in ensuring provision in a wide range of disciplines for as many students as possible, because demands are increasing.  My record is one of significant investment in the development and quality of this sector.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to support the terms of the motion.  I believe this investment lays a solid foundation for the continuing development of <Col N="602" /> this very important sector into the future.  The White Paper spells out the developments which I foresee for this sector.  The provision of maintenance grants is a matter, I can assure the House, which I will keep under continuing review in the light of available resources.  The contribution of Senators to this debate will play its part in securing those resources at some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank Senator Ormonde for raising this very important issue.  As the Minister said, over 18,500 students participated in post leaving certificate courses last year, costing the Exchequer £39 million.  Most courses are of one year's duration and lead to National Council of Vocational Awards certificates and straight into employment for many students.</P>
      <P>For others it is a pre third level access course. For example, the vocational school in Newcastle West runs a very good post-leaving certificate course in art which acts as a lead-in to the College of Art and Design in Limerick.  The course does not just serve the needs of west Limerick as students travel quite long distances, some from as far away as Monaghan, to attend this course. Some people consider post-leaving certificate courses to be an excellent vehicle for access to third level colleges.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly referred to the extensive article on PLCs in yesterday's Supplement to <i>The Irish Times.</i>  One sentence in that article which summed up the importance of PLCs stated &ldquo;The main strength of the PLC sector lies in its vocational ethos and its attention to the needs of the job market&rdquo;.  A very strong link has been established between the post-leaving certificate courses and regional technical colleges and, as the Minister said, a path towards progress is very well established.</P>
      <P>The post-leaving certificate courses are also used by many adults.  I was struck recently by a photograph of recipients of awards on a childcare course, some of whom were my age and older.  I thought that some of them could have given the course rather than taken it.  However, they were women who felt the need to do a childcare course so that they could, with safety and assurance in their qualifications, set up créches and child minding facilities so that other women could access the work place.  These courses are, therefore, not just used by students who feel they need another year before they go on to third level or do not have enough points, but also by many mature students who wish to top up their education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to digress a little and speak about a course in an area near me.  It is called an t-Ionad Glas and is an organic horticultural college operating out of Dromcollogher vocational school.  Dromcollogher is a very small town in the south west of County Limerick which boasts two schools, a private secondary school and a vocational school.  In an effort to anchor the vocational school in the community, one of the <Col N="603" /> teachers started up a post-leaving certificate course in organic horticulture.  It started in 1992 with seven students and now has 22 students, eight of whom have returned for a second year because they felt the first year was highly academic, as it was leading towards the NCVA award, and they did not have sufficient time to develop their practical skills.</P>
    <P>Students come from all over the country and one person has come from Great Britain to study on this course.  Their educational qualifications range from those who left school early with only a junior certificate to those with third level degrees.  All they have in common is that they want to be trained in organic horticulture.  Eleven of the students are on VTOS.</P>
    <P>As the course is expanding and its popularity grows, demands are being made on it to expand into the area of farming which is more prevalent in the area, which is husbandry or the care of animals, rather than horticulture.  Problems often arise with post-leaving certificate courses because, as a result of their development, they start to move into other areas which may not be strictly educational.  Teagasc is not sure if it should manage the course and the vocational education committee feels it has outgrown the vocational education committee and the post leaving certificate courses.  Nobody seems to want to take responsibility for encouraging the, to use a pun, organic growth in this course.  When the Minister calls for a framework, it must be recognised that some courses by necessity will die away whereas others have a natural need to grow.</P>
    <P>There is a need for some, not all, post leaving certificate students to be financed.  Two girls wanted to do a post-leaving certificate course in Croom, which is 20 miles away from Newcastle West but difficult to access, which would have necessitated their staying in the village.  Accommodation was not easily available in the village and both girls came from families where the mother suffered from an illness and the father was heavily dependent on social welfare.  They could not, therefore, access the course.  They got onto the course which was their second choice in Newcastle West, where they are doing fairly OK. However, I thought it was a pity they were not able to access the child care course on which they had their hearts set.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that if she was given the resources she would fund the maintenance grant.  We should all assist her in getting those resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <P>I was delighted to see the increases which the Minister was able to obtain in her budget from 1993 to 1997, a most laudable achievement of an increase in investment of 28 per cent.  That might not fit into the economic and monetary union criteria for public sector spending&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is a wonderful tribute to her for obtaining that amount of investment in our education system and one of which she can be rightly proud.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, this developing sector of education is a Government priority.  A sum of £39 million is annually pumped into PLCs, most of which are run by the vocational education committee sector with some being run by community colleges, for which she is to be commended.  I also commend my colleague and friend, Senator Ormonde.  We are both members of South Dublin County Council where she has regularly raised this issue.  It is important that we debate it in the House because there is a view abroad, particularly in the PLC sector, that they are the Cinderella of the Irish education system.  Senator Ormonde is purposeful in raising the issue and concentrating on their needs.</P>
      <P>I was heartened by the Minister's response and comments made by other Senators.  The bottom line is the PLC sector has mushroomed since 1985 beyond our wildest expectations.  If we knew then that over 18,000 young people would be involved today, we would surely have used that sector sooner as a way of ensuring people are given a chance in education.  As a result we are in a bind to try and respond to the need for maintenance grants and other resources in this area.  The Minister will look at it sympathetically and I congratulate Senator Ormonde for putting down this motion.</P>
      <P>This is a real issue in my constituency.  A large number of young adults who complete their leaving certificate find PLC courses more accessible than going to university.  I regularly meet frustrated parents on the doorsteps who find they have to fork out £30 to £50 per week to allow their children to continue on a PLC course.  It is a burden which the Minister has recognised. However, we also have to bear in mind that the objective of a PLC course was never to be a step up to third level or diploma and certificate courses.  It was always intended to be one which would provide an individual with the opportunity of a job upon successful completion.</P>
      <P>At present there is a huge shortage of skills among young Irish graduates entering the labour force.  Numerous American industries based in Ireland have to advertise for graduates abroad. Many graduates of PLC courses, such as the telesales course in Ballyfermot senior college, go directly into employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention behind PLC courses was to rapidly plug people into employment using a one year course.  I recently spoke to Columb Collins, Director of Tallaght Regional Technical College, and in his view PLC courses were never seen simply as a mechanism through which people would enter third level; they were described in <i>The Irish Times</i> supplement as two and a half level courses. He and other educationalists are of the view that while it has come down to the fact that many people are given an opportunity to advance to <Col N="605" /> certificate and degree course eventually, ultimately the objective was to plug them into employment having gained various skills.</P>
    <P>The £11 million required for maintenance grants is not peanuts.  However, Senator Daly's suggestion that we should look at giving relief by way of covenant to parents through the Finance Bill is excellent and one we should pursue when it comes before the House.  As other Senators said, education costs are colossal, not just tuition and examination fees but also weekly maintenance costs which parents and young adults have to produce for going to college.  It is an expensive time in anyone's life and has led to large numbers of students taking up seasonal and weekend employment to try and fund themselves through college.</P>
    <P>I congratulate those who contributed to this debate.  It was useful in highlighting the needs of PLC courses.  I hope that this debate will advance the needs of people in that expanding sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and Senators for their helpful contributions in supporting this motion.  I acknowledge the Minister's work, and that of her predecessors, in regard to the quality of these courses and how we have standardised them through the NCVA, TEASTAS and to teachers.  They must be congratulated because many of them had to do in-service training and diversify their skills in order to reflect the needs of today's markets.</P>
      <P>I take issue with Senator Hayes.  His perception was that these courses were an end in themselves. They started off as such but are now part of a progression and the Minister has highlighted very forcibly that this should be so in order to allow people to move from a PLC course to a certificate course.  Colleges, such as Ballyfermot senior college and Coláiste Íde, Finglas, have many courses which are now validated as certificate courses and are linked to regional technical colleges thus allowing students to progress.  I hope that would be an avenue for those who do not make into the regional technical colleges.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister supports the overall thrust of this motion but there is a perception that regional technical college students are covered while PLC students are not and therefore, there is an inequality.  I am dealing with one student who left my school to do a course in Ballyfermot senior college.  He came back to me saying he could not maintain the pace because his family did not have enough money.  Many students like him work at night in pubs in order to eke out an allowance for themselves.  We must look at this issue on that basis.  I hope between now and September, when the courses begin, the Minister will make a statement that we will consider students in that situation.  Most students come from Dublin but some courses require people to travel from the country and these students are discriminated against.  That is why I put down the motion.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated she was considering this issue and I thank her.</P>

      <P>I am moving the amendment on behalf of Senator Lee.  Does the Minister consider it is necessary to include the qualification &ldquo;violent&rdquo; in the exemptions given to the Garda Síochána under the section.  Section 27(1)(a)(ii) states:</P>
      <P>With regard to employment in the Garda Síochána or the prison service, nothing in this Act applies to the assignment of a man or, as the case may require, a woman to a particular post where this is essential in order to guard, escort or control violent individuals or quell riots or violent disturbances.</P>
      <P>The amendments seek to delete the word &ldquo;violent&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 27 provides a limited exclusion for the Garda Síochána from the scope of the legislation as far as the gender ground is concerned. The purpose of the exclusions in subsection (1)(a)(ii) and (iii), which are the subject of Senator Lee's amendments, is to allow the Department of Justice to discriminate on the basis of sex where a preponderance of gardaí or prison officers of one sex, usually men, would be more obvious in quelling or preventing certain violent situations.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendments would be to broaden the scope of the exclusions thereby allowing discrimination to apply far more widely than would be necessary to deal with violent individuals or situations.  In those circumstances a wide range of duties and assignments in both the prison service and the Garda Síochána would fall outside the scope of the anti-discrimination provisions of the legislation.  Such a position would be most disadvantageous from the point of view of employees of both sexes in these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, women prison officers would have no redress under the Bill if they were continually rostered for desk duties and excluded from the main work of a prison officer, which is to guard and escort prisoners.  Despite the likelihood that a similar case to my example would not arise in practice, it would be most undesirable and probably contrary to EU law to allow for it <Col N="607" /> by way of exclusion in the Bill.

      <P>In page 26, subsection (2)(b), line 20, to delete &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am also moving this amendment on behalf of Senator Lee.  This issue arises where the Minister for Justice considers there are insufficient numbers of either men or women serving in the Garda Síochána or the prison service.  Section 27(2)(b) provides that the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, can, by order, state that the Act shall not apply to competitions for recruitment to the Garda Síochána or the prison service.  Should this not be within the ambit of the Minister for Justice alone?  Is it necessary to have the consent of a second member of the Cabinet?</P>
      <P>I have more than a passing interest in this aspect because it applies to other places of employment.  For example, the issue of the imbalance in the male and female intake to colleges of education repeatedly arises for educationalists and the Minister for Education in trying to create an adequate balance of role models in specific areas.  The amendment seeks to delete the reference to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform in the section to allow the Minister for Justice to act alone.  In the context of delivering better Government and making people responsible for their areas in terms of how decisions are made, is it necessary to involve a second Minister in this decision making process which is obviously a functional matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator O'Toole will find me equally convincing on this amendment. Section 27(2) allows the Minister for Justice to recruit on a single sex basis to the Garda Síochána and the prison service.  The scope of the provision is confined to cases where there are not enough members of one sex to meet privacy and decency requirements of prisoners or suspects or to deal with violent situations.  The services in question come within the remit of the Minister for Justice but the exclusions which may be required come within the scope of the Bill.  In law it would have been open to either Minister to <Col N="608" /> make the order, given that both have different responsibilities relevant to it.</P>
      <P>My primary responsibility is to ensure the integrity of equality legislation while the primary responsibility of the Minister for Justice is to ensure the effective running of the services.  The consensus approach, which we consciously adopted in the provision, will facilitate the development between us of a well conceived proposal for an order in this area should it prove necessary in the future.  I hope the Senator will review the amendment and withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 32, subsection (1), line 28, after &ldquo;special&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I read section 35 I interpreted it as meaning that it is not unlawful for an employer to pay to an employee with a disability a special rate of remuneration for particular work.  In other words, a person with a disability could receive more remuneration than that to which they were entitled for the work they had produced.  In this regard I will return to my earlier example about parachute making.  An able bodied employee might turn out 100 parachutes while an employee with a disability might produce 60.  I had presumed that the section meant that the person producing less work would receive the same rate of pay as the able bodied person.  It was only when I reconsidered the section that I discovered it means the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the rationale behind the section is to increase the employment potential of disabled persons.  I am also aware that the rate of employment among such people is extremely low. Therefore, if a person can only turn out six as opposed to ten pieces of work they will be paid for what they produce and remain in employment. <Col N="609" /> However, although this increases employment opportunities, it is discriminatory because, while these people may not be capable of producing the same end product, they may work 40 hours per week.  If it were possible to use the term &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; a person producing ten pieces of work could not claim they were receiving less pay for the same output.  I do not know whether my argument makes sense but that is the object of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I examined Senator McGennis' amendment to section 35(1) closely and I understand there may be some sensitivity to the term &ldquo;special rate of remuneration&rdquo; used here. However, I am concerned about the possible implications of replacing the term &ldquo;special&rdquo; with the term &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo;.  As it stands, this provision would cover a situation where an enhanced rate of remuneration is provided but there could be some confusion about the interpretation of &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This subsection is intended to facilitate the employment of persons with a disability whose capacity to do the same amount of work as other employees is restricted.  It must be accepted that in some cases there will be persons with a disability who, even with reasonable accommodation, will not be in a position to satisfy the principle of equal pay for equal work.  The NRB already recognises such circumstances and in its efforts to promote the employment of such persons it makes arrangements to subsidise the costs of such employees.  However, where the NRB is not involved I would not wish to preclude the possibility of an employer making a genuine effort to increase the participation of persons with a disability in employment, particularly such persons whose capacity to perform is seriously restricted.</P>
      <P>I will examine this amendment further to see if perhaps there may be a more appropriate wording to achieve this objective and facilitate greater participation of persons with a disability. However, I do not intend to adapt this provision in any way which would exclude the principle of equal pay for equal work from workers with a disability who are fully capable of doing like work with other employees, with or without reasonable accommodation.</P>

      <P>I move this amendment on behalf of Senator Norris, who is indisposed and will return to the House shortly.</P>
      <P>Section 37 is the crucial part of the Bill.  During this afternoon's debate we argued about minor aspects of this extraordinarily intricate legislation. I did not have an opportunity to state it earlier, but I must place on record my appreciation of the work invested in this complicated legislation by the draftspeople.  However, the Bill is fatally flawed in respect of section 37.  I believe I have convinced the Minister of my argument but I have failed to convince him to act on the basis of it.  I appeal to him to give it further consideration.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with the area of ethos and what is required under the Constitution in various ways.  This section deals with churches, hospitals and the people who work in them.  An example of what worries me was reported in British and Irish newspapers last week under the headline &ldquo;Teacher forced to resign&rdquo;.  The article states:</P>
      <P>In what is thought to the first case of its kind in England, a Catholic teacher has been forced to quit her job because she married a divorced man.</P>
      <P>The decision by the deputy head teacher, Ms Bernadette Nott (36), to marry twice-divorced Mr. Malcolm Hornby made her position &ldquo;untenable&rdquo; in the eyes of the governors of St. Augustine's Primary School, in Stamford, Lincolnshire, where she had worked for seven years.</P>
      <P>Ms Nott said &ldquo;My only sin was falling in love and marrying.  That seems to be a sin that cannot be forgiven.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am concerned because the Minister and I received representations at the highest level from the Catholic Church authorities.  They assured and convinced the Minister, but not me, that such a situation would not arise in one of their schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people referred to in the article did not have the protection afforded by the legislation which the Minister proposes the House should pass.  If that can happen without the force of legislation or a Constitution which provides such an out clause, I dread to think of the nightmare scenario which could develop for teachers and nurses working in Catholic institutions throughout Ireland.  I am aware that the Minister was informed, in writing and verbally, on many occasions that the Churches would not be interested in taking this kind of action.  I pointed out to him that the Churches would not take <Col N="611" /> action but individual boards of management would use legislation to take this kind of precipitate action.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter on Second Stage and, in the interim, a case has arisen in a Church school in England.  Will the Minister explain why teachers should not be concerned about this matter?  I am particularly worried about the position of primary school teachers.  While operative or surgical interventions may occur in hospitals in high profile events such as those we discussed during the past number of weeks in a different context, this will not become a major issue in universities or post-primary schools.  However, it will become an important issue at primary school level where huge demands will be made on teachers.</P>
    <P>At this stage I will refer to amendment No. 38, in my name, until Senator Norris returns to the House.  Amendment No. 38 seeks to protect the ethos of schools.  We also want to ensure parental choice and reasonable protection for the employment possibilities and promotion prospects of primary teachers.  The Churches are adopting a grossly unfair and unnecessarily aggressive approach to this legislation.  Over the years teachers, Churches and parents have found a delicate balance between each other's private expectations, arrangements and beliefs.  It would be unwise and imprudent of the Churches to upset this balance as they are about to do. However, they will not find a way to do this because teachers are in favour of a choice in education.</P>
    <P>Teachers have recommended for years that parents should have the option of sending their children to nondenominational schools.  We have also said that denominational schools run by Churches should also be an option because variety is important and nobody wants dull uniformity anywhere, particularly in the education sector. Are we saying it is beyond the power of human ingenuity to draft legislation that protects the private lives of teachers but which also allows them to have honest and fair prospects of promotion and access to employment, while at the same time protecting the ethos of schools and allowing parents to have a choice in education?</P>
    <P>There is a way of doing this in the context of our Constitution.  No person, legislator or Minister, could argue other than that it would be wrong to allow an employee or a teacher to actively undermine the ethos of a school.  In other words, if a teacher ridiculed the religion being taught to the children or undermined it in any way, it would be unacceptable and offensive to parents and to everyone involved in education in the context of what is required in our Constitution. Should Churches be given the authority to deal with such situations?</P>
    <P>I do not have a difficulty with many aspects of section 37.  However, I have a problem with section 37(1), which states:</P>
    <P>A religious, educational or medical institution which is under the direction or control <Col N="612" /> of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment which promotes certain religious values shall not be taken to discriminate against a person for the purposes of this Part or <i>Part II</i> if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) it takes action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution.</P>
    <P>If we could ensure that this legislation would be confined to dealing with religious matters, we would not have a difficulty with it.  However, there will be problems because we have now legislated for divorce.  It is only a matter of time before two divorced teachers, one of whom is taking the Confirmation class and the other the First Communion class in a Catholic school in a village in rural Ireland, develop a relationship and someone says that their living arrangements are unacceptable to the Church which is running the school and are undermining its religious ethos. That will be argued reasonably and forcefully and it will be difficult to resist.  These two teachers could find themselves in the same situation as the woman in Lincolnshire.  As sure as it happened in England, it will happen here.</P>
    <P>At least the people in England will be able to fight it through the courts on the basis that it was an unfair or unjust dismissal.  If, before this legislation was introduced, a Church here moved against the teachers in the situation I described, it would have to prove the reasonableness of its position either through a judicial review case or an unjust dismissal's case if it was not covered by unfair dismissals legislation.  Now it will only have to prove that these steps had to be taken because it was &ldquo;reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>People will not be able to survive in that milieu. What we are doing is wrong but there is a way to deal with it.  If the Minister and I agree that we can live with this if it is confined to religion, then let us do it in one of two ways.  We could restrict it to the religion ground but that is not possible because religion ground, as defined in the Bill, is narrow in that it only applies to where two people are of differing religion.  A number of other grounds are listed in the amendment, such as &ldquo;gender ground, the age ground, the marital ground, the family status ground, the sexual orientation ground, the race ground or the travelling community ground&rdquo;.  I hope we will add the trade union ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We must ensure that action is not taken in a way that would be offensive or that it is not used as a defence.  By not allowing it to discriminate on the grounds I listed, including the <Col N="613" /> disability ground, it restricts it to religious matters. It is not restricted to the religion ground as defined in the Bill.  This is what the Minister is trying to achieve.  The board of management of a school could use the private life of a teacher to say that the way they are living their life is anathema to and undermining the Catholic ethos of the school.  Therefore, they were not going to consider them for the post of principal, promote them or take whatever action they may consider necessary to stop them.  My legal advice is that this can happen.  If I am wrong will the Minister say that it cannot happen?  I do not want him to say that they would have to prove this on various different grounds.  There is a legal loophole which allows the board of management of a school to use aspects of a teacher's private life to his or her disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I concede that the religion ground is narrowly defined in the Bill.  By excluding the other grounds specified it is down to religious matters. An easier way might have been to include a statement about private lives.  However, having looked at this possibility I concede that it is not possible to do so.  There are aspects of a teacher's private behaviour which could rightly be used as grounds for dismissal or disciplinary action.  However, this should never include the relationship the teacher is in, their marital status, sexual orientation or the other grounds which have been specified by the Minister in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There are 40,000 teachers and 30,000 nurses who are fearful of this legislation being used against them.  Would the Minister accept an amendment which would give him what he is trying to achieve?  At the same time this amendment would give the Churches the protection they need for the ethos of their schools.  I accept that this issue must include disability.</P>

      <P>I understand the difficulties the Minister has with this Bill.  This State has given enormous powers to the various Christian traditions to run schools and hospitals.  They now run almost all the schools and many of the hospitals.  Consequently, this Bill will affect a large number of people.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has spoken of how this Bill will affect his members, particularly those within the Roman Catholic tradition.  I have had representations from members of the minority Churches, particularly the Church of Ireland.  It has been said to me that this section is intended to protect the ethos of the minority religions.  I very much appreciate what the State is doing in this regard.  However, I resent the quoting of Northern Ireland legislation, which has removed schools and hospitals from equality legislation. Northern Ireland is not the type of society we should follow.</P>

    <P>The Minister has said that what matters is not what people are but what they do.  I understand why he says that the ethos of certain schools should be preserved.  That is the right of parents. <Col N="614" /> However, like Senator O'Toole, I have many concerns about this section.</P>
    <P>On 26 February, the Church of Ireland sent a fax to its national school teachers.  The letter concerns the Employment Equality Bill and states:</P>
    <P>The Church of Ireland board of education today released publicly a statement on the Employment Equality Bill currently progressing through Seanad Éireann.  In it the board offered an assurance to teachers that the passing of the Bill would not alter the sympathetic and fruitful relationship between management and teachers which has traditionally existed in Church of Ireland schools.  The following is the full text of the statement.</P>
    <P>The board of education regrets the attempts which were made to remove entirely section 37 (1) of the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, as originally proposed by the Government.  The board welcomes the efforts of the Government to protect the religious ethos of schools in the drafting of the amendment to section 37(1)(a) which was passed by the Dáil on Wednesday 5 February 1997.  However, while the board acknowledges that the intention of subsection (b) was to prevent the undermining of religious schools and other institutions, it believes that, as presently stated, the subsection is unsatisfactory from the point of view of teachers and management.</P>
    <P>The board assures teachers in Church of Ireland schools that the traditional ethos of these schools in which teachers and managements have had a sympathetic and fruitful relationship remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>I have also had a communication from the Past Students Association of the Church of Ireland College of Education.  They expressed concerns of which the Minister is aware.  The association supported amendment No. 38 which proposes subsection (1)(c):</P>
    <P>it provides that discrimination is on grounds other than the gender ground, the age ground, the marital ground, the family status ground, the sexual orientation ground, the race ground or the travelling community ground.</P>
    <P>It is important to address this issue because the board of management has expressed concern that the traditional relationship between it and its staff should remain stable, and those in employment are concerned that this legislation may allow them to be the only people within this State to be discriminated against on these grounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been rightly praised for the work he has done.  Can he convince other members of the Government that this issue is causing grave concern to a large segment of the community, which includes members of minority religious traditions?  It is important that this is publicly known.  It is not the case that this section has been included to protect members of the minority traditions.  They also have anxieties.  Can <Col N="615" /> some movement be made on this section so that people will only be dismissed if their professional conduct is in conflict with the ethos of the institution? People are entitled to this form of protection.</P>

      <P>Turning this debate into a charade is an easy way out.  This is very serious.  The Bill is to remove discrimination in peripheral areas but permits it to continue in the principal areas where it functioned in the past.  That is unwise.  Discrimination existed in the past in national and secondary schools and in private hospitals, most of which were controlled by religious interests.  It is astonishing and regrettable that those should be exempted from the principal clauses in this Bill.</P>
      <P>These sections should be omitted but that is unlikely to happen.  Accordingly, I have put down amendments to permit discrimination when it is absolutely necessary to preserve the ethos.  Ethos is not defined except in a document entitled <i>The Governance of Schools.</i>  There it is defined as being in accordance with the doctrines, moral teachings, traditions, practices and customs of the Church as defined by the Church from time to time.  That is a very narrow and sectarian definition, so a very sectarian point of view is being protected.</P>
      <P>There may be circumstances in which this could be justified, but that has to be carefully considered. To say there are &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; grounds gives too much latitude; it is just tolerable that we accept that it should be &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; to preserve the ethos.  I have had correspondence from the churches, including the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland and only one letter expressed any fear about the position if this section were deleted but even that person would be reassured if he or she understood that the capacity to discriminate would be supported if it were &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;; that should be the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> My amendment No. 36 proposes:</P>
    <P>In page 34, subsection (1) (b), line 30, to delete &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;essential&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 37 proposes:</P>
    <P>In page 34, subsection (1) (b), line 32, after &ldquo;institution&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;during working hours&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The relevant section states that the institution shall be exempt if&mdash;</P>
    <P>...it takes action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution.</P>
    <P>There is case law to which Senator O'Toole referred on this matter.  In England a woman was dismissed because she married a divorced man. In Scotland a school gardener went to a gay rights demonstration in Edinburgh.  He appeared in a newspaper photograph of the crowd and was fired.  There was no evidence that the parents were disconcerted by this, that he had tried to provoke the school or that his action in expressing a conscientious political decision had undermined the ethos of the school.  The governors of the school had an apprehension, real or imagined, that the school's reputation might be damaged by the open and honest expression of his point of view in a legal and democratic manner.  However, their decision was acceptable and legal and that decision was upheld on appeal.  The same situation would occur with this legislation as it is framed.</P>
    <P>I seek a small change in wording.  &ldquo;Reasonable&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.  If one wants to preserve the ethos of a school, surely action should be taken only where it is necessary to do so.  If one is permitted to take such action where it is necessary, logically the ethos can be preserved.  However it will only be preserved in circumstances where it is necessary.  Should one make it essential for an employee not to undermine the religious ethos of an institution during working hours, one has equally protected the ethos and cut away the grey area in which discrimination may operate against an employee.</P>
    <P>This section conflicts with a number of international positions taken up by the State and also with the Constitution.  The Campaign to Separate Church and State has written to the President and asked her to refer this Bill, with particular reference to this section, to the Supreme Court for a judgment on its constitutionality.  That group has reasonable grounds for that position, although the Minister's advisers may disagree.  The Constitution states:</P>
    <P>1º Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.</P>
    <P>This section does not do that.  I agree with Senator O'Toole when he says that discrimination <Col N="617" /> should be confined to the narrowest grounds possible.  Why should a Church of Ireland school employ a Church of Ireland teacher of geometry?  What is so different about Protestant Euclid and Catholic Euclid?  It is acceptable where the religion or ethos of the school must be taught but to reserve the right to promote a particular form of mathematics or geography seems absurd, neurotic and insular.</P>
    <P>Section 37 is also repugnant to Article 44.2.3º of the Constitution, which states:</P>
    <P>3º The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the grounds of religious profession, belief or status.</P>
    <P>This is precisely what the section appears to set out to do and seems to be in conflict with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other international instruments that can be examined.  I will not place them on the record of the House.  However, I would like to refer to them.  There is the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.  This was proclaimed at the General Assembly of the United Nations on 25 November 1981 and it was so urgently pleaded by the Irish delegation that it became known internationally as the &ldquo;Irish Declaration&rdquo;.  Article 2 states:</P>
    <P>No one shall be subject to discrimination by any State, institution, group of persons or person on the grounds of religion or belief.</P>
    <P>Yet, it seems we are doing precisely that in this Bill.  Article 3 states:</P>
    <P>Discrimination between human beings on the grounds of religion or belief constitutes an affront to human dignity and it disavows the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and shall be condemned as a violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and enunciated in detail in the International Covenants on Human Rights and as an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations between nations.</P>
    <P>Article 4 states:</P>
    <P>All states shall take effective measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief.</P>
    <P>Article 4, section 2 states:</P>
    <P>All states shall make all efforts to enact, or rescind legislation where necessary, to prevent such discrimination.</P>
    <P>This Bill is removing discrimination in a number of areas but is allowing it to remain in the principle area in which it is likely to operate.</P>
    <P>Religious ethos is clumsily and vaguely defined in the nebulous document exchanged between the Roman Catholic Church and the Minister.  In terms of the ethos of the Roman Catholic <Col N="618" /> Church, as I understand it, and as it has been publicly and shamelessly proclaimed by no less an authority than Cardinal Ratzinger, it is not only moral but also required of Catholics to discriminate in good faith against people on the basis of sexual orientation.  That is repugnant to any notion of human rights and if we are going to kow tow to the Roman Catholic ethos and are going to grant to people the right to discriminate against anybody who appears to conflict with that ethos, we are handing an invitation to denominational schools to discriminate on one of the very bases on which we have outlawed discrimination in employment in a sweet shop.</P>
    <P>In educational terms that is a very bad example to be setting our children.  It is from the educational system &mdash; not merely the lessons but the demeanour, behaviour and the respect accorded to different people within the school system &mdash; that children will learn about values.  If the Bill continues, unamended in this form, I firmly believe it will become an incitement to discrimination, not an inhibition.  For that reason it is urgent that we attempt to amend this Bill.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to agree with us, particularly in the light of the White Paper on Education's proposals.  Under the heading of the outline of legislative provisions it states on page 221 that the provisions relating to the teaching profession generally could include provisions relating to the position of teachers in schools, their duties and rights, particularly their rights in respect of discrimination and their right to earn a livelihood.  These are the very rights that are being clipped back by this legislation.  They are certainly not being enhanced.  Nobody, irrespective of what verbal or imaginative skills they had, could possibly maintain these rights are being enhanced.  They also run counter to the State's obligations and commitments under the United Nations Human Rights Covenant.</P>
    <P>In 1993 we had to account for our human rights record under the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights before the United Nations Human Rights Committee in Geneva. The Government's delegation was led by the then Attorney General, Mr. Harry Whelehan, who told the United Nations Human Rights Commission that &ldquo;priority was being accorded... to the non-discriminatory treatment of minorities... in regard to education, employment&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the question of religious discrimination in education was to be addressed in the current review of equality legislation&rdquo;.  Mr. Whelehan is a very fine lawyer but I would not have considered him to be the most radical of figures to emerge in this State.  Yet, here he was telling the United Nations Human Rights Commission that Ireland intended to address, as a matter of priority, the question of existing discrimination in education on the grounds of religion.  In the Bill this is exempted. I find that extraordinary.  Is this the will of the Irish people?</P>
    <P>If we look at our knowledge of what the will of the Irish people is, it tells us that this is not so. <Col N="619" /> For example, in <i>Prejudice and Tolerance in Ireland</i>, published in 1973 by Fr. Micheál Mac Gréil, more than 1,000 Dubliners were sampled; 87.5 per cent disagreed with the statement that an applicant's religion should be considered when considering them for a responsible position. Almost 90 per cent thought religion should be irrelevant.  In February-March 1992 Abacus Analysis carried out a survey in which 239 representative voters in the Wicklow and Kildare Dáil constituencies were surveyed in a multiple choice question.  Some 95 per cent said they would prefer Catholic teachers as long as they were good people.  However, the religious beliefs of teachers ought not to be taken into account when selecting, promoting or dismissing teachers in national schools where teachers' salaries were paid by the Department of Education.  The remaining 5 per cent expressed a preference that all teachers must be practising Roman Catholics in order to be eligible for selection or promotion. Teachers who did not conform to Roman Catholic doctrines should be dismissed for not doing so.  We have a 95:5 per cent opposition to discrimination on the grounds of religious belief.  I think the 95 per cent are representative of the decent, tolerant majority of people in this society.</P>
    <P>I believe it is very important that we recognise that there seems to be very little public demand for these kinds of stringent measures.  It should be possible to water this legislation down.  I acknowledge there has been pressure on the Minister, pressure that has come not just from the Roman Catholic Church.  It would be most unfair to target them exclusively.  Pressure has also come from the Church of Ireland which is nervous about a dilution of belief among its members. Can I point to the fact that in the school which services the Minister's own religious minority, the very fine school of Stratford, all the present teaching staff are non-Jewish.  In the Islamic schools &mdash; Islamic religion tends to be very severe on these matters &mdash; all of the staff are not required to be Muslim.  They are prepared to accept a kind of pluralism which the two major Christian denominations feel less comfortable with.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look as seriously and as carefully as he can at these amendments.  I hope that my friends in the Fianna Fáil Party will find their usual moral stance to be vindicated on this occasion and that they will not be found in the most unusual position of being accused of lacking moral courage.  Far be it from me to launch that particular missile at so worthy a group of colleagues.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Norris is losing allies by the minute.  He may find he loses even more than he intended.  I will immediately concede that this is a very difficult area.  I accept that it is appropriate for a school of whatever denomination <Col N="620" /> or no denomination at all to wish to preserve its ethos.  That is the point Senator Henry made.  On the question of choice, if parents want to send their children to a school of a particular denomination or a non-denominational one, that should be their prerogative.  The State interferes with that choice at its peril and to the detriment of constitutional provisions.  Can that choice be reconciled with ensuring that staff of schools or hospitals are protected?  This is what amendment No. 38 seeks to achieve.</P>
      <P>I concede that the Bill was improved in the Dáil and that it is closer to what we desire. However, it is not as close as we wish.  It is extremely important that minorities in the State should preserve their ethos.  I accept the difficulty of defining ethos but it is something we all recognise when we visit schools.  It is extremely important that the minority ethos of whatever group &mdash; Jewish, Church of Ireland, Methodist or no religion &mdash; be protected.  There is an obligation to protect that diversity for the good of society because of the dominance of my religion, Roman Catholicism. It is essential that that diversity survives and is protected because it is vulnerable and has been declining.  There are many examples of schools closing while there are other examples of schools which have flourished.  The issue is one of choice and of protecting teachers in the system. It should not be possible to discriminate against somebody because of colour or disability.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a primary school board of management.  I would never wish somebody to be discriminated against even on grounds of religion but I see the capacity for fundamentalist Ayatollahs to use the legislation as an excuse to prevent people whom they regard as undesirable from gaining employment.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; used in section 16 (4), which we debated at length, is relevant here.  It is open to busybodies to advise the board of management of allegations regarding the suitability of somebody for a job thus jeopardising their job or promotional prospects.  It should not be possible to discriminate against somebody because we dislike their lifestyle.  It is possible to reconcile the principle of protecting the ethos of the institution while also protecting teachers or other employees from discrimination.  Amendment No. 38 achieves that reconciliation.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with amendment No. 35 tabled by Senator Norris removing &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;; neither do I agree with his amendment No. 36 calling for the removal of &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; in favour of &ldquo;essential&rdquo;. I am taking my courage in my hand when I say to Senator Norris that neither amendment is necessary.  We are not allowed to refer to Senator Norris in his absence.</P>

      <P>What we are arguing about are the grounds which can be used to prevent somebody being employed or promoted.  Lifestyle is not sufficient grounds.  Just because we dislike the lifestyle of somebody is not sufficient grounds.  However, it is correct and appropriate for a school or hospital to employ people who will not undermine the ethos of those institutions.  Allowing that happen is part of the diversity we seek in society.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris mentioned a survey suggesting that 90 per cent of people in Dublin city thought nobody should be discriminated against on religious grounds when they seek a responsible position.  This does not surprise me.  I note Senator Norris is now in the House.</P>

      <P>The Senator is losing more ground. I would expect that 95 per cent of the citizens of Dublin, being reasonable people, would say nobody should be discriminated against on religious grounds when applying for a job. However, I am certain that a large majority of them would say that a school could appoint somebody in line with its religious ethos.  I am confident of that.  There are many precedents for surveys showing different things.  There are surveys showing that the State should not fund political parties while other surveys show that private individuals should not fund political parties.  In other words, nobody should fund political parties. There are inconsistencies.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Irish Declaration&rdquo; of the UN refers to the appointment of people to responsible positions without discrimination and ensuring that people in their ordinary activities are not discriminated against.  However, it does not extend to the area suggested by Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 38 is a valuable one and the Bill can be improved.  The Minister went a considerable distance in the Dáil in amending section 37 and I think we can go further.  The spirit of amendment No. 38 should be taken on board.</P>

      <P>This is the nub of the difficulty in the legislation.  The problem is trying to find a formula of words protecting the ethos of the relevant institutions while at the same time protecting individual freedoms of employees and potential employees.  I strongly support Senator O'Toole and others when they say that the lifestyle of the employee, or potential employee, should not be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> Senator O'Toole referred to a case in Britain. I would be extremely concerned if I thought such a case could be successful on behalf of an institution here because of this legislation.  We all share the same desire about the wording of this Bill.  I welcome the changes the Minister made in the Dáil.  However, I do not know if the wording proposed by Senators O'Toole, Henry and Dardis would tighten the protection for teachers.</P>
    <P>On a technical point, I thought they should have used &ldquo;and&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>But, in effect, they can still use (a) or (b) if they are not using (c).  Maybe I am wrong but I do not see that it increases the protection. What Senator Henry read out sounded more protective because she added the words &ldquo;provided that&rdquo; to (b).  I do not know whether I am reading it wrongly and I would like the Minister's clarification but, along with all other Senators, I would like to see the protection of the private lives of teachers, nurses or anybody working for a religious, educational or medical institution. I do not know yet whether this amendment will improve the Bill as passed by the Dáil.</P>

I am still at a loss to know how the wording proposed by Senator O'Toole's amendment achieves the objective as stated by Senator Dardis and I put it down to the fact that I must be punch drunk at this stage.  Everybody agrees that there is a need to ensure that a person's private life is not used as an excuse to either debar them from employment or refuse them their right to advancement within a hospital or school.  Even if grounds of disability had been included in this &mdash; and I have no doubt that Senator O'Toole would not propose that one group be excluded &mdash; I do not understand how this amendment achieves Senator O'Toole's objective.

      <P>Senators will undoubtedly be aware of the considerable difficulty the Government had in achieving a text on this subsection which secured a balance of competing rights which warranted protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris has put forward three thoughtful amendments which he is satisfied would improve this provision.  Each of these would, in effect, upset the level of balance which the existing text delivers.  The Senator believes that a very <Col N="623" /> much more stringent exclusion should apply to any protection of religious ethos.  He spoke eloquently on Second Stage about the prospect of Church hierarchies orchestrating a regime of widespread victimisation of teachers who fail to comply with strict religious requirements.  He also conjured up images of the Inquisition to reinforce his warning of the potential abuse of this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>And I thought he was good tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to Senators that it will be for the Director of Equality Investigations or the Labour Court to be convinced that a person's exclusion is justified in any particular case.  Furthermore, it will be for the institution concerned to satisfy the director or the court on this matter.  I assure this House that the Director of Equality Investigations and the Labour Court are a very far cry indeed from the Inquisition.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Henry and Dardis have also put forward a substantive amendment to this provision. I understand the motive for this proposal. It is based on a belief that the exclusion at section 37(1)(b) is unduly broad.  The reality is, however, that this paragraph has been strictly and narrowly drafted so that while a denominational interest may argue before a Director of Equality Investigations or the Labour Court that some discriminatory action was reasonably necessary to prevent the undermining of its religious ethos, the onus will be on the institution to show the need for the exclusion.  This, in my view, will effectively provide considerable protection for the employee.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned previously that there is a delicate balance in the present text of this provision which reflects both the genuine concerns of teachers and the legitimate rights of denominations. Senators O'Sullivan and McGennis referred to the effect of amendment No. 38.  I think they are right, looking at it from a drafting point of view, because section 37(1) is saying that the institutions shall not be taken to discriminate against a person if (a) and (b).  Amendment No. 38 interferes in no way with and does not qualify or limit (a) or (b) but adds a third ground of exclusion &ldquo;or (c)&rdquo;, the meaning of which I have difficulty in following, so that the institution, instead of seeking to avail before the equality officer of either (a) or (b), may now avail of either (a) or (b) or (c).  That point is well taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Henry and Norris expressed concerns that section 37(1) may infringe our obligations under the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance Based on Religion and Belief.  The Employment Equality Bill, 1996, and in particular section 37(1) is consonant both with the Constitution and our international obligations in this area.  The instruments contain a general prohibition on discrimination <Col N="624" /> on grounds of religion and allow exemptions from that general principle in certain cases.</P>
    <P>The UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights sets down certain civil and political rights which signatory states undertake to respect without distinction as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political and other opinions, national or social origins, property, birth or other status.  These include the right to life, liberty, fair trial, freedom of conscience, political opinion, movement and residence within the state, and prohibition on torture and slavery.  The issue covered by this Bill &mdash; the right to equality in employment &mdash; is, by and large, beyond the scope of the Covenant. However, it is worth nothing that the parties to the Covenant are obliged to have respect for the liberty of parents or guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions.</P>
    <P>The Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance Based on Religion and Belief provides for the rights of freedom of thought, conscience and religion.  These rights may, however, be subject to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public morals or the fundamental rights and freedom of others &mdash; Article 1.  For example, Article 5 of the Declaration specifically provides a right of access for children to education and the matter of religion or believe in accordance with the wishes of their parents or guardians.  Furthermore, the Declaration provides for freedom of religious groups to establish and maintain appropriate charitable or humanitarian institutions &mdash; Article 6.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to a case in Lincolnshire. He made the point that the UK does not have the protective legislation which we are now proposing.  Under this Bill the institution concerned would have to show that action of the sort resorted to in the Lincolnshire case was reasonably necessary to prevent the employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution. That is a very strict test and I put it to Senator O'Toole that section 37(1) would greatly enhance the protection of a person in the context of a circumstances such as that which occurred in the UK.  He referred to other remedies which he suggested would no longer exist: judicial review, dismissal rights, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>He seemed to suggest that. Whether or not he did, let me clarify the situation. A person who is aggrieved in such a context has certain remedies available to him or her under existing law.  Judicial review, to which Senator O'Toole referred, is one such remedy, there is the Unfair Dismissal Act, 1977, and there may be others.  This Bill in no way amends, restricts or interferes with any remedy available under existing law.  No right that person has now will be taken away by this Bill.  On the contrary a range of new protections, rights and remedies are <Col N="625" /> given to a range of people who have no right or remedy at present.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole said &ldquo;The school may say that...&rdquo;.  A school may say whatever it wants but the determination as to what happens is not on the say so of the school or institution.  If is comes to the point the onus of proof is on the school to establish to the satisfaction of the equality officer &mdash; an independent adjudicating officer &mdash; that what was done undermines the ethos of their institution.  That is a right and a remedy which is not available now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted it down as he said it.  It is always possible that in certain circumstances there could be an aspect of an employee's private life that would impact on the employment.  How does the Bill limit this?  We agree that institutions may have their religious ethos.  On Report Stage in the Dáil on 5 February, Deputy Keogh said at column 715, referring to the amendment I introduced to section 37 (1), &ldquo;I am not too unhappy with the Minister's amendment...&rdquo; and went on to say &ldquo;...it is reasonable for parents and students of a school which they understand to have a certain ethos to expect that to be maintained.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are saying that they may take action to prevent a prospective employee or an employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution. We must agree that it is all right for the institution to have a religious ethos.  If one finds fault with saying that it may take action to prevent that ethos from being undermined by the person in question, the converse is to accept that it is all right for an employee to take action to undermine the religious ethos.  That is untenable.</P>
      <P>If the issue of whether a particular action, be it an aspect of a private life or other action, undermines the ethos of an institution was left to the word of the institution I could understand that would be problematic.  However, that is not the case.  We are providing an independent adjudication process and putting the onus of proof on the institution that makes the allegation.  It will have to satisfy the independent adjudication officer that the person has undermined the ethos. It may find that difficult to do.  I imagine equality officers will case a cold eye on such a suggestion. It would have to be an exceptional case before an equality officer, acting independently, would be satisfied that a person had undermined the ethos. I know that Senator O'Toole likes the term &ldquo;undermined&rdquo; and I agree that it is useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> We accept that an institution is entitled to have its ethos.  Are we then saying that it is all right for an employee to undermine it?  The provision allows an institution to take action if the employee is undermining the ethos.  The converse is that an employee may undermine it, which is untenable.  This provision proposed is reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There are situations in which it might be objectively held that a teacher or an employee was undermining the ethos of the church.  That might be a finding in fact.  However, it might not be a bad thing.  In terms of the Roman Catholic ethos, it is clear that on the interpretation given by the Vatican and the Curia the existence of a homosexual teacher who was not deeply and bitterly ashamed of his or her condition constitutes an undermining of that ethos. That has been maintained consistently in statements from the Vatican, principally under the present Pope and Cardinal Ratzinger.  In establishing and confirming the known ethos of the church we are wittingly accepting this.</P>
      <P>An objective analysis would come to the view that a well balanced, happy and secure gay person rather than a miserable, neurotic and penitent one, would by his or her very existence undermine the ethos of an institution.  This case was made against me in the University of Dublin, not in any national school.  I was considered to be undermining the university, not through any propaganda I was making on behalf of my sexual orientation but simply because I was a good and popular student and might be seen as a role model.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that teachers will be secure in their employment?  Is it not good teaching practice to intelligently challenge the ethos of any Church?  Are we to take it that an intellectual challenge raised by a teacher in terms of comparative religions, for example, undermines the ethos of the Church?  Would it not be better for the students to have an intelligent challenge to their ethos or beliefs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister guarantee that under the legislation as framed the Eileen Flynn case could not recur?  I do not believe her rights would be guaranteed and, based on her public statements, neither does Ms Flynn.  I ask the Minister to reiterate clearly and explicitly that the case instanced by Senator O'Toole would not recur under this legislation.  I also ask him to state that the Bill would cover the case I instanced, concerning a Scottish gardener who attended, in his own time, a political meeting at which he expressed views which some of the governors of a school felt might undermine its ethos.  His subsequent dismissal was upheld on appeal under Scottish law.  Although it was never shown that any damage had been done, it was held that the governors had reasonable apprehension that such damage might occur to their school.  My belief is that those three cases would, regrettably, still be possible under the legislation as currently framed. If the Minister can convince me that is not the case I will be happy.  In any event I do not intend to press any of my amendments.  I will reconsider <Col N="627" /> the thoughtful contributions of the Minister and some of my colleagues with a view to reframing the amendments and reserving the right to resubmit them on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In all honesty, some of the Minister's replies to me were somewhat specious.  I will deal with them and may stand to be corrected. As to what is and is not available, the record will show I did not state that access to existing remedies would be reduced; however, by this legislation, the Minister will reduce their effectiveness.  If a teacher were sacked tomorrow on an issue relating to religious ethos, he or she could follow various possibilities.  He or she could use the Unfair Dismissals Act, could claim &ldquo;unjust dismissal&rdquo;, meaning anything not dealt with under the Unfair Dismissals Act, or seek judicial review.  Whichever route the teacher chose to take, management would have to prove the case against him or her.  The Minister has now put a weapon in the hands of school managements, who can say their actions were now covered by this legislation, which gives them a base on which to set and contextualise their arguments for getting rid of teachers.  Until now they would have had to prove the reasonableness of their case; they now have been given the additional force of legislation to argue the question of ethos.  This was not available to them in this manner before.  The Minister or his advisers will say they could have used certain provisions of the Constitution, but those balances and checks were there naturally.  School managements now have a lesser burden of proof on them.  It is not a matter of access to remedies but how the Bill can be used against teachers.</P>
      <P>As to the amendments, I freely concede, as I did on Second Stage, that the Bill was vastly improved in the Dáil.  Few teachers agree with me but I had many arguments with them to prove it has been.  People thought using the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;essential&rdquo; represented a softening of the previous position.  There are at least four elements in the provision.  The Dáil has improved it because, as it is now written, the management of a school would have to prove, first, that what they were doing was reasonable; second, that it was necessary, third, that the employee was undermining or about to undermine the institution in the context of its religious ethos; and fourth, ethos was redefined as religious ethos.  I do not know the difference between &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; and &ldquo;religious ethos&rdquo; and the Minister must explain it.</P>
      <P>He has also not explained his remark that the issues could not be used as proof.  He could not say what might or might not be said, but teachers are worried that their marital arrangements could be used against them.  I believe they can be under the Bill as written and the Minister has not contradicted me.  I am worried about that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to a typographical error the word &ldquo;disability&rdquo; has been omitted from my amendment and therefore I cannot and will not press it to a <Col N="628" /> vote tonight; but I will return to it on Report Stage, having made that correction.  The Minister and Senator O'Sullivan suggested that I should have used the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;or&rdquo; in amendment No. 38.  If my amendment was accepted, the provision would read:</P>
    <P>A religious, educational or medical institution... shall not be taken to discriminate against a person ... if ... it proves that discrimination is on grounds other than the gender ground [etc.]</P>
    <P>It is easy to re-write the beginning of the amendment to cover that point by omitting the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; before my proposed paragraph (c) and allowing it to run as part of the text.  I will bring it back on Report Stage to deal with the points made by Senator O'Sullivan and Senator McGennis, having consulted with people who raised the matter and with the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I thought it was not necessary to return to the next issue but since the Minister mentioned it again, I reiterate that I was unable to write a phrase to cover the private lives issue.  I said the same to teachers who asked me that question.  I had originally intended to cover it but an element of one's private life necessarily impinges on one's work.  If a teacher arrives in drunk, or leaves in the middle of the working day to play golf four times a week, or refuses to wash himself, those aspects of his private life would be utterly unacceptable, although they might have nothing to do with the religious ethos of the school.  My amendment states that action can be taken against a teacher or an employee as regards some aspects of private lives, religion, etc.  However, the Bill should not allow the power to discriminate on certain grounds, as it does in section 37. The restricted areas in subsection (1)(a) and (b) could continue if accompanied by the proviso in my amendment that discrimination shall not be on the ground of gender, age, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, disability, race, membership of the travelling community or, if the provision is added, membership of a trade union. What else is left?  Everything else is left, but those issues are not included.</P>
    <P>Matters to do with religion are included, and these are far wider than the religion ground, as interpreted in the Bill.  I did not frame the amendment to allow discrimination to occur on the religion ground only because that would be too narrow.  It protects ethos carefully and correctly.</P>
    <P>The nightmare scenario of how information on who is sleeping with whom makes its way from the bedroom to the board of management of the school defies the imagination.  It goes beyond the valley of the squinting windows back to fundamentalism involving people passing information on each other and action being initiated on the basis of gossip.  It involves the State interfering in private lives in a way with which the Minister disagrees.  He feels as strongly on these matters as I do.</P>
    <P>The Minister has argued his position cogently <Col N="629" /> and there are elements of it with which I agree. However, he has not told me what is wrong with accepting my amendment.  In what way does it restrict what he is trying to do?  In what way does it take from clauses (a) and (b)?  In what way does it lessen the protection of the ethos on the religion ground?  We are entitled to have these questions addressed.</P>
    <P>Legislation covering the employment of teachers in religious schools is in force in many parts of the world.  Some of it &mdash; for example, in respect of some state laws in the US &mdash; is very restrictive and worrying.  However, if teachers in Irish schools are dismissed on the basis of religious ethos they will effectively be denied the constitutional right to work because they will never be employed in any other school in the State except, perhaps, in the 2 to 4 per cent of schools that are multi-denominational or, following the enactment of the Education Bill, nondenominational. This is unlike the situation in England.  At least the teacher in Lincolnshire can seek employment in the state schools system.</P>
    <P>What we are doing here in protecting the ethos is important.  However, let us do it in a way that recognises difference.  There is nothing pluralist and inclusive about this legislation.  People should be enriched by difference.  If members of the Government speak of enrichment and learning from difference, surely this can only come about from the interaction of all people?  Surely there is nothing better for a people in understanding their own ethos or culture than to be exposed to, involved in and perhaps taught by others?</P>
    <P>We are creating a polarised system.  Given the reduction in the numbers of those involved in the religious, education will be handed over to fundamentalists within the next ten years.  I am terrified by this legislation.  I will rewrite the amendment to include disability and to ensure that the first part is acceptable to Senator O'Sullivan and Senator McGennis.  I will also discuss it with the Minister's Department.  I will then ask him to tell me what is wrong with it.</P>
    <P>I have not raised my difficulties with the legislation, rather I am speaking in favour of my amendment, which strengthens the requirement of the Bill, protects ethos and finds a balance between ethos, private lives and personal opportunities. I appeal to the Minister, for the sake of the future of education and the immediacy of these issues, to concede that it is a good amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>People should be allowed to send their children to schools the ethos of which they approve; protection of the ethos of schools is, therefore, very important.  I agree with Senator Norris that philosophically it is good for children to encounter other beliefs and comparative religions.  I sent my children to schools where this was taught and which contained wide selections of traditions and religions.  I would have been dismayed if fundamentalists had started to teach them.  I therefore understand those who hold the <Col N="630" /> view that the destruction of the ethos of a school is contrary to what they want for their children.</P>
      <P>I am less sure about hospitals because there are so few hospitals within the State that can offer specialist treatment in certain areas.  I am concerned that religious beliefs may be enforced in some of the provisions which are made in the major hospitals, which are almost completely supported by State funds.  However, these concerns are not strictly relevant to this Bill, which is concerned with the position of employees.</P>
      <P>No matter what Senator Norris may say about the surveys he has read and about the great tolerance among Irish people for different views from the religious aspects of our various traditions, I am not sure that they are as accurate as we would wish.  Otherwise, why have so many people written to me expressing concern that they may be discriminated against by this legislation?  I can only take comfort from remarks made to me by the Minister, both privately and publicly, to the effect that it is not what people are but what they do that will be considered as undermining the ethos of schools.</P>
      <P>I will not press the amendment.  The Minister is sympathetic to our grave concerns and has made genuine efforts to address them.  However, I am worried that so many people from various backgrounds consider that they may be discriminated against in their employment.  They are not people who would normally be fearful of this kind of situation.</P>

      <P>I endorse Senator O'Toole's remarks.  I am terrified of fundamentalism being unleashed and allowed to control society and the schools.  I am sure the Minister shares that fear; it is one held by every democrat.  The essence of the pluralism to which we aspire is to maintain differences in religious ethos and to maintain the minority religions and the schools they operate. That is an essential element of our pluralism because of the dominance of one religion within the State and it is essential for the health of the nation.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a point about how the legislation gives more protection to rights.  There is no dispute about that; of course, the legislation enhances the protection of rights.  What is at issue is whether it enhances the protection of rights to a sufficient degree.</P>
      <P>I was struck by an aside which Senator O'Toole mentioned.  If a teacher is an alcoholic does that undermine the religious ethos of the school?  It does not undermine the religious ethos of the school, although it might undermine the school itself, which is a separate issue.  However, I have a problem which relates to the definition of disability in the Bill which includes &ldquo;a condition, illness or disease which affects a person's thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or which results in disturbed behaviour&rdquo;. Could that be construed as alcoholism?  If alcoholism fell within that definition we would then be in serious trouble.  That occurred to me as we were debating the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> The pure vindictiveness of what was done to a teacher in John McGahern's book <i>The Dark</i> was a horrific scenario.  Obviously, neither the Minister nor any of us wants something like that to happen again.  We are trying to ensure that nothing like that can happen again.  That type of unacceptable fundamentalism, to which I am sure no Member could subscribe, must not be allowed free rein or to destroy people in the way a teacher was destroyed in that novel.</P>

Surely these fundamentalists have had free rein for the last 70 years.  Why then have they have not been running amok?  Am I the only Member who feels this way?</P>
      <P>I serve on a school board of management.  Am I wrong in thinking it would take a decision of the board of management of that school to employ or dismiss somebody who it was felt was undermining the ethos of the school?  I wish to point out the composition of the boards of management of schools to those who are concerned about fundamentalists running riot and creating misery for people of different sexual presuasions, religious ethos or marital situations.  The board of a post primary school is composed of the principal, who might not be a member of a religious community and usually is not in post primary schools; two teachers; two parent representatives and two diocesan representatives.

      <P>I will tell Senator McGennis a story from her constituency.  A school was established in Santry three years ago by the Tridentine rite.  It was operated under a system which was not, to a certain extent, completely clear to the parents.  When they brought in rules such as the introduction of prayers at various parts of the school day and that girls had to wear skirts below their knees there was wide media interest in this fundamentalist school.  Effectively, the State moved to close the school; but it could not do so because it did not have the authority under the current legislation. It is a scare story which has not gone away.  The current Minister for Education was involved in dealing with it but could not find a way out, nor could I or anybody else.  This opens the gates to more of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future if a fundamentalist group sets up a school it will ensure that any of its teachers are also fundamentalists.  Teachers reflect society and there are teachers who are campus crusaders and other fundamentalists.  I am not speaking for those people.  The Minister knows my views on this and I am speaking about the mainstream of teachers who are completely committed to their faith.  This is not the liberal agenda.  The people <Col N="633" /> who are raising this issue with me have not put religion behind them but are secure people who practise and believe in their faith.</P>
    <P>The last group which met the Minister were a group of Church of Ireland teachers who are involved with the Church of Ireland board of education, have a huge commitment to that area and felt that some of the points which I raised at an earlier stage of the debate did not fully reflect the need to protect their ethos.  They were entitled to that view, which was reasonably put.  However, we came to a position of understanding on how we might conclude this.  It is their view that this amendment is an appropriate way to deal with the matter.  I am putting the case that we need to look to the future and to include the present.  This amendment must be acceptable to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of the identification of asylum seekers by the media.  I am concerned about some developments.  We discussed the Refugee Bill, 1996, at length in the House and had many differences with the Minister of State.  We came to an agreement on it, concessions were made and it was passed.  Getting it through the House was a long and tortuous process. Elements of it were important to us and I want to refer to the identification of refugees.</P>
      <P>We know the dangers for refugees if they are identified in the media and word gets back to their home territory.  In 1996 while we debated the Refugee Bill, a press conference was organised where two young Russians who had arrived in Ireland were identified, photographed and filmed.  Their home villages were identified and for good measure they were branded as deserters from the Russian army.  The Russian Embassy was apparently contacted by a journalist to see if it would check whether the pair were genuine deserters.  It is easy to find it humorous, but we know how difficult it was for them.  Within 48 hours the pair had fled the country and everyone assumed that they were practical jokers.  Since that time Rescue Trust has been the only organisation to raise this issue and it has had a chequered history of relationships with the Minister of State's Department. However, it is important to recognise it raised this issue and that the issue has been raised in the media since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 February 1997 photographs of nine Liberian asylum seekers appeared in the media while there was also television coverage identifying them.  I am sure the Minister of State shares my concern.  I am not raising this in order to get <Col N="634" /> somebody in the dock for breaking the law.  I raise this because what is being done is intrinsically wrong and it is completely against the spirit of what was agreed in the Act.  If the Liberians request for asylum is refused where do they turn? On appeal they could justifiably claim that following their identification in Ireland, their lives would be at risk if they were to be forcibly returned to Liberia.  If their request is granted, how will their families fare?  What will the Government's reaction be if the families are punished by the Liberian authorities?  Have the dangers to which asylum seekers are exposed upon identification and the impact of future legislation been pointed out to journalists and others?</P>
    <P>This was an intrusion.  It is wrong, will cause problems in the future and has been handled very badly.  The Department has to take responsibility for these events.  It was raised two years ago, but it still happens.  It is not good enough.  People are put at risk.  Their lives are endangered and it goes completely against the spirit of the Refugee Act. How does the Minister of State intend to deal with it?  I have to hold the Minister of State responsible in terms of representing the Department involved.  Why was this allowed to happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily agree with the Senator's concern that inappropriate media coverage of those who seek refuge on our shores from persecution in their countries of origin may be a threat to the well-being of their relatives and other connections back home.  The representatives of the media should be conscious at all times of the nature of an asylum application.  The basis of the applicant's case is that he or she is fleeing from persecution and, if that is the case, then exposure of the identity of the applicant may put people connected with the applicant who remain in the home country at risk of the same persecution.</P>
      <P>Ireland has international obligations to asylum seekers under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees.  Part of the obligation which we as a society, as distinct from a State, owe to applicants for refugee status is respect for their privacy.  This is vital, as it can be a matter of life or death if the right to privacy is inappropriately breached.  Section 19 of the Refugee Act, 1996, puts in statutory form the protection of privacy to which asylum seekers are entitled. Freedom of expression in relation to news items about asylum seekers must be subject to the greater right of the individual asylum seeker not to be put at risk or have family and friends put at risk.  The Act does not prevent the coverage of stories about asylum seekers.  It is possible to cover such stories in an anonymous way without diminishing their impact; if anything, the use of anonymous techniques will reinforce to the reader or viewer the possible risks associated with identifying the asylum seeker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Act, it will in any event be possible to run stories which identify the asylum seeker if he or she and the Minister consent.  The Minister's <Col N="635" /> consent, which cannot be unreasonably withheld, is a valuable additional protection for the asylum seeker, who may be under pressure to forgo privacy, whether that pressure be political factions related to the country of origin or simply a tabloid journalist more interested in a juicy story than in the safety of relatives back home.</P>
    <P>The work necessary to set up the new offices and procedures envisaged by the Act is going ahead in my Department.  We expect that the appointment of the Refugee Applications Commissioner will be completed shortly by the Public Services Commission and I am anxious to have that work completed to allow for the commencement of the Act as soon as possible.  In the interim, I ask that the media, when dealing with stories about asylum seekers, be conscious of the sometimes life and death consequences of identification and that, in the interests of the people whose stories they are covering, they voluntarily comply with the spirit of section 19 of the Act pending its commencement.</P>
    <P>I refer to Senator O'Toole's contribution.  The capacity of the media to tell that story was not in any way enhanced by the publication of photographs of the asylum seekers.  The media can tell the story; all we are seeking is restraint in relation to identification to protect people in the country of origin.</P>
    <P>I recall an occasion when people involved in another case were identified and the Department of Foreign Affairs was contacted by the country of origin, seeking details of the people who were identified in the media and the nature of their application in this country.  I share the Senator's views and I emphasise to the media that it can tell the story without putting named individuals and their relatives at home at risk.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's point and I accept her bona fides on the matter.  However, a mistake occurred and it is not good enough just to ask the media to have restraint.  Will the Minister assure the House that her party will circulate a copy of her statement to newspaper editors and bring this matter to their attention?  It should be formally pointed out to them by the Minister.</P>

The closing date for applications in relation to the Refugee Applications Commissioner was 19 February.  Interviews are under way and we expect that all the structures will be in place within the next few months.  The power of the Minister under section 19 to give his or her consent to the publication of the name, in addition to the consent of the refugee himself or herself, is enforceable under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect which should be considered as the legislation comes into force is a sensitisation course for interested journalists with the Department of Justice or more appropriately the Refugee <Col N="636" /> Council, an NGO which looks after the welfare of refugees, to ensure journalists know about the danger.  Thoughtlessness rather than ill will led to this problem.</P>

      <P>I presume it was not a coincidence that the Minister signed the regulations after I submitted my matter on the Adjournment. I welcome that move.</P>
      <P>Many Dublin local authority members had meetings with the Minister prior to the drafting of the legislation.  However, as a result of his discussions with local authority managers beforehand, he was aware of the extent of the problem of wandering horses in Dublin city and county. We assured him of our support when he introduced the legislation, regardless of the fact that we were in Opposition.  I welcomed the broad thrust of the Bill but the delay in enacting it has caused concern in the communities.  There was an expectation that, once the legislation was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the problem would be immediately addressed.  Yet, two months later not a single horse has been removed from the urban and suburban parts of Dublin in which they are kept by a huge number of young people.  When the legislation was debated in the House, I said it would only be as effective as the finance provided for it and the strength of Garda support for local authorities in implementing its provisions.  I hope the Minister will reassure me that the Bill will be as strong as necessary to protect animals which are subjected to cruelty and motorists and pedestrians from the possibility of accidents.</P>
      <P>There is a need for the Minister to provide funding to support the proposed equine centre for Cherry Orchard in Ballyfermot, Dublin 10, and to remove the barriers to the commencement of this project.  Balance is required in the approach to the problem of wandering horses and the phenomenon of urban cowboys.  A huge number of young people in the Ballyfermot area own horses.  They love their animals, which are their main interest in life at this stage.  The community has made a number of submissions to the Government for funding to establish an equine centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They received much favourable comment and promises that the scheme would be taken seriously and funded.  They understood it would be a pilot scheme in Dublin to address the issue of horses in urban areas.  To date, they have not received a penny in funding and the land which was earmarked for the project is still derelict.  In the Cherry Orchard estate and other areas of Ballyfermot, people have constructed stables in their back gardens.  The Minister will agree that <Col N="637" /> is unsuitable and not the way the project should be run.  However, it is either that or leave many of the animals running wild.</P>
    <P>The signal needs to be sent to owners of horses in urban areas that the local authorities and the Garda will come down heavily on those who abuse their animals by not feeding or watering them properly.  However, genuine animal lovers should be told that there is more to the legislation than just removing and disposing of the animals if they are taken in three times.  We should be sympathetic to this phenomenon in urban areas. The Cherry Orchard estate was identified as a suitable area for a project and the people there made submissions.  They are awaiting Government approval and funding.  If both aspects were taken together, it would be a positive way to approach the legislation.  As the Minister has signed the regulations, I urge him to deal with the provision of an equine centre in Cherry Orchard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter. However, there was no undue delay in enacting the legislation.  I and two officials were assigned the task of formulating the Bill two years ago but there was no previous legislation to guide us or on which to model a new Bill.  It was pioneering legislation; we were more or less given a blank sheet and asked to formulate a Bill.  We established a group which carried out wide consultations. The Bill was introduced last June and passed by Christmas.  If one considers the time it takes most Bills of this complexity to progress through both Houses, the legislation was passed in record time.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was passed, it was necessary to consider a system of identification.  Recommendations were made by different groups about various forms of identification and it was necessary to closely examine what we thought would be the best system.  We chose microchips as the best available modern technology in this area.  The Show Jumping Association of Ireland uses it effectively for jumping ponies.  It microchipped approximately 2,500 ponies and there were mistakes in only five cases which were due to human error.  My Department has handled the process of implementation of this Bill efficiently and without undue delay.  I signed the Control of Horses Act, 1996, (Commencement) Order, 1997 (S.I. No. 99 of 1997) on 3 March 1997.  The order brings Part IV of the Act, dealing with penalties for those convicted of an offence of cruelty to animals, into operation from 5 March 1997, while the provisions of the Act dealing with horse control will come into operation on 18 March 1997.  The recasting of the laws on cruelty to animals is a testament to the Government's vigorous attitude towards the issue of animal welfare.  The penalties imposed in this area have been considerably increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently arranging for the drafting of regulations under the Act in relation, <i>inter alia</i>, to the licensing and identification of horses.  I expect <Col N="638" /> these regulations to be in place by early April 1997.</P>
    <P>I have been anxious to ensure that resources are available to assist local authorities in putting the Act into effect without delay.  To this end, I made provision for the sum of £2 million in my Department's Estimates for 1997 for this specific purpose. In the past, when, for example, the Abattoirs Act was put in place, local authorities were asked to operate it without being provided with funding. However, my Department has put forward a framework of legislation through which local authorities and the Garda Síochána can operate effectively. We have also provided funding.</P>
    <P>A commitment to introduce this legislation was made in &ldquo;A Government of Renewal&rdquo; and we have delivered on it.  Previous Administrations expressed concern about wandering horses but did not take action.  The Government has delivered the goods as part of the success of its programme.</P>
    <P>As the allocation of the £2 million will be related to the severity of the horse problem at local level, I am currently completing a census of the incidence of wandering horses on a county-by-county basis.  Precise allocations will be decided in due course by reference to the relative scale of the problem in each area and the measures to be taken by local authorities to implement the Act.  The provision of funding for equine centres such as that at Cherry Orchard, Dublin 10, will be a matter for the local authorities. I agree with Senator McGennis that the Cherry Orchard project is very desirable but the Department is providing £2 million to local authorities for the implementation of the Act, which is concerned with control not development.  It is the responsibility of local authorities, vocational education committees, FÁS and ADMs to make their contribution.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for the making of by-laws by the local authorities for the control of horses.  I hope they have such by-laws ready for immediate publication.  I intend to write to local authorities to acquaint them with developments and, in particular, call upon them to initiate arrangements for the drafting of by-laws if they have not done so already.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but I believe he is aware that it will be difficult to implement the legislation.  In the past, under legislation then in place, the Garda Síochána and employees of local authorities faced serious problems with regard to their safety.  I referred to the Ballyfermot project because, if they proceed in isolation, the rounding up of horses and the implementation of the Act may prove a recipe for a riot.  Local authorities do not have the necessary funds to kick-start this project. The Minister of State pointed out that the ADMs or the partnerships may have a responsibility in this area.  Will he inform me about any other area from which we might attract the funding required?</P>

However, we were given the task of bringing forward a framework of legislation under which local authorities and the Garda Síochána could operate effectively. They could not do so until now because they did not have the necessary legislative support.  Other agencies, including local authorities, will hopefully provide support for projects such as those at Cherry Orchard and Fettercairn.  I support the Senator's argument and I agree that it is important to develop such projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I wish to make statements on five issues of importance to the organisations I represent.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for Enterprise and Employment sanction an extension of the community employment scheme for the provision of personal assistance for the disabled at the Resource Centre, Derrane, County Roscommon?  This scheme is to cease in one week and strong representations were made to me by representatives of the Resource Centre, personal assistants and disabled people.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment must allow an extension of this scheme. There is a current trend to suspend schemes but that is not appropriate in this case.  I ask that the scheme be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter I wish to raise involves the Minister for Health.  When will a proper pay structure be put in place for the grade of chartered physiotherapists?  What is the up-to-date situation regarding the present negotiations between this group and the Department of Health?  I last dealt with the Minister on this matter in December 1996.  At that time the informed me that negotiations were ongoing.  To my knowledge, however, nothing has come to fruition. This matter is a cause of concern to the grade of health workers in question and I ask the Minister <Col N="640" /> to conclude negotiations and inform me of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications instruct Bord na Móna to continue the harvesting of milled peat at the Bord na Móna Derryfadda works at Ballyforan?  This is of vital importance to the west where 20,000 acres of bog are about to be abandoned by Bord na Móna.  The permanent workforce of 11 people and 25 seasonal workers have maintained a presence in the bogs and harvested approximately 50,000 tonnes while awaiting a final decision as to whether a power station or briquette factory will be built on the site.  In the region of 20,000 acres of unused bog have been drained and readied for harvesting.  However, the limited harvest is the only means of income to which the people in the areas of Ballyforan, south Roscommon and east Galway have access.  I request that the harvesting of milled peat, which was reintroduced by one of the Minister's predecessors, not be allowed to cease.  Until a proper industry is put in place I ask that harvesting of milled peat, which may be used by one of our industries, continue for 1997.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for the Environment sanction and provide necessary funding for the Ballagh/Ballybeg water scheme in County Roscommon? This matter is becoming a thorn in the side of anyone who has had dealings with the group involved.  The Minister has had sufficient time since 1993 to deal with this matter.  All the relevant documents, contracts and costings have been sent to the Minister.  Roscommon County Council has answered every letter sent to it over the past three years.  I ask the Minister to allow this scheme to go ahead.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment to sanction and provide funding for public sewerage schemes at the villages of Ballintubber, Cloonfad and Ballinagare in County Roscommon.  The situation is the same as that which applies to the Ballybeg water scheme.  Roscommon County Council has sent all the necessary documents and costings on the Ballintubber and Cloonfad schemes to the Department.  I ask the Minister to outline the up-to-date position on the Ballinagare scheme.  These matters are being brought to public attention because of strong local representations.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader for being present in the House.  I have no doubt he will convey my concerns to the relevant Ministers and I hope a speedy reply will follow.</P>
