      <P>I have received notice from Senator Daly that on the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to outline the funding which will be provided for coastal erosion work in County Clare, and the money which is available form the EU for such measures.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Trade to introduce regulations to prevent the practice where products which appear to be Irish made are in fact manufactured outside the country.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mooney on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to review the allowances paid to elected councillors introduced in 1995.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give urgent consideration to have the plans for a new vocational education committee school at Summerhill, Mallow, expedited.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to reinstate his staff at Henshaws Meat Factory, Dock Road, Limerick, so as to enable them reopen the slaughter house and allow the plant to function properly.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the extension to replace the prefabricated <Col N="1462" /> classrooms at Pallaskenry national school, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for a new fire station in Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator Daly's and Senator Henry's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item 1. There will be 30 minutes per speaker.  Members may share their time.  The debate will be brought to a conclusion at 4 o'clock, with the Leader of the House concluding not later than 3.45 p.m.  If speakers are offering at that stage we will review arrangements, but on the basis of the information before me they should allow those who wish to speak to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  I am sure the House will facilitate any speakers offering at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
      <P>A terrible tragedy occurred 25 years ago today in Northern Ireland when 13 people were killed. A couple of weeks later a 14th person also died from injuries received that day.  Apparently new evidence has emerged which was either not available to the Widgery commission or ignored by it. The Fianna Fáil Party supports the motion by John Hume yesterday calling for a public inquiry. I understand that 75 MPs in the House of Commons have signed their names to the motion.  We commend them for making this call.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister should take immediate steps to establish an inquiry, which would help to restore the confidence of the Irish people in British justice.  I hope this message will be conveyed to the British Government, John Major, and all concerned.  We believe it is of vital importance.  In view of the evidence collected and provided by honourable and decent people over the past number of years, the time is right to call for an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to us.  I support Senator Fitzgerald's call, especially in view of the words by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs last night that any new evidence on what happened so tragically in Derry 25 years ago should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to advise on the situation regarding the environmental health officers?  It is almost the anniversary of their work to rule.  We are receiving alarming reports regarding food sanitation, rather than food safety.  There are reports of salmonella and <Col N="1463" /> lethal E-coli infections.  It is important this dispute is brought to a conclusion immediately.  I realise the officers have investigated all cases of food poisoning and have been most responsible in that regard.  However, the dispute, which has been ongoing for almost a year, cannot continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. It is desirable that the debate concludes today because there are many items on the Order Paper from the previous session.  It would be better to conclude the discussion today and I support Senator Fitzgerald's suggestion that the position should be reviewed at 3.45 p.m. if necessary.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Fitzgerald's remarks about the need to reopen the investigation into the events of Bloody Sunday at a time when that sad occasion is being commemorated.  It is unquestionable that new evidence exists on the basis of soldiers' testimony.  In such circumstances it is important that the matter is reopened.  I ask the Leader to request the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to do everything possible at that level to support the motion on the House of Commons' Order Paper, which has been signed by so many MPs, seeking the reinvestigation of this matter to bring it to a final conclusion.</P>
      <P>I raised a matter yesterday but I cannot recall if the Leader dealt with it.  It relates to the urgent need for a debate on agriculture and particularly the problems in the beef industry in light of the Egyptian ban on live cattle exports, the extension of the Russian ban to more counties, the reduction in export refunds and the revaluation of the green currency.  These developments are recent and should be discussed.  It is important the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry outlines how he is dealing with the problems in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for an inquiry into the events on Bloody Sunday.  It would not only be an assurance that the British Government is at last examining the true facts of the case as they are presented but also remind people who in those days urged the use of armed force every time a crowd gathered on the street. It was a lesson to them that the situation at that time was infinitely complex, but even today some people in the North mutter that is the only way and that they should go in and put them down. The people who need to be put down cannot be identified and Bloody Sunday was a perfect example of utter folly.  It was as if nobody had learned any lessons from Amritsar years earlier. It was an object lesson to loyalists who called for fierce action against the people on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newspapers are currently urging a general election.  The Government does not need to be reminded that it is in the interest of newspapers to call for general elections.  When an election is held, reporters go to the bar and start cashing post dated cheques because stories do not need to be collected.  They just jump onto word processors. <Col N="1464" /> Regardless of whether there are grounds for an election, I would not look to the newspapers to find them.  There is talk of a general election and the Opposition is entitled to call for it; that is its job.  However, the newspapers and the Opposition have not mentioned the effect on the peace process of open preparations for an election here at the same time as that is happening in Great Britain.  It is not a good idea or a happy outlook.  Will the Leader mention my concerns to the appropriate Minister and seek an assurance that this aspect has been considered?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>He will be very happy to hear that.  They will postpone it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to come to the House for a debate on national heritage centres and the special areas of conservation? These are major problems in the west and all mountain areas.  Many sheep farmers will be put out of business if the directive is implemented.  A debate is timely because, as Gay Byrne said on television recently, lunatics must be producing such directives in Europe.  Many directives have neither sense nor reason and Ireland should think of itself and stop heeding some of the daft directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If Europe wants to know, the cause is simple.  It is a lack of people in rural Ireland and a lack of food for most birds and wild animals. That is why they are dying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator put a question to the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Small farmers should be encouraged to set aside agriculture to feed wildlife.  That is how it would be conserved and preserved and not through daft directives which will put farmers out of business.  I appeal to the Leader to ask the Minister to come to the House to debate these subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will have an opportunity next week to express their views in detail on Northern Ireland.  However, given the day that is in it, it is appropriate that Senator Fitzgerald raised the reopening of an inquiry into the events on Bloody Sunday.  It is also significant that the matter is on the House of Commons' Order Paper today in the name of Mr. John Hume and a large number of other MPs.  I support the call for a reopening of the issue and the Tánaiste expressed his views.  It appears new evidence exists which is pertinent to the events at that time. I do not subscribe to the view that reopening the matter after so many years will add to sectarian tension.  That would not be the case.  It is important the truth is reached and that is the overriding consideration.  The experience in <Col N="1465" /> South Africa shows that reaching the truth can be a healing process.  It is most important for the families involved that their minds are set at rest regarding what exactly happened that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I raised my concerns about Ms Róisín McAliskey and I am sure the Leader conveyed the views of the House to the Tánaiste.  However, I ask him to bear in mind the urgency of the matter, given her health and the health of her unborn child.  I would be grateful for an indication next week that official concern has been expressed to the British authorities.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a full and thorough investigation of the events of Bloody Sunday.  Senator McAughtry reminded the House that the slaughtering of innocent people goes back to Amritsar. Bloody Sunday was one of the worst cases of state terrorism this century since the Sharpeville massacre.  Senator O'Sullivan correctly pointed out that when the truth emerges it is a potent force for healing and reconciliation and not necessarily division.  Some revisionists in society suggest that merely asking questions about Bloody Sunday is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator put a question to the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader investigate if there is a mechanism whereby we could find out what material is available in the Department of Foreign Affairs?  I was a civil servant at the time and I recall suggestions that the Irish authorities possessed a large amount of photographic evidence. Given the nature of this matter, an international inquiry should be sought.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht what is happening with the remnants of Luggala?  The Office of Public Works is breaking the law because it has not made any effort to reinstate the site and that is a concern.  It has become an eyesore and it is time the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht commanded the situation and outlined what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most persistent features of elections in recent years is that fewer people are voting at each successive election.  Will the Leader raise this issue with the Government in the context of changing the day of the election? We have a fixation with calling elections on Thursdays and it seems eminently sensible to change the day of the poll to a Saturday or Sunday to allow people to vote when they have the maximum amount of free time.  This would be in the interest of all politicians.  The Leader might arrange a debate on this or put it to the Government. The Seanad could lead with this proposal as I believe there is support for it among the population as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support John Hume's initiative on an inquiry into the events of <Col N="1466" /> Bloody Sunday.  I was a member of Government at the time and recall those events well.  I also recall the impact of the events on the people of Derry when we went there as an official Government delegation.  It is essential we do as much as we can to heal those wounds and vindicate those who were wrongly and maliciously accused of violence or attempted violence.  It should be done so that the healing can start.  I was in Government for many subsequent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should put a question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 25 years on and successive Governments have expressed total dissatisfaction with the Widgery whitewash.  The events of the day itself were bad enough but that an official Government &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo; should attempt to vindicate the murders and accuse the victims cannot be left on the record.  For that reason, this is not just an issue for Dublin or Ireland but one of fundamental rights.  To mark our sympathy today not just for those killed but those whose families were wrongly and outrageously implicated for things they never did, we should stand in silence before we commence to commemorate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing this matter on the Order of Business.  The Senator should put a question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader propose we stand in silence for a moment?  We could extend that to all the victims of the tragedy in Northern Ireland but we should mark our respect in some fashion today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a full inquiry into what happened 25 years ago today.  That event heightened sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland and we still see the outcome of that.  After this event many people joined organisations and got involved in violence as a reaction to it.  We still see the results of that event as the violence that ensued still continues and the reaction of people to what happened has a crucial bearing on that violence.  I fully agree with Senator O'Sullivan that knowing the truth would have a great healing effect on both communities, especially the Nationalist one, and the whole island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's call for a debate on agriculture.  On the Adjournment in December I asked for a guarantee that beef prices would be maintained in January.  I did not get that guarantee and they were not maintained. Cattle being slaughtered now are realising £60 to £70 a head cheaper than a month ago.  That is a slaughtering premium that applies in the months January to April, the purpose of which was to encourage beef farmers to winter fatten cattle.  It defeats the purpose when they do not get the beef premium.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for a debate on agriculture to address the problems in that sector as it is badly needed.  I also ask for a debate on the recent decisions of the National Roads Authority. According to the newspapers they have decided to spend money on various schemes and I am disappointed that my county is neglected.  The Croom by-pass needs to be started soon and it is not mentioned.  There are terrible traffic jams in Croom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We want a debate on the National Roads Authority announcement.  The country roads are in a very bad condition and that will have to be addressed.  The Croom by-pass is very urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the high cost of insurance for young drivers.  We have all seen the recent upsurge in the taxi business. It is a growth area throughout the country and the cost of insurance for hackney drivers is huge.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for an inquiry into Bloody Sunday.  This is the 25th anniversary and it is important this House make its voice heard.  I am very involved in the case of East Timor and the massacre in Dili was one of the pivotal points in the struggle for independence of the East Timorese.  The massacre in Derry on Bloody Sunday was a similar pivotal event in the history of this country.  It was nothing other than murder by the State which was subsequently justified by the State in a clearly partial and incomplete inquiry, which is discredited.  This must be acknowledged. I ask the Leader if it is not possible, in view of the apparently unanimous support in the House for an inquiry, for a very brief motion to be introduced? It could be passed by the House and endorsed by every Member urging the Government to request the United Kingdom authority to institute such an inquiry.  We cannot demand but we can urge the Government to request a neighbouring sovereign State to behave decently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Fitzgerald and other Senators on their call for an inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday.  It is appalling that after 25 years we are still in this situation and I support the views expressed here this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to ascertain from the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment what the current situation is relating to the drawing down of Cohesion Funds from the EU.  The Leader will be aware that there is substantial funding sanctioned for Ireland and available as Cohesion Funds for a variety of projects dealing with pollution control, provision of water services and sewerage facilities.  He will also be aware that <Col N="1468" /> there is growing concern at the levels of water pollution.  Senator O'Kennedy can advise him of the situation in Lough Derg, where there is serious concern for its future.  The Lough Derg anglers have cancelled all their trout fishing competitions for this year and this is an appalling situation for one of our most important national lakes.  There is also the problem of declining stocks of trout in the Corrib and Mask.  All the inland fisheries are threatened with pollution and, at the same time, millions of pounds are available through Cohesion Funding.</P>

      <P>A question for the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications for the funding are in Brussels.  Some projects have started but a huge number of projects are waiting to start.  The initiative must come from the Minister for the Environment and the Leader should impress upon him the necessity of indicating to the Commission the schemes in Ireland he wishes to see proceed this year.  We would like to see some starting date for Lisdoonvarna, Doolin and north Clare.  We had 500 people at a meeting in Lisdoonvarna on Monday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to emphasise how widespread the depth of feeling in the community is regarding these issues.  We had almost 600 people at a meeting in Lisdoonvarna last Monday pleading with the politicians to impress upon the Minister the desirability of releasing funds for that project.  The contract documents are with the Department.  All that is needed is a nod from the Minister and I am asking for that before there is further appalling damage done to one of our most important natural inland fisheries resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the call for a debate on the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. I concur with all that has been said.</P>
      <P>I wish to call on the Leader to seek the House's support for an investigation into the untimely death of the Brother Larry Timmins of the Franciscan Order in Clara who died under very suspicious circumstances in Kenya.  He was a brilliant young man who gave his life doing great work in that area.  The suspicious circumstances in which he died are appalling if true.  The Franciscan Order has called for an inquiry, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Tánaiste have taken a personal interest in it.  All our missionaries throughout the world and their families here are very disturbed, particularly those families with missionaries in Kenya.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> I am grateful to Senator Fitzgerald for raising the terrible events of 25 years ago in Derry.  Most of us vividly remember that day with horror and shock.  The vividness of our anger and our sorrow will probably remain with us all of our lives.  We remember with horror of a different kind the official coverup known as the Widgery report.  It is a travesty of the truth and the author should be ashamed of it.  It is in everybody's interest that the truth of what happened comes out.  I would be happy to ask that the House stands for a moment to remember, not just the people who were killed 25 years ago, but all who have lost their lives in Northern Ireland.  I thank Senator O'Kennedy for having made that proposal.</P>
    <P>If Members wish to make time available for statements and the passing of a motion in support of what John Hume is proposing in the House of Commons, the Whips can meet to arrange this.  If that is the will of the House I would certainly be supportive of it.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Senator Henry that the matter she raised should be raised on the Adjournment. Senator McAughtry's concerns about an early election are ones which have a great deal of substance. There is stable, good Government with a working majority in the Lower House and a working minority in this House.</P>

      <P>Senator Farrell raised the question of heritage centres and I will try to facilitate this.</P>
      <P>I conveyed Senator Roche's views to the Tánaiste and there will be an opportunity next week to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes raised the question of changing the days on which elections are held.  He will have two opportunities to make his case for change during discussion of the European Elections Bill, and the Electoral Bill, which will be taken in the next couple of months.</P>
      <P>I will speak to Senator Dardis regarding a debate on agriculture.  However, there is an extremely heavy load of legislation for discussion over the coming months which will have to receive priority.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke raised the high cost of insurance for young drivers.  I would like to make time available for this issue.  There is an interesting report from the Law Reform Commission out today regarding the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly raised an issue which I think is important and I will speak to the Senator regarding time for it.</P>

      <Col N="1470" /> Senator Cassidy raised the tragic death of an heroic and generous young man, Brother Larry Timmins, in strange circumstances in Kenya.  I do not know what powers are open to a foreign country for finding the truth, but the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs are extremely concerned and will do everything in their power to ensure that the truth is found.  We pay tribute to the work of Brother Larry Timmins and send sympathy to his family and to his order in their great loss.  There are thousands of Irish missionaries doing noble and unsung work in undeveloped countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful and honoured to have the opportunity to address you.  I have often addressed the Seanad as a Minister of State and I understand that you are breaking new ground in issuing an invitation to me to address you.</P>
      <P>As Chairman of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, I and my colleagues, two of whom, Senator Gallagher and Senator O'Kennedy, are Members of this House, are engaged in a complete review of the Constitution. We set out with the great advantage of having available to us the report of the Constitution Review Group, which was chaired by a most distinguished former Member of this House, Dr. T. K. Whitaker.</P>
      <P>Our committee was established seven months ago in July 1996.  The committee elected me as chairman and Senator O'Kennedy as vice-chairman. Senator O'Kennedy has devoted a great deal of time to the task of constitutional review. He was a member of the 1967 committee on the Constitution, chairman of the 1972 inter-party committee on the implications of Irish unity, which considered constitutional matters in relation to Northern Ireland, and he was also a member of the 1973 all-party committee on Irish relations which succeeded it after the dissolution of the Dáil in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> One of the first things our committee did was to seek, through public notices, the views of the people on the report of the Constitution review group.  We received almost 150 submissions from private and public bodies and from individuals. Some organisations expressed a wish to make a supplementary oral presentation, and in view of the importance of involving the public in the process from an early stage, the committee acceded to these requests.  These oral presentations began in November and will be completed, I hope, next week.</P>
    <P>As a result of the reviews carried out since 1966, culminating in the Constitution review group's massive report last year and the flow of responses from the public, the committee has available to it a huge volume of advice, admittedly some of it conflicting, on a wide range of issues.  It is likely, therefore, that a large number of amendments, substantive and technical, will be needed to contour the Constitution to the current needs of the people and those of the coming generation. Many of the changes will relate to the fundamental rights aspects of the Constitution and others will relate to the institutions of State, including Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Constitution review group's report includes some discussion on Seanad Éireann, but the review group felt that the time available to it did not allow it to carry out a sufficient analysis. It recommended that &ldquo;a separate, comprehensive, independent examination of all issues relating to Seanad Éireann should be conducted&rdquo;.  We decided to get this process under way quickly.  We commissioned two eminent political scientists, Mr. John Coakley of University College Dublin and Professor Michael Laver of Trinity College Dublin, to produce a study, &ldquo;Options for the Future of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;.  This was submitted to the committee on 5 December 1996.  It is a sophisticated analysis based on the Inter-Parliamentary Union's extensive database and is probably the first systematic use of that invaluable source of information in any country.  We also sought the views of the current Members of the Seanad and those of a number of distinguished former Senators.</P>
    <P>We have received responses from individual Senators while Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Wright submitted some preliminary views from the Fianna Fáil group of Senators.  In a very supportive move, the Leader of the House, Senator Manning, arranged for this debate on the role of and the electoral system for Seanad Éireann.  Our committee greatly appreciates this.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that the Seanad in its current form has come in for criticisms from different quarters sometimes accompanied by demands for its abolition.  Particular criticism has been directed at the Seanad's arcane nomination and electoral procedures and its almost total domination by the Dáil and the Government.</P>
    <P>In 1967 the first all-party committee on the Constitution was able to say that, in having a <Col N="1472" /> second Chamber, Ireland resembled &ldquo;most modern democracies&rdquo;.  The current position is that only one-third of national parliaments &mdash; 58 out of 178 &mdash; have second chambers.  The trend is towards having unicameral legislatures.  In federal states the Upper House can be provided with a representative basis and substantive functions different from those of the Lower House. However, in unitary states an Upper House, having a democratic mandate as strong as that of the Lower House, could institute the likelihood of deadlock in the legislative process because both Houses would have an equal right to veto legislation. If one sought to obviate such deadlock by dividing the legislative areas in two and giving control over an area to each of the Houses one would immediately be presented with the question, why have two Houses?  The representative basis of the Upper House in a unitary state is, therefore, structured on less democratic lines than the Lower House and is given functions and powers inferior to those of the Lower House. Thus, it may be able to function as a temporary check on the will of the Lower House.  It cannot frustrate it.  For that reason the Upper Houses in unitary states have a reduced status in the public mind.</P>
    <P>Our committee, in a preliminary discussion of whether the Seanad should continue to exist, tends towards the view that the Seanad, with its calm deliberative atmosphere, provides an exceptional service in revising Bills, thus enhancing the quality of the legislation coming from the Oireachtas.  The former distinguished Senator and Minister, Professor James Dooge, in his essay &ldquo;The Role of the Seanad&rdquo; brings this out eloquently and forcefully.  Moreover, another distinguished former Senator and Minister, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, in a submission to our committee stated:</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the utility of Senate debates in relation to complex questions.  Such debates in the Dáil are, almost always, narrowly adversarial and only too often pettily confrontational.  I found, however, that in the Senate there was a higher proportion of serious discussion of issues and on the whole a less polemical approach.  In particular I remember weighty contributions by the late Senator Alexis Fitzgerald in which he drew attention in a non-polemical way to possible pitfalls in proposed legislation which seemed to have escaped the attention of the Lower House.</P>
    <P>However, this revising function, being largely technical, is not readily appreciated by the public and provides little safeguard against public criticism of Seanad Éireann.  The committee feels that the status of the Seanad can and should be enhanced by expanding the functions it carries out.</P>
    <P>Two functions which it has been suggested could be given to Seanad Éireann would be the holding of tribunals of inquiry and the approval of senior public appointments.  My own view is <Col N="1473" /> that if the Seanad were to carry out those functions it could find itself involved in direct and sharp confrontation with the Executive.  In any event, systems for carrying out those functions already exist and attention should concentrate on how to improve them.  It seems better to seek out important functions that the political system is failing to carry out and give those to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the bridge between Ireland and Europe established by the Treaties of the European Union is carrying a huge volume of EU legislation and that this traffic, with increasing European integration, will become ever heavier. The Dáil, even with its extended committee system, is not capable of carrying out the necessary analysis of draft directives and the overview of regulations implemented by statutory instruments. This whole legislative process is effectively left to be determined by the Executive and officials and so there is a huge democratic deficit. The Seanad should be given the task of monitoring this immensely important legislative traffic, by carrying out an analysis of its intent and an investigation of its effects.  MEPs could have a right to attend its debates and European Commissioners might be invited to participate.  The Seanad has already set a precedent in that regard with the recent participation of the European Commissioner, Mr. Kinnock, in a debate on transport. Such a process would help to provide a strong focus on the operations of the European Union in Ireland.  This is an important service that needs to be provided even now.  In the future, its relevance to the quality of our democracy could be critical.</P>
    <P>There is an architectural principle that &ldquo;form follows function&rdquo;.  If one were to add to the Seanad's functions a function such as the one I have suggested, certain ideas of who should carry out the function begin to form.  Since European legislation covers a wide range of activities in the economic and social spheres it would seem sensible to have available in the Seanad representatives of the major national interest groups. Since many of the issues covered by the legislation would be scientific and technical, one could envisage the rationality of securing representation from the third level institutions and the professions.</P>
    <P>The way the membership of the Seanad is selected at present makes it remote from the people.  Eleven Members are nominated by the Taoiseach, six are elected by university graduates and 43 are elected by a small group of national and local public representatives numbering about 1,000.  One could undoubtedly adapt the present membership structure to meet the demands that enlarged functions for the Seanad would require. Thus, the Taoiseach's 11 nominees in theory, provide an opportunity to bring people with specialised experience and skills into the House who might have had no previous experience of partisan politics and to give representation to groups that may not otherwise have it.  However, Taoisigh <Col N="1474" /> normally use their power of appointment to ensure the dominance of the Government party or parties in the House.  Should the facility for such nomination provide for representatives from certain specified groups, such as, in addition to representatives from Northern Ireland, emigrants and the disabled?</P>
    <P>The university constituencies give representation in the Seanad to only two of all the third level institutions that now exist and, moreover, enfranchise large numbers of people who are no longer domiciled in Ireland.  The Seventh Amendment of the Constitution in 1979 provided for the expansion of the university franchise to other institutions of higher education.  Is it not time to introduce legislation to give this amendment effect and provide a far wider pool from which to draw candidates?</P>
    <P>Vocational representation was an innovative feature of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  However, owing to the nomination procedure and the political nature of the electorate, it reproduces a House with the political complexion of the Dáil. Should procedures be changed so as to give the vocational groups the direct representation which would enhance the capacity of the House to carry out the suggested enlarged provisions?</P>
    <P>However, it would be possible to take a radical approach to the composition of Seanad Éireann, ranging from a House whose membership was totally nominated to one in which the people were the electorate.  Two ways of involving the people in the election process have been mooted. First, conduct popular elections on a regional basis&mdash;for instance, on the basis of the provinces or the European Parliament constituencies. Second, conduct popular elections for candidates representing economic, social or cultural interest groupings.</P>
    <P>A directly elected Seanad would certainly have more popular legitimacy and authority than the Seanad as constituted at present.  Depending on the precise system of representation selected it would also give the opportunity to offer a legitimate voice in the political system to social groups and regional interests which are not currently represented in any explicit way by the system of narrow geographic constituencies used for the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The issues surrounding the representative basis of the Seanad are highly political issues upon which Senators, with their particular experience, could give our committee exceptionally valuable advice.</P>
    <P>Our committee will receive, with great attention, the views of the House.  The aim of the analysis must surely be to ensure that the Seanad will be, and be seen to be, relevant, effective and representative.  In that way one will provide an eloquent answer to those who ask the question &ldquo;What does the Seanad do?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Chairman of the all-party Oireachtas committee to the House. His presence is an indication, if such were <Col N="1475" /> needed, of the flexibility of the procedures of Seanad Éireann.  The Chairman follows in a line of distinguished non-Members of Seanad Éireann who have addressed the House.  I am certain that this demonstrates to him, and the members of his committee, that Senators are ready to look at our role and function, and to make recommendations to make this House more effective, accessible and sensitive to the broad range of the Irish experience. I assure the Chairman that most Members of this House will play a vigorous role in trying to achieve meaningful reform.</P>
      <P>One could be forgiven for saying that if this were a matter of considerable importance for the Oireachtas, the public and Members of this House, there would be a more visible attendance today.  The same can be said of the press.  It is clear that the media do not regard this subject as one of the most crucial issues facing the Irish electoral system.  If they did we might have a more significant presence.  However, they may be listening and reporting from elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The lifeblood of any political chamber is that it can do its work and be seen and reported doing so.  By the same token, it must be criticised when it fails to fulfil its role.  For that reason, I would suggest to the media that there is a strong case for a more constant, investigative, critical and supportive role in relation to the procedures of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I would also suggest to fellow Senators that the same applies to them.  Each of us sent here with an endorsement from the electorate, restricted as that electorate may be, have a duty to discharge the obligation imposed on us by making recommendations and contributions.  Some very distinguished Members have done so in the past and that tradition continues to the present day.</P>
      <P>Membership of either House is not a right, a privilege or a perk to be enjoyed without discharging the duties and obligations involved.  It is vitally important that every Member of Seanad Éireann plays an active role in the proceedings of this House but that is not always the case.  We must look at why this is so and how we can improve the composition and electoral system of the Seanad to ensure that we play a more meaningful and consistently positive role.</P>
      <P>The Seanad does not exist in isolation; it is a House of the Oireachtas.  I am not suggesting that the Chairman or the committee see it that way, but we all recognise the need to use the opportunity to make both Houses more meaningful. We need to look at the electoral systems of both Houses to see if they can be made more significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that most Members of this House are prepared to acknowledge that the electoral system of the Seanad needs to be looked at. However, I would be ignoring reality if I did not also stress, with even greater emphasis, that the electoral system to the Lower House is even more fundamentally in need of radical reform.  This is required to prevent us ending up with a system <Col N="1476" /> which is so totally undemocratic that a small party, which enjoys 1 or 2 per cent support, is able to influence and control Government because of a distorted representation.  This would not happen in any other country.  I am referring to Democratic Left.</P>

      <P>How can that be representative? It is a nonsense.  I was a member of the 1967 constitutional committee which recommended the single seat transferable vote aligned to a list system.  My party was in Government at the time but, unfortunately, chose to misrepresent the committee's views and opted for a single seat system on the straight vote.  That did no service to democracy or the committee.  It was clear that our preference was for the single seat transferable vote.  The result is a waste of electoral time and an abuse of the peoples' rights in terms of candidates from the same parties competing with each other in the same constituencies.</P>
      <P>That frustration means that many Members of the Lower House are signalling they want no part of this nonsense.  That could and should have been avoided.  Our committee will come to that in turn.  I want to emphasise that matter.  As I have said for the past three to five years, and our spokesperson on the environment has said this since, it is time that the electoral system to Dáil Éireann was changed.  If that is not done soon, we will lose respect.</P>
      <P>The electoral system to Seanad Éireann needs to be looked at, but for a different reason.  I am in the unusual position of having been a Member of both Houses for over 30 years, so perhaps my experience of observing the change since then will enable me to make some suggestions which might be of consequence.  There have been enormous changes in society since Seanad Éireann was established under the 1937 Constitution. Some of those changes reflect the switch from the rural to the urban situation.  There have been changes, particularly in the educational sector. When I was last in this House there was no access to third level education.  Donagh O'Malley was about to introduce changes.  The enthusiasm and dynamism which comes from universal access to third level education was missing.  It was also missing in 1937.</P>
      <P>I say with the greatest respect &mdash; my university colleagues will recognise this &mdash; that the representation from universities, which was properly written into the 1937 Constitution, needs to be looked at.  The third level education system is a feature of the vigour and dynamism of this country but some of our young graduates are excluded.  The regional technical colleagues and the institutes of education did not exist in those days.  I was privileged to be a junior Minister in the Government which introduced most of those radical changes which need to be reflected in this. It is common cause that we need that dynamic in the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> Having said that, I acknowledge that in the first Seanad in which I sat from 1965-69 and in this Seanad, the role of the university Senators has been particularly informed and significant.  They do not need my endorsement to make that clear. I should also say that I believe they would acknowledge that it is not as representative as it should be of the range of qualifications, particularly if we look at the technical and technological and others areas which are excluded.  I hope that, with consensus, Seanad Éireann can look at that because we need that dynamic and that of young graduates to be represented here.</P>
    <P>The Chairman obviously wants to stimulate debate in this House and I thank him for the manner of his presentation.  He put up signposts and has left the rest to us.  Another issue which he signposted &mdash; and how right he was &mdash; is the role of the Seanad in relation to European legislation. We were not members of the European Union at that time, although the expectation was there.  That great farseeing thinker, Seán Lemass, who eventually became a member of the committee, had in mind in 1965 that Ireland would vindicate itself in a new partnership in Europe, and how right he was.  He rightly tried to steer us in that direction through education and qualifying our young people in the areas to which I referred. He also wanted the Oireachtas to have a vigorous role when we became members of the European Union.  Clearly, that role has not developed to the extent we would want.</P>
    <P>There is expertise available in this House and I agree with the suggestion from the Chairman, which will be reflected here, as regards the review of European directives, legislation and the macro economic policies in Europe about which there are sharply differing views in this House; Senator Ross has a strong view and I have some reservations on where this will leave us in terms of our own economic independence and what protections and restrictions should be introduced.  What better place than the Seanad to look at that in a structured and informed way and to recruit, as we have from time to time, people to come to the House to suggest and advise?</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs is not on top of that job because there is a plethora of committees at present.  I serve on four committees and enjoy each one, but other matters demand my attention.  I have a type of observer status on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and its members do not have the time, resources or capacity to discharge that fundamental job.  As has been suggested, the Upper House could fulfil a major role in that regard.  How best that can be done is a matter on which the committee could recommend.  Both Houses can then endorse that recommendation.</P>
    <P>There are not the same confrontational political positions in this House as in the other.  The set pieces are not as immediate and obvious as they are in Dáil Éireann, for perhaps obvious and understandable reasons.  I find, therefore, that the nature of debate in the Seanad is, by and large, <Col N="1478" /> more objective, less confrontational and nearly always tends to find consensus whereas in the Lower House &mdash; this is not a criticism of that House &mdash; the search is not for consensus but for difference.  I suppose that is a feature of directly elected lower chambers.</P>
    <P>It is important that there is a role for a Seanad or an Upper House.  There are many examples &mdash; the considerable legislation initiated here &mdash; which are not for me to illustrate, as I am sure other Members will do so.  I am satisfied from my experience in both Houses over a considerable number of years that there is an important and meaningful role for the Seanad which only an Upper House can effectively discharge.  I would like it to have the opportunity to look at specialised areas such as European legislation, relations with other countries and foreign affairs, with which we have dealt.  I would like this to become part of a structured role for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, our composition lacks reflection of the level of specialist technical knowledge young people now have.  I give way to no one in my inability and incapacity in all matters related to the new computerised information age.  I plead, like Socrates, that the beginning of knowledge is to recognise the extent of one's ignorance.  My ignorance of this area is abysmal.  That said, the Oireachtas badly needs that level of input and, if it can be introduced through Seanad Éireann, it would be a great contribution.  How qualified are we to comment on the area of information technology and new services, such as financial institutions where money can now be transferred by pressing buttons?  This has changed the nature of international society.  While some colleagues are better equipped, we need a more direct and expert input and that is why I would like to see the Education Panel changed.</P>
    <P>Eleven Members represent agricultural interests and another 11 represent labour interests, that is 22 Members which is more than one third of the Seanad membership.  At the time it was conceived, that seemed reasonable but we must acknowledge that the nature of Irish society has changed utterly since then and that change has not been reflected in the composition of the electoral panels.  The population of rural Ireland, rural Europe and rural America is declining. There is a grossly distorted representation in the Seanad in terms of 11 Members representing agriculture which is not as significant now as when the electoral panels were composed.  Similarly, the nature of trade unionism has changed and there is a case for examining the composition of the Labour Panel.  I mention these as examples of why the composition of all electoral panels should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The electoral body is both Houses of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities.  I hope what I say will not be construed as offensive but it is evident that, with such a confined panel of electors, a relationship develops between Senators and their electors.  We want to see our local authority members with real democratic <Col N="1479" /> functions.  This is something which has exercised the minds of the committee, and the Chairman in particular.  We want to encourage effective representation at local democracy level.  It may well be, however, that, because local authority members do not have that and that one of the few perks they have is to elect members to the Seanad, this has given rise to a distortion of the relationship between electors and elected.  The best guarantee of being elected to this House if one is on a panel is to keep in contact with individual local authority members and supply them with tickets to All-Ireland, soccer or rugby matches, etc.  I know that was not contemplated by anyone who suggested a review chamber of Seanad Éireann.  I also know that, if those who conceived the Upper House of Seanad Éireann thought it would be reduced to this, they would have immediately dropped it as being not only contrary but offensive to what they had in mind. That shows that the strange relationship between Senators and county councillors should be examined with a very critical eye.</P>
    <P>I am in a certain difficulty here, but perhaps I feel an obligation to say this as this is my second time in the Seanad.  Maybe I am released from that difficulty in that I have already signalled as a candidate for the Dáil that I will not be standing for the Seanad again, whatever the outcome.  It is a privilege to be here and one I greatly appreciate but it also imposes an obligation and I cannot ignore the fact that some who make the most significant and consistent contributions are probably most vulnerable in terms of their likelihood of being re-elected and some who make no contributions are probably most secure in their likelihood of being re-elected.  That is not how democracy should be exercised or discharged in either the Upper or Lower House.  One of the reasons those in the Dáil who make the most vigorous contributions as legislators are often punished by their electors is that they have concentrated on doing what they should rather than what they should not do.  That is something we should and, I hope, can examine.</P>
    <P>There is a case for changing that one to one relationship between Senators and councillors. One way it can be done is universal suffrage mentioned by the Chairman but it is for Members of the House to make suggestions as well.  The other extreme is the old way before 1965 where two members were nominated by each county council to cast votes on behalf of all councillors.  One never knew who they would be.  The relationship between Senators and county councillors has changed utterly since the 1965 Seanad which I knew and the &ldquo;service&rdquo;&mdash;which I do not regard as a service &mdash; which some Senators give county councillors has also changed.  This is not something which can be ignored.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that, in a bicameral system in what is not a federal state, the Government cannot risk the second Chamber frustrating the decisions of the first.  By and large, the relationship <Col N="1480" /> between the Seanad and the Dáil has been positive and healthy.  Much of what has been initiated here has been adopted in the Lower House and much of what has been adopted there has been changed here.  There has been an opportunity in a less politically confrontational way to review legislation through the Dáil.  It is important to accept that this House's changing the will of the Government or of the Lower House cannot be risked.</P>
    <P>I accept the reasons for reducing or limiting the power of the Seanad.  The Taoiseach of the day was given power to nominate 11 Members to guarantee a Government majority in this House. It is understandable that the Taoiseach should know they will vote with the Government. However, there should be a definition of the qualifications needed by Members nominated in that way; it is not enough to ensure a Government majority.  Some of the Taoiseach's nominees over the years saw this House as a place for a gentle retirement.  I am not sure that was the intention or that it best served the national interest.  There have been some distinguished contributors from the Taoiseach's 11 nominees. However, it is important that it is not seen as a perk for services rendered but rather as an opportunity for service.</P>
    <P>As regards casual vacancies &mdash; I say this with due deference to the young Senator who has joined us and who will undoubtedly make a vigorous contribution &mdash; the electoral system to the Seanad is already confined, so why should the electoral system for filling casual vacancies be even more confined?  It is not an election as we know it because the result is predetermined.  At least a by-election to the Dáil means the involvement of a universal suffrage.  Here, as soon as someone in the Government of the day decides who will be their candidate, the result is predetermined. We should examine if that is a reasonable and proper exercise of democracy.  Although many distinguished Members have come here through that system, it was not what those who looked at Seanad Éireann initially had in mind as its role and function.</P>
    <P>As the chairman's presence today and the presence of Commissioner Kinnock and the former distinguished Senator, Professor James Dooge, with whom I was privileged to serve here, indicates, this House has the capacity to be flexible in terms of being accessible to people who would not otherwise have access to the Lower House or to a Department.  There should be a special place for the dynamic element in Irish society &mdash; those organisations which do so much to enhance people's lives and to protect those who need protection and which devote their time to vindicating those people &mdash; either through the elected procedure or by allowing the leaders of those organisations to make a contribution to this House.  We could listen to their points of view and acknowledge the dynamic and vital role they play in our society.  We would then be able to have a direct input into any changes made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> I thank the chairman and the Leader of the House who introduced this flexibility which is an important part of what the Seanad can do.  I hope the debate will throw up suggestions which will be of vital importance to the committee and to the service of democracy.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that we are discussing the role of the Seanad today when major decisions, in which this House had no act or part to play, are being made outside it.  We are playing the part of political eunuchs while the men with the testosterone are in Liberty Hall deciding the fate of the nation's finances.  That is why we are sitting here navel gazing in this extraordinarily useful academic debate while the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is deciding whether the things that really matter in this country, the so-called social partnership, should be accepted.  If the ICTU decides against the social partnership, the budget and the Government's financial strategy will go up in smoke.  As it happens, the ICTU will miraculously decide in favour of this agreement.  Yesterday it was ratified, whatever that means, by IBEC, the business leaders who are the compliant friends of every Government in power.</P>
      <P>It is a terrible reflection on our role in society and on the Government that the control of the finances have been surrendered to well paid union bosses and so-called heads of industry.  The so-called social partnership agreement, which is of such fundamental importance to this nation, has not been passed in this or the other House. That agreement is sent to people who are not elected, who are self-appointed and who have far more power than this House or the Dáil because they have been handed it by successive Governments. Not only should we be debating the role of the Seanad but also the role of the Dáil.  Does the Dáil have any real role or power when major decisions are being made across the Liffey?  The answer is no.  Both Houses are rubber stamps for Government policy which is decided elsewhere. The need for Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's committee is at least a recognition that there is something wrong.  I am delighted no one has yet suggested that we invite representatives of the social partners because we do not need them and they have other, unelected platforms in which to express their views and other places in which to exercise their political testosterone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this House must ask ourselves whether we are serious wanting to influence events, or are we happy to continue the cosy arrangement which exists for most Senators?  Deputy O'Keeffe has presented us with a challenge and unless we recognise our total impotence we will not get anywhere. It is also true that most of us have a vested <Col N="1482" /> interest in the system continuing as it is.  We are all elected under the present system so we are more comfortable with it and instinctively we would like it to remain.  We must initiate change and take a few personal risks.</P>
    <P>The composition of the House, specifically the university representation, was raised by Senator O'Kennedy.  The problem with this House is that, other than at present, it invariably reflects the numbers in the Dáil.  Before it is introduced every Bill or motion is guaranteed a safe passage.  The Government is currently in a minority in the Seanad, but that is unlikely to happen again.  It only arose because of special circumstances in which a Government came into power without a general election.  Normally, the Government will have an in-built majority and the Seanad will be a rubber stamp.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves whether we want the Seanad to pass all legislation or to amend and criticise it.  This is a difficult question because it would be indefensible for an unelected Chamber to defeat and amend legislation and continually to thwart the wishes of a Government &mdash; that is not its role.  However, such a Chamber could have the expertise referred to by Senator O'Kennedy and could put serious thought and input into legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly how this would be done but I have some suggestions.  Why does the Seanad not receive all Bills before the Dáil does? In that way, rather than being a revision Chamber, it would preview legislation and make suggestions and amendments which would be acceptable to the Minister in a non-confrontational, non-controversial manner.  The legislation then need not come back here, so that when it goes to the Dáil it has the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Government and the Minister.  Currently, nearly all legislation goes to the Dáil first and the Government's attitude is to put it through the Seanad as quickly as possible and to ensure there are no delays; that is slightly difficult in present circumstances but the Government has been highly successful in that regard.  No Government welcomes so-called &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; made in this House because it regards them as obstructive.  All Governments regard the Seanad as a thorough nuisance which must be tolerated because at present it is nothing more than a home for political patronage.</P>
    <P>One reason why there will be no change and why it will be extremely difficult for Deputy O'Keeffe to have any of his suggestions implemented is that it is not in the interests of any political party in this House to change the system.  If there are no nominees, the Taoiseach of the day will have lost the power to give 11 jobs to people whom he wants to get into the Dáil, who have served him well, or have lost Dáil seats and will be back.  It also means his general power of patronage will have been removed and no Taoiseach is happy to give that up.  If the Seanad was made non-political, many of the 43 Members elected through the panels would almost certainly <Col N="1483" /> lose their seats, because they are voted in by a highly political electorate.  If the university seats were changed, abolished or reformed in the way Senator O'Kennedy suggested&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or if there were more of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or if the numbers were increased, some of us on the university panels would lose our seats.  A different electorate would elect different people.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to see how this House will agree to any reform because there is a conspiracy between all the political parties.  We disagree on many issues but we agree that the system should remain the same because it looks after everyone who is here.  That is what happens and it will continue. It would require a superhuman effort by a person of great vision &mdash; or perhaps extraordinary political folly &mdash; to take on his own party Members in this House and abolish their seats. No Taoiseach will do that because nearly all of them depend on Members of this House for support in the parliamentary party.  This is an academic debate because no such man or woman exists in our political parties so it will not happen, although it is a lovely idea.  The proof of this is in Deputy O'Keeffe's reference to the 1966 all-party Commission on the Constitution.  That report was issued over 30 years ago but nothing has happened about its recommendations because no politician will commit political suicide in the name of reform.  Even if a Taoiseach going out of office wanted to do this, he would not get it through his parliamentary party because the Members would then be voting for political suicide.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we can tinker around at the edges.  It may be that university representation, as identified by Senator O'Kennedy, could be changed. I believe that will happen sooner or later because there are only six university Senators, they tend to be independent, so the other political parties could get together to teach them a lesson.  They might change the universities panels but there is no way they will tamper with their own vested interests.  The legislation will be passed by 54 votes to six and the other Senators will be happy to have dealt with the elitist university representatives. That will not happen in present circumstances because the university representatives hold the balance of power, but it will probably happen sooner or later.  There will also be a move to make those seats available to the political parties, which will be presented as Seanad reform. Neither Senator O'Kennedy's seats nor those on this side will be reformed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not suggesting that reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will not be here, he will be in the Dáil.  The seats of the university <Col N="1484" /> Senators will be changed and that will be described as reform of the Seanad.  That will be presented in a Government manifesto as the abolition of an elitist system.  It may not come in the way the Senator suggested, but it probably will.  It could involve an enlargement of the constituencies to make the Government of the day more popular with the loudest and largest regional technical colleges and universities demanding the franchise at the time.  That is how it will come about; there is nothing more certain. The Seanad will then be reformed and we will forget about it for another 25 years.  When Deputy O'Keeffe and I are long dead and buried, a future Member of this House will say how the O'Keeffe report said in 1997 that the Seanad should be reformed.  Deputy O'Keeffe will get immortality for this, but no achievement.  Never mind&mdash;it is a good effort.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with what Senator O'Kennedy said about university seats.  He is proposing to widen the franchise so that the particular expertise not included in the franchise at the moment would somehow be expressed by the election of new people.  In other words, there are technical colleges with certain skills and expertise which could elect Members with those skills.  That is a poor reflection on the universities which elect Members to this House at the moment.  It is my understanding that all those skills are reflected in nearly all those universities.  I have no hang-up about how many seats Dublin University should have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided there are two, I have no hang-up about the number of seats.  However, the constant bellyaching about university seats is a diversion and a red herring to take the heat off other Members of this House.  It is good to reflect on the contribution made by previous university Senators.  Their electorate is much larger than that of any other Member.  Those who point so accusingly at us should recognise that our electorate is over 30,000.  Senator O'Toole's electorate is over 100,000.  Senator O'Kennedy's electorate is about 900 and he has to get about 25 votes to be elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is elitist now?  Senator O'Kennedy is elected by a few county councillors.  I was delighted to hear him say that the way to get votes is to give them GAA tickets.  If I distributed GAA tickets to my constituents most of them would not know what they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> If reform is to take place it must occur everywhere. It must be radical and must start at the bottom.  We must say: &ldquo;To hell with political parties in this House and the system as it was; let us give it a new role&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned the role of the Seanad in regard to Europe.  I am not sure about that.  He also mentioned the interesting idea of ratifying appointments, but then rejected it.  I marginally disagree with him on both counts.</P>
    <P>Ratifying appointments is quite a good idea. Deputy O'Keeffe rejected it on the grounds that it would bring the Seanad into confrontation with the Executive.  I would like to see the Seanad in confrontation with the Executive and probing the Government on issues such as appointments.  I would like to see it in constant confrontation with the Executive, being critical but constructive.</P>
    <P>I would hate to see the Seanad providing what he called a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; for Europe.  I can see his idea &mdash; he wants the Seanad to enlighten the Irish people about Europe and to provide a window for an issue which has not really been debated in this country.  However, I do not see the Seanad as a facilitator for Government policy of all sorts. Perhaps the Seanad could have a role as a forum for critics of Europe and those who do not like economic and monetary union, which has not been debated.  However, it should not be an instrument or a facilitator of present Government policy.  That is done by the wretched social partners and the Dáil.  I do not see it as our role in any sense to facilitate the Government.  I see our role as quite the opposite: to be critical.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in Irish politics at the moment is that everybody agrees about absolutely everything.  Sorry, that is an exaggeration, to which I am prone &mdash; there is very little difference between most political parties on the major issues.  The so-called social partnership appears to be approved of by all political parties.  That is extraordinary when so many trade Unionists are against it.  If the Seanad became part of that consensus, even in a non-political way, we would lose something very vital.  One of the great assets of this House over the years has been the fierce criticism made of the Government by those on the Independent and Government benches.  A great amount was sometimes achieved as a result of that.</P>
    <P>If we became a facilitator of Government policy we could pack up and the Progressive Democrats idea of abolishing the Seanad would be correct. We must provide something different, at which laudable efforts were made in the past. Reference was made to the nomination by various Taoisigh of people from Northern Ireland. These have probably now served their purpose, if they ever did serve a purpose.  However, those who made such nominations had honourable intentions, particularly Dr. FitzGerald and Mr. Haughey, who sometimes nominated people from Northern Ireland who did not take the Whip in situations where the numbers were a little difficult for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> However, the problem was that it was seen as tokenism and they never managed to persuade an elected member of the Unionist Party to take a seat here, which would have been very interesting.  It is no reflection on those appointed from the Protestant community in Northern Ireland that they could never claim to represent mainstream Unionism.  I doubt if such a representative will ever come to this House because of the political problems which that would present for them at home.  That experiment worked in the case of Nationalists but the Nationalist opinion is already voiced here.  It was voiced here today in regard to the events in Derry 25 years ago.  We have no real need for that opinion to be voiced in this House at the moment.</P>
    <P>There were other enlightened nominations, such as that of Éamon De Buitléar and Ken Whitaker, but they were on the whole the exception rather than the rule.  A Seanad comprised of people of that calibre and with that input, rather than representatives of political parties, would be the ideal.  However, that would be very difficult to achieve, as has been pointed out, because nobody could propose that and expect to survive politically.</P>
    <P>I was delighted that the proposal to give three seats in this House to emigrants was dropped. That was a major insult to Members of this House.  The Government, when cobbling together the Programme for Government with its socialist friends, decided to make a concession to the emigrant groups and promised them three seats in the Seanad.  That was foolish.  It was also insulting to the Seanad because it was a way of saying &ldquo;we will give them three Taoiseach's nominees and to hell with the Senate, we will keep them quiet with that.&rdquo;  It was rejected decisively in this House and was then dropped by the Government and emigrant groups.  I have no problem giving votes to emigrants in certain circumstances, usually on a reciprocal basis, but I have with the idea that three seats in this House should be given to people from Australia, America and the UK.  This was to keep a pressure group happy and was the last suggestion we received about the reform of this House.  These people did not even have to have set foot in this country in their lifetime.  It was an extraordinary suggestion which has been dropped.</P>
    <P>However, we have to listen carefully to Deputy O'Keeffe and the committee so that they do not pick up on every Tom, Dick and Harry type of suggestion on giving out seats.  We have had that today with talk of politically correct groups having seats in this House.</P>
    <P>The Seanad needs to be reformed and made into a non-political House.  The way to make the Seanad constructive is to forbid anybody in this House from having a party whip and have open discussion.  Members of political parties and local councils should be banned from coming into this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Col N="1487" />
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That only leaves Senator Norris who would talk to himself all day and amuse the people of Ireland quite happily and interrupt himself as well without any difficulty.  We would then have a non-political House discussing legislation before it got to the Dáil.  It would be presented in a non-political manner by people who would not have to look over their shoulders every five minutes to see what the electorate thought.  As Senator O'Kennedy mentioned, very few people who contribute conscientiously to this House get any advantage from it when it comes to getting elected.  The people most likely to be re-elected to the Dáil and Seanad are those who do the least work because they are in their offices churning out letters to their constituents and are not in the Chambers.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole was interviewed by a newspaper at the weekend.  He said he was delighted that the trade unions and IBEC were now having a real input to the budget.  However, we do not. Senator O'Toole, to whose absence I am not allowed refer, and will not refer, is not here because he is in Liberty Hall pushing Government policy through the trade union movement. He is not here navel gazing with the rest of us because he knows where the action is; it does not lie in the Seanad or the Dáil, it lies with farmers, trade unions, IBEC and non-political, non-elected people.  They are deciding the budget strategy of this country but we cannot even defeat Finance Bills.  They are deciding worker conditions, what the budget deficit will be and everything else, while we, as political eunuchs, examine our role today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Norris for allowing me to speak ahead of him.  I promise I will be brief in spite of the complexities of this issue.  I am delighted Deputy O'Keeffe is here.  It is a mould-breaking experience in more ways than one.  Perhaps, it is a pointer to the future for the functions and activities of this House.</P>
      <P>Inevitably, this issue is about continuance or abolition.  Naturally, turkeys do not vote for Christmas and I am not in favour of abolition. However, in reading the detailed report submitted to the all party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution, it is interesting to note there is one element of the report which impacts on the public perception of the Seanad's existence that it is an unnecessary financial burden on the State.  If we do nothing else but dismiss that myth, we would be doing a good day's work.  The report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget of the Seanad is relatively small as is its permanent staff.  During 1995, for instance, it amounted to 9.5 per cent of the total budget of the Houses of the Oireachtas or in real money terms, £2.8 million.  Much of the work that Senators do at present would simply be transferred to other shoulders producing a reallocation but not a saving of resources.  What is more, much of the work that Senators currently do on a largely voluntary basis would be sacrificed.  Among the more obvious of the <Col N="1488" /> pressures that would develop were the Seanad to be abolished would be the servicing of joint Oireachtas committees whose role has been increasing in recent years but which, as we have already pointed out, would have much greater difficulty in functioning were they unable to draw on the membership of a second chamber. In addition, an important forum of the formal representation of the interests of particular groups would be lost.</P>
    <P>That encapsulates what is Seanad is about.  It is how I define my role as a Member of this House. I have been honoured and privileged to have been representing not only the Library Association of Ireland who nominated me but the wider constituency in which I have become involved.  In recent years I have also been honoured to have been chosen to serve on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I also sit on two subcommittees of that committee, one dealing with United Nations affairs and the other with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If the committee system did not operate, if the Seanad did not exist and if I were not a Member, then the chances or opportunities open to me would be so limited it is likely that the nearest I would get to any of those committees would be as a member of the public sitting in a gallery.  If the Seanad is abolished, 166 Deputies remain. There is growing pressure from the public on whether this number of TDs is necessary for a country our size.  Urgent and drastic changes are needed to the system of multi-seat constituencies to give Deputies better opportunities to represent those who elect them.</P>
    <P>A much wider debate on our electoral system than the one focused on the Seanad is taking place.  Given the somewhat cynical attitude adopted by some people, it is possible that in a referendum the public would vote for the abolition of both Houses of Parliament.  Such is the perception that what we do is not of great interest.  However, I question the wisdom of appealing to emotional, knee-jerk responses which call for the abolition of institutions of State on the basis that the Government can run the country with the aid of civil servants, or the &ldquo;permanent Government&rdquo;, as John Healy, God rest his memory, referred to them.</P>
    <P>If public opinion&mdash;how does one define public opinion?  &mdash;does not admire these institutions, I doubt if abolition is the easy option.  Those who tout that kind of nonsense do not understand what democracy is about and how it works. Democracy is a flawed concept.  It is not perfect, but I would prefer to live in this democracy, flawed as it is, than in some other countries which give the impression that they may be economically stronger or better or that their systems are better.</P>
    <P>Since the welcome introduction of joint committees over the last few years, the burden on Deputies to function effectively within them is now open to question, primarily because of the horrendous workload, including constituency <Col N="1489" /> work, that is placed on them.  Deputies are members of two or three of the 22 committees which operate at present.  They spend two to three days a week in Dublin, primarily to process legislation emanating from Government or in some cases initiated by themselves.  Given the expansion of the committee system, much of the minutiae of legislation is now discussed in committee. The amount of physical effort required to prepare, attend and contribute effectively to improving legislative proposals from the Executive takes up a huge proportion of time.  In view of this, how can Deputies spread themselves effectively?  The system is creaking under the weight of so much demand on their time.</P>
    <P>By contrast, Senators do not, theoretically at least, have the same constituency or legislative demands.  The business of both Houses is ordered by the Government.  At times there is a flood of legislation, while there is less at others.  Our Standing Orders give us the capacity to fill our time effectively by debating reports and topical issues of the day in a much more detailed manner than allowed for by the procedures of Dáil Éireann.  For example, Senator Norris has a special interest in East Timor and has raised the issue on many occasions, bringing it to the forefront of public debate.</P>
    <P>Similarly, many other issues which would never be raised in the public consciousness have been raised and debated in this House.  Effective measures have been taken and Government has been made to listen.  National policy has been formed following initiatives taken on various subjects. Many of them have never been debated in Dáil Éireann, although the Order Paper of the Dáil will often note reports, such as those made on semi-State bodies or various European institutions. Rarely is there the same expansive debate, the attention to detail or the expertise of the kind in this House available to the Dáil because it is concerned with other business.  In this respect alone, the Seanad fulfils a very important role.</P>
    <P>The flow of EU directives is extraordinary. They appear almost daily, which does not give us the time to debate them in detail.  This is not good in a functioning democracy.  Like an increasing number of people in this country, I am pro European and am interested in European affairs.  A system is required to debate EU matters in more detail.  EU directives are effectively legislative measures when they appear before both Houses. When they are subsequently enshrined in law the opportunity for debate arises, but the directives themselves need to be considered.  Approximately six months ago it was reported in the British newspapers that EU directives decided upon by the EU Council of Ministers were in some instances not translated into English until several weeks after decisions had been taken, thus precluding the opportunity by the British Parliament's select committee on European Affairs to debate them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> All institutions must change and evolve if they are to survive.  We have a role to play in the context of European legislation.  The committee should consider the many ways in which it can be enhanced.  For example, commissioners or junior Ministers could attend the House to discuss matters and to ensure that we know what will happen once directives are decided on.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to the decision by the Government not to proceed with the proposal to introduce emigrant Senators to the House.  The proposal was badly conceived.  Senator Ross described it as an insult to Members.  It was equally an insult to those who have been lobbying for several years for emigrant voting rights.  It was never on their agenda and they saw it as the short end of the stick.</P>
    <P>I am passionately committed to the concept of granting emigrant votes.  As a former emigrant, I believe that there should be a mechanism to allow those who had to leave this country involuntarily for economic reasons to continue to have an involvement in the body politic and access to political activities, if they so wish.  Not all emigrants wish to do so.  There is a perception, even in the Houses of the Oireachtas, that if the franchise was granted to emigrants, multi-seat constituencies would be awash with votes from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, America and elsewhere. We are familiar with the comments of a number of Deputies, including the Tánaiste, who said he would hate to have to wait for the last box from Boston for the fourth seat in north Kerry.  It is a fair point; but the registration process in Europe, where practically every country grants the franchise to its emigrants, indicates that not everybody wishes or registers to vote.  Ultimately, not everybody who is registered casts their vote.</P>
    <P>Although there are peculiarities in the proportional representation system, instead of cursing the dark when the light goes, we should do something about our political system rather than saying no to emigrant votes.  If our system is so fragile and open to manipulation that a handful of votes from Boston will decide the fifth seat in a constituency, it should be changed.  We should not say &ldquo;Do not give votes&rdquo;; we should change the system and ensure it does not have that effect on domestic politics.</P>
    <P>There are various ways in which emigrants could access the political system.  As in parliaments in other countries, three or four seats could be created in Dáil Éireann which are exclusively emigrant seats.  Seanad Éireann was not the way forward.  The suggestion was a Dáil solution to a Dáil problem.  It threw the matter over to the Seanad because it thought Senators would not mind.  However, we did mind and it is no longer in the mainstream of political thinking.  The issue will not go away.  It will exist as long as there are emigrants and people wish to retain an active interest in the affairs of this country.</P>
    <P>In the context of representation, I said earlier that I represent the Library Association of Ireland.  There are two tracks on which one is <Col N="1491" /> elected to the House.  One is through political parties and the other is through representative bodies.  The system as it currently operates in terms of representative bodies is good.  There is a political element, but this is ultimately a political House.  We deal with <i>Realpolitik</i> although admittedly in a truncated form.  I am not sure we should open the electoral process to representatives of trade and professional organisations.  They would have a narrow view because they would consider that they had a mandate to speak exclusively about their issues.  Senators have a much broader view.</P>
    <P>For example, I am a politician and a representative of a professional organisation with which I have great empathy and an understanding of its problems and priorities.  I can make an effective contribution to representing its particular interest but I, and other Senators, have much wider interests which are adequately dealt with in the committee system.  This has been a lifeline for Senators since its establishment, and the records of attendance and contributions show that in the main Senators always attend and make real contributions, primarily because the burden on our time and our priorities are different from Deputies.  This is good.  The system needs fine tuning, but the proposed radical overhaul will not result in a better House.  It is accepted by all sides that abolition is not on the agenda and that it will involve reform within the system.</P>
    <P>Regarding the regional versus national character of the electoral process, I am opposed to regionalising the election procedure.  Senators are national politicians in a national Parliament representing national and some international issues. If the procedure was regionalised it would diminish and erode to some extent the ability of the House to function properly.  However, ultimately and despite our comments, if there is a continuing public perception that the House does not matter and that view is conveyed by the media, people will continue to think it is irrelevant.  The media has a heavy burden of responsibility to give the House more recognition and respect than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Every Senator has a story about how they worked hard on legislation, researched and thoroughly prepared for a debate, but received the ultimate insult of not even being mentioned in the national media.  It is as if the debate never happened.  If one is a spokesperson there is a greater responsibility to prepare and research the issue thoroughly to ensure the legislation is as perfect as one can make it when it leaves the House; it is particularly galling to find the media will not even acknowledge that it is ongoing. Consequently, the public does not know it is happening.</P>
    <P>Senators who deal with county councils are aware that, although one may have spent the previous four or five years making a worthy contribution and the Official Report may show volumes of contributions, when we are on the hustings, <Col N="1492" /> what one says in the House usually has little relevance to whether an elector will ultimately vote for one.  The Acting Chairman knows that is the case because he is a long standing Member of the House.  It is sad and wrong, but the county councillors or the electors are not to blame.  If they do not know what is happening in the House, how can they evaluate and assess Members' worth? They use other means and priorities.  There is a heavy responsibility on the media and I cannot understand why it continues to ignore the Seanad. The honourable exception is <i>The Irish Times</i>, which has a permanent record of what happens in the House.  It does the best job it can within the limited space available.  However, that leads to the frustrations I mentioned for those who do not even get a line in the newspaper.  It is not that Senators want to say that they were mentioned in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  It is so the readership will know what Senators said and what we do in the Seanad. The last question asked is what Members do in the Seanad.  If the media reported what happens here that question would be consigned to the dustbin of history.</P>

      <P>I am privileged to be one of the two Senators who are members of the all-party constitutional review group and I appreciate being part of it.  I welcome the group's distinguished chairman, Deputy O'Keeffe, and the officials who are present.  It is saddens me that there are no media representatives in the Press Gallery for this debate, which is critical in terms of democracy, the history of the State and the general complaints about politicians.  As other Senators said, it is a true reflection of how seriously they take the Seanad that when the House is navel gazing and examining its role, not one media representative has bothered to remain for the debate.  It reflects a continuing lack of understanding of the role of the Seanad and Senators.  Not a day goes by without my being asked what I do as a Senator.  People fail to realise what is involved or what the difference is between a Senator and a Deputy because in my constituency I tend to do the work of a Deputy, which would not necessarily be the case with all Senators.  People fail to see any distinguishing factors between the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are examining the role of the Seanad, the issue is much broader and rightly deserves attention.  The fundamental democracy of our State is now in question.  We have a system of politics which means, because of the proportional representation system, we are constantly looking over our shoulders at the constituency.  Politicians seeking election here or in the other House must spend time in their constituency; therefore, their role as legislators inevitably becomes secondary. That is not healthy for democracy.  One should not be judged by the number of funerals one has attended or babies one has kissed for eligibility for the Legislature.  Until that question is satisfactorily resolved, the problems we face in the <Col N="1493" /> Seanad will be similar to and dependent on those faced in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>To add to that, there is total ignorance as to what politicians do, which is reflected in the general public who fail to register or vote.  They think all politicians are the same, that it makes no difference who is elected and they wonder what we do anyway.  That needs to be addressed with education and in the media.  It is unhelpful that currently in politics it is extremely difficult for people to remain in the system.  If we want good people involved in running the country we must create a system that enables them to do so. Therefore, politicians must be paid adequately for their work and their routine must be survivable because so many of them are dropping out. One cannot make oneself available in Dublin and one's constituency 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to a public who generally do not understand what one is doing.  Until those fundamental issues are resolved, this debate is academic.</P>
    <P>We are looking today at the role of the Seanad in terms of the constitutional provision and what needs to be done.  Because the Seanad has a number of defects in its function, makeup and selection it is true that we do not have the clout we should.  Perhaps we should not have that clout but because we can be so easily ignored, it is very difficult to see the future of the Seanad and whether it should have more powers on legislation, proportional representation or the system of election.</P>
    <P>This debate is the result of the Seanad now being a house for has-beens and wannabes; those who are past their sell-by date in politics and those aspiring politicians whose real ambition is to be in the Lower House.  While that continues to be the case, there will be inherent defects in the nature of business in this Chamber.  Despite the original intention for the Seanad to be a vocational representative body, in reality we all represent political parties.  By whatever cloak and dagger means we get elected do not seem to matter so long as we are elected.  This has been used very successfully by political parties to pay off dedicated former Deputies and promote aspiring Deputies.  That has been the perception of the Seanad because while we are forever looking our shoulder at the Dáil and blatantly accepting we are politicians with the Whip system, it denigrates the role of the Seanad as a second Chamber.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe in the role of a second Chamber.  It is very important for legislation given the hurly-burly of the Lower House and the pressure Deputies are under, that there is extra time given to it through whatever forum there may be, particularly in the form of a second Chamber.  Senator Ross suggested that all legislation should be primarily reviewed by the Seanad before it goes to the Lower House.  That may be undemocratic because those who are elected directly should have a prior say to what becomes the business of both Houses.  I agree that the option of introducing more legislation in the <Col N="1494" /> Seanad should be and has been used, but it could be used to greater extent.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to many representative bodies running the country.  For some reason he failed to refer to the media who have a great say in who is running the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not something to labour but while we are debating our role in the Seanad the media should accept their responsibility in reflecting what we do here on a day-to-day basis.</P>
      <P>Without being technical, we have a very unusual method of selection for the Seanad.  We are the only true vocational representatives in a second Chamber, we have six university Senators and the Taoiseach nominates 11 Senators.  Why 11 I do not know.  Generally, I favour the role of the Taoiseach's being transferred to the head of State.  That probably would make little difference as the head of State would operate on what is recommended by the Government of the day but it would be a sensible move.</P>
      <P>In relation to the university Senators, I may not make myself very popular with them but when the Seanad was set up, third level education was not freely available, an elite set of people went to university and a smaller number of people had the suffrage as a result.  Giving three votes to Trinity College, of which I am a graduate, was to give Seanad representation to the Protestant minority in the Republic.  While the debate has ranged as to whether other universities should have the same right to seek seats in the Seanad, why should people with degrees have a vote in the Seanad when other citizens have not?  Why do we need six university Senators who are often no more independent than the rest of us?  It should be admitted that everybody has some political baggage; some do not represent their universities at all in the House.  In my view it is an insult that, in 1997, those representing universities are given precedence in terms of who and what they represent and the argument is not valid any longer.  I favour scrapping the university seats and highlighting the role of vocational groups and in that way provide for the educational and great academic contribution which has been made by previous university Senators to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex issue.  If one looks at the composition of the Seanad and the system of election, there are four main areas to be considered.  The principal area of concern is the basis on which Senators are elected or selected, the second is the cycle of renewal, third is the size of the Seanad and the fourth is the powers of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The size of the Seanad, with its 60 Senators, is adequate in terms of the size of the population and the Dáil.  The system of selection is critical to this debate.  It is a complex area because there are eight potential processes of selection for Senators.  Selection can be made directly or indirectly by election, indirectly by councillors or regional bodies, by vocational groups, by the Lower House, through co-option by colleagues, through heredity as in the House of Lords, by appointment and by <i>ex officio</i> membership.  The range of combinations of those processes could be endless.</P>
      <P>We need to change the current system.  I canvassed throughout the country during the last election and not once was I asked about policy or issues I would like to address in the Seanad.  That is a sad reflection on the system.  I do not blame councillors for that because they know little about what happens in the Seanad.  It is important for councillors to have a better link with central Government but I do not know how that can be achieved.  We must also look at improving local democracy when we talk about improving Seanad representation.  I am also concerned that one can be elected to the Seanad, as was mentioned earlier, by virtue of the number of GAA tickets one can dispense.  That is not a good reflection on the House and in the long run damages us because individual Senators are capable and have diverse qualifications and expertise.  A better system of selection or election would serve us better.</P>
      <P>I do not favour selection by regional bodies because this country does not have a proper regional structure.  It might be considered if there were strong regional structures.  Devising elections on the basis of the European Parliament constituencies might be an option as it is important that Seanad representation recognises the fact that certain areas of the country might not be as well represented in the Dáil as they should be.  This might apply to places such as the west of Ireland which warrant positive discrimination in terms of membership of this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should examine the current selection process by panels representing vocational groups. The system has not worked as intended.  It is agreed that the concept of the Seanad representing the vocational interests of people who otherwise would not be represented in the Dáil is popular.  In addition, it is important, in terms of <Col N="1496" /> reviewing legislation, that expertise be brought to the consideration of various categories of legislation, complex as they are.  In that sense the Seanad could fulfil that role very usefully.  It has also been argued that as the bulk of the legislation which affects the citizens of this country comes directly or indirectly from Brussels it warrants greater examination.  All too often statutory instruments are introduced virtually unnoticed even though they affect us daily.  The role of the Seanad in reviewing European legislation is worth considering.</P>
    <P>Our MEPs are at a disadvantage because they have no forum to which they can report on the work they do in Europe.  The Seanad could have a role in this regard by allowing MEPs to sit and participate in the workings of the Seanad without according them voting rights.  This would be particularly appropriate if it complemented a future role for the Seanad in reviewing European legislation.  If we adopt that role we must allocate places in the Chamber to MEPs to participate in debates.</P>
    <P>The public regularly questions how decisions are reached.  Cabinet confidentiality might have an influence on that attitude.  Another factor is the PR voting system which puts TDs under so much pressure they are inclined to rush legislation through the House regardless of whether it is valid.  It is therefore necessary that any perceived or real democratic deficit should be addressed in the Seanad.  How that can be done in terms of electing its Members is a difficult problem to which I cannot offer a definitive response.  However, there is a need to look again at how decisions are made at Cabinet and in the Dáil and at giving such decisions further deliberation in this Chamber.  That would be an important consideration with regard to the future role of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The concept of corporate representation in terms of vocational panels is, I believe, only practised in one other state, the free state of Bavaria. That state has ten functional areas and a six year term, with one-third retiring every three years. The idea of a fixed term for Senators is good; it would impose a distance between the Dáil and the Seanad which might appeal to some, although not to others.  The fixed term combined with rotating membership through retirement is a good idea that is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, in the course of the debate on this issue in 1922, was the first party to raise the concept of vocational representation in the Seanad.  Mr. de Valera accepted it in 1937 because of its popularity in Catholic teaching at the time.  It is still a popular concept but the problem is how to implement it.  At present certain groups have nominating rights and many of them are out of date, if not obsolete.  Other groups which should have nominating rights on the same basis do not have such rights.  Even if we do nothing more than tinker with the system, that issue must be addressed.  If the Seanad should represent those who would not otherwise have a <Col N="1497" /> voice, in terms of the expertise they might bring to legislation, or minorities within our society, we must look at broadening the number of panels involved and reducing the number of Members representing each panel.</P>
    <P>I favour the right of the Taoiseach to nominate Senators being transferred to the Head of State. However, there are other options in terms of varying the numbers involved.  It is essential to achieve a balance between the political and vocational aspects of the House.  How can that be done?  We have blatantly ignored the vocational aspect of the House by electing politicians.  There is a benefit to be gained from having both.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, this was proposed by the 1959 Seanad Electoral Law Commission which sought to create a balance between political election and vocationalism.  I believe their suggestion was for 30 politically elected and 30 vocationally elected or nominated Senators.  It is worth considering whether the right of the Taoiseach or the head of State to nominate the balance of power in the Seanad should be confined to political people. There should be more scope to give representation to those involved in vocational capacities.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to suggest that people can be truly independent and non-political in that role.  The nature and history of this State means that everyone is political to an extent.  I would not support Senator Ross's idea of non-party members, that in itself is anti-democratic.  The fact that members of the Defence Forces cannot be members of political parties is a nonsense.  Everyone has a political persuasion and there is no point hiding that fact.  These people deserve the right to vote and represent themselves politically; that is their constitutional right.</P>
    <P>We need to look again at the powers of the House.  A chamber with no clout will be ignored. There must still be a balance between the traditional separation of powers between the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.  It has been suggested that the Seanad might be given a veto over judicial appointments.  This is worth looking at as it would give this House some say in that area.</P>
    <P>I cannot give a definitive response as to whether we should have similar powers to the US Senate which operates as a forum of inquiry or the Italian Senate which can make or break governments.  It is dangerous to go overboard in terms of executive powers.  If one creates an ongoing conflict between the two Houses and the Executive it would make governance of the country quite difficult.  However, there may be issues which warrant additional address in this Chamber in terms of executive powers.</P>
    <P>We should have more legislative powers.  The fact that we can only veto legislation for 90 days makes this House somewhat irrelevant.  At present, because of the balance of power in the House, there is a little more scope in terms of what can be achieved but the Government will always have the majority.  We cannot deal with money or constitutional Bills, and most of the <Col N="1498" /> Bills we deal with are initiated in the Lower House.  This leaves us with very little clout.  This House has a great deal to contribute and if it were redefined in terms of the expertise which could be represented here it should be given greater legislative powers.  Only by achieving this will we arrive at a proper balance between the two Houses.  This would be an advantage to democracy.</P>
    <P>This House has a role to play in terms of secondary legislation.  This is an area which could be better addressed in the Seanad.  The notion of our initiating more legislation is also very worthy.  It is difficult to know what would be achieved by our being able to veto legislation for a longer period. There are areas of legislation that we should be able to veto <i>per se.</i>  This would have to be considered in terms of the make up of the House. However, if the Seanad possessed a greater expertise in certain areas, there is no reason we should not have such a veto on legislation coming from the Lower House.  These are the issues which we need to address in this and future debates.  There is no getting away from the fact that if we as Senators bury our heads in the sand we will find one day that the decisions were made for us.</P>
    <P>We are not being as effective as we could be. It is important that we have an effective second Chamber.  There must be balance between this House, the Lower House and the Executive but the need for a second Chamber is beyond question. The issue is how we can construct our operations to make ourselves more effective.  Unless we confront this we will become irrelevant to an even greater number of people than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>I do not blame Senators for this state of affairs. The media fail to cover the work of this House. We have a superior range of debates than the Lower House and this warrants greater recognition, but, in the long run, a chamber with no clout cannot expect any other kind of treatment.  As long as we operate this system we are doing ourselves an injustice.</P>
    <P>I would be happy to listen to the various ideas coming forward but it is important that elected, nominated and university Senators use this unique opportunity to put forward their views. This is critical because change must take place in this House and the more say we have in that change the better.  In the long run we will serve ourselves and this country better if we reform this House as opposed to allowing the <i>status quo</i> continue and risk its abolition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is by no means the first time that we have addressed the issue of Seanad reform.  However, it is the first time we have done so in the light of the deliberations of the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution.  It is to be welcomed that the Chairman of that committee is in the Chamber today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to the Chairman in response to his request and included some of my ideas in outline. <Col N="1499" /> I also included a slightly sharp note that the committee might consider the operations and functions of the Dáil.  If they were considering the abolition of the Seanad they might do better to abolish the Dáil and leave Senators in charge of the country.</P>
    <P>I was irritated by the machinations of the Chairman's colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, and his committee who openly and impertinently called for the abolition of the Seanad and started by getting a number of digs in at the university seats.  I listened with care to the clear and thoughtful contribution of Senator Gallagher.  In her closing remarks she mentioned the value of the different Senators.  She spoke of the elected, nominated and university Senators.  A casual reader might assume from this that university Senators are not elected.  I know the Senator did not mean this.  The university Senators are the most democratic element in the House.  No one accepts the old hogwash about delegated universal suffrage where county councils and members of both Houses are elected by the people and the people surrender their right to elect the Members of the Seanad, the 47 people elected on the panels being elected by delegated universal suffrage, the people having voluntarily submitted and surrendered their right to elected public officials.</P>
    <P>The reason for this system is clear.  It is so that the party structure may retain its stranglehold on all these seats.  That is a corrupt system.  I would add the caveat that I do not attach any stigma of corruption to the people who are elected through that system.  It is a source of constant amazement to me that colleagues of such calibre are elected through a system which I regard as defective.</P>
    <P>There is one way around this, which is to look at the merits of the university system instead of at the proposed defects.  There is one striking merit in the way university Senators are elected, that is, that the ordinary members of the nominating body are enfranchised.  In other words, graduates of the university &mdash; I think it is ten &mdash; can nominate somebody to stand for election. However, it does not end there and is not surrendered to county councillors and Members of the Oireachtas to elect them.  The 30,000 graduates of the University of Dublin, who are on the register, act as a voting college.  The same applies to the National University of Ireland where over 100,000 graduates vote.  Although there appears to be a degree of disparity there, only 30 per cent or less vote in the NUI constituency while 65 per cent vote in the Trinity election.  Trinity graduates value and use this privilege and prerogative.  That means independent minded people must persuade an articulate and informed electorate that they are worthy of being voted to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>I contrast this with the panel system.  Among the nominating bodies is the Royal Irish Academy.  The President of the RIA stood for election to Seanad Éireann &mdash; I presume on the cultural panel &mdash; and did not receive a single vote. <Col N="1500" /> The head of one of the most prestigious academic intellectual cultural bodies did not receive a vote. I know Senator Ross said one only needs about 25 votes to get in, but not to get one vote is a pretty minimal performance.  I always laugh at the wonderful charades of elections which usually take place in the dining room in Leinster House where people receive 97,560 votes.  One must multiply the votes by about 0.25 million to fool people into thinking that it is a real contest or election.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the vocational aspect of Seanad Éireann, the most important and significant contribution we can make to ensure it works is to look again at the nomination bodies and make sure we have targeted the most significant representative groups, such as trade unions and perhaps even the Churches, which should have a voice in Irish public life.  When we have decided these are the most appropriate ones, we should enfranchise the ordinary members.  If, for example, we have a medical lobby, we should enfranchise all the members of the Irish Medical Organisation, the nurses and so on who will vote for their representative to this House.  We would then find genuinely committed people with a range of expertise which could be brought to bear on legislation and could fulfil the function of this Chamber as a reviewing one, which would be good.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Gallagher that my colleague and distinguished friend, Senator Ross, was wrong when he said we should not allow Members of the House to be members of political parties.  Of course they should be members of political parties and even subject to the Whip; but they should get into this House by a fair, reputable and proper electoral system.  Then they should arrange themselves in any way they like.  I would go so far as to say that some seats should be reserved to be fought exclusively on a party basis because one of the things I have come to appreciate about this House is that although I regard the system as essentially corrupt and vitiated, it provides a mechanism for senior politicians who are unlucky at the elections to have their wisdom and experience continued in the interest of the State.  This is a bit of a <i>volte-face</i> for me, because I was the one who coined the phrases about the Seanad being a rest home for decrepit politicians.  However, there is a sense in which that experience is sometimes too valuable to be lost to the service of the State between elections. I am not totally against any party interest in this House but I am against the Seanad being so obviously the tool of party interests.</P>
    <P>I hope the Chairman will consider and pass on to the relevant authorities the deep sense of grievance that is felt in this House at its exclusion from the provisions of the Bill intended to finance political parties at election time.  Not only should the Seanad be included in the Bill, but it must not be restricted to parties.  People who are party members at the time of Seanad elections get considerable assistance in terms of workers, finance <Col N="1501" /> and additional envelopes.  That includes people who are members of political parties in the university interest, of whom there is at least one, whose blushes I will spare.  That gives an unfair advantage.</P>
    <P>I do not see why Independent Members should not receive a degree of support, given that elections are extremely costly.  I fought six elections, which cost about £10,000 each, before I got into this House.  I had to pay for stamps and envelopes because I did not have Oireachtas postage.  I sent 37,000 letters and signed each one by hand, which gave me writer's cramp and is slightly dull.  It worked, but it was expensive.  It took me about 15 years of being employed and working reasonably hard in this House to pay off the accumulated backlog, which was about £60,000.</P>
    <P>There should be a level playing field and we should all get support.  That support should be extended to candidates who get over a certain threshold of votes.  They should be reimbursed by so much for every vote.  It is not fair to continue to advantage sitting candidates at the expense of potential new Members of this House.  I urge the Chairman to bring to the committee and Government the strong feeling that it is wrong to exclude the Seanad and Independent Members from the operation of this Bill.  It is probably unconstitutional to do so.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline a number of other reasons the Seanad should be continued, although it should be carefully reformed.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I visited the Czech Republic a couple of months ago.  The Czech's were in the process of establishing an Upper House.  They now have a Senate; I believe the elections are over.  We spoke to a number of Cabinet Ministers about it.  I was told by a Minister that they had reviewed the operation of Upper Houses in various countries, including Ireland, and were so impressed by their operation, in particular the Seanad, that it helped to persuade them to initiate a Senate this year.  It is not an idea which is passé and from the 1930s.  We are recognised by our European colleagues as playing such a vital part in the democratic process that they are prepared to embark on the creation of second chamber using us as a model.</P>
    <P>We are also able to do certain things which have not been done by the Dáil.  I am an extremely egotistical person.  Most academics and all theatre people and politicians are egotistical and as I fall into those three categories I am particularly so.  I am sure the House will excuse me from reciting my participation in this matter but it is close to my mind.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago I tabled an amendment to the Child Care Bill, which was supported by Brendan Ryan and which necessitated the introduction of a new section that introduced the guardian <i>ad litem</i> principle into Irish law for the first time.  It has been introduced into British law in the wake of a particularly horrifying case where a young girl of about six years was <Col N="1502" /> returned to her defective and dysfunctional family by the local authorities where she was promptly butchered and murdered.  We argued hammer and tongs for six weeks with the Minister, who I think was Deputy Noel Treacy.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher mentioned earlier that we are not to be trusted with the State purse strings and cannot introduce a measure which entails a charge on the Exchequer &mdash; an unnecessary disadvantage under which to place the Seanad &mdash; and it was because of this that the amendment was ruled out of order.  However, I knew this would save children's lives.  We had been extensively briefed by various agencies in this State and were convinced we were right.  We therefore repeatedly reintroduced it and argued on it although we knew it would be ruled out of order. We wore down the Minister.  He was a decent man who came to accept what we said and went through the difficult process of returning to Cabinet, recommitting the measure and sending it back to the Dáil.  That change has or will in future save children's lives.  That was a good day's work which this House accomplished with the assistance of the relevant Minister and which the Dáil failed to do.</P>
    <P>It was perhaps a little technical and dull.  There were none of the amusing exchanges on the Order of Business which we all enjoy so much. Not one single word appeared in any print media. It was not shown on RTÉ television or broadcast on radio.  That is a disservice to the Houses of the Oireachtas because when something as important and significant in terms of its impact on ordinary people's lives takes place as a result of the legislative process in this House, the electorate should be aware of it.  It is by this they will learn to value the Seanad and not by the nonsense which often appears in newspapers, for a proportion of which I am responsible.</P>
    <P>This House is inadequately covered in all media.  Some are better than others.  Sometimes, this House only receives one minute's coverage in &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  This is ridiculous, fatuous and insulting.  I do not want to involve myself in media bashing and do, in the words of the old cliché, have many good friends in the Fourth Estate, but inane reports about Senators speaking to an empty House annoy me.  Taxpayers would be in worse trouble if the place was full with stuffed eejits digesting their lunch and dozing away.  If this place is empty, it is because my colleagues are in their offices working hard with one eye on the monitor, reading legislation, answering correspondence or taking part in committees.  No member of the press is unaware of that; yet they trot out the same old tripe, week after week and year after year.  They are unprincipled in this.  We now unfortunately have tabloid newspapers in this country.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago being included in a delegation attending the International Parliamentary Union in Canberra.  There was a big stink about it.  &ldquo;Senators on junket&rdquo;, the headlines read.  No one would talk to the press.  They <Col N="1503" /> rang me and I said I would talk to them.  They told me I was attending this conference which was costing so much.  I said I did not know that but they might perhaps be correct.  They asked me if I would enjoy myself.  I said that I most certainly would and, as a representative of Irish taxpayers, it was not up to me to be wizened, mean, begrudging and miserable.  They would like me to enjoy myself and I would go on a second class flight to China and Fiji as well.  I did and it was cheaper than the authorised and organised club class flight.  I took part in the conference every single day and raised the question of East Timor. I blistered Gareth Evans, the Australian Foreign Minister, inside his own Parliament buildings and made the headlines in Australian, New York and some European papers.  The only place it was met with a resounding silence was in my little home town of Dublin, although I had all the material faxed to the newspapers.  I rang my secretary from Australia asking if there was anything in the newspapers.  When she said no, I told her to ring them and to send another fax.  She rang newspaper offices wanting to know why this was not covered as it was an important political statement on East Timor.  The answer she received was revealing.  Senators on a junket was a story. Senators working was not a story.  That raises a serious question about the ethics of that kind of journalism.</P>
    <P>Books and programmes are often produced about elections.  However, they only cover the election to the Dáil.  Sometimes, the election to the Seanad is completely left out.  It should be recognised that unless and until there is a change, this Oireachtas comprises of two Chambers and each, in its different way, is worthy of respect.</P>
    <P>The reform of the laws on homosexuality was handled with special sensitivity in this House. Even before the reform of the principal sections of the Criminal Law Acts, 1861 and 1885, this House pioneered the introduction into Irish legislation of sexual orientation clauses guaranteeing certain civil rights for a minority of people in this country.  That is something of which this House can be proud.  I also remember that I got the first debate ever on acquired immune deficiency syndrome held in this House.  I was told I could not use some of the rooms in Kildare House for these briefing sessions for some fussy little reason.  I then hired a room in Buswells Hotel.  I got a Roman Catholic priest who worked with drug people in the city centre, Fiona Mulcahy from St. James's Hospital, who is a remarkable specialist in this area and a few others, to attend.  I chaired the meeting, held my tongue and did not advocate anything.  I felt that, by having colleagues from both Houses listen to others with a range of expertise, it would raise issues in their minds and make them come to terms with matters rather more so than if I engaged in a polemic.  We had one of the best informed debates ever on that difficult subject which the Dáil was afraid to tackle at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> Remarkable work has been done by my colleague, Senator Neville, on the subject of suicide. Although he is a supporter of the Government, it is remarkable and regrettable how infrequently Government is prepared to accept in any way other than a dog in the manger fashion legislative initiative from its backbenches and Cabinet. Senator Neville has suffered from this on a number of innovative legislative proposals he has produced. So have I.  The last legislation initiated by the Independent benches in this House, which passed through all Stages of debate and into law was a Bill now nearly 40 years old dealing with the humane conditions for pigs and abattoirs and was introduced by the late Senator Professor W.B. Stanford.  That is lamentable.  People should be encouraged to do this.  It should not just be Government.  This House should have a clear role in initiating legislation.</P>
    <P>One other matter which is partly an achievement of this Seanad is the establishment of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I take some small credit for that for the following reason.  I took that as my principal debate, my Private Members' Time, on three successive occasions.  I possibly had that privilege about once a year then.  I remember reading the contributions to previous debates, including those which took place before I was elected, and noting that every single person who spoke had at one time or other been in favour of a foreign affairs committee.  I wondered why they had changed their minds and what the altered circumstances were which caused them to change their minds.  The answer was an election.  When people were in Government, they opposed a foreign affairs committee but were strongly in favour of it in Opposition.  I imply the malign influence of the mandarins of Iveagh House and am perhaps not too far short of the mark.  They did not trust us to have any input in the formation of foreign policy or to be accountable to it.</P>
    <P>In the third debate I said that since everyone was or had been in favour of a foreign affairs committee and the Government, for technical reasons, was not capable of providing it, I would like to announce we were having our own committee anyway.  I was cute enough not to push myself into the Chair; I gave that position to the present Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael Higgins.  I became secretary and I wrote to all the foreign affairs committees in Europe.  It was interesting that they replied because it gave us a <i>de facto</i> recognition which was one of the things that put the skids under the Government.  Whatever about having a foreign affairs committee which it could control, the idea of having a wildcat foreign affairs committee with Deputy Michael Higgins and myself in the driving seat produced nightmares not only in Iveagh House but also in Government Buildings. That was one element which hastened the development of the foreign affairs committee.  It was not perhaps crucial, but it was an influence and this House achieved it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> We used wonderful ways around things.  We were forbidden, for example, to send notices out about meetings so I put it on the Order Paper that &ldquo;Seanad Éireann takes note of the fact that there will be a meeting of the foreign affairs committee in Room G9 on Tuesday, 26 February&rdquo;. Then I would ask the Cathaoirleach on the Order of Business if he was prepared to take item 30. We had to be a little athletic when trying to find ways around these issues.</P>
    <P>As regards reform of the Seanad, certain information should be made available to us &mdash; for example, the Standing Orders of the Seanad under which rulings are made.  I have never seen this book, although I presume it exists.  I would like to know if something can be raised immediately as a matter of urgent national interest because when we try to do so, we almost invariably get the Cathaoirleach's ruling that it is not contemplated under Standing Orders.  That is often complete tripe.  I remember raising an ESB strike here and I was told it was not a matter of national importance.  Simultaneously, however, the Taoiseach was telling the Dáil it was a national emergency, yet it could not be contemplated here.  Why could it not be contemplated? Why are we not entitled to know even if it is embarrassing for the Government?  Let it be embarrassing because democracy is about embarrassing people from time to time.</P>
    <P>Our exclusion from financial matters is also a mistake for the various reasons I have suggested. For example, we are excluded from considering certain financial issues, amendments can be ruled out of order and we are excluded from participating in the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, which is made up exclusively of Dáil Members.  I am not even allowed to attend because it discusses finance.  Why is that the case?  I have threatened to turn up like a bad penny and I intend to do so at some stage.  It also discusses a wide range of other issues which are marginally related to finance but we are excluded, by virtue of our membership of the Seanad, from the operation of that important committee.  That is wrong and it should be changed.</P>
    <P>We have played an important role in a number of areas for which we do not get credit or appropriate pay.  I am nakedly unashamed to say that I gloated when I saw a newspaper headline the other day which read: &ldquo;Politicians Vote Themselves a Bonanza&rdquo;.  I thought, thank God they have shown backbone at last and we will get an increase.  However, that was not the case.  The article was about allowances for being away from home, which was taking the situation back to what had existed previously.  However, the newspapers had a field day.</P>
    <P>We should also have improved secretarial assistance.  I am not talking about the standard of intelligence or work because I cannot speak highly enough of it.  However, each Senator should have a secretary, a room and the facilities that will make him or her a more productive contributor <Col N="1506" /> to this House.  We should also have proper research assistants.  We are lucky at present because the Institute of Public Administration provides a number of us with American research assistants as part of their course here and they have done extremely valuable work for me in researching papers and so on.  However, we should not have to rely on this slightly exploitative system; there should be proper research assistants.</P>
    <P>We should also be given some type of introductory course on the work of legislating.  The secretaries, of whom I have spoken highly, are efficient and up to date with the latest technology. Why?  Because the Oireachtas gives them time off to go on computer courses where they familiarise themselves with the tools of their trade.  New and old Senators are not given any introduction on how to read legislation which is written in a specialised language.  What appears to be the ordinary meaning of phrases may not be so and often one section refers to another.  It would be extremely valuable to have assistance in that regard.  We should also have assistance in terms of draftspersonship so that if somebody wanted to initiate legislation in a certain area, they could go with the bones of the idea to an official of this House and have it turned into legislation.</P>
    <P>The franchise should be extended.  I have said on many occasions that the logical way to do this is to recognise the separate identity of the two constituencies.  Trinity College is a Dublin city centre college so Dublin City University should be included in our constituency in the same way as the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The University of Limerick should be included in the NUI's constituency because it is a national constituency embracing the entire island.  The dates of the election to both the Seanad and the Dáil should coincide, which would rule out direct political intervention.  I agree with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's comments about representatives from different interest groups.  What better non-party, committed person with a vision could we have than Ms Adi Roche from the Chernobyl Children's Project, for example?  What better person could we have to speak about East Timor than Mr. Tom Hyland from the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign?  We should also make provision for Question Time so that we can raise matters of immediate relevance.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the committee's conclusions and to whatever is initiated as a result of its elaborations. We have given Deputy Jim O'Keeffe sufficient material to mull over.  We hope that with this type of happy collaboration between Members of this House and his committee we will arrive at a formula for making this already valuable House more efficient and productive in the interests of the people.</P>

      <P>The justification for a second Chamber and its status and role in the body politic has always been a fascinating subject on which there has been lively debate.  The need or otherwise for a second House in a Legislature has been a vexed problem for political scientists and constitutional experts.  There are instances of great statesmen and writers expressing divergent views and displaying sharp differences of opinion on the value of a second Chamber.  Some have contended that a second Chamber is undemocratic and subversive to the will of the people expressed and articulated through the popularly elected Lower House while others have stressed the absolute need for such a House as a safeguard against the &ldquo;tyranny of a single Chamber Legislature&rdquo;. The great French constitutional framer, Abbé Sieyes, totally rejected the concept of a second Chamber with his well known and often quoted observation that &ldquo;if a Second Chamber dissents from the first, it is mischievous; if it agrees, it's superfluous&rdquo;.  On the other hand, Sir Henry Maine pleaded that almost any kind of second Chamber is better than none.  Benjamin Franklin strongly opposed the presence of a second Chamber, likening it to a two headed snake in the following illustration:</P>
      <P>She was going to a brook to drink and on her way was to pass through a hedge, a twig of which opposed her direct course; one head chose to go on the right side of the twig, the other on the left, so that time was spent on the contest.  And, before the decision was completed, the poor snake died with thirst.</P>
      <P>However, George Washington thought the function of a second Chamber was to act as a check on the legislative machine.  Thomas Jefferson once protested to Washington against the establishment of a two-house legislature.  Washington asked: &ldquo;Why do you pour your coffee into your saucer?&rdquo;&ldquo;To cool it&rdquo;, replied Jefferson.  &ldquo;Even so&rdquo;, said Washington, &ldquo;we pour legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Many authorities could be cited either in favour of or against the need for or utility of a second Chamber.  The subject of merits and demerits of an Upper House or the controversy between retentionists and abolitionists is age-old and recurs from time to time.  The reasons for favouring and preferring a two-chamber legislature are many but the important ones are these.  First, there is need for a sober and second look at legislation which may be the result of political passions of a momentary nature or calculated tyranny of a dogmatic majority in the popular House.  The second Chamber, it is believed, is capable of giving opinions less dependent on the transient political emotions.  In other words, it acts as a check on hasty or ill-considered legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> Second, a second Chamber provides for a more careful scrutiny of an issue in a calmer atmosphere; it acts as a corrective and a complement to the first Chamber.  Third, in the present times of growing complexity of legislation and a heavy legislative schedule, the Seanad is useful in sharing the burden of the Dáil.  It helps plan the legislative programme in such a way that the Oireachtas as a whole can discharge its duty properly and effectively.  Fourth, the second Chamber can hold debates on matters of wide ranging public interest which might not be held in the Dáil, as it must concentrate on legislation and financial issues.</P>
    <P>Fifth, the Upper House may serve as a device to give representation to interests which remain unrepresented in the popular House.  We note the contributions that Senator McAughtry, the late Senator Wilson and others have brought to the House.  Also, Senators elected from the Labour Panel may have a strong industrial relations background &mdash; mine stretches over 25 years &mdash; so they can bring that experience to bear in debates. Likewise, the presence of farmers and agriculturalists from the Agricultural Panel allows the House to benefit from their experience.  The Seanad gives representation to specific interests in that way, although perhaps not as effectively as it could.</P>
    <P>Sixth, the Seanad may include people of talent who are shy of facing the rough and tumble of a general election.  The Taoiseach's nominees often include such people.  Seventh, although the Government is responsible to the Dáil, the popularly elected House, it can be influenced if not controlled by the deliberations of the Seanad. Eighth, bicameralism is almost indispensable in federations.  We are not a federation but we are moving in that direction.  We should give greater weight to our role as local politicians.  We are elected by county councillors, we should be more conscious of representing their views and interests and we should consult with them more than we do.</P>
    <P>In early December I spent five days studying the Upper Houses of the Indian and Malaysian Parliaments.  While the Malaysian Parliament did not have much relevance to us, the Indian Parliament had many interesting features.  When the Constitution of India was being drafted, its framers were fully aware of and took into consideration all the points for and against a second Chamber.  The chairman of the constitutional commission said that there was a considerable volume of opinion against having a second Chamber, as it might prove to be a &ldquo;clog in the wheel of progress&rdquo;, involving expense and adding nothing to the efficiency of work.  He replied to this criticism by remarking that the need for a second Chamber had been felt almost everywhere. He further said:</P>
    <P>After all, the question for us to consider is whether it performs any useful function.  The most that we expect the Second Chamber to do is perhaps to hold dignified debates on <Col N="1509" /> important issues and to delay legislation which might be the outcome of passions of the moment until the passions have subsided and calm consideration could be bestowed on the measures which will be before the Legislature; and we shall take care to provide in the Constitution that whenever on any important matter, particularly matters relating to finance, there is conflict between the House of the People and the Council of States, it is the view of the House of the People that shall prevail.  Therefore, what we really achieve by the existence of this Second Chamber is only an instrument by which we delay action which might be hastily conceived, and we also give an opportunity, perhaps, to seasoned people who may not be in the thickest of the political fray, but who might be willing to participate in the debate with an amount of learning and importance which we do not ordinarily associate with a House of the People.</P>
    <P>At the first meeting of the Rajya Sabha, the Indian Upper House, its chairman said:</P>
    <P>There is a general impression that this House cannot make or unmake government and, therefore, it is a superfluous body.  But there are functions which a revising chamber can fulfil fruitfully.  Parliament is not only a legislative but a deliberative body.  So far as its deliberative functions are concerned it will be open to us to make very valuable contributions and it will depend on our work whether we justify or do not justify this two Chamber system, which is now an integral part of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>My work in India was in conjunction with the establishment of a new second House in South Africa, the National Council of the Provinces. The South African Upper House has been totally revised in the light of the new Constitution.  Not alone has it been kept, but its role has been enhanced.  In this regard a study was undertaken of 11 Upper Houses throughout the world, some of which have features which might be of interest to us.  I could repeat much of what has been said today but I want to introduce the experiences of other countries and studies done elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Most of the other Houses are elected indirectly through the provincial or state legislatures but there are several exceptions, notably Germany's Bundesrat, where the state delegation is chosen by the executive rather than the legislature.  Russia's Federation Council is a hybrid, consisting of the head of the legislature and the regional governor from each of the 89 regions.  Canada, Brazil and Australia choose their second House through direct election from the voters.  The distinction between the two methods of choosing members of the second House is that in systems with an indirect system of elections, Members of the second House tend to be more closely linked to provincial structures.  This tie is strengthened in countries like Russia and Namibia, where members of national second houses are not only <Col N="1510" /> drawn from provincial or regional bodies but retain their seats in those bodies as well.</P>
    <P>The composition of some of the houses also seeks to promote a degree of representation to certain other interests.  For example, while the appointment system for Malaysia's Dewan Negara is closely linked to political parties, it also seeks to provide representation for minority groups by allowing the King to nominate individuals capable of representing racial minorities or other groups.</P>
    <P>The power to accept, amend or reject legislation in the second Chamber is the key to evaluating its legitimacy or contribution. The strongest Houses among those studied are the German Bundesrat and the Australian Senate.  In Australia, the Senate must provide its assent to a bill before it can become a law; all legislation faces this strict requirement.  The ability of the German Bundesrat to represent state interests is most evident in its voting powers.  The Bundesrat has an absolute veto on all Bills affecting the interests of states, including fiscal matters.  In addition, it can reject all Bills or propose amendments to them.  A similar provision exists in Namibia where if two thirds of the National Council &mdash; the Upper House &mdash; opposes a Bill in principle, the National Assembly &mdash; the Lower House &mdash; is obliged to approve the Bill by an equal or greater two thirds majority or else the Bill fails completely.  However, it does not have this power, even with a two thirds rejection, on finance Bills.</P>
    <P>The Russian Federation Council also allows for strong representation by the regions.  Certain federal laws are always subject to its approval, including the federal budget, taxes and revenues. The Canadian Senate is entitled to delay or decline to pass any Bill, but it tends to use these powers discreetly.  While the Senate frequently does amend Bills with the concurrence of the other chamber, many of the amendments are technical changes that reflect the last minute request of the ministry behind the legislation.</P>
    <P>The House of Lords, which is closer to us, has no final veto over legislation, although it can make amendments.  In general, the House of Lords amends the details of Bills rather than challenging their principle, and virtually all of its amendments are accepted by the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>Most of the Houses examined have the power to introduce legislation.  One exception is the Namibian National Council.  The types of legislation which second Houses are able to introduce is a determining factor of their relative strength in relation to the other House.  The second Houses in Argentina, Brazil, Russia, India, Malaysia, Australia and Canada all have the power to initiate legislation &mdash; as does the Irish Seanad &mdash; but with certain limitations.  For example, the Argentinian Federal Senate may not initiate laws relating to taxation, while the Brazilian Federal Senate may not initiate Bills relating to the federal budget.  Likewise, money Bills dealing <Col N="1511" /> with either taxation or expenditure of public money may not be introduced in India or Malaysia, which is similar to our situation.</P>
    <P>An examination was made of the relationship between the Second House and provincial structures. While this is not very relevant to Ireland, some very interesting facts arose.  In several countries, especially Austria and Argentina, members of the Second House are more closely tied to their provinces or states than to their political party structures.</P>
    <P>The communication methods between the two Houses was also raised.  Most of the methods of communication between the two Houses of Parliament are similar throughout the countries examined.  The publication of parliamentary gazettes, Senate journals and Order Papers, which include reports on Senate activities, joint committees are so on, are fairly common.</P>
    <P>All of the 11 chambers examined have some form of committee system, but their role and structure vary from country to country.  A primary distinction among committee systems revolves around the question of whether the committees correspond to ministerial portfolios or to the committees of the other chamber.  The second Houses of Argentina, Brazil and Russia do not correspond to ministerial portfolios but they do in Germany and Austria.  In fact, in Austria's Bundesrat committees correspond both to the portfolios of ministries as well as to the committees of the other chamber.  In Germany the committees comprise members of the provincial ministry responsible for that particular portfolio at the provincial level.  There is a constant connection between the province and the national level on an issue by issue basis.</P>
    <P>Malaysia's second House has no standing portfolio committee and only a few administrative committees, which is almost identical to our structure. The whole chamber goes into committee session to examine Bills in detail.</P>
    <P>In several of the second chambers, such as the Russian Federation Council and the Austrian Bundesrat, the number of committees is far fewer than in the other House.  This is true in the House of Lords, which makes little use of standing or select committees and where the select committees do not oversee the work of Departments. Rather, the committees in the House of Lords tend to focus on internal affairs and the administration of the House.</P>
    <P>As I said, South Africa recently revised its Senate and renamed it the National Council of the Provinces.  It comprises nine provincial delegations of ten members each.  The delegates are selected by the provincial legislatures on the basis of the party political proportional representation formula set out in the constitution of South Africa.  Each delegation has six permanent members and four special members, who are members of the provincial legislature sent to participate in particular NCOP business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> I wish to refer to our study of the Upper House of India, the Rajya Sabha.  Everywhere we went in India we were told how the Indian constitution was modelled on the Irish Constitution, which was well known in parliamentary circles there. The strength of the Indian Upper House is totally different to ours and is fixed at a maximum of 250 members; of course, it represents a population of 950 million people, which is more than the population of Europe.  There are 245 members of the Upper House at the moment, including 12 nominated members.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Lower House, the Rajya Sabha is not dissolved as a body but one third of its members retire every two years and their place is taken by new members.  The Vice President of India, who is elected by an electoral college consisting of members of both Houses, is the ex officio chairman of the Rajya Sabha.  When the Vice President acts as President of India the duties of chairman are performed by the deputy chairman who is elected from the members.</P>
    <P>Except in certain financial matters which are the sole concern of the Lower House, the Rajya Sabha enjoys coequal status in all respects.  A money Bill cannot be introduced in the Rajya Sabha, as is the case here.  It can only be introduced in the Lower House and after it is passed by that House it has to be transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for its recommendations.  The Lower House has the power of either accepting or rejecting the recommendations.  If the money Bill is returned to the Lower House within 14 days of its receipt in the Lower House it will be deemed to have been passed once the time has expired.</P>
    <P>Under the Indian constitution the Rajya Sabha possesses equal authority and power in regard to the amendment of the constitution.  There is provision for a joint sitting with regard to a Bill if deadlock arises between the two Houses.  In other words, a Bill to amend the constitution has to be passed by both Houses separately and if this does not occur a joint sitting is held to decide the matter.</P>
    <P>Another special power relates to the proclamation of emergency.  This provides that if a proclamation of emergency is issued when the House of the People remains dissolved, and the resolution approving the proclamation is passed by the council of state, the proclamation will be legally effective for up to 30 days.</P>
    <P>There are some important matters in respect of which the constitution has placed both Houses on a footing of equality.  Both Houses have equal rights in the election and impeachment of the President, the election of the Vice President, to make laws defining parliamentary privilege and to punish for contempt, to approve a proclamation of emergency and in regard to the failure of the constitutional machinery in states.  The Upper House even has sole rights in some cases.</P>
    <P>Most of the Parliaments which were studied have a Question Time.  I sat for an hour during Question Time in the Upper House in India, which was not dissimilar to the Irish Question <Col N="1513" /> Time.  I wish to quote from an explanatory booklet for new members of the Indian Upper House:</P>
    <P>How effective and assertive the Rajya Sabha is in the matter of reflecting people's problems and highlighting public issues can be seen by watching the House during the &ldquo;Question Hour&rdquo; on any day.  Through the device of questions, important matters on which the public mind is agitated are raised.  This device has been used not only to elicit information and ventilate public grievances but also to goad and force Government to admit executive lapses or to investigate into them.  It has been able to secure important assurances and policy statements.</P>
    <P>It goes on to illustrate important decisions that were made as a result of questions which were put at Question Time.  Most Upper Houses have question time; it acts as an important ally for Senators in raising issues of importance or concern to the general public.</P>

      <P>Very little, if any, of my contribution will call for constitutional change.  I take this opportunity to give an account of my 12 months in this House, particularly with regard to the Northern Ireland panel suggested by Deputy Kathleen Lynch in this report.  I have been disappointed at the lack of opportunity to discuss Northern Ireland during my time in this House. This does not call for a constitutional amendment but it would be wrong of me not to point it out. I was delighted to learn, having been here for three or four months, that I was allowed to sit in on the meetings of the subcommittee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on Northern Ireland.  I thought I could make a contribution but when I went to the meetings it occurred to me that Senators from Northern Ireland should be full members of the committee automatically &mdash; I know they are expected to work here and I will do that wholeheartedly &mdash; in order to give them more authority.  I was embarrassed questioning an SDLP delegation at one meeting because I had to question people of whom I am quite fond.  I had to pretend to be searching because nobody else was being very searching with them in the North.  They represent Northern Ireland.  Deputy O'Keeffe should bear this in mind as it would make a considerable difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad I became a Member of this House through a by-election because it gives a good deal more authority to a Senator.  I have been approached by and been able to help interests in the South.  It would not be a bad idea to have more people from Northern Ireland participating in by-elections.  I found it a good experience and it must have been helpful for the people of the South to watch a person from Northern Ireland competing for a Seanad seat; it must have added to their knowledge of Northern Ireland affairs.  I am suggesting conventions, not constitutional <Col N="1514" /> amendments but I hope somebody takes them on board.</P>
    <P>Having accepted the invitation to run for this seat I was sorry the Fianna Fáil candidate stood down in favour of an SDLP candidate because in the event of a person from Northern Ireland running for this House in the future there is no more healthy way to do it than by being opposed by the Opposition parties here and not by another candidate from Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Chairman to the House and appreciate the important work he is doing.  This is my sixth time speaking on this issue since 1987.  Much of what I have to say relates to change which does not require constitutional amendment but does require a difference of interpretation as to how the Constitution is impacted upon.  There are many mistaken impressions about how hamstrung the Seanad might be because of the Constitution.  I do not support that point of view.</P>
      <P>The Seanad has extraordinary potential. However, it has enough power.  It is not proper in a bicameral Parliament that the Upper House would pervert the wishes of the people as expressed in the Lower House and the Seanad can work very well and effectively within those parameters.  I dislike it being seen as either a retirement home for failed TDs or a launching platform for young political tigers.  There is nothing wrong with Members of the Seanad aspiring to become TDs.  This House is enriched by having ex-Ministers and former Members of the Lower House in it.  I have differed on that with some of my Independent colleagues in the past.  However, in any bicameral structure there are certain conditions for its success.  It needs a different electoral process in the Lower House, which we have, but it must be different but not less democratic.  Also we need to look at how that would work.</P>
      <P>I prefer to be seen as considered and academic rather than pejorative.  I consider this House at present to be anti-democratic and unrepresentative. My position is as good an example as any. I am the leader of the largest educational organisation in this country and an active member of the most senior labour committee here.  There is a Labour Panel and an Education Panel but I would not have a snowball's chance in hell of being elected to either panel because I am not attached to a political party.  Therefore, the only way I can seek election to this House is through what is considered by many to be the most exclusive panel, the University Panel.  It has been good enough to elect me for the past ten years and I hope it continues to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> What can be done?  How can we extend the franchise?  The Constitution is very clear.  There is nothing wrong with giving votes to county councillors but it is wrong that they should have all the votes and that 43 Members of the Seanad should be elected by county and urban councillors. I call it a distillation of democracy, a pyramid model, where people are elected to local councils and elect another tier above them.  The idea is a good one but it is wrong that it is the only method of election.</P>
    <P>I suggest the committee might look at introducing a change in the Electoral Bill which would allow us to distinguish between what we call the inner panel and the outer panel.  For example, for the Agriculture Panel, people are nominated by four Members of Parliament.  The inside panel should be kept as it is, thus retaining the model. The outside panel should be elected by popular vote of the people who are part of the agricultural community.  Why should a member of the IFA not have a vote for this panel?  Similarly, trade Unionists and those involved in education &mdash; teachers and parents &mdash; could be included in respect of the outside panels for Labour and Education, etc.  This would produce a balanced Seanad which would include useful new blood.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that the same nomination day applies in respect of the Dáil and Seanad.  Nomination for both Houses should not be ruled out. If the ill conceived idea of confining votes for emigrants to the Seanad was reconsidered in this context there might be a wider involvement for them.  Those of us on the University benches have the distinction of being elected by some graduates living overseas.  I have received correspondence on my web-site on the Internet from graduates in Japan, the US and Australia who are interested in what is going on in Ireland, who click into the Irish papers every day and who wish to be considered for the vote.</P>
    <P>The Seanad can be a useful forum of subsidised political representation.  However, it is apparent to Members with a second source of income, such as myself, that the salary for Senators is inadequate. Those who give a commitment to the House should be awarded with a decent salary.</P>
    <P>While we can initiate legislation, it was also originally intended that we could modify or revise it.  This Chamber should modify, revise and consolidate legislation and should look at old Statute Book for these purposes.  It should be a reforming House.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has enough power.  It is wrong to consider emulating parliaments whose governments must fight their way through two Houses, encountering obstacles to progress.  I defy anybody to prove to me the need for more powers for this House.  However, we need additional responsibility, greater participation in democracy and Governments that are not afraid to be more open about their legislative business in the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> In my ten years as a Member of this House the past year has probably been the most productive because Ministers listened to arguments when they knew that the Government was in a minority and told their advisers to make changes.  I have seen Ministers who did not have the guts to talk to advisers grow in professional self-confidence. The requirement to listen to Senators and proceed accordingly has been good for them, for the House and for legislation.</P>
    <P>The committee should not be restricted to constitutional reform.  It should interpret the nature of the constitutional objective and then consider if the legislation in place fulfils it.</P>
    <P>We made constitutional changes to extend the franchise to all third level graduates.  There is no case for delaying proceeding with this.  Every third level graduate of every educational institution in this State should have a vote in Seanad elections.  It is intolerable and appalling that this has not been done before now.</P>

      <P>That adds to what I was going to say about the traditional response of the Kerryman to the visitor's question on directions: &ldquo;If I were you I would not be starting from here at all&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The question is raised as to what the Seanad does.  However, the basic question which the committee should confront is what should the Seanad do?  Everything else &mdash; electoral systems, electorates, etc., &mdash; is dependent on that and logically responds to what is required of this Chamber.</P>
      <P>Has a copy of the document discussing the options for the future of Seanad Éireann been distributed to every Member?  It was submitted to the committee, of which I am not a member, on 5 December.  It is a bulky document.  Looking through it, I am glad to agree for once with anything written by Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien in the past 15 years when he refers to the relative lack of partisanship in this House and the way it can illuminate rather than heat discussions.</P>
      <P>The question of the Seanad holding tribunals of inquiry and approving senior public appointments, which was suggested in the appendix to the Whitaker Commission, could be divisive. However, a crucial role must be played by somebody in evaluating on an annual basis &mdash; certainly on a regular basis &mdash; the performance of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Executive is central to decision making. We know how this happens in practice most of <Col N="1517" /> the time.  It involves civil servants and Ministers and once decisions are made they proceed through the Dáil and the Seanad.  They may be delayed by this process, but the core of decision making occurs between Ministers and civil servants. We cod ourselves if we pretend that those at the receiving end have a major influence on what happens.  If we do not have the influence beforehand we will not have it afterwards.</P>
    <P>It is essential, therefore, both in the interests of openness and improving efficiency, that there be regular reviews.  This should not occur in an adversarial sense.  Most of the time we only hear about the work of Departments when something goes wrong.  Tribunals of inquiry are tribunals into what went wrong.  We never hear about what goes right nor about the normal functioning of Departments.  However, for most of the time, the quality of Government depends on the quality of the normal functioning of Departments.  It is essential, therefore, that this be brought much more into the open as a matter of normalcy.</P>
    <P>If this is accepted, and there is goodwill to approaching it not in an adversarial sense but in devising the mechanisms for review on a regular basis, the Seanad could have a significant role. For example, it would be central to following up on the Freedom of Information Bill and the unavoidable reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, which has become a bad joke.  While it may or may not have been relevant to the way Government performed in 1924, it is not just unrealistic but fraudulent in terms of the image we convey of the way Government operates today.  It is an insult to an educated electorate. Tom Barrington said it was devised for the age when Government was at the level of a grocer's shop or a corner shop.  Government is now at supermarket level, yet we are still trying to apply the same management techniques and assuming that the Minister must have sole responsibility for everything.</P>
    <P>Political problems are involved but a fundamental revision of that Act is essential for good Government.  The way the performance of Departments is reviewed must be an integral part of that and the Seanad should have a simple role in that type of review, which would not be party political.  Party politics is always part of it, but essentially it would not be a party political matter. However, it must a political matter; it cannot be left to outside so called expert groups.  There must be much more constructive co-ordination and co-operation between Senators and Deputies and the Executive behind the Minister.  If a mechanism is not devised for establishing that forum of institutional decision as we approach the next century, the Dáil and the Seanad will serve the country worse and worse.  It is a big question but it is central to what Parliament and the Seanad should do.</P>
    <P>I accept the dismissal of the specifics in terms of relations between the Seanad, Departments and the Administration.  However, the general issue should be central for the committee and we <Col N="1518" /> should repeatedly return to it.  I am not talking about adversariality.  On the contrary, much good Government does not receive any attention.  The Universities Bill is available and there will be departmental reviews.  One can debate the details but the principle of review is included.  It is odd that virtually everything except the Departments which determine the legislation under which the country is run is up for review on a regular basis. We must get it into the heads of administrators through the Oireachtas, not outside bodies, that a review function is available.  I agree with the important point about the review of European Union legislation.  The House should discharge this function.  However, if the review of administration and EU recommendations is a large portion of the Seanad's work, who does it?</P>
    <P>I have much more confidence in the current composition of the Seanad &mdash; although that may appear a strange statement from somebody who is not part of the mainstream political process &mdash; than I have in a number of the recommendations for reform.  When the Seanad was established, it had a notional vocational basis.  That was instantly deployed by Mr. de Valera, who always knew what he was doing, to ensure it was not a vocational Seanad in the way people might think. At the time the idea was that vocations supplied expertise, but that is not nearly as much the case today.  There is much more academic and specialist expertise in society which does not depend on vocational representation of that type.  The important quality of the Seanad and any political body is judgment.  How expertise is judged is much more important than expertise.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest the interest groups should not be represented but they will come to the House with highly partisan perspectives.  They are not necessarily party political but we should not fool ourselves that they are not political in the wider sense.  Who will judge that expertise?  A major issue is how one relates the Chambers of Parliament to expertise, and it is not necessarily by having representatives of expertise in the Chamber. This may appear a surprising point from me but we should give much thought to how to make the best use of the much wider range of expertise which now exists compared to when Bunreacht na hÉireann was instituted.</P>
    <P>Some steps have been taken with regard to Taoiseach nominees.  I am not adverse to the idea that people nominated by the Taoiseach should only accept nomination on the understanding that they will vote on the Government side of the House.  They need not be party people; but if people can ensure Government and at the same time bring a different perspective, the Government must have a commitment for the duration. I have no objection to that.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the universities constituency electorate should be extended to all graduates of third level institutions.  In terms of a mechanism.  I have no problem with national or university wide representation.  It will be awkward if one tries to break down what individual universities should <Col N="1519" /> have.  That also raises problems, but I have no objection to a national constituency of graduates.</P>
    <P>The report contains the unfortunate phrase &ldquo;...and moreover enfranchise large numbers of people who are no longer domiciled in Ireland.&rdquo; The Minister spoke about emigrant votes in a positive sense, which I strongly favour.  However, the impression in the report is that there is something almost a little untoward about it.  It should be rephrased before final publication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy O'Keeffe to the House in his capacity as chairman of the committee on the Constitution.  It reflects positively on the wish of the House to reform itself.  I also welcome the Deputy's thought provoking address, which was well crafted.  I was particularly taken with his points about the contours of the Constitution and shaping them to the current needs of the people and future generations.  That phrase echoed with me.  Although it was agreed this morning, I am disappointed that it is necessary to share time.  I thank Senator O'Toole and Senator Lee for sharing their time but I did much work on this matter and it is unfortunate it was not given more time.</P>
      <P>A fundamental question is involved, but I will not restate points I made previously regarding the Progressive Democrats' view of the Seanad or that we believe it could be abolished.  The report refers to the models of unicameral systems in unitary states which work very well.  It is most unsatisfactory that a report of this quality was not circulated to Members in advance.  I tried to find it in the Library this morning and communicated with Deputy O'Keeffe's office.  Thankfully, he was able to furnish me with a copy.  The debate would have been much more informed if the report had been freely available to Members beforehand.</P>
      <P>The report mentions elite critics.  There may be a precise academic definition of elite in that context; but if it is intended to infer that a party such as the Progressive Democrats is in some way elite in believing the Seanad could be abolished, I reject that view.  The report states that the case for the abolition of Seanad Éireann has not been strongly enough made.  However, it later states that it is not worth having an institution which makes no difference.  This is the fundamental point.  Does the institution make a difference?  If not, can it be reformed to the point where it can make a difference?  I am coming to the view that it makes some difference, but it could make more. It has made a difference in the legislative area because, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, the contributions in general have been balanced, well informed and, particularly from the university benches, learned.  Where it has been shown that legislation can be amended for the common good, in general Ministers have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the case of reform, we are faced with redrawing the Constitution.  It is not possible to create sufficient reform without bringing in the <Col N="1520" /> Constitution.  That must be done.  The Maastricht Treaty deals with the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments. Some of these aspects could be dealt with in the Seanad and there should be a much closer relationship between the European Parliament and the Seanad.  This interface should take place much more regularly and not just through visits by Commissioners, such as Commissioner Kinnock's presentation.</P>
    <P>Is there more than the role of checks and balances?  Perhaps not much more, but if the checks and balances are good enough that might be adequate, and there is reference to this in the summary of options for the Seanad.  The onus is on the defenders of the institution to show how it can work, be reformed and not be abolished.</P>
    <P>There have been oblique references to the primacy of Parliament, which I feel strongly about. Parliament has to be the primary agency in the State and the Executive must be answerable to Parliament.  It increasingly seems that Parliament is the cipher for the Executive and is simply a rubber-stamp.  The ultimate sanction Parliament has is to throw the Government out but in reality that is an extreme measure that does not arise very often, happily for those of us who stand for election.  I would not remove that sanction from the Dáil and would not have it as a Seanad sanction so that there could be a vote of no confidence in the Government, making it fall.  We would have to leave that out, but there will have to be some vehicle by which the primacy of Parliament is reclaimed.  I am not precise as to what that would be, but the balance has shifted too far to the Executive and away from the Parliament. A question arises about whether the Dáil has the political courage to allow the Upper House more powers and influence.  There is obviously tension because of selfish electoral interest.</P>
    <P>I defended the existing electoral system in 1991 and it is quite representative.  The councillors are representative of groups within the country and I reject the notion that minorities are not represented within Parliament.  Minorities are well represented by individual Deputies and Senators who argue cases on their behalf.  That is the nature of representative democracy.  However, there are other models which may be superior to that electoral system.  The Clerk will be interested to learn that in 1925, the election was done with a single transferable vote for the whole Free State as a single constituency.  There were 76 candidates, 67 counts and it took three weeks to count the votes.  I doubt the Clerk's office would go for that option.  There might be a case for combining the existing system and a list system.  The system where the original House elected in 1928 by the Deputies and existing Senators has some merit: there could be a list system where parties could nominate people.  One difficulty with the present electoral system is that it is difficult for small parties to gain representation.  That would be the experience of the Progressive Democrats and it is <Col N="1521" /> only by creating alliances that it is possible to gain electoral victory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>If needs must.  One will always be pragmatic in those circumstances, as the Senator is well aware.</P>
      <P>Should there be more Taoiseach's nominees? It is probably important that the Upper House has a similar complexion to the Lower House; but in circumstances where the Government has been in a minority, the House has worked well and the Opposition has been responsible.  There are no fears about that.  In 1925, W.T. Cosgrave had 30 nominees.  If one had more Taoiseach's nominees &mdash; not 30 &mdash; it would allow the Government of the day to nominate people like the late Senator Gordon Wilson, which was a hugely important nomination.  People like Senator Wilson would never have considered standing for election to this House.  His was a direct nomination and a very fortuitous one.  As to whether or not the Taoiseach's nominees should vote for the Government, it was a condition of Senator Wilson's case that it would not be required of him to do so.  The Taoiseach of the day acceded to that request.  There are circumstances where it should not be required of the person nominated by the Taoiseach to vote with the Government.</P>
      <P>Several procedural matters could be improved, but they are probably more for the internal regulation of the House than the constitutional committee. One matter raised was qualified majority. That is, if there was a sufficiently important matter which the House felt strongly enough about, it should be possible by virtue of qualified majority, perhaps two thirds, to overturn the decision of the Dáil.  That should be looked at.  On committees, manpower is a major factor.  It has become very difficult for small parties to man committees and the Upper House has a role in manning committees.</P>
      <P>On the universities, I favour the extension of the franchise to the third level in general. Whether that would be one constituency or with Trinity retaining its separate status, I am unsure.  I have referred to the contribution of the university Senators and they have added to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for emigrants, it should not be the case that emigrants have seats in the Upper House.  They should have the same voting rights as any other citizen.  They should be able to nominate the constituency they originally came from and there should be a time limit on the number of years away from home; but there are plenty of democracies where emigrants can vote by universal franchise to the main legislative assembly, which is normally the Lower House.  There is no reason that cannot be done in our case.  The example of France is given, where Senators from abroad have seats in the Upper House.  That is probably a vestige of colonialism whereby citizens resident abroad came back to take their seats.  If people <Col N="1522" /> are citizens of a country, they are entitled to vote irrespective of where they are.  There are difficulties in doing that but it is possible with modern communications.</P>
    <P>The Seanad can have a useful function with checks and balances.  Whether it requires extra powers I am not convinced; but it does need extra responsibility.  The Seanad has to reform.  It is a case of reformation or abolition and reformation is probably the preferable course.  It was said to me that perhaps if the Seanad was less powerful it might be made more important, which relates to vocational representation.  In respect to bodies like the Irish Farmers' Association having nominating powers to the House, although I have no evidence I suggest they and similar bodies would reject that notion because it would politicise them.  There would be inevitable political interference to try and tone the complexion of the House.  Bodies which are jealous of their non-sectarian and non-political nature would not wish to go down that road even if we allowed them seats in the House.  If they came in as non-political they would probably end up political.  This is a political House and there is nothing wrong with that; it is as it should be in a political democracy.  To quote Coakley and Laver: &ldquo;Those who are cynical about the prospects of institutional reform in Ireland might take the view that the most probable outcome of the current debate will be no change.&rdquo;  I hope they are wrong.  We look to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, his committee and the Oireachtas to show that will not be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  Other Senators may not know he was an eminent former Minister; hopefully he will be a Minister in future.  I congratulate him for staying with us throughout this debate.  The work he is doing in his committee on constitutional reform is very important and it is right that someone of his standing as a Member of the Oireachtas should have been selected to chair it.  He was probably also selected because he represents one of the safest seats in the country, although he probably would not agree with that.</P>
      <P>As for whether this House derives its mandate from the people, it does not.  The democratic deficit in this House is clear.  However, Senator Dardis made an important and central point when he asked if this House can make a difference to political life and the legislative process. He concluded that it could and it is in that context that we have to look at the role of this House.  It has made a difference to the Parliament in raising issues that are being discussed throughout the country on a continuous basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a purely democratic basis it does not derive its existence from the people and as a result there have been questions asked about its existence. Throughout the history of the State the role played by the Seanad in the life of the country has been positive and it is probably more positive today precisely because the Government is in a minority.  The amount of vying and debate that <Col N="1523" /> takes place between the Government and Opposition is intensified.  That was not envisaged in either the 1922 or 1937 Constitutions but it has happened as a result of numbers.  That fusion has been positive, for example, in bringing forward Private Members legislation just before Christmas.  Deputy Mary Wallace's electoral reform legislation passed swiftly through this House.  This might not have happened a number of years ago.  Because of the numbers in this House the Government has managed to provide a most interesting focus of debate.</P>
    <P>I am not really qualified to speak on this matter because nobody actually elected me to the Seanad &mdash; I was appointed directly by the Taoiseach; I keep saying to people long may it continue. I was not even elected to South Dublin County Council so I am a pretty rare animal. However, people bring their own experience to this place.  In 1995 when I was asked to be a Member on my way from the Taoiseach to meet Senator Manning an adviser to the Government said, &ldquo;You will not cause any difficulties for us, will you?&rdquo;  I said I hoped not.  It is in that context that many Members who have been appointed by the Taoiseach are seen as people either on the way up or on the way down in politics; whether I fit into any of those categories I am not sure.</P>
    <P>The experience this House can bring to national political life is important.  People in this House are less party political than in the Dáil. That is the nature of the House because we encourage consensus and try to move on issues unilaterally.  This encourages people to be less party political.</P>
    <P>The role of the Independent Senators throughout the history of the House has been positive. They have always seen their role as attempting to change legislation positively rather than being a bloc of Independents continually chastising the Government over legislation.</P>
    <P>When we debated the question of specific seats for emigrants I was very much in favour. However, when it came to the floor of the Seanad it was vociferously shot down by the vast majority of Members.  I believed that we should have moved on the issue of giving Seanad votes to emigrants as an achievable first step.  In a very short time we could have changed the impression many emigrants have about the political life of both Houses.  I was shocked by the majority view from both sides which resulted in a positive proposal from Government being thrown out.  If we had reacted more positively to that proposal three Members of this House could have represented the emigrant lobby after the next election.  It is fine for Members to speak about reform, but when it was put in front of us we threw it out.  If we had accepted it as a principle to be worked on, we could have had the basis for transforming one aspect of this House.</P>
    <P>I once had an interview with Senator O'Toole while writing an article for a university.  I am not sure if he met me because he knew he would be <Col N="1524" /> speaking to a large number of graduates of the NUI, but I took the view from him then, and I have heard it reiterated today, that within the present Constitution we can bring about positive change.  We can change the panels, the numbers represented on each panel and the number of nominating agencies.  Small steps, like votes for emigrants and redrafting the panels, should be taken first.  I agree with other Members regarding the university Senators and extending the franchise. That is common sense.  Where change comes before the Seanad in the future, I hope we will take it on board and accept it.</P>

      <P>I too welcome Deputy O'Keeffe.  I wish to express appreciation to John Coakley and Michael Laver for the very comprehensive submission they forwarded.  It gives a very detailed account of the options and choices which face us.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that on around 2 March two years ago we had a comprehensive debate over a number of days suggesting adjustments which would make the House more effective and efficient and more relevant to the world outside. To date we have not seen much change in that regard, although I welcome the change whereby Deputy O'Keeffe is here with us discussing the options which might be put in place.  I would like if we could have further adjustments and provide an opportunity to question the professors who prepared this document as would be done in the committees.  That would allow us discuss proposed changes with the professionals and experienced political scientists and to make effective decisions.</P>
      <P>I am not sure we are going to make any major advances.  We have seen very little fundamental political change to the Constitution since its enactment other than where changes had to be initiated as a result of court decisions.  It is rare that we have taken any other initiatives.  We have set up committees and politicians have worked hard in those committees. The fundamental point is that there has been little change.</P>

    <P>I thank Senator Norris who suggested this debate this morning.  It is useful that we debate the matter now.</P>
    <P>Few people of the appropriate age can forget Bloody Sunday 25 years ago.  All of us have our memories.  We remember news trickling in that something appalling and unprecedented in our history, which should never happen in a civilised country, was happening in the city of Derry.  As the news trickled in we watched the black and white television pictures.  We saw the picture that is etched forever in everybody's memory, the picture of the then Fr. Edward Daly holding his white bloodstained handkerchief as he helped to bring an injured man to safety.  That and other pictures are burnt into our minds and will remain there forever.</P>
    <P>We also remember the enormous anger that gripped people not just in Ireland but in all parts of the world.  We remember the sense of incomprehension and disbelief.  How could this happen in a civilised country?  We remember the anger which drove sane, ordinary people onto the streets of Dublin and led to the burning of the British Embassy, something none of us thought would have been possible in this country in the 1970s.  We saw the anger and despair following Bloody Sunday and the incredible suffering of the families of the victims.</P>
    <P>Afterwards we watched the beginning of a major cover-up.  We listened to the blatant, brazen lies about what happened.  An inquiry was set up under the Lord Chief Justice which we expected to lead to the truth.  However, we were given an official tissue of lies, a suppression of evidence and a blatant distortion of the facts.  As a result the word &ldquo;Widgery&rdquo; became redolent with shame and ignominy as far as most people were concerned.  It was synonymous with official cover-up and travesty of truth.</P>
    <P>Sadly, we later saw the exploitation of what happened on Bloody Sunday by those who engaged in mass murder and some of the most foul and heinous acts of violence against people who were as innocent as the people who were gunned down on Bloody Sunday.  That is something we must never forget.</P>
    <P>Twenty-five years later there is considerable new evidence about the events of Bloody Sunday. The evidence surprises nobody; it confirms what most of us already knew to be the facts and the extent of the cover-up.  Mr. John Hume said on RTÉ radio this morning that he did not need a new inquiry.  He knew what happened on Bloody Sunday as does any fair minded person who makes even the smallest attempt to inquire into the facts.  However, there is an enormous need for an official response to this new information.  The official response must take into account not only the new information but also the facts that are already known.  It is important that, 25 years later, the lie which is Widgery be demolished and the truth of what happened on that awful day be <Col N="1526" /> known.  It should not be known in order to be used as a weapon in an ongoing quarrel but for its own sake and so that those whose names have been blackened by the Widgery report can at last have that wrong corrected.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the truth and for the British Government to apologise to the relatives of those who were killed on that day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I second the motion.  This morning Senators reacted appropriately by standing in silent prayer for those who were killed on Bloody Sunday and for all those who have died or been injured in the tragedy that is Northern Ireland.  This afternoon we are fulfilling another function as elected representatives in a sovereign Parliament.  That function will advance the healing process which will help to bring about reconciliation and eliminate the deeply felt hurt of families and an entire community in the face of a terrible massacre and, even worse, the official whitewash and deceit that followed the massacre.</P>
      <P>We have advanced 25 years but elected political representatives have an obligation to search for the basis of reconciliation and to work in common cause to achieve it.  It is not surprising that our counterparts in the British House of Commons, who we meet regularly at the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, are proposing the same action as is suggested by this motion.  This is a chance for us to work together towards the common cause of simple recognition.  I might anticipate the findings of an inquiry but, as Senator Manning pointed out, the truth has been known to all for a generation.  However, we seek an inquiry that will look at the facts, accept the evidence and give the appropriate response and apology to those who were brutally murdered and to their families and communities who have suffered so much.</P>
      <P>That would be a huge step towards achieving the reconciliation we seek.  It would not offend any community in Northern Ireland.  Wrong done by government is much more grievous than wrong done by terrorists who do not act in our name.  That is why we must ensure that the standards that have disgraced government in this instance be apologised for and obliterated.</P>
      <P>A Member of the British House of Commons, Andrew Hunter, whose reactions are predictable and consistent in their predictability, does no service to any cause when he again chooses to blindfold himself and, in a most offensive way, suggests there is nothing new to be learned and nothing to be inquired into.  That type of blind, irrational response shows neither respect for those who were killed and their families nor respect for the intelligence of the Irish electorate and its representatives. I pity him in having such an approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the British Government, despite calls from this and the British Parliaments, does not conduct this long overdue inquiry, the call must be brought to other fora such as the European Union, in which we are partners with the British, <Col N="1527" /> and the United Nations.  I hope that, in a sense of common purpose between the British and Irish Governments and Parliaments, we can agree to do it together.  If not, we have an obligation to pursue this matter further to ensure that the wrong of 25 years be belatedly corrected in the interests not just of those who died and their families but of the political future and harmony on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Leader of the House for moving this motion on Bloody Sunday. I was one of the people in Derry that day and I will never forget it.  It was like being on the Strand Road in Derry in 1969 when the Troubles started. Living in Letterkenny, which is about 20 miles from Derry, means one cannot forget what one saw that day.  The fear experienced by people when the shooting started made them dive for cover.  We headed for the safest place.  It was terrible to be in areas around the Creggan and see mothers and fathers coming down from the Creggan after they heard there had been shooting and a massacre.  I will never forget the shock and distress on their faces.  Bloody Sunday will stay in the memories of people all over Ireland for many years.  I recently saw the film &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo;, including the depiction of the Croke Park murders which were also called Bloody Sunday.  That day was never forgotten.  Unfortunately, the Widgery Tribunal was set up and there was no evidence found that the demonstrators were armed.  At the same time, the tribunal did not condemn the paratroopers.</P>
      <P>New evidence has now come to light that the demonstrators were not armed and that the shots did not come from the paratroopers but from snipers on the city wall.  It is a damning indictment of the British Government that it should allow this opportunity to pass, remarking only that an inquiry would be of no use.</P>
      <P>I congratulate both John Hume and the Tánaiste for the manner in which they have approached this matter.  The Tánaiste has raised it with the British Government for many years. The concerns of the families are there and they will not be happy until they have been told that their loved ones were innocent.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy commented on the remarks made by Andrew Hunter this morning. It is hard to believe that this type of attitude still exists within the British Government.  Mr. Hunter said that he was cynical about the whole affair but that there was no need for an inquiry.  However, if the pressure had not been maintained in the case of the Birmingham Six those innocent men would still be languishing in British jails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a case of simply saying there should be no inquiry.  I remember the faces of the Doodys and the Nashs who came down to look for their children that day.  They will never forget what happened.  They know their children were innocent and it is proper that an inquiry should be held.  The state accused and vilified them and said <Col N="1528" /> they were men of violence.  They were not men of violence but innocent people looking for civil rights.  The families deserve an inquiry and something should be done as soon as possible to bring this chapter to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for his typically gracious acknowledgement of the small role I played in getting this matter before the House.  I suggested it this morning because, although it was appropriate that we stand in silence as a mark of respect to the dead, I felt we should do something practical to strengthen the hand of the Tánaiste in pushing the British Government towards an inquiry.  We cannot demand that they have one but we can request that they do.</P>
      <P>I feel this strongly because I am half English.  I was brought up to believe in British justice. However, the last 25 to 30 years have been a catalogue of infamy.  Names like Lord Denning with the &ldquo;appalling vista&rdquo; judgment.  Lord Widgery with his tribunal, the Diplock courts, the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, all called into question the basic concept of British justice.</P>
      <P>I remember the visual images of Bloody Sunday such as Bishop Daly carrying a white flag. There was another man, whose name I cannot remember, who also carried a white flag because he went to assist a young man who was lying on the ground dying.  I heard two young women from Derry on the radio the other day say that they begged that man not to go because he would also be shot.  He said &ldquo;No, I have a white flag and they will respect that.&rdquo;  They did not respect that.  To shoot someone under a white flag rendering assistance is an appalling breach of every canon of decency.</P>
      <P>Mr. Hunter says that there should not be a new inquiry until there is new evidence.  How new and startling does this evidence have to be to satisfy him?  People were described by the officer commanding as being in possession of nail bombs and having fired shots, but we know this was not true. He glossed over this by saying that the IRA traditionally removed weapons from the bodies of shot gunmen.  We now know there were no nail bombs.  These people did not shoot.  They were peacefully protesting as they have every right to do.  I also heard those two women say that this taught them one lesson &mdash; there was no use in democracy.  Unfortunately, this appalling tragedy was one of the most significant recruiting agents for the Provisional IRA.</P>
      <P>I remember the day that the British Embassy was burnt.  I was on my way to a meeting about James Joyce and saw Daithí Ó Conaill on the back of a cart.  I will never forget the words he used.  &ldquo;We are one race, one people, we have one culture, we have one voice&rdquo;, he said.  I thought to myself that I had heard that before&mdash;Ein Reich, Ein Volk, Ein Fuehrer&mdash;and I knew that there was a fascist element being released by the stupidity and callousness of the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Truth can heal and reconcile and we are entitled to it.  Those people were innocent.  Not <Col N="1529" /> only were they murdered but they were then vilified and their reputations besmirched &mdash; blame the victim.  The British Government has sunk to a scandalous low.  It is a reproach to the whole judicial system.</P>
    <P>We also ought to ask questions about the role of the soldiers and the kind of training they received that allowed them to carry out this callous murder of innocent civilians.  It would be valuable if that question was raised at the inquiry because, in addition to giving a much belated apology to the memory of the dead and the surviving relatives, we ought to use this inquiry to ensure that this kind of behaviour does not occur again either in Northern Ireland or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If these questions were answered by an inquiry and an apology made it would go some way towards reconciling the people of the two communities in Northern Ireland and I commend the Leader for his initiative in allowing this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see this motion on the Order Paper and I am glad that the Progressive Democrats supported it and my name is attached to it.</P>
      <P>The motion bears careful reading.  The British Government has all the facts at its disposal.  They are in Ministry of Defence and Northern Ireland Office files among others and it may not be the case that it requires the reopening of a public inquiry to establish them.  It is open to Mr. Major to secure all the facts he needs and on the basis of those facts to make a clear, unambiguous and comprehensive statement about the events of that day.  The statement must accept responsibility for the killings and offer a full apology to the families and friends of those killed.</P>
      <P>I bow to Senator Maloney's more immediate experience of the events.  If the families deemed it appropriate to have a public inquiry then I would agree to that.  However, if it were to reopen a lot of personal wounds for them and if there was another attempt to besmirch the names of those killed then it would be better that the British Prime Minister and Government come clean and make a formal statement in the House of Commons accepting culpability and offering their apology.</P>
      <P>I am glad that in this motion we are supporting what John Hume is seeking to do in the House of Commons with the backing of many members of that chamber.  Given that the facts are available and the British Government can access them, there may not be a need for a prolonged inquiry.  The Irish Government should also look at its own archives and make public any relevant information because it must also have examined the matter carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bloody Sunday was a watershed in Northern Ireland politics.  It precipitated a great change &mdash; replacing Unionist rule in Stormont with direct rule from Westminster and leading to an aftermath of bitterness between the communities which survives to the present day.  The Widgery inquiry, established to look into the facts, was a <Col N="1530" /> whitewash and it brought British justice into disrepute. At the time some of us were prepared to believe in the equality of British justice and confidence in it was totally eroded.  Witness statements recently published were disregarded by the tribunal. If this were a criminal case &mdash; reference was made to the Birmingham Six &mdash; there would be good grounds for reopening the trial.  The British Government should do the decent and honourable thing by acknowledging its responsibility as a first step to reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The time has come to lance the boil and to remove the source of grievance which has poisoned the political atmosphere in Northern Ireland for many years.  Governments, like people, should be generous; they should have the generosity of spirit, open-mindedness and big heartedness to apologise.  That appeal was made this morning by an English churchman who I heard on the radio.</P>
    <P>We must be even-handed in our condemnation of violence, irrespective of the quarter it comes. We must be mindful that many other families have suffered terribly through the loss of their relatives.  We should condemn all violence of whatever nature and from whatever quarter.  We cannot have the politics of selective condemnation of violence.  Obviously, we strongly condemn what took place on Bloody Sunday but there have been other incidents over the years which we have condemned.  If they were to recur &mdash; we hope they do not &mdash; we would condemn once more.  If, as was stated, Finchley is the same as Northern Ireland, it unquestionable that if 14 people died there as opposed to Derry city there would be a totally different response from the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember Bloody Sunday as I was three years of age when it happened.  It is moving for many Members who remember and who were politically involved at that time to recount that tale today as we remember those who were murdered in 1972.  As we remember those who were murdered, we hope that by clearing up this scandal once and for all by establishing an independent tribunal and apologising for what occurred, we will help to bring the people of Northern Ireland together.</P>
      <P>There is deep seated contempt in each community for the other.  By apologising and by discovering the truth, we could go a long way to heal some of the wounds.  As Senator Norris rightly said, some campaign agents behind the IRA cynically used Bloody Sunday.  It was a recruiting ground as never before for that organisation which became more sophisticated and organised as a result of Bloody Sunday.  It is vitally important to set the record straight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative taken by the House &mdash; I commend the Leader and other group leaders for tabling the motion &mdash; will send a signal supporting what the Tánaiste and the Government will say to the British Government and, in particular, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  Any <Col N="1531" /> attempt by this House to help in that regard will be positive move and the people will see it as such.  If attitudes in Northern Ireland are to change, we must learn to forgive and, in a sense, forget.  As John Hume has often said, we should draw a line across the history of Northern Ireland and begin to look for a better future for everyone there.  We cannot forget the thousands of innocent victims who have been murdered on the streets of Northern Ireland over the past 27 years but by tabling this motion I believe we are, in a small way, perpetuating their memory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>By tabling this motion we are reflecting the deeply held feelings of the majority of the people, North and South, about the tragedy in Derry 25 years ago and the failure of the British authorities to adequately respond.  The Government must continue to use its influence with the British authorities to have a new inquiry established.  If the British authorities fail to do so, the Government should explore the possibility of taking the matter to the Court Human Rights or down any other avenue which is open to it to deal with this matter which has caused much upset for so many people.  I add my support to the motion before the House and call on the British authorities to take action to set up a new inquiry.</P>

      <P>I remember Bloody Sunday very well; it was a snowy day.  Four or five of us, including Seán Conway who later became a Member of this House and who died tragically last year, were in Ashbourne.  We were full of good spirits and we went into the Hunter's Moon where we had hot ports and whiskeys.  I had just found out that we were expecting our first child so it was an important day.  The owner of the pub, Mr. John Byrne, who is from a place near Derry came over to us with tears in his eyes and asked if we had heard the news.  He told us up to 20 people &mdash; the numbers were unclear at that stage &mdash; had been shot by the paramilitaries in Derry. I still feel the shock when I think back to that day.</P>
      <P>Derry is a city I know well.  The INTO holds a conference there every second year.  It was only in the past two weeks that we decided to hold our 1997 national education conference in that city. The people of Derry have extraordinary and unstoppable optimism.  It is a city of song and friendship and there is always optimism.  I recall visiting the city in the summer of 1994 before the ceasefire where I spoke to John Hume and others.  The people were certain there was to be a ceasefire because there had been no violence there in the previous 15 to 18 months, apart from one stray bullet.  There was much optimism and development on Ship Quay Street.  It was the fastest growing city of its type in Europe at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to touch on a point raised by Senator Dardis about reopening old wounds. There is no danger of that happening because those wounds have never closed; the hurt has <Col N="1532" /> always been there and it has informed everything for the past 25 years.  My sense of anger about it is so complicated that I find it difficult to articulate. It is not only directed at the British Government but also at the Provisionals and the callous way it has used this incident as a breeding ground for young terrorists to continue the cycle of pain, killing and violence for generations.  The Provisionals have used this incident unmercifully to recruit young people.  I know this from my members teaching in that city.  They have given me examples of it time and again.</P>
    <P>I remember two occasions in the past 15 years where the Provisionals insisted that youngsters from the Creggan and Bogside march to commemorate Bloody Sunday.  On those occasions there was violence when the RUC or the British Army over reacted and mowed into these young lads and broke a few bones.  The next day the IRA had six more recruits from the Bogside and the Creggan.  It confirmed for these youngsters that the IRA was right.  On every occasion the British Government reinforced that prejudice and confirmed the sense of injustice and we enforced and confirmed the prejudice and sense of injustice. The British Government is guilty on three counts: the parachute regiment representing it, the crooked way in which it conducted so-called inquiries and its giving a weapon to the IRA to develop its reign of terror.  It is disgraceful that it should at this stage not wish to clear the record. It was 25 years ago.  Why is the British Government so slow to do this?</P>
    <P>It would be nice if Derry could be remembered in a practical way.  It is a time the militaristic air of the national anthem was replaced with &ldquo;The Derry Air&rdquo;.  It is a reminder of many things and crosses many communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for taking this matter.  While he does not have direct responsibility for this area, he comes from a county with a large coastline and will be aware of the extreme difficulties experienced by people in coastal areas due to coastal erosion. The west coast has received a severe battering from the sea over the last few years.  Areas which were hitherto undamaged have suffered severe coastal damage due to the changes in tides and the movement of sand.  It has been difficult to explain but weather conditions, storms especially, have played a part.  There seems to be a movement in western coastal areas which has caused <Col N="1533" /> undue hardship to and concerned many people who live there.</P>
      <P>In my constituency over the past number of years serious damage has been caused by the sea. I am specifically referring to areas adjacent to Quilty, where there is a nice fishing harbour and resort.  There have been dramatic movements of sand and tides in the past few years.  The road to the pier at Seafield, near Quilty village, is threatened and the pier may be under severe strain unless some remedial action is taken.  The local authority is concerned about it but does not have the financial resources needed to undertake the comprehensive and expensive works to remedy the situation.  It was hoped a few years ago, with the availability of European Union funding, that it would be possible to conduct joint operations. It has been depressing to see other areas receiving substantial grant aid and EU funding to tackle coastal erosion problems while the problems in Clare have not been dealt with.</P>
      <P>I do not want to enter into a litany of areas which have suffered severe damage, but adjacent to Kilrush and near Kilrush marina, where the Minister launched an excellent marine leisure project, the road into Cappagh village has been undermined by erosion caused by the Shannon.  It would now take major investment by the county council, money it does not have, to carry out remedial works and replace the walls which would ensure the road would not be washed away.</P>
      <P>In the inlets adjacent to the mouth of the Shannon, whole areas of embankments have been washed away, thousands of acres of land flooded and stones and seaweed scattered over a wide area.  We gave photographic evidence of this to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, the Commissioners of Public Works and others.  Since the flooding of a year or two ago, the damage caused to the foundations of some of the coastal protection walls has not been remedied. The sea is making inroads into land there, especially into land occupied by small farmers with small holdings who are dependent on this land to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect of this which has caused hardship for people is the undermining of many old culverts laid down in a joint scheme between local farmers and the Office of Public Works 30, 40 and 50 years ago.  Many have been undermined and some have collapsed with the result that flooding has built up behind them.  The problem was difficult to resolve as it was not clear until recently who was responsible for repairing and maintaining these culverts.  The county council did not want to know because it did not have any money.  The Commissioners of Public Works did not want to know because they felt it should be done by someone else.  The result is that many farmers are severely inconvenienced, cattle have been put at risk and lives put in danger in one area near Seafield, where houses were flooded and people evacuated in the middle of the night. <Col N="1534" /> The situation is unsatisfactory and people are seeking financial support to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to impress upon his colleague the desirability and urgency of finding some EU or departmental funding to supplement the work done by local communities and the county council. I also ask that some remedial efforts be made this year before any further permanent damage is caused which will further damage the livelihoods of people involved, threaten some of the local communities, raise the prospect of people losing their lives and allow a deteriorating situation to worsen.  It needs urgent and remedial action now. The longer this is left &mdash; the Minister will be aware of this from his constituency &mdash; the more expensive it will be.  Small schemes which would not cost much now will be hugely expensive in four or five years' time.  I refer especially to Seafield and its pier and fishing harbour.  If the road to it is washed away, the cost of remedial works will run into millions whereas a small amount now might deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>You could have fooled me 18 months ago when they won their first All Ireland in a long time and showed the personality of Ireland at its best.</P>
      <P>In recent years everyone has come to recognise that the Irish coastline is a resource of immense value in economic, environmental, ecological and social terms.  It is recognised that coastal erosion is a major threat to the coastal resource.  This resource is fragile and in many instances nonrenewable, and the systems operating within the coastal zone will significantly depend on the preservation of the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has one of the longest coastlines in Europe, stretching to 5,800 kilometres.  In 1992 the County and City Engineer's Association carried out a needs study which showed that 1,500 kilometres of our coastline is at risk and approximately 500 kilometres requires immediate attention at a cost of over £120 million.  Many of the areas under threat from erosion, such as Bray promenade, County Wicklow; Rosslare Strand, County Wexford; Laytown, County Meath; and Enniscrone Strand, County Sligo, are major tourist amenities.  The erosion and possible loss of such amenities will pose serious economic difficulties for local communities, which to a large extent depend on these tourism amenities for their economic survival.  This is in addition to the <Col N="1535" /> economic loss of State owned property incurred due to erosion.</P>
    <P>Coastal erosion also impacts on the local ecological environment.  Loss, for example, of sand dunes or other shore areas can disrupt flora and fauna and the natural habitats of a number of birds and animals.  Erosion in certain instances poses a social threat to isolated coastal communities. Apart from the economic disruption, erosion is threatening the communication and transport links for these communities.  Being cut off from the mainland will have serious and potentially catastrophic consequences for them.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that the line cannot and should not be held against the sea.  This view is supported by three distinct arguments.  The first is geomorphological&mdash;erosion provides the sediment that builds up the natural coastal defences of other areas of coastline by forming beaches, shingle bars, etc.  The second is environmental&mdash; the natural mud flats, marshes and dunes are home to a wide variety of birds, animals and fauna.  The third is economic&mdash;protection works can be costly and as the funding available for protection works, whether that be Government, local authority or private is limited, it is essential to ensure that investing in any protection scheme represents value for money.  In other words, a scheme must be justified.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the threat posed by erosion and the need for coastal protection. EU Structural Funds are being made available for the first time to help address the serious erosion problem.  Under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services £5.1 million is being made available over the 1994-9 period to undertake priority protection works.  The primary objective of the funding is the protection of State owned foreshore, local authority owned property, tourism amenities, including beach and dune systems and natural habitats-ecology.  Preservation is the objective where this can be undertaken at economic cost.</P>
    <P>In order to draw up a targeted programme of priority coastal locations, consultations have been held with and submissions have been sought from the various coastal local authorities.  The local authorities have submitted details of their top priority proposals for consideration.  They have also been advised that given the cost of the proposals received, which is in excess of £25 million, and the level of resources available, it will not be possible to undertake any or all of the proposals received.  Considerable progress has been made in the last two years in tackling priority projects. In 1996 alone 15 projects were aided at a cost of almost £1 million.  Included among these projects are protection works at Tawin Island, County Galway; Laytown, County Meath; Ardgroom, County Cork; and Enniscrone, County Sligo.</P>
    <P>Clare County Council has identified a number or priority proposals for consideration.  These include Lahinch &mdash; rock armouring and new sea <Col N="1536" /> walls with a cost estimate of £500,000; Kilkee &mdash; renewal of sea walls and promenade and the provision of new sea walls with a cost estimate of £1 million; Seafield Beach and Pier &mdash; rock armouring, gabions and sea walls with a cost estimate of £1.1 million and Cloghanes &mdash; rock armouring and new sea walls with a cost estimate of £650,000.</P>
    <P>To date it has not been possible to grant aid any of the projects identified by Clare County Council.  However, subject to funding, which will be in the region of £1 million per annum over the next few years, Clare County Council's proposals will be considered, along with proposals from the other coastal local authorities, over the remaining years of the Environmental Services Operational Programme.  I assure this House, on behalf of the Minister, that there is no question of County Clare being forgotten about or ignored.  In the context of available funds, it is impossible to undertake works in every priority location at any one time.  I will convey Senator Daly's message to the Minister and I hope he is lucky this time. Obviously, Clare County Council must identify which of these priority areas it would like to be attended to first.</P>
    <P>The Government is aware of the need for increased funding for this area and it will make every effort in this regard.  The £5.1 million, apart from being the first time that Structural Funds were made available for coastal protection works, is a significant increase in funding provided in the early 1990s when only £100,000 per annum was made available for capital works on coastal protection.</P>

      <P>On the day when there is a debate about the price of the pint, I want to talk about another aspect of Guinness.  Since childhood, I, like many others, have marvelled at the number of Irish souvenirs, even leprechauns, which have &ldquo;Déanta sa tSeapáin&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Taiwan&rdquo; written on them.  Many products relied for their sale on their Irish connection, yet they were produced outside Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Christmas in the Aer Rianta shop at Dublin Airport &mdash; they are also available in other shops&mdash;I came across the most misleading products I have ever seen called Guinness clothing. While several pieces of knitwear were made in Ireland and so labelled and the wax jackets on sale appeared to have been made in England, I could not find the labels of origin on the other high quality items for sale.  Yet the descriptions on the labels gave the impression of a close association between the garments and Ireland. For example, the following was printed on the outside of the swing tag on the clothes: &ldquo;Clothing inspired by the richness of Irish country life&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guinness is a guarantee of Excellence, Guinness <Col N="1537" /> since 1759&rdquo;.  On the inside of the same swing tag it said:</P>
    <P>In 1759 Arthur Guinness began brewing at St. James's Gate in Dublin.  He stood firm in his belief to offer only the very best and more than 200 years later the name Guinness stands for Excellence and individuality all over the world.</P>
    <P>Guinness clothing is a casual wear range created from natural fibres and is inspired by the great traditions of Guinness and Irish Country Life.</P>
    <P>The following types of names were used to describe the garments: Lansdowne, Ravenhill, Curragh, Moren, Mayo, Galway, Trinity, Dingle, Bantry, Harp &amp; Barrow, Wexford Wax, Fastnet Wax, Atlantic, Liffey Leather Belt and Dunloe Leather Belt.  These are closely connected with Ireland.</P>
    <P>These are not cheap garments.  The Lansdowne rugby shirt retails at approximately £42 to £45, including VAT, but it is sold to the retailer for approximately £20.  At these prices there is no reason Irish manufacturers could not manufacture the garment.  Fruit of the Loom in Donegal, which had to lay off many people recently, makes similar garments for the world market.  The Curragh sports shirt retails at approximately £32 to £34 and this is bought by retailers for approximately £15.50.  This could also be made here at a profit.</P>
    <P>The slogan, &ldquo;Guinness is good for you&rdquo;, could be changed to &ldquo;Ireland has been good for Guinness&rdquo;. Arthur Guinness put great store in helping the Irish economy and I remember the fuss there was when the head office was transferred from Dublin to London.  However, are those now in charge of the firm trying to help the old tradition of the firm?</P>
    <P>We constantly hear about the problems of the Irish textile trade.  Employment has fallen from 12,000 in December 1990 to 9,300 in June 1996, which represents a 22 per cent loss in less than six years.  How wise is it for a profitable firm such as Guinness to trade in this way?  All trade is international and the shops at airports are international. However, many visitors as well as many Irish people want to buy Irish products made by Irish people.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me if it is possible to introduce regulations so that people can ascertain if what appears to be an Irish product is one.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this important matter.  Unfortunately, I did not have all the details about this matter before I came here so my reply is probably too general to deal with the specifics raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I opened Leixlip Country House Hotel yesterday evening which was built 225 years ago as the home of Captain William Brady.  I understand it was to be the first site for the Guinness Brewery <Col N="1538" /> before it moved to James's Gate.  In the last fortnight I also attended the craft show, which featured an incredible range of Irish manufactured garments of the highest quality.  I agree with the Senator that many of the garments she mentioned could have been manufactured by exhibitors at the show.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for consumer protection rests with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, whose remit extends to labelling requirements which could include country of manufacture. Under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, he has the authority to intervene where false or misleading information about goods and services has been provided in the course of a business, trade or profession.  A useful guide to this Act is available from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not have direct responsibility in this area and it is not in my remit to introduce regulations. However, in relation to trade regulation, my Department has responsibility for implementing the terms of Council Regulations 2913/92 on the rules of origin of goods.  These are laws, regulations and administrative practices used to identify the country of origin of internationally traded goods.  The need to identify the origin of a good arises from the fact that national and international commercial policy instruments will often accord different types of treatments to goods based on their county of origin.  For example, preferential trade agreements will often grant duty free access to products which originate in any of the countries which are party to the agreement.</P>
    <P>There are two types of origin rules &mdash; preferential and non-preferential.  Preferential rules form an integral part of any preferential trade agreement signed by the EU and Ireland is party to all the Union's trade agreements.  Preferential rules of origin contained in these agreements are published in the Official Journals of the EU.  Non-preferential rules are employed in the implementation of commercial policy instruments such as anti-dumping measures and quantitative import restrictions.  They are also used in compiling trade statistics and in the application of origin marking requirements.  The non-preferential rules of origin which apply in the EU are contained in Articles 22 to 26, inclusive, of the regulation. These articles cover basic origin concepts such as &ldquo;wholly obtained&rdquo; and the last substantial working or processing which confers origin.  In addition, there is a list of origin rules for specific products such as textiles, televisions and car radios.  As a result of the GATT Uruguay round, discussions are currently under way on the harmonisation of all non-preferential rules applying to goods traded by members of the World Trade Organisation.</P>
    <P>The regulation provides for the issuing of certificates of origin prepared by a reliable authority or agency duly authorised for that purpose by the country of issue.  In Ireland, as in most member states, these authorities are the chambers of commerce. <Col N="1539" /> In assessing the suitability of a chamber for authorisation to issue such certificates, chambers must comply with the following requirements: first, affiliation to the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the umbrella body representing all the regional chambers; second, a proven need by exporters for the service in that area; third, the ability to provide an efficient service and fourth, a good understanding of the rules of origin.</P>
    <P>Evidence of non-preferential origin in the form of a European Community Certificate of Origin is only required in a limited number of circumstances and need only be provided when requested by the importing country.  As Minister with responsibility for the internal market, it is important to remember that EU law relating to barriers to trade prohibits manufacturers having to affix labels showing the country of origin of their products, even if the goods come from outside the EU.  Once goods have been imported into the Union and the necessary customs procedures have been complied with, the goods may then circulate freely.  Member states cannot take action to prevent such goods being imported into or exported from their territory.</P>
    <P>I remind the House of our performance as a trading nation in recent years, which provides a remarkable success story.  Exports constitute an increasing share of the economy's total output of goods and services.  They have increased from 60 per cent of GDP in 1985 to 77 per cent in 1995 and it is estimated that last year that share rose <Col N="1540" /> further to over 80 per cent.  As the growth in our GDP becomes increasingly related to our export performance, so do our prospects for expanding employment and improving our living standards. A recent study carried out by An Bord Tráchtála estimates that one in four jobs is now directly dependent on exports.  When indirect influences are taken into account, such as inputs from services, etc., to manufacturing, the ratio is as high as one job in two.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, fair to say that imports represent the opposite side of the exporting coin and, as I have already stated, our export performance results in far more goods and services produced in Ireland being consumed overseas than we import.  It is clear that exports based on open access to markets and the resultant free movement of goods and services play a pivotal role in our economic well being.</P>
    <P>My reply has been general but I now have the details of the matter raised by the Senator.  The Department of Tourism and Trade has a close relationship with Guinness, which sponsors about 2,500 festivals and other community activities throughout the country.  Only last week it was heavily associated with the Celtic Flame festival, which I launched in the Guinness Hopstore.  I will bring the issues raised by Senator Henry to the attention of those in charge of Guinness and I will communicate their response to her.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 5 February 1997.</P>
