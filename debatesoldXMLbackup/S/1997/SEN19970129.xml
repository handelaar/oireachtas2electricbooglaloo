      <P>I have to announce that the following Member has been elected to fill the casual vacancy in the membership of the Seanad to which the Resolution of Seanad Éireann on 17 December 1996 has reference &mdash; Agricultural Panel, Oireachtas Sub-Panel: Denis Naughten.</P>

      <P>It is a source of great pleasure to congratulate and welcome Senator Denis Naughten to the House.  His election is a tribute to the respect and affection in which his late father was held.  It was also a tribute to Senator Denis Naughten.  He was elected in his own right and he has the makings of a first class politician. He is a welcome addition to the House and I wish him well.</P>

      <P>I join the Leader of the House in extending congratulations and good wishes to our newly elected colleague, Senator Denis Naughten.  It has been an eventful week for Denis.  On Monday he was co-opted to Roscommon County Council, yesterday he was elected a Member of Seanad Éireann and today he takes his seat as the newest and youngest Member of the House.</P>
      <P>I wish Denis a long and successful political career.  He follows in a proud and honourable tradition. I had the privilege and pleasure of serving with his father on Roscommon County Council for over 22 years and in the Oireachtas since 1981.  The many well deserved tributes which were paid to the late Liam Naughten are on the record and need not be repeated.  Denis will uphold the same high standards and will serve his area, county, country and party with the same loyalty and dedication as his late father.  I wish him well for the future and I look forward to working with him.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independent Senators, I welcome Senator Denis Naughten to local and national politics.  We wish him the best in his political career, mindful of the sad circumstances which led to this occasion.  The Senator has big footsteps to follow, although I am sure he will tread his own road.  We will offer the Senator every support where we can.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I congratulate Senator Naughten on his resounding success.  He had a comfortable majority and it is nice to see the Naughten name represented in the House.  I wish the Senator well for his term in the Seanad and in his future political career.  I hope it will not be too short a time before he must contest another election, although we all face that prospect in the near future.  I am sure Senator Naughten will be an addition to the House and we look forward to working with him in the future.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome Senator Denis Naughten to the Seanad.  In his father, Senator Naughten has a fine example to follow and I do not doubt that he will fill his shoes extremely well.  I congratulate him on a resounding victory in the election.  I welcome the fact that the Senator is a young Member of the House.  Upper Houses of Parliament tend to be seen as bastions of senior citizens and elder statesmen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I join the Leader and other speakers in welcoming Senator Denis Naughten. I observed him approaching the Cathaoirleach to receive his welcome and I saw the same smile on his face as that of his late father.  I have no doubt Senator Denis Naughten will be a worthy successor. He has the same confidence and smile of his father and, judging by the tremendous support he has received, he might be a strong contender for a seat in the Lower House.  His name will last a long time on the Irish political scene.</P>

      <P>It is a great honour and a privilege to welcome and congratulate Senator Denis <Col N="1379" /> Naughten.  We come from the same constituency and I was a close, personal friend of his father. Denis received a resounding vote.  The Opposition had to put forward a candidate but that is democracy.  I know that they will join with everyone else in wishing Denis well.  I look forward to working with him in this House and in the constituency.</P>

We were on opposite political sides but we always maintained a good personal friendship.  I hope that our two families will be able to continue that tradition.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Cotter that, on the motion for the Adjournment today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funding for the building of a new national school at Urbleshanny, County Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelleher of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to upgrade Cork regional technical college to the status of an institute of technology.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to review the allowances paid to elected councillors introduced in 1995.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to approve the commencement of work on the Kildalkey village sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Trade to introduce regulations to prevent the practice where products which appear to be Irish are, in fact, manufactured outside this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for a new fire station in Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give urgent consideration to have the plans for a new vocational education committee school at Summerhill, Mallow, expedited.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the extension to replace the prefabricated classrooms at Pallaskenry national school, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to outline the funding which will be provided for coastal erosion work in County Clare and the money which is available from the EU for such measures.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Cotter's and Senator Kelleher's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader clarify that tonight's Private Members' business will be in the form of having a proposer, a seconder and so on? I thank the Leader for circulating his intended agenda of legislation and debates between now and Easter.  I welcome next Wednesday's debate on Northern Ireland.  Before the recess I mentioned the recent documents brought forward by the Minister for the Environment on changes in local authorities, particularly budgetary changes. It is important that the House has an opportunity to discuss the role, costings and funding of local authorities before the Minister brings forward legislation to implement these changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be aware that the convergence criteria for European Monetary Union and associated aspects of monetary union have enormous implications for the future of the State. Tomorrow the social partners will adopt the Partnership 2000 document.  It is crucially important that the House debate it in a way in which people will not take the side of a trade union, an <Col N="1381" /> employer or the Government.  We should look at it openly to try to assess how it will impact on inflation, tax improvements and, in particular, employment and unemployment.  It is crucially important that we have an early debate on it.  It will be debated in other places so I do not see why this House does not hold the first debate. It is a matter which affects workers, employers, farmers and every aspect of our lives.  All the main political issues are there.  Will the Leader confirm that there will be a debate on Northern Ireland next week?  The situation has hit a new low since the recess and this issue should be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I note his anxiety for a debate on Partnership 2000.  I support such a debate which would have been important regardless of whether it was adopted.  The Leader has been kind enough to circulate a provisional schedule until Easter.  I note Northern Ireland is to be debated next week.  Will the Leader confirm that such a debate will take place?  It is extremely important in the light of what is happening in Northern Ireland that we debate the matter.  We are all anxious about the trend of events.  It is important that we make statements on that matter.</P>
      <P>Although this matter was discussed to some extent before Christmas, I would like to refer to the Buchanan report on those who received funds from Dunnes.  If a Member of the Seanad is named, will the Leader consider convening the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to deal with that matter?  My party considers it essential that, in view of the time it has taken to deal with this matter, a tribunal of inquiry on the lines of the hepatitis C tribunal would be instituted to deal with it.  Perhaps it is something at which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could look.</P>
      <P>On the legislative programme and the provisional schedule circulated, will the Leader indicate when the Credit Union Bill will come before the Seanad and if the Universities Bill will come before an election?  When will we take the Fisheries (Commissions) Bill, 1997, which has been passed by the Dáil?  It relates to the fisheries board and ensuring that matters are regularised. Will the Leader find time in the next few weeks for statements on agriculture.  It would be appropriate to reopen item No. 17 in the light of the extension to more counties of the ban on Irish beef exports to Russia, the banning of live cattle exports to Egypt, the reduction in export refunds and the revaluation of the green pound.  From all those points of view, it is important that this matter be discussed.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Wright and Senator O'Toole on the matters they raised&mdash; local government and the lead up to European Monetary Union.  Both debates would be useful. It is intended that local government will be discussed at a future date.</P>
      <P>The Children Bill, 1996, published by the Minister for Justice, is extensive legislation and is important in its remit of justice as applied to younger people.  I hope that will be on the Order Paper in this session.</P>
      <P>When will the Control of Horses Act, 1996, become law?  I am not sure it has been signed yet. Most local authorities would like to implement its provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's suggestion that we have a debate on the macro-economic policies to be pursued over the next number of years.  This House could fulfil an effective role in supervising the implementation of European legislation and regulations which will be an important area of responsibility.  In light of the review of European expenditure in 1999, would the Minister for Finance explain how he hopes to adhere to long established disciplines when, under his macro-economic policy as directed in the budget, there will be a projected borrowing increase of 1.5 per cent in a period of peak growth and a rise in the national debt of £2.2 billion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  Will the Minister explain to this House, the public and our European partners how, with an increase in debt service charges of £2.5 billion and public expenditure allowed to run wild, he intends or proposes to manage the discipline of European Monetary Union so that, after 1999, all the benefits we have enjoyed in recent times will still be available to the Irish people?  It is time this House, in the context of the debate Senator O'Toole asked for, addressed these serious issues having regard to the lack of direction in terms of public expenditure, the growth in the debt ratio and the overall growth in the borrowing requirement of £2.5 billion.  The Minister owes this House an explanation as to how he proposes to deal with that.</P>

      <P>I am sure Members will know that the National Economic and Social Forum has published its report, No. 11, dealing with early school leavers and youth unemployment.  All in this House who have participated in debates on the subject will know the importance of this document.  It offers many insights into the difficulties we face.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if he will make time available to discuss the operation of the pub trade, particularly in Dublin, and the licensing laws.  There is a growing tendency to automatically grant late licences.  Some pubs have permanent fluorescent signs advertising late licences, which is not a good idea.  I am asking the Leader to put this on the Order Paper because the noise, public urination, vomiting and rioting is a nuisance for many residents.  Young people are continually being fed drink.  I saw this at the time of the examinations when people of 13 or 14 years of age were staggering around Parnell Street blind drunk and being served by almost every pub in the neighbourhood.</P>

      <P>A question for the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving reasons because it is a matter of urgency.  Two nights ago I took a sleeping pill at 1 o'clock but at 4 o'clock I was woken by the noise in the street outside my house.  A young man was being kicked to death on the ground by three other youths.  I called the Garda but it was 20 minutes before they arrived.  They then dragged them off into Gardiner Place.  I brought a shillelagh with me in case the youths had syringes with them.  When I asked the gardaí were they not going to arrest them, I was told I might be arrested for possession of an offensive weapon.  I pointed out to them that it was every Irishman's right to carry a shillelagh.  I had to make a formal complaint as the gardaí were going to leave the man who was injured on the footpath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will come a time when people will be publicly murdered in this city as a result of the tolerance of drunkenness and the provision of late licences.  When these licences are granted, the <Col N="1384" /> least the Garda should do is to ensure that the publican is on the premises.  There are too many absentee holders of licences.  In view of the growing seriousness of the situation about which many parents and residents are concerned, I ask the Leader for a debate on the licensing laws, particularly in light of the fact that some of these publicans are now seeking an exemption from the anti-discrimination legislation so they can discriminate against groups such as travellers and gay people. They should put their own house in order first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the newspaper industry and, particularly, on the importation of British newspapers.  This is a serious problem because the British newspaper industry is extending its market here, particularly on Sundays.  There is obviously a widespread policy of dumping their newspapers here and this is putting a lot of pressure on national and provincial newspapers.</P>
      <P>We should also have a discussion on the media, particularly after the recent newspaper articles about politicians and their extended families.  We are all aware that someone resigned recently from politics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I am anxious to have a debate on this issue.  We are not trying to muzzle the press, but guidelines should be set or a press council established so that this does not happen again.</P>
      <P>I would also like an opportunity to discuss the extension of the rural policing scheme.  In my area there are still considerable teething difficulties resulting from the rural policing scheme introduced in 1992. Many people are concerned about this extension and we should debate it before it happens in order to encourage consultation at local level and allow the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána an opportunity to hear the views of elected politicians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Leader a number of times to arrange a debate on local authority funding.  I have been a local authority member for a long time and I have never seen such confusion as there is now.  We have no channel of communication with the National Roads Authority: it does what it likes and its employees are &ldquo;the untouchables&rdquo;.  Elected local authority <Col N="1385" /> members are criticised, and rightly so, but they no longer have any function.  Water rates have been abolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Local authorities should be told where they stand&mdash; there is no point the Minister making an announcement and spending the money for them. They are in difficulty at present.  County managers are unable to hold area road meetings until clarity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Enright that a debate is necessary on the Irish newspaper industry and the dumping of British newspapers on this market.  However, far more important is the dominance in the indigenous newspaper market of one group whose influence far exceeds the collective influence of Members of this House. This group can target a person, set him up and take him out.  That is a most unhealthy state of affairs in any democracy so it is time we debated the ownership of the Irish newspaper industry, which is concentrated unfairly in very few hands &mdash;we all know whose hands I am talking about.</P>

      <P>The nurses' strike is due to begin on 10 February.  I have raised this matter in the past and I ask the Leader again to request the Minister for Health to intervene to prevent this strike and reach agreement with the nursing unions and organisations.  The public should not have to suffer a national strike because there are enough problems in the health service already.  It is the wish of this House that every effort be made to reach an agreement with the nurses and prevent a strike which will have to be settled at some point.</P>
      <P>A matter which concerns both the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is the serious demarcation dispute between local authority vets and environmental health officers.  Wholesale and retail fresh meat outlets are not being properly monitored and, according to information received today, prosecutions for breach of the guidelines have not been proceeded with because of that dispute. That is a very serious matter in terms of public health, particularly in light of some recent incidents. Will the Leader of the House bring that matter to the attention of the Minister for Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  My understanding is that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I understand that those two groups are not working together which means that public health could be endangered.  As I said, prosecutions have not been proceeded with.  It is a matter of great public concern which should be resolved.  The public should not have to consume food from outlets which are in breach of the regulations.</P>

I have called for such a debate in the past but the need is now <Col N="1387" /> more pressing due the recent announcement of the abolition of water rates and so forth, which we all welcome.  It is only right and fitting that the Labour Party abolished those rates because it introduced them.  Local authority financing is in total disarray with many anomalies; some counties have refuse charges but others, such as Dublin, do not, which is an imbalance.  It is time for this House to debate local government reform because, while there are fancy booklets about such reform, no funding has been put in place.  It is like a boat without a rudder in the middle of the Atlantic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I soundly condemn the growing tendency of groups to protest noisily outside Ministers' homes at the weekend, which affects the Minister's family and the entire neighbourhood.  My sister lives in the same estimate as the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan), and her life is interrupted every weekend by noisy protesters.  This is unfair.</P>
      <P>I also call for a debate on the Structural Funds as the mid-term review of those funds is now under way.  This House should debate the future of those funds both pre-1999 and post-1999.  Contrary to the comments of Senator O'Kennedy, who seems to think any borrowing is out of the question, many economists believe we should borrow more to provide for our infrastructural needs in 2012.</P>

Apart from those in hospital, thousands of people are on waiting lists for surgery and urgent medical treatment. The Leader is aware of the widespread anxiety and confusion this is causing.  There is now a real risk to life.  If the Minister cannot intervene the Government should call on the services of the ICTU or an independent body to bring both sides together, as has occurred in previous difficult situations. This is a serious matter.</P>

      <Col N="1388" /> Will the Leader record my concern at the treatment of Róisín McAliskey?  I was horrified to listen yesterday to one of our Members of the European Parliament describe the conditions in which a pregnant young woman is being treated. She is subject to regular strip searches.  That can be a traumatic experience for anybody at any time, but it is outrageous for a woman in her state.  It goes beyond what any civilised community should find acceptable.  Will the Leader use his good offices and the Office of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to suggest that if Ms McAliskey must be incarcerated pending the production of whatever evidence and her extradition, it would be more appropriate that it should happen closer to her home?  The present situation is inhumane in the extreme.  I am not aware of the evidence and I do not wish to enter into that debate, but the boundaries of what is acceptable in a civilised society have been transgressed in this case.  I am sure colleagues from all sides of the House share my concern on this mater.</P>

      <P>I support the call for the Minister for Health to intervene, sooner rather than later, in the nurses' dispute.  To discuss the measures to be put in place in the event of a strike is to ignore the crisis facing him.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the Minister's intervention would establish a precedent throughout the public service.  However, if the ICTU was willing to acknowledge that this is an exceptional case, a deal similar to that agreed with the teachers' unions could be effected.  This extremely serious matter can be resolved with the support of the ICTU and the Minister's intervention. It will have to resolved sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to make a statement to the House on the serious situation involving the refusal of a number of Dublin hospitals to undertake what are termed &ldquo;routine smear tests&rdquo; because of the enormous backlog of tests which have not been decided on by the system of due process?  The commitment of the Government is in question if it is decided that such tests can be left in abeyance.  There is no such thing as a routine smear test.  It is incumbent on the Minister to immediately advise the House on what he intends to do about this matter. The screening of women to prevent cancer cases cannot be ignored.</P>

    <P>The debate this evening takes the usual Private Members' format, with a proposer and seconder. The usual time considerations will apply.  I confirm also that the debate on Northern Ireland, which I promised before Christmas, will take place next week.  A full debate on the funding of local government will be held on Ash <Col N="1389" /> Wednesday, 12 February.  I hope there is no coincidence between the date and the topic.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator O'Kennedy requested a debate on Partnership 2000.  Such a debate would be useful and I will talk to the Senators about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked if the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges would be involved if a Member of the House is named in the Buchanan report.  The answer is yes and the necessary procedures will be put in place if that arises.  The Senator also sought an immediate tribunal of inquiry.  I remind him that, legally, such a tribunal can only be established on a specific and grievous matter but, until Judge Buchanan reports, we do not know if a specific or grievous matter exists.  It would prejudge his report to order a tribunal of inquiry into what may or may not happen.  It is reasonable to await his report and if it indicates that a specific or grievous matter requires investigation, there should be a full tribunal of inquiry. A mechanism is in place which is outside the control of the Government and the Houses.  I am sure the judge is working as fast as possible and it is only fair to await his report before moving further.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Credit Union Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is keen to move it as quickly as possible through the other House; it will not be delayed coming before this House. The latest information on the Universities Bill is that I hope it will be completed in the other House in the next two or three weeks.  I will not put any impediments on its way to this House.  I am looking forward to the debate.  It will be magnificent legislation when it has completed its passage through both Houses because there will have been a major parliamentary input.  I am looking forward to the discussion and to making some points which could not have been made previously.</P>
    <P>The fisheries motion mentioned by Senator Dardis will be taken next week.  It was not on the provisional list I circulated because it arrived later.  I will talk to the Senator about a debate on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan raised the Children Bill; I do not have any information on it.  I do not know the commencement date for the Control of Horses Act.  However, I will seek those details. Senator Cotter mentioned the NESC report.  I will consider a debate on that matter.  I would welcome a debate on the issue raised by Senator Norris regarding the organisation of the licensed trade.  Serious issues, such as licensing hours, pricing and late night extensions, are worthy of debate and I would be happy to allow Senator Norris have the second half of the debate which he started today.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright and others referred to the newspaper industry.  I placed the report on the newspaper industry on the Order Paper.  This will provide a structure for such a debate and an allied discussion on privacy, journalistic ethics, <Col N="1390" /> etc.  I would welcome such a debate and I will try to organise it at an early date.</P>
    <P>I replied to Senator McGowan's query.  Senator Finneran and others raised the nurses dispute. Every possible effort will be made to prevent that strike.  I will not say any more than that but I will convey the Senators' concerns to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke mentioned the funding of local government.  Senator Finneran also raised local authority veterinarians and environmental health. A good way to ventilate that matter might be to raise it on the Adjournment.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach would be sympathetic, although I cannot pre-empt his decision.  Senator Kelly sought a debate on Structural Funds and that should be possible this session.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Roche that there is cause for concern about the way the individual he mentioned is being treated.  From the outside, it strikes me that what is happening is unnecessarily brutal and insensitive.  There should be a more humane way of incarcerating a person who is being legally held, as this person is.  I will convey those sentiments to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis raised the postponing of smear tests.  This is an important matter and the most effective way would be to raise it on the Adjournment.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach would be sympathetic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 37 to 40, and in page 6, lines 1 to 3, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and her officials for the extraordinary courtesy and facilities they made available to any Member who showed an interest in this Bill.  It would have been good if we had gone back to when the Dáil committee considered this.  We could have done a lot of work if it had been a joint committee but that is now past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of amendments follow this one directly.  The offending section is subsection (3) of section 1.  It provides that local authorities and health boards will be effectively excluded from <Col N="1391" /> the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, as it will then be, for three years.  There is not only no good reason for that exclusion for three years to become a matter of legislation but there is every good reason why there should be no such exclusion.  There is a compelling need to open the local authorities in particular to closer public scrutiny.  I say this as a member of a number of local authorities and a health board.  The problem is that since the 1940s there has been an inexorable move of power from the local authority members to the management.  In some local authorities there seems to be a very serendipitous arrangement whereby the local authority members and the management keep very closely in touch with each other.  Sadly, there is abundant recent evidence to suggest that matters are not as they should be and that information is not flowing freely within the local authorities, let alone between the local authorities and the general public.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage, I pointed out that a colleague of the Minister of State's, Councillor Cullen, who is chairman of Wicklow County Council, had the courage to take an action in the High Court to discover certain matters relating to lands in Glending in Blessington, County Wicklow. It was to discover what arrangements had been made without the knowledge of the councillors or the public in relation to those lands, and I commend him.  Since that action the local authority has rezoned the lands in question with, at best, possession of partial information.  Since that rezoning, it has become public knowledge that a portion of the lands in question were subject to a study relating to archaeological and heritage remains.  Correspondence between the Office of Public Works, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and Wicklow County Council, my own local authority, would suggest that we can now scrutinise it against the background of the new information we have found.  That suggests that at a minimum the public and the members of the local authority have been fatally misled as to the heritage importance of the site in question.  That should not have happened. It would not have been necessary for a local authority member to take legal against the council if they, as a citizen, had the right under a freedom of information provision to demand access to all information from the county manager.</P>
    <P>This is not unique to Wicklow.  Councillors throughout the country are at breaking point with frustration.  They are being treated in an appalling manner by local government management which has become overbearing and too powerful.  There is a need to return some balance.  There is also a need for the general public to have access to local government and health board proceedings.  The intention is not to threaten the privacy of matters which are properly kept private within the files of the health board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> The Health (Amendment) Bill, which is currently progressing through the Oireachtas, will put the members and executive of the health authorities in exactly the same legal relationship as exists between the members of local authorities and county managers.  There will be functions which will be reserved for the members of the health boards and functions which will be executive or managerial and appropriate to the management of the health authorities.</P>
    <P>There is an abundance of evidence that members of local authorities and health authorities are not kept as fully informed of developments in important areas as they should be.  If the elected representatives are not being kept informed about what is happening in the offices of health authorities or local authorities, what chance have the public?</P>
    <P>There is no compelling reason for excluding local authorities or health authorities for three years from the freedom of information legislation. This is reminiscent of the arguments which were made when the ombudsman legislation was first being discussed.  The contention was that if the health authorities and local authorities were brought into his ambit, there would be such a huge number of complaints that the office would become unworkable.  There is an element of the same argument here, an argument which stands logic on its head.  If there is to be a strong demand for access to information which is in the possession of county councils, corporations, town commissions or other type of local authority, and health boards, then we should open the doors to them.  I do not believe there will be an overwhelming demand for information in these areas except in issues of importance to local communities.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow some years ago I was told by a member of the public that there were secret negotiations between my council and a land owner to purchase a huge site for a dump.  I asked questions at a local authority meeting and was told that there were no such arrangements.  It was suggested that I should not listen to rumours.  I moved a formal motion of section 2 of the 1955 Act because I believed the information I received was less than candid.  There was a formal reply to that motion only after the manager took legal advice as to whether he should put a section 2 motion on the top or the bottom of the agenda. This fuelled my suspicions that something untoward might have been happening.  We got a denial in response to the motion, but three years later, in a motion of discovery in the High Court, we discovered while discussing the contentious issue of siting a dump at Ballinagran, that there were not only discussions between local authority staff and the owner of the lands at Fassaroe, but that the heads of an agreement had been arranged.</P>
    <P>These two cases are not peculiar to Wicklow, similar cases happen in every local authority. Council members who represent the people are being denied access to information and, if they <Col N="1393" /> are being denied access to information, the public is also being denied access.  In Blessington the community council wished to oppose the rezoning of an incredible amount of land.  It is an appalling travesty and I have asked the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to review the manner in which Wicklow County Council has handled it.  Members of the community council found it at least as difficult as members of the elected council to get information relating to the nature of agreements that had been made in our name with the company concerned.</P>
    <P>This offends me because the arrangements were made in my name behind closed doors.  I am an elected representative of the people of Blessington and I represent all the people of Wicklow on the council.  I could not get the information, nor could the Minister of State's colleague, Councillor Cullen, nor could the community in Blessington. A High Court action was required to secure the information.  It is novel for a council member, let alone a council chairman, to feel compelled to go to the High Court to get action. I commend him as it was an act of tremendous courage.  He stood to lose a great deal of money as the action cost £47,000.  What community group could afford to take such an action?  The same problem occurred a few years ago with Luggala when I and other representatives, including Deputy Kavanagh, were misled by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>This is a trend.  There is a disturbing amount of evidence that local authority members are kept in the dark about serious issues and are treated, as somebody in Wicklow inelegantly put it, like mushrooms&mdash;they are kept in the dark and we know what they are fed.  This is causing grave frustration in local authorities.  I will press this amendment because it is a means of assisting colleagues in local authorities to do the job they passionately wish to do but currently do not have the tools or information to do it.  There is discouraging evidence that secrecy is becoming endemic in some local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a further point about the health boards.  There are crises all over County Dublin about the acquisition of property for the use of health boards.  Those crises need not occur if local authorities were open and discussed what is happening with the communities.  The biggest fear communities have is fear of the unknown.  If local authorities and health boards are not willing to be upfront and freely make information available to members of the public, people will expect the worst.  When contractual negotiations are at an advanced stage there will obviously be difficulty in accessing information, but there is sufficient protection in the Bill to ensure that local authorities or health boards will not be disadvantaged if they are included under its provisions.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed by the argument for exclusion of local authorities and health boards.  According to hearsay information, the argument has gone <Col N="1394" /> forward from local authorities to the Department of the Environment that local authorities are in such a chaotic condition they could not withstand the public scrutiny that would result from the implementation of this Bill within three or even six years.  That is nonsense.  I do not believe the local authorities are in such a chaotic condition. If that argument is put forward by a group of managers to the Department of the Environment I hope the Minister will have sufficient strength to say &ldquo;if that is your argument, it is bankrupt and it compels us to open up the local authorities to scrutiny&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business, Members spoke extensively about local government and a debate on that issue has been promised.  We are concerned about the decline of local government. One means of redressing the balance is to ensure that this Bill will apply to local authorities.  If it does, there will not be a huge influx of people into local authorities.  Many of the sensitive local authority files, particularly those relating to planning, are already accessible under existing legislation. Under the 19th century legislation which established our system of local government, there is the widest possible range of access rights for the public to local authorities.  The problem is the local authorities are not prepared to provide such access under current law.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has been willing to accept logical arguments.  I ask her to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>In attempting to draft this amendment I would have gone further than Senator Roche.  Even section 1 (2), which provides that &ldquo;this Act shall come into operation on the day that is one year after the date of its passing&rdquo;, does not go as far as I am prepared to go.  I would have reduced the time period but, on Second Stage, <Col N="1395" /> the Minister of State referred to the difficulties that would be encountered by certain Departments and I am prepared to concede to her argument.</P>
      <P>However, to provide three years for a local authority or health board to come within the remit of the Bill is excessive.  It is particularly excessive in the context of modern communications and the existence of the information highway, computers and other information technology. It is not as if all the documents held in county council offices will be made available.  My reading of the Bill suggests that documents which existed before the implementation of the Bill will not be subject to the same scrutiny as those that are generated after its implementation.  That suggests that, following the commencement date, the onus will be on the local authority to ensure that every file it prepares is properly assembled and accessible to the public.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage the Minister of State said, in the Official Report, 19 December 1996, Vol. 149, column 1293:</P>
      <P>What is contained in the Bill represents the outer limit, that is, that health boards and local authorities will come under its remit by a certain date so there can be no delay beyond that. If it is possible to bring the date forward, we will do so...I will explore bringing forward the date because I agree with the Senators that the sooner we get the information the better.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to deliver on that commitment and accept the amendment.  If section 1 (3) is deleted the local authorities and health boards will be treated in the same manner as other agencies which are expected to comply with the provisions of the Bill within one year of its passing.  That is a reasonable course of action.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable for a local authority, whether it be a county council or district council, or a health board to seek three years grace before complying.  I watched a television programme about the Connemara-Clifden railway recently.  A lady could remember leaving Euston Station in London at 6 p.m. and travelling by train to Holyhead, by boat from Holyhead to Dún Laoghaire and by train from Dún Laoghaire to Clifden and all in less than 24 hours.  If it was possible to do that at the turn of the century one wonders how much progress we have made in the meantime.</P>
      <P>We are treating local authorities like newspapers by giving them a deadline.  My experience as a practising journalist would be that one does nothing until the deadline is very near.  On some occasions the deadline will have passed before one does anything, so the further away the deadline the less activity there will be.  Then there will be a flurry of activity within the last few weeks which we might as well have now rather than in three years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the Minister's intention with this Bill and the difficulties involved in achieving a balance so that we protect private individuals and <Col N="1396" /> sensitive information.  However, this is a &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; Bill.  Yes, we agree that information should be available but those responsible for distributing information will be able to find reasons why they should not do so.  Unless there is a will on the part of these people to disseminate information, be they local authorities or Government Departments, it will be easy for them to find provisions within this Bill to refuse to do so.  Both the Minister and I know that would be undesirable.  The question is: how can we frame legislation to prevent it happening?</P>
    <P>In Scandinavian countries there is an insistence on information being freely available.  We could learn many lessons from them.  It is possible for a citizen in Sweden, and possibly Norway, to see the Prime Minister's correspondence.  This has become a tourist attraction.  We are a very long way from that and it is a direction in which we must move.  To allow three years for a local authority or health board to get their act together is to allow them too much time and this needs to be restricted.</P>
    <P>I endorse Senator Roche's point about the availability of information to members of local authorities.  If they cannot get information then what chance has the ordinary citizen?  Within some sectors of local authorities there are those who are actively obstructing the issuing of information. This must be done away with and the Minister is to be commended if she can achieve this.  I want to improve the Bill to ensure that people will not be allowed to be obstructionist.</P>
    <P>We have to draw a distinction between two groups when it comes to matters of a sensitive nature.  Firstly, there is the individual who is entitled to see what is written about themselves and, secondly, the individual who wants to see what is written about others.  For instance, it should be possible for an individual to see information in a health board file as to whether they are entitled to local authority housing.  However, that file should not be available to members of the public.  I realise that sections of the Bill attempt to achieve this balance.  I know from meetings of my local authority where houses are being allocated subject to the advice of the health board and county council officials, that information can be very delicate.  There have been calls for the press to be admitted to these meetings but these calls have been properly rejected. The information discussed should only be available to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment as it is probably the only way to ensure that local authorities respond.  Let us consider the Title of the Bill:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An Act to enable members of the public to obtain access, to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy, to information in the possession of public bodies...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first public body that any individual will <Col N="1397" /> come into contact with is their local authority.  Far from giving an out to any local authority or health board in a Bill as important as this, local authorities should be giving the lead and showing other agencies that information can and must be made available.</P>
    <P>Everyone elected to local authorities has great expectations and hopes of achieving what their predecessor failed to do.  Most councillors come up through community councils or residents associations and we attended public meetings where local councillors were unable to answer questions posed by the public.  In my experience, and the Minister's is similar, we all intended taking on and breaking the managment system of this structure.</P>
    <P>I served with the Minister and saw her ability, tenacity, courage and strength in trying to break down barriers in Dublin County Council.  She was a member before I was elected and I used to go into the public gallery in O'Connell Street and watch business being conducted.  The Minister was one of the more formidable councillors in tackling management.  However, I also saw her frustration in trying to access information and effect change in the council's way of thinking. That situation still pertains, if to a lesser degree.</P>
    <P>The system of appointing managers to the Dublin local authorities has changed, so the managers know they have a fixed tenure in office of five or seven years.  They do not seem to be holding on to control to the same degree as before, yet they still do to some extent.  At committee meetings at which deputy managers and principal officers attend there is a strong tendency to keep control of the information that councillors are looking for.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the new Dublin authorities took place in less than two years.  The announcement was made in 1992 and, as far as I remember, there was a fixed period of two years.  The authorities were born on the 1 January 1995.  If entire local authority structures for Dublin could be set up within two years, there is little reason to allow a further three year period for compliance after the year allowed for in the legislation.  The Minister is indicating that it is three years in total.  If we could create three new authorities and break down a 78 member council in less than two years we could certainly see all authorities conform to the provisions of this Bill within a year.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned, local authorities are very modern in the way they conduct their business and most are computerised.  The sections to which one might go, including public areas and the offices, are computerised and people are familiar with technology.  I do not understand the reason for allowing this, although the Minister will say it does not mean they have three years but that they have that time in which to complete their business.  It is possible that a number of local authorities will do so.</P>
    <P>My local authority, Fingal County Council, held a conference yesterday on strategic management initiatives which, unfortunately, I was not <Col N="1398" /> able to attend.  The concept behind it was responding to the needs of the community and residents in the fastest and most effective way. It is possible that Fingal County Council, Dublin Corporation or Wicklow County Council may decide to take the lead.  It is also possible that a number of local authorities will drag their feet and at the end of the three years may come back to the Minister of State looking for a way out and may cite lack of finance.  This House will have a debate on local government funding in the next week or two.  The standard answer to any question is that due to lack of funding, it is impossible to respond to the question or that resources are not available.  Local authorities which are sluggish about doing their business will cite lack of finance and will come back to the Minister of State and say that if she provides them with extra finance, they will comply.  Those who feel good about this legislation will do their business.</P>
    <P>This has happened in local authorities in relation to the provision of accommodation for travellers with which the Minister is familiar. Local authorities which felt it was their duty and that they had a responsibility to provide accommodation for travellers did so while those who did not did nothing and no penalties were imposed on local authorities who would cite many reasons for not providing accommodation.</P>
    <P>The cases to which Senator Roche referred are not unique to Wicklow County Council.  A Green Party member of my local authority took a case to court on the landfill site in Kill and, having lost, is still paying the cost to the local authority. It is a brave local councillor who will take on such a task and I take my hat off to those who do so.</P>
    <P>There are communities which, for their own reasons, challenge everything a local authority does and I do not hold them in high esteem.  Such challenges are not usually due to a lack of information but to try to prevent something being done.  There are communities in severely disadvantaged parts of Dublin and rural areas who do not have a halfpenny to take a case to court. These communities invite councillors and public representatives, such as myself, to public meetings to tell us what is happening in their area because they do not have the clout and finance to beat it.  In a number of cases, one is hard pressed to believe that what they are saying is not true.  Sometimes what is happening in their community may not be as bad as feared but the rumour and innuendo associated with a lack of information will leave those in disadvantaged areas feeling that local authorities have no respect for them and that anything can be foisted on them.  Senator Roche cited as examples landfill sites and the provision of local authority accommodation and traveller accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State will recall asking her county manager &mdash; I know I did &mdash; about the acreage and location of land within the ownership of Dublin Corporation in Dublin County Council's administrative area.  That information <Col N="1399" /> was governed by the Official Secrets Act and we could not be told the acreage of land.</P>

      <P>They knew about every blade of grass, but under no circumstances could we see a map.  I thought there was something very sensitive about maps but when the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1994, came into effect, maps were lashed out like confetti at a wedding and members were told the value of the land.  There was no revolution; nothing happened.  Although Dublin Corporation sold as much land as it could in the interim, this information was provided to the three local authorities overnight.  Dublin Corporation is still carrying out its business and made £11 million in the process.  That is an indication of the stupidity and nonsense of a local authority system where managers dictate what can be made available to members and residents.  There is a suggestion, which is hard to believe, that the manager's association dictated this subsection.  The Minister should give the lie to that and agree to the amendment deleting the subsection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every Senator, I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  I was not going to speak on this amendment because I am not a member of a local authority or a health board but listening to speakers, I have been shocked to discover that members of those authorities cannot find out what is being done in their name.  Before I listened to those speeches, I had some sympathy with these deadlines.  I manage a department, although it is not a local government one, and I would hate to be asked to put my finger on a great deal of that information tomorrow morning. I rationalise that on the grounds that the busier, more thrusting and innovative the department, the less time it has to keep its files in order, but that is not a justification to carry it that far in other areas and I do not want to rest the defence of these figures on such an assumption.</P>
      <P>What bothers me about the three years, and even the year&mdash;because I take Senator Dardis's point on that&mdash;is that underlying this Bill and crucial to its success is what many speakers said on Second Stage and what Brendan Ryan said about keeping us in the dark and so on, that is, that we are essentially dealing with a change of culture and attitude.  In a sense, these are details which must be co-ordinated to try to drive forward that change of attitude as far as possible. The moment one relaxes on detail, one allows those who do not want to change to find an exit route from the thrust, intention and principles behind the Bill.  It is, therefore, important to scrutinise any detail of this type which appears to be slowing down the momentum which the Bill is intended to generate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an educational process which some people will welcome.  Others will have to be dragged into accepting that this is the way we look at things. <Col N="1400" /> Instead of the assumption that, unless the information can be prised out of a person it has to remain secret, it must be that information should be freely available unless a strong case can be made against that.  Senator Dardis and others referred to good cases and I agree with the reasoning that this should not be legislation which will allow every busybody in the country to stick their nose into everybody else's affairs; there are plenty people of that sort around.  It is important to keep the pressure on and not relax it.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister of State for information because, not being a member of these bodies, I do not know exactly how they work.  It strikes me that the one year mentioned in section 1(2) is fairly generous.  Has thought been given&mdash;I presume it has&mdash;to not having blanket figures and deadlines where all information would become available simultaneously and nothing would become available until all becomes available? In other words, there must be priorities&mdash; Senator Roche spoke a great deal about property &mdash;in terms of public interest and so on.  If local councils or health boards are told a category must become available by a particular date, there is consistency across the country in what categories are prioritised.  Surely it will not take three years for everything to become available or even one year in terms of section 1(2)?  Is there scope in terms of priority and category for establishing a reasonable deadline for different categories in light of assumed public demand and the Minister's experience?</P>
    <P>There should be regular publicity about the pace at which councils and boards achieve the targets so that the best to the worst can be listed. The worst could then be asked why they could not keep pace.  Why can some impetus not be given?  It could become an achievement for a local authority to implement the provisions of this legislation as quickly as possible as opposed to dragging out matters as long as possible.  Maybe that is fantasy or naive, but I ask those who have experience of these matters to say why some form of achievement record could not be built into this Bill.  Maybe there is some area which is so difficult as to require three years.  I am sure there is and that a case could be made for it, but surely not for every area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that all county managers be sent to UCC to Senator Lee for a lecture. He has made the point well that we need a change in culture more than legislation to persuade people to consider it a virtue to move forward rather than trying to delay as long as possible. Perhaps Senator Lee would consider giving a special course for managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking account of what Senator McGennis said about the Minister's record in local government and what I know of her as well, she would not have inserted such a timeframe into the Bill and would have made it shorter if she could.  I presume <Col N="1401" /> there are good reasons why the figure of three years is in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <P>I hope this debate will strengthen her hand in negotiating with whomever she has to, be it the Department of Health, the Department of the Environment, or whoever. Everyone in this House, especially those who are members of local authorities and health boards, wants to see this legislation applied to those bodies as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that, as Senator Roche said, legislation already exists which should give us much of the information withheld from us.  If the councillor Senator Roche mentioned, Councillor Cullen, won his case in the High Court, I presume it was on the basis of existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the judgment was made on the basis of legislation.  We often do not know that we are already entitled to a substantial amount of information.  I only recently discovered after 12 years as a member of a local council that I was entitled to a considerable amount of information which I did not know I could obtain.</P>
      <P>In my local authority it is extremely difficult to get access to its legal department and to get a law agent to attend a meeting with councillors and respond to their questions.  It is like trying to pull teeth to get that department to be forthcoming. A cultural change is certainly needed in local authorities and the purpose of this legislation, aside from its detail, is to do that.  I challenge Senator Dardis on his assertion of it being &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; legislation.  It is not.  It is being specific about what is exempted so that people cannot hide behind generalities which can be quoted to prevent information being given.  The point is that it is as precise as it can be in its wording.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns expressed and assume that the timeframe exists for a specific reason.  I would welcome if the Minister could work any miracles on it during the course of the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a member of a local authority or a health board but I am a citizen of this country and know to my cost that freedom of information is not so free.  Cavan County Council charge £1 per page for photocopying in the planning office and this has cost me a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am already on record as stating that this legislation cannot go far enough and, in my experience, cannot be implemented soon enough.  To have a delay of between one and three years, whatever the reason, begs the question of what these people have to hide.  It cannot simply be a matter of reorganisation of office structure or whatever in order to make information available to citizens.  I fail to see why there should be that delay and fail to see the relevance in any argument <Col N="1402" /> put forward by or on behalf of local authorities or health boards.</P>
    <P>I will give two examples.  In County Monaghan, I live beside the Killarney of the north, Lough Muckno Leisure Park.  It is owned by the county council, which decided in secret committee to lease it to an English registered company for what is reported to be a fairly nominal fee.  It is actions such as this, which to this day remain unexplained to the people of Castleblayney, which I question. That no one can be forced to give information about it to the citizens of the town seems extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Another example of a litany which I could give is in County Cavan, where the county council&mdash; at whose behest I do not know &mdash; took the fisheries board to the Supreme Court stating that it had no right to seek to have the county council obey or implement the laws relating to pollution control in the county.  Some of the councillors, when I asked them, were not aware that a case was taken on their behalf.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the nature and history of this State has been to give more power to individuals who are not answerable to the public and to take it away from those who are, politicians.  A county manager in my constituency was able to say to someone, &ldquo;You're only,&rdquo; I will not quote the next word, &ldquo;passing through and I'm here for life&rdquo;.  If we have one man running each county with whatever vision, or lack of it, he may have, deciding on what land may be bought and used for housing stock, deciding on planning in the county, whether he has planning qualifications or not, it seems to me there is no democracy.  For that reason it is most important that freedom of information legislation be introduced to allow citizens access to the information to which they are entitled.  I cannot state it more strongly than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The aspect which has distinguished all contributions so far is the absence of any political motivation behind the arguments advanced.  That, I am glad to say, has often been a feature of debates in this House.  I did not serve with the Minister on Dublin County Council, but long before she arrived here I recognised her as a crusader on these matters.  I also noticed that Senator Lee, in making his objective contribution &mdash; he is not involved in local authorities &mdash; was amazed that such a system should prevail.  He asked the Minister if county councils have to wait a certain period from the day this legislation is passed to release every file and piece of information. I understand from the Minister's reaction that is not the case.  As a local representative in Dublin, she is a noted crusader for the rights of the underdog, so we should reserve our position until we hear her response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Roche's comments about the experience of local representatives.  My local authority overcame this problem many years before Wicklow County Council did.  Legislation already exists under which the local authority can <Col N="1403" /> be compelled to give information to its members and to the public.  However, when we told the local authority about the Application of Enactments Act, 1898, we were still refused the information. It was not until the council's law officer told the executive it was attempting to defend the indefensible that things changed.  I have no doubt the original file was a bulky one.  However, by the time it was made available to the public, it was much smaller.  The job was not done thoroughly because correspondence was missing from it. After approximately four months the file returned to its original size.  That Act stated that members of the public could get information provided they came during certain specified hours and paid one shilling.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that new legislation must be put in place as quickly as possible.  I will wait to hear the Minister's reply because I believe she will endeavour to ensure that the public is not kept waiting until the last day of the period and that prioritisation will be introduced.</P>
    <P>Two excellent officials in my local authority, who are both retired, were in charge of two sensitive areas in the authority but they would not supply information to members of the public under any circumstances.  Time after time they were told to get out of the offices.  They then asked me and other local representatives to get the information for them.  When I telephoned the officials, I was given the information which I then relayed to the persons who had requested it.  These officials believed that the public should not be given such information and this created many problems.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and health boards will need time to organise themselves.  I ask the Minister to keep the legislation as short as possible.  Members want the best from this legislation and the points made here today have not been made to gain political advantage.</P>

      <P>I share everyone's impatience to enact this legislation as quickly as possible.  Like Senator Howard and others, I was horrified by some of the examples we heard from Wicklow County Council.  I served under a slightly less secretive management structure in Dublin County Council, although I recall one occasion when we sent for the law agent&mdash;it was his only time in the chamber&mdash;and he fainted and was taken away in an ambulance.

      <P>It is particularly important this week to reassure Senator Dardis that personal privacy is strongly protected by this Bill. People will not be able to see private information about other people.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee put his finger on it when he mentioned the culture of secrecy which has existed for 75 years.  It is a culture with which I have battled at central Government level in my efforts to gain acceptance for this Bill.  We decided not to draw up two separate Bills for central Government and local government.  I would not be here today with this Bill, and I might not be before you for another year or two, if we had undertaken the same detailed consultation we had with the Departments with the local authorities and health boards.  We consulted since June 1994 when I sent my first memoir to Government and to 18 Departments.  At that stage there was only a commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to examine it.  It took us from then to last December to publish the Bill.  If we had consulted 118 local authorities and eight health boards, this legislation would not be before us today.</P>
      <P>We have secured agreement from the Departments. I hope that health boards and local authorities, particularly those which display the culture of secrecy we have heard about in Wicklow County Council, will use the period after the publication of this Bill to make preparations.  I regard three years as an outer limit.  I also hope that as people see openness in the mainstream Civil Service and the ancillary bodies mentioned in the First Schedule, and with cross party political will, these barriers and the culture of secrecy will begin to fall.</P>
      <P>Local authorities and health boards must do their homework because the day this Bill is passed and signed into law by the President, a clock will start ticking to put it into effect.  Public bodies, therefore, must take important steps before the people are given the legal right to see files.  Under section 15 they must compile detailed manuals of the type of information they have. Under section 16 they must codify all the internal rules and regulations and publish them.  Anybody who is denied a benefit, grant or pension because there is a secret rule, guideline or interpretation which they did not know about will have a legal right to have any disability against them redressed.  That is a powerful and important task and we looked carefully at how quickly it could be done.  Those two legal duties must be in place for every public body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third and fourth matters are of a practical nature; they are not specifically legal requirements as the provisions of sections 15 and 16 are but they must happen if this Bill is to work.  A public body operating under the Bill must have its information systems in order and must train its staff.  Many of us have experience of the regulations on access to information on the environment or have read in the Ombudsman's report about what a disaster they have proved to be for the public.  There is a dialogue of the deaf <Col N="1405" /> between people looking for information and those whose job it is to provide it.  There was no change in culture and no preparation or homework was done, so although people had legal rights they were unable to exercise them.  We want to ensure that this works from the first day because, if it does not, there will be rumblings in the bowels of public administration to the effect that this legislation is a nuisance which is not worth a candle and so it should be rolled back. That would an enemy of the openness which everyone in this Chamber wants to achieve.  I want to ensure that this works well.</P>
    <P>The 12 month lead-in time was chosen carefully after speaking to people from other countries with similar models of Government which had brought in this type of legislation.  We talked to officials from Canada, New Zealand and Australia and to people who had studied this process, such as Mr. Robert Hazel of the Nuffield Foundation, who had conducted a study of the introduction process.  We took careful advice about how quickly to introduce the provisions.  I am impatient about this legislation and if I had been told it could be introduced in six months that would be the time period in the Bill, but we were told this was the minimum.  In Australia, for example, it was 21 months before the manuals were ready, so people had a legal right but it was not backed up with information about what was available and could be found.  The lead-in period has been pared to the minimum, which is 12 months.</P>
    <P>We have yet to do the consultation work with the local authorities, but I was not going to speak to 118 local authorities and eight health boards before publishing my Bill.  They will have a specific task to get themselves in order.  In particular they will have to codify rules and regulations, which can be about everything from septic tanks to housing applications to rules about square footage in housing projects.  There is a great deal of homework to be done.</P>
    <P>I want this to be in place as quickly as possible. The three year period is intended as an outer limit.  Bodies will know they should not simply wait.  They must do this work and if they drag their heels they must introduce the provision in three years, come hell or high water.  In the spirit of the forthcoming local government reforms, which are greatly concerned with openness, information and empowering councillors, I hope that people get on with their work and will have this done sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Lee's point about categories of information which might be brought in earlier.  If there are and if local authorities are ready to start earlier, that should happen.  These periods are envisaged as outer limits.  The alternative was to make this a Bill for central Government alone&mdash; and I do not think anyone wants that&mdash;which is why I did it in this way.  I am considering whether it can be done more quickly.  I am continuing discussions with my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Health, and I <Col N="1406" /> am confident that there are certain classes of information which we can bring in sooner and I may be able to return to that on Report Stage. At a practical level, this sets an outer limit and if we can bring the dates forward, if all of us work on the &ldquo;softening up&rdquo; process and if the homework is done in the local authorities, we will be able to apply the provisions earlier than three years.  My strong personal commitment is to get this into action as quickly as possible because the examples given by Senators show how badly it is needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said she had battled with the culture of secrecy, but to what extent has she won that battle?  In certain quarters of the public services there is a perception that, apart altogether from it being a matter of right, it is not even good for citizens to be able to acquire the information.  As I said on Second Stage, this is a distasteful vestige of colonialism that should be rooted out&mdash;the idea that the people are not entitled to know, that one could not trust the natives to govern themselves and that it is good for a benevolent power far across the seas to bring Christianity and white rule to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not given a plausible reason why the period applying to local authorities should not be less than three years.  The consequence of this is that it is local authority members who are responsible, not the officials. Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;director&rdquo; means a director (within the meaning of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990) but includes, in the case of a local authority or health board or any other public body ... a person who is a member of it or a member of any board ...</P>
      <P>That appears to mean that it is not the county manager who will be responsible but local authority members; and if that is the case, local authority members unanimously want this matter brought forward.  The Minister made a distinction between central and local government which may exist, but that does not mean the delay has to be three years.  Section 3 (1) (c) states:</P>
      <P>if, during the first 3 years of application of this Act to a public body specified in subparagraph (3), (4) or (5) of paragraph 1 of the First Schedule [those are the bodies we are talking about], any difficulty arises in bringing this Act into operation in so far as it applies to that body, [the Minister may] by regulations do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for bringing this Act into operation in so far as it applies to that body and regulations under this paragraph may, in so far only as may appear necessary for carrying the regulations into effect, modify a provision of this Act if the modification is in conformity with the purposes, principles and spirit of this Act [.]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may mean the Minister could force them to do things more quickly, but it could also mean <Col N="1407" /> they would be allowed to delay the matter further.  I am subject to correction on that and the Minister is shaking her head vigorously, but I think it possible to take that interpretation.  It would not be the Minister's intention to extend it beyond the three year period but it is possible under the Bill.</P>
    <P>In my earlier contribution on this amendment I mentioned the point about when the legislation becomes relevant to a particular record.  Section 6 (1), the most important provision of the Bill, states:</P>
    <P>every person has a right to and shall, on request therefor, be offered access to any record held by a public body and the right so conferred is referred to in this Act as the right of access.</P>
    <P>That is the principle of the Bill, as we alluded on Second Stage.  Section 6 (4) states:</P>
    <P>The records referred to in subsection (1) are records created after the commencement of this Act and records created during such period (if any), or such time (if any), before such commencement as may be prescribed, after consultation with other members of the Government, and references in this Act to a record shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>Again, it seems the records which will be relevant in the case of a local authority are those which are created after the commencement of the Act. If that is the case I do not see why it could not start in the morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed by the Minister of State's response.  Senator Lee referred to a form of competition between our colleagues in local authorities.  The result of such a competition would be a dead heat.  The reality is that the local authority managers would bring the Act into operation in the last minute of the last hour of the last day by which it had to come into operation.</P>
      <P>Many Members expanded on interesting case histories and examples of local authority recalcitrance. I was struck, in particular, when Senator Gallagher said she failed to see why it would take two years to make information available.  Senator Howard pointed out there is a legal basis at the moment on which much of this information should be available.  The fact it is not available is indicative of how extraordinarily deeply ingrained it is within the local management culture, and within some parts of the local council culture, to deny members information on which they can act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept, as Senator O'Sullivan said, that one could go to the High Court to challenge the manager. However, I do not have the resources to go to the High Court to challenge my manager because if the manager wins the case I will have to pay the costs; however, if the manager loses the case the council pays the costs.  It is an extraordinarily unequal competition.  For example, the <Col N="1408" /> Green Party councillor in Dublin who tried to seek information and to represent the public was subjected to very severe penalties, running to tens of thousands of pounds.  As we all know, legal teams representing local authorities are always well padded out and money is never an object. While the local authority might not have money to fill potholes, provide lights or fix a leaking bathroom tap, it can always find money for the whims of the county manager.  I am sure that is not unique in Wicklow; it is an endemic fact of life throughout local authorities that the councillors count for nothing.  We should strike a blow for councillors.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said, in reference to the negotiations which went on between her officials following consultations with other Departments, that agreement had been secured.  The reality is that we are legislators and we have to decide the right course of action.  There is no compelling argument which can be put forward to prevent this Bill applying to local authorities from the most current date.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to section 15. The provision of a reference book will be very helpful, particularly to students of public administration. It will be marvellous to have some categorisation of what information is available and how to get it.  It will be particularly beneficial to academic research.</P>
    <P>However, we are not primarily concerned here with academic research.  We are concerned with a culture which is hell bent on denying access to the commonplace.  Professor Paddy Lynch of UCD once suggested that one of the features of the Irish public service was that it guarded its most commonplace file as if it contained the last copy of the secret of eternal youth.  Why should any discussions between my local authority, on behalf of the citizens of Wicklow, and a major corporation be secret?  There is no reason for me or any other citizen not knowing what is being done in our interest, if that is the case.  It is being done in our name without our knowledge.  Putting together the facts relating to cases could not be so complex that it would require three years to do.</P>
    <P>If the three year clause is allowed to stand, notwithstanding what has been said about this being the outer limit, I will press this issue; it will probably be the only issue I press today.  If this is allowed to stand it will be carved in granite.  Local authority officials, who have a lifetime vocation of denying councillors fundamental information, will bring the Act into operation on the last possible day of the third year.  There is no compelling legal problem with any local authority which is interested in public service or making information available for so doing.  The reality is that the current denial is evidence that the only problem exists in the minds of men and women who fill senior positions in some of our local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>No argument has been put forward here on why I should not press this amendment.  I am not <Col N="1409" /> denying there will be some difficulties.  However, it would not take even the biggest local authority three years to order its files and make people aware of the truth.  What can there be on the files to hide?  This is not a Masonic confraternity but the Irish public service and local authorities which exist to serve the people.  Denying people information in the possession of those authorities cannot be in the public interest.  It cannot be accepted and I am not accepting it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to remove the three year clause because one year is more than sufficient. The reality is that information currently in the possession of local authorities is, in law, supposed to be instantaneously accessible.  As Senator Howard said, under the 1898 Act a citizen, on the payment of a fee not more than one shilling, has the right to request this information. However, that right is currently denied unless a citizen is prepared to take legal action.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>All we are asking is that the current legal arrangements should apply.  Those laws continued to apply when this State came into operation. They did not go out of effect until county managers got too much power and the balance moved from the democratically elected to the non-democratically appointed.  We have heard examples of what should not be allowed to happen from councillors from all over the country.  I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment and to tell the local authorities they have one year to comply with the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if there was not a vote because there is greater unanimity on both sides of the House on what is desirable in regard to this issue than on any other recent issue. However, if there was a vote I would have to support the amendment on the basis of what I have heard so far.  Speaking from a position of ignorance, I wish to put to the Minister of State some of the implications I draw from what Senators Dardis and Roche said.</P>
      <P>They made the point that, under section 6(4), this Bill only applies to records to be subsequently created and not to records which now exist.  I was taken aback by that because I have tabled an amendment to extend it to other records.  If it is the case that only records which are to be created come under the aegis of the Bill &mdash;I am simply repeating the point made by Senator Dardis&mdash;what is the difficulty with making those records available from a very early date, so that the ethos of organising them in a way which will facilitate access to them can be inculcated from the outset?  It is not a case of every record in the possession of the local authorities being made available in identical form straightaway. Will the Minister of State clarify if that is the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that if some local authorities drag their heels and do not meet the deadline, they will have to come in after three <Col N="1410" /> years.  However, if they drag their heels what will they come in with after three years?  Presumably, they will be starting from scratch if they have postponed these matters and have not begun to internalise the culture of openness.  If they are doing it against their will they will be obstructive and will not be in a position to grant open access to their files.  It will begin when it can be implemented, which may take longer than three years.  What would be the time limit in that situation and why should they not continue to drag their heels?</P>
    <P>Sticks and carrots can be used where people are obstructive.  What sticks and carrots have the Minister of State and the Government?  If there is no other language they understand why not begin to use the financial resources from the outset to get them thinking along these lines now, rather than indicating that penalties will only be applied if nothing has been done after a lapse of three years?</P>
    <P>From the outset, the mentality should be imposed with the sentiment that the culture is changing.  It has been said that from the day the Bill passes they will begin to think along these lines, but they should have been doing this at least from 19 December 1996, when the Minister of State introduced the Bill to the House.  That mindset should already begun to have changed. If the incentive is there it should begin to operate henceforth.</P>
    <P>I see no reason, unless it can be shown that in practice it is impossible, why categories cannot be established&mdash;the Minister of State said it may be possible to establish classes on Report Stage &mdash;with deadlines, incentives and disincentives for their achievement.  In this way an attempt should be made to make it clear to the 118 authorities, or whatever number of them are recalcitrant, that this is serious business and that the pressure will be kept on them.  General elections will occur and sentiments may be expressed that these pressures may reduce with a change in Government.  If one is serious one must begin the process now and not wait for three years.</P>
    <P>I take the point about deadlines.  I dabble in journalism and am not unfamiliar with the culture of the deadline.  It applies to all organisations where change, some of it unwelcome, is being pressed.  The earlier the deadline the earlier that changes are made.  The modalities of the implementation are probably very important.  Much time and thought should be devoted to this, which should begin now, not when there has been heel dragging for three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These standard sections, which are included for a limited period, are <Col N="1411" /> offered by the parliamentary draftsman to deal with technical misprints that tend to creep into even the best proof read legislation.  It is not possible under that kind of technical section to do something that would be so contrary to the purpose of the Bill as set out in the Long Title, which is to open up information, rather than give anybody an extension beyond the three years.  If a local authority refuses information after three years the information commissioner becomes operative.</P>
      <P>Section 6(8) sets out the principle that nothing in the Bill shall stop people giving information which they would be obliged to give or which it would be good practice to provide, other than information which would be illegal for them to give.  That is backed up by section 38, which provides a power to the information commissioner to report on this.  It attempts, therefore, to push out the boat, even in advance of bodies becoming included under the terms of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee asked if the information to be made available is only prospective information. When a body is designated, all current files, all personal information files, including those going back over time, and all information needed to understand a current file are included.  A current file and its history becomes included, as does full personal information files.</P>
      <P>However, the onerous administrative task will be to organise circulars, internal routes and guidelines.  A big financial penalty will apply if this is proceeded with incorrectly.  This will take time to organise.</P>
      <P>I will consider the extent to which we can bring forward categories of information for Report Stage.  I have examined this very carefully. Members will know my personal commitment to pushing out the boat as far as it can go with regard to these matters.  I have done this in the Bill.  The period of three years is an absolutely outer limit.  The only restrictions are those governed by practicalities to make access to information as good as can be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that there is unanimity, I wish to accommodate the Minister of State and not be divisive.  I will introduce a similar amendment on Report Stage because it entails a principle which is the core issue in the Bill.  It is only fair to give the Minister of State an opportunity to introduce an amendment on Report Stage that would reduce the categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of this legislation from day one would be in respect of current files.  The numbers of current files held by local authorities are not huge.  There is no reason why they should not be fully accessible from day one.  Councils already have codes for matters such as septic tanks, planning, rules for house, by-laws, planning decisions and so on.  All of these are subject to some kind of code.  They must be written down in law, which does not present difficulties.  The Minister of State's officials should look at these between now <Col N="1412" /> and Report Stage and agree that such issues should come into operation from day one.</P>
    <P>While I do not accept that it should be the case that there are other issues on which it will be more difficult for local authorities to proceed, if it can be shown to me that this is so, I will not press matters.  However, it should be made clear that matters must proceed from the designated dates.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why housing applicants to local authorities should not be able to see their files and see why they are not getting the same priority as others.  It is wrong and unjust that this pertains.  We should not condone injustice.</P>
    <P>I will not press the amendment because we have had a lengthy discussion and there is unanimity. However, if it is in order, I will put down the same amendment on Report Stage.</P>

It may take me three years to find something in my own Department, but it would not take me three years to know under what guidelines I was trying to find it.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis referred to difficulty in understanding the text.  It reaches the outer limits of obscurity.  I do not know whether the outer limits were further in earlier examples but I do not believe the resources of the English language&mdash; to say nothing of another language &mdash; do not permit clearer legislation.  The irony is that we are discussing freedom of information, in which access to and clarity of information is one of the principles involved, but some of us have great difficulty understanding some of the drafting.</P>

      <P>The Senator is correct.  Many people, including several Senators and Senator Roche is pre-eminent among them, have argued for years in print, academically and politically <Col N="1413" /> about the importance of trying to enhance the role of local government.  If that role is to be enhanced, parity of access to information is essential for citizens at local and national level.  It is important there is not a two tier system in terms of citizens' esteem for the services rendered by the two levels of government.  Anything which distinguishes them should be avoided if possible. An integral part of enhancing the role of local government is to try to ensure its conformity and that, if possible, it responds positively so it does not need to be constantly kicked regarding the principles involved in this area.  This is another reason for keeping up the pressure.</P>

      <P>This amendment is technical. Provision is already in place in section 12(1)(b) and (g) to enable transcripts to be provided. There is a vague danger if the section remains as it stands that people might be given transcripts when they are seeking photocopies and this might delay the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment relates to section 12(1)(b) under which a public body may give access by giving a statement in writing of the information concerned.  This gives the body huge scope to provide a précis or an abbreviated version of the information.  I realise the difficulty in this area.  An example is when the Kill anti-dump group, following the public inquiry, arrived at the Department of the Environment with almost a lorry load of material.  We must have some sense but my amendment proposes deleting &ldquo;statement&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;transcript&rdquo;, if that is what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement in writing allows public bodies huge scope to condense to an unacceptable degree the information sought.  I suspect this is the reason for the deletion in section 2 of the definition of copy including a transcript.  I understand it imposes an onus but I would prefer it to <Col N="1414" /> be imposed rather than the possibility to circumvent the intention of the Bill by allowing local authorities or other public bodies to provide the person requesting the information with a very condensed version of it.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 18, to delete &ldquo;(e) or (f)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(e), (f) or (g)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point about the complexity of the legislation arises again regarding this amendment.  The difficulty of getting around the Bill which is about creating access to information is extraordinary.  It is a complex area but it is not a reflection of recalcitrance on the part of the drafters.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is clearer when one considers amendments Nos. 52 and 53.  The logic then becomes obvious.  As I said on Second Stage, many bodies have been conferred with certain statutory powers and functions, such as the Law Society, the Bar Council and the various medical registration boards.  I am not sure if I mentioned the other example of adoption agencies but I intended to refer to them in deference to Senator McGennis.  Many of these agencies were conferred with statutory functions under various enactments and it is fundamentally important that they are included.  I will be controversially upfront about this matter because, if we are discussing freedom of information, we must be clear about what we are doing.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the Law Society and the Bar Council, which have played ducks and drakes with people's rights and lives for so many years, are open to public scrutiny.  I mentioned the case of a young couple&mdash;I am not supposed to mention names&mdash;in Greystones who are languishing in limbo because people in the Law Society are prepared to juggle with their lives in a way which I find disgusting.  Since I last mentioned the case, the argument involving a number of solicitors, in which this innocent couple is involved, has reached the Supreme Court because the barrister who was originally briefed by their solicitor to represent them turned around and represented the other side and the Bar Council will not get involved.  It is extraordinary because the young couple recently discovered that a character in the Bar Council who was handling their case will be in charge of the committee which will examine the grievance about the way that august body mishandled their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a clear conspiracy between the Law Society and the Bar Council to grind my constituents into the ground and I will not accept it.  I am <Col N="1415" /> sure if any other Member of this or the other House faced the same set of circumstances they would too would take umbrage at the way these people operate.  If a non-statutory agency has been entrusted in law with any power or authority, on accepting that power or authority it must also make itself liable to be as open, transparent and accountable as any statutory agency.  I thank the Minister for her assistance because I know she and her officials share my passion in this area. Issues of civil liberties and people's rights are involved in this case.</P>
    <P>From my limited experience in my part of County Wicklow, I could mention four or five cases which would illustrate how scandalously the Law Society and members of the Bar have treated people's rights in the State.  I am not happy that those people in the privacy of their rooms or wherever they hold their meetings or cabals should be allowed to handle people's lives in that way.  I put this amendment down because of two young people, Maureen and Terry Doran, and the way the Law Society has treated them.  Everyone accepts in this case that an error was made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> My difficulty is with section 2 on page seven and is to do with personal information &ldquo;held by a public body on the understanding that it would be treated as confidential.&rdquo;  Whose understanding are we talking about?  I had considered altering this to say &ldquo;on the specification&rdquo;, so that if somebody had submitted information about themselves to a public body and wanted to make a specification as to its confidentiality they would be able to do so.</P>
    <P>I understand reasons for confidentiality if there are commercial transactions in which a public body was engaged but I have grave difficulties with the phrase &ldquo;understanding that it would be treated as confidential&rdquo;.  From that, if the county manager decided that in his understanding it was confidential, even though he had not received a specific instruction to that effect, would there be grounds for saying that personal information about an identifiable individual could be withheld?</P>
    <P>I welcome the alteration to the Government amendment on information relating to the personal affairs of the individual.  That has improved matters by specifying financial affairs.  On Second Stage we raised the exclusion of information relating to the criminal history of the individual, which is the substance of amendment No. 6.  On Second Stage the Minister said that if a person gained a criminal record for parking on double yellow lines, which is private, others will not be able to have access to that type of information.  I am not sure about that and cannot understand why, if one commits an offence, that that should not be in the public domain.  Some very trivial matters are reported in local newspapers and I can envisage circumstances in which it would be quite appropriate to have information on the criminal history of an individual made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis seems to have a problem with the word &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;.  The normal situation would be that the understanding would be of both parties, determined either explicitly or by longstanding custom and practice. Generally it would be a mutual understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we delete the proposal as the Senator suggests&mdash;and I will look at &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; again &mdash;one would have no protection for confidential information.  Public bodies often hold sensitive information which would not be appropriate for third party access.  This definition of personal information affects the Bill later, as normally when dealing with personal information only the person concerned can see it.  There has to be an overriding public interest for somebody else to see it, or in cases where one would see personal information about one's child, such as a school record, or about their next of kin.  Generally, only you can see your own file, only I can see mine and it is not open to public access.  Deleting that could allow confidential information to be accessible to third parties and that is not what the Senator intends.  We will look at &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;<Col N="1417" /> again but I believe it means a mutual understanding.</P>
    <P>On information relating to the criminal history of an individual, under freedom of information a public body cannot ask of anybody who inquires why they are looking for that information.  In the week that is in it, if any stranger could walk in off the street and see the youthful indiscretion of somebody else, that would be regarded as completely inappropriate.  There are cases at the moment where employers, looking to employ somebody, go directly to the Garda, show their bona fides and would be given clearance or not on the criminal history of the individual.  They are asked who they are and why they are looking for that history.  This would not cut across that kind of access in controlled and appropriate circumstances, but freedom of information is about somebody walking in off the street and officials being legally precluded from asking them who they are and why they want to know about a third party.  In those circumstances it would not be appropriate to look at third party information and that would be the effect of Senator Dardis's proposed deletion.  We should be careful because youngsters get into trouble from time to time and it should not hang around them for the rest of their days for any person to access.  That kind of open access would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister of State says.  Trivial matters should not be exposed to the full glare of public scrutiny, but a balance should be struck.  Perhaps it is possible to frame this in terms of convictions in the District Court so we have a line drawn on what would and would not be appropriate to be public knowledge.  The Minister of State is correct on my difficulty with the word &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; and that was why I sought deletion.  I found it difficult to substitute a word for &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;.  One way that might be considered on Report Stage is to have a definition of &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; in the definitions section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>On a trivial point, it is open to confusion to read section 2(1) and then to have all of these (a)s and (b)s.  Perhaps the draftsperson needs to look at the technical aspect of that.  We should know the part of the Bill we are talking about.  It is easy to be confused as to the different parts and subsections.</P>

      <P>I agree and sympathise with Senator Dardis's points.  I tend to the Minister of State's view on the importance of privacy.  The balance to be struck, to which Senator Dardis referred, is one between secrecy and privacy.  The Minister is coming down on the right side, that of privacy.  On the Government amendment, one is substituting information relating to financial affairs instead of business affairs.  That seems to be a straightforward substitution.  However, &ldquo;or the personal affairs&rdquo; was dropped.  That is a change in meaning.  What is the thinking behind that?</P>

      <P>We looked at the working of this in other jurisdictions in relation to privacy Acts.  On mature reflection we felt that the way it had been originally expressed was not adequate. &ldquo;Business affairs&rdquo; has been dropped; only &ldquo;financial affairs&rdquo; is included in amendment No. 5, as business affairs are dealt with in detail in section 27.  It was felt that &ldquo;personal affairs&rdquo; was too vague and is at variance with the more specific nature of the Preamble.  This is based on legislation that is working well in another jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>At the end of several sections there are definitions of the terms used in those sections.  Section 14, for example, which runs over two pages, uses several phrases not used elsewhere, such as a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo;, and when you reach the final subsection the terms are explained.  Why are those terms not in section 2? If they have to be scattered throughout, why not at the beginning rather than the end of the sections?

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 18, after &ldquo;foregoing&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and includes all references to other related records&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that there is the possibility&mdash;and it is only a possibility given that our public servants are tripping over themselves to be open and accessible &mdash; that people might be less than fully forthcoming with information.  When a requester lodges an application for a certain type of information, the problem is knowing the right question to ask.  If you are an investigative journalist, a humble academic or an even humbler councillor and you are trying to get to the truth, it is often very difficult to know what question to ask.  You <Col N="1419" /> could get a truthful answer to the wrong question. The person providing the information should have a statutory responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is mentioned elsewhere in the legislation that anybody providing information should provide it to the fullest possible extent.  However, it struck me that in this subsection, by adding the words &ldquo;and includes all references to other related records&rdquo;, you would put down a clear marker regarding other related records about which the requester may not have seen fit to ask.  This would appeal to lazy academic researchers &mdash; none of whom are in this House.  It is a requirement for cross referencing and it makes good sense.  I hope the Minister can see this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point being made but I think the matter is dealt with elsewhere. People are required to look for information with due particularity.  Also, Departments and public offices have to give guides with references to what is available and will be under legal obligation to help people narrow down the request.  Senator Roche referred to this as being a bit belt and braces.  If somebody made a routine request, the process would be delayed for a long time while staff compiled all the cross references. It could make a simple request unnecessarily voluminous. It is important that the process is kept as simple as possible.  There is a legal duty on public bodies to be helpful.  That is the purpose of the reference manuals and of narrowing down requests to what people are looking for.</P>
      <P>A public body could, for example, be required to seek records which it does not hold but which are referred to in its records.  The mechanism suggested would not work in practice and could discredit the idea of openness.  That would be a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of making the Bill unduly complex.  Given what has already been said about the complexities of the Bill, the additional phrasing suggested in my amendment does not create undue complexity.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says.  The intention in the Bill is that people should be helpful, the manuals should be helpful in giving a general view of information.  The requirement that one should be as helpful and forthcoming as possible is fine.  Maybe between now and Report Stage the Minister would consider the merit of putting in some formula of words.  All the material related to an individual case would not be covered in the manual.  The manual would be a general guide. There could be internal pressure put on public servants not to give members of the public too much information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember years ago working in a Department and discovering that somebody was not getting what they were entitled to.  I committed the cardinal sin of ensuring that the public knew that if they asked the wrong question they would not get their entitlements.  I got a severe chastisement <Col N="1420" /> and was told that my job was to see that they got as little as possible.  That attitude does prevail.</P>
    <P>In some public service agencies I can see a willingness, at management level in particular, to withhold as much as possible.  If there was the specific requirement to draw attention to cross references, it would be helpful.  I accept that there is a difficulty with drafting and that the draft I put forward is cumbersome, but if the Minister could return to the issue on Report Stage, I will not press the amendment to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to indulge in my annual outburst of pedantry about the &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; disease. Why is it not possible to say &ldquo;for a Department of State, the Minister for Government having charge of it&rdquo;?  Why must the phrase &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; be used?  There was a trend away from the use of the phrase, which was most desirable, but now the trend has turned back.  It is a most cumbersome phrase.  There is a marked absence of the phrase in the text of early Acts of the Oireachtas.  Its use appears to be a modern disease so I make my annual appeal to the parliamentary draftsman in relation to &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My other point relates to section 2 (1) (ix) which refers to &ldquo;information relating to property of the individual (including the nature of the individual's title to any property)&rdquo;.  On Second Stage I spoke about the public's fascination with the estates of people who are dead and the need for newspapers to publish the value of estates of the deceased.  Is it possible to amend this provision to have it apply to the property of an individual, living or dead?  It causes distress to the surviving relatives of the deceased to see details about his or her estate published in the columns of a Sunday newspaper.  I accept there is huge fascination with such information, which is why the newspapers publish it, but is it appropriate that such information is published in national newspapers each week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <P>I need to take further legal advice to ascertain if the term &ldquo;individual&rdquo; applies to the dead as well as the living in this context.  The intention is that property information would not be accessible under this legislation. If it is otherwise published people can get access to it but there is no question of making a request under freedom of information legislation to discover how many acres of land somebody has or the details of a car registration.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (3), line 1, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I proposed these amendment to tease out what the Minister of State has in mind with regard to this provision.  It refers to people with disabilities and the manner in which public bodies may be issued guidelines by the Minister for Finance on how to respond to their requests.  If the principle is accepted as a good one, the phraseology should be strengthened.  It should not be a question of &ldquo;may&rdquo; but &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I have not done anything about the use of the phrase &ldquo;as he or she considers appropriate&rdquo; which occurs throughout the Bill and appears to permit much leeway to the Minister.  That does not concern me at present.</P>
      <P>It is important to use every opportunity available to raise public consciousness and the consciousness of public bodies of the particular challenges that confront people with disabilities.  The amendment is a way of both satisfying the aspiration of this Bill and of advancing a worthy general purpose, in terms of raising the consciousness of officials who might be involved in these matters. It is possible that people with disabilities might use this legislation disproportionately if it transpires that they become conscious of a range of rights of which they might not be aware now or do not have an opportunity to use now.  People with disabilities are probably active beneficiaries of this legislation and it is desirable that they and the officials involved should be encouraged to respond positively to it.  In that case the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be used rather than the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 seeks to impose a time limit of four weeks.  The time limit is nominal as little can happen in four weeks but it is suggested in order to stress that there ought to be a deadline and to focus the Minister of State's mind on the need to have definite guidelines in place at a particular time from the commencement of the legislation. The principle is good and I hope the Minister of State will see its merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concerns.  All of us wish to see people with disabilities facilitated in using this legislation.  The reason the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is that it is more flexible and in favour of people with disabilities.  We looked carefully at the experience in other countries and it is only during the period following the implementation of legislation such as this that one can identify practical teething problems.  In the first six months the only people with disabilities who might use the legislation could be wheelchair users and not people who are deaf, blind, maimed or people with mental <Col N="1422" /> disabilities.  If legislation and regulations are cast in tablets of stone it is hard to change them.</P>
      <P>We believe the legislation is pro-disability because section 15 (5) obliges the Minister for Finance to put in place the organisational arrangements to make the legislation work. Under that section guidelines and circulars will be issued as problems emerge.  At the end of a process the guidelines can be codified into a set of regulations based on experience.  The experience in other countries is that following a period of about one or two years one can identify the teething problems and practical issues that must be tackled.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate why the Senator has proposed this amendment, the provisions as currently drafted would be more helpful to people with disabilities because issues can be noted as they arise and circulars under section 15 (5) can be issued.  That will not mean that the disability issue has been dealt with because new problems can arise.  However, it is cumbersome to introduce new regulations.  It is better to go through the informal process first and make regulations following experience in the problems that can arise for people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little puzzled by the Minister of State's response.  She appears to be saying the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but shall only do so after a certain delay in order to see what the problems are.  Why does one use permissive phraseology for what is intended as presumably an obligatory commitment, but after one has experience of observing what is happening?  I would prefer to see the principle of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; included and, again, it comes back to the resources of the language to find a way of saying that.  If one wishes to say &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and specify a period within which it will be implemented, it can be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to what we have learned from other countries.  One of the strengths of this Bill is the fact that the Minister of State has consulted widely and pondered the lessons of other countries.  However, that must mean that already a number of these issues will have arisen in other countries so one is not starting in a vacuum.  One can already anticipate or identify some of the problems and consultation with some of the organisations representing the disabled would identify others.  There is nothing to prevent these being added or finding a phraseology to allow for that.  Once one had started with a &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the principle would be accepted.  It would not be up to an individual Minister and there would be a commitment built in to adding to the list.  If we are in agreement on the principle then what I am suggesting is superior to what is in the Bill which does not copperfasten the principle.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would look at this before Report Stage.  For once I am confident that I am right.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 6 to 11, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The records referred to in subsection (1) are any records relevant to an application made by a requester&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment because I could not see how one could confine the legislation to records created after the commencement of this Bill.  There were bound to be references to earlier events and that would be an artificial and impossible barrier to set down in terms of the search for information.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the section continues: &ldquo;Records created after the commencement of this Act...before such commencement as may be prescribed...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that this recognises the artificiality of saying only from the day the Act comes into effect and therefore it allows for records created previously.  This is an extraordinarily cumbersome and permissive expression.  &ldquo;Records created during this period (if any), before such commencement...&rdquo; The whole of recorded time could come under that phrase.  &ldquo;After such time (if any)...&rdquo; I am not sure what that means. &ldquo;Before such commencement as may be prescribed, after consultation with the other members of the Government, and references in this Act to a record shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo; It is not even after consultation between the Minister for Finance and the head of the body or another Minister, but &ldquo;other members of the <Col N="1424" /> Government&rdquo;.  This is an extraordinarily all embracing phrase and suggests infinite possibilities for postponement, delay and deferral.  I know that is not what is meant but, given the normal processes of administration, delay is built into that phrase.  My own phraseology is very simple and speaks of any other relevant records.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate a clarification of how this is intended to operate in practice as distinct from what appears to be the impossibility of rapid implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>My concerns are almost identical to those of Senator Lee.  He has proposed an alternative which I am prepared to accept.  My view is that sections 4 and 5 should be deleted and there would be a consequential amendment in subsection (6) which would say subsection (1) rather than subsection (5).</P>
      <P>The core of the Bill is section 6(1):</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, every person has a right to and shall, on request therefor, be offered access to any record held by a public body and the right so conferred is referred to in this Act as the right of access.</P>
      <P>We are circumscribing that subsection.  The limits which are imposed by section 6(4) and (5) are far too restrictive.  There is the capacity to procrastinate because the Minister must consult with other members of the Government and so on.  The three years looks like a short period when one considers what might follow from this.  The right is so firmly established in section 6(1) that it is inappropriate to confer these extra restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The language may be slightly confusing.  It is intended that when people apply for records they will be able to see current files and any past information which it is necessary to understand those files.  All personal information will be disclosed straightaway.</P>
      <P>Section 6(4) is causing some grief but it is prescribing a rolling back process so that, initially, one will see current records and anything necessary to understand those records and all personal information whenever created.</P>
      <P>After the Act has been in operation for a while, the Minister for Finance will prescribe a rolling back so one can see records created perhaps four or five years before commencement.  Then a further rolling back will reveal records created ten years before and so on until files come under the aegis of the Archives Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We took advice from people who brought in freedom of information legislation in other countries, particularly in New Zealand.  They spent a lot of time archiving material and looking at old records and nothing was done about current files. The vast majority of requests were for current records but the system for meeting those request was in disarray.  On the basis of this advice we felt that the majority of requests would be for current material and it was important to get current and future record systems ready.  Only then would we <Col N="1425" /> tackle the older files.  This is a practical approach and is not in any way an issue of principle.  As soon as the system is up and running the Minister for Finance will prepare regulations to start rolling it back until freedom of information legislation meets the Archives Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the difficulty involved and am prepared to accept that one establishes a date which is within six months or a year and that everything that is created after that becomes the subject of scrutiny.  I realise the intention of the subsection is to allow people to go back.  A problem which arises from that is that if the prescription is not introduced, what about the archival aspect?</P>
      <P>I tabled a motion at Kildare County Council whereby the council would establish an archive. Legislation has been introduced in this area.  It is important that those documents are preserved because they are the most comprehensive social record of the history of the county.  However, under this it could be argued that it might not be possible to have access to some of those documents and if one were to adopt the letter of the law under section (4), it might not be possible for the historian like Senator Lee to go back to discover what was in a document of interest to him, assuming he could find it among the files when it is given to him but I will not go back over that again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's explanation but I was not speaking from a historical perspective.  First, I did not understand what this meant or at least how it applied in practice. If one is talking about current files, why not say records created after the commencement of this Act, etc.?  Why not put this into language which people like myself have a reasonable chance of understanding.  I believe the principle is admirable and sensible but I have great difficulty extracting that from the phraseology used here.  I know draftspeople may have problems, but surely it is possible to give clearer expression to this. The Minister of State said it with admirable clarity and was not getting overtime for being a draftsperson as well.  Why can it not be included like that?</P>
      <P>Having said that, it is still very permissive as distinct from saying this is what is intended to happen &mdash; this shall happen.  How are the words &ldquo;after consultation with other members of Government&rdquo; to be interpreted?  Does consultation take place with them all together or seriatim? If somebody wanted to be a nuisance, the phraseology is so loose and obscure that nothing could happen.</P>

      <P>The roll back would be about all records in a particular period or a specific set of records &mdash; for example, if it was a matter of public interest to look back at past records of the BTSB.  The Minister for Finance would consult <Col N="1426" /> with other members of Government before making these regulations because in most cases, presumably, it will not be the Department of Finance's records.  The Minister for Finance is the prescribed Minister for the public service so he would consult with other Departments about the roll back.  We hand it in plain English to the draftsperson's office and it comes back as a stamped copy saying it is consistent with the Constitution. It may not be English as I would write it but my English may not get stamped copy status.</P>

      <P>It is time the English of Ministers and their officials began to get stamped copy status.  I am becoming more &mdash; I do not want to say irritated &mdash; bewildered by what is contained in legislation.  The Minister of State gave us a clear explanation and I do not see why it should be incompatible with our Constitution to find a phraseology similar to hers which is constitutionally acceptable instead of phrasing it like this and having to have it explained in English.  I am serious about this.  It seems Ministers are in awe of draftspeople and legal people.  If I may say so, Ministers speak far more sense than either of those categories.</P>

      <P>To pick up on Senator Lee's last point, frequently legislation is drafted for the benefit of the legal industry rather than that of our citizens and it is to perpetuate that industry. I accept restrictions are imposed on us by the Constitution, which is an easily read and understandable document.  Why can we not do the same with legislation?</P>
      <P>To return to my original point, I do not see the need for these circumscribing subsections when the principle is so clearly laid down in clear English in section 6(1).  We then move into this minutiae.  We keep coming back to the official sitting in his office who is determined that the public shall not have access to this material.  He will know the minutiae of these subsections and the cross references.  Then when poor Joe Public comes in, he will tell him that section X (c)(4)(d) gives a cross reference saying he is not entitled to information.  Poor Joe or Sheila Public will go away beaten and subdued by the sheer weight and authority of this official whose sole purpose in life is to thwart the reasonable grounds of the public to access to information.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister will want to be reasonable but I have a wording in later amendments which states &ldquo;in such other forms as may be reasonably sought by the requester&rdquo;. There is a substantial proportion of illiterate people of whom some might be travellers.  Also, some people are blind.  There are different categories of people for whom writing cannot, unfortunately, be taken for granted.  In certain circumstances, people might not even be familiar with using a phone.  I know the intention behind the Minister's amendment is to facilitate but I would like that to be more explicit.  I have amendments to later parts of the Bill where I substitute &ldquo;in such other forms as may be determined&rdquo; with the alternative &ldquo;as may be reasonably sought by the requester&rdquo;.  I accept the intention behind the amendment but it does not quite cover the full range of what we might wish it to.</P>

      <P>This amendment is about how someone applies for information and allows the Minister to say that a person can apply in different forms because writing is becoming an almost obsolete mode of communication.  I have an outline which the Senator might enjoy.  Under the Interpretation Act, 1937, writing is defined as follows, &ldquo;The word writing includes printing, typewriting, lithography, photography and other modes of representing or reproducing words in visible form and cognate words shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I might engage in an electronic means of communication to let the Senator see it.  The amendment allows for application by the Internet and E-mail and other new forms which may develop and for the Minister to describe those.  The reason for some visible form being the generally preferred method is so that a record exists of the request which can be used when someone has the responsibility for following it up.  A request will be known as one made under this Bill in terms of it having access to the right of appeal.  The amendment is meant to be proactive and not intended to constrain.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), line 45, to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>This amendment suggests deleting the paragraph which states that a request must be stated as a request under this Act.  If we are creating a right to information, this is superfluous and such a request should not be made.  Paragraph (a) is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 replaces paragraph (b) with the words &ldquo;containing such identifying particulars as are known to the person requesting concerning the subject matter in the record&rdquo;.  I can see a circumstance where a requester might not want to make all such identifying particulars available.  For example, if one were investigating something, it might be enough to provide sufficient particulars to identify the matter which is the subject of the request.  A requester might make available such information which they believe sufficient to identify the subject matter. Who makes the judgment as to what is sufficient? I am trying to create a situation where there is no possibility for an adjudication that a valid request will not be dealt with because someone says there are insufficient particulars.  An excessive degree of judgment is permitted in the existing wording to someone who wished to frustrate the Bill.  I want to create a situation where the intention of the Bill will not be frustrated because the set of words &ldquo;containing sufficient particulars&rdquo; allows a degree of latitude to someone who might wish to frustrate the Bill.  I suggest that it should be the requester's judgment which counts and not some third party in some public agency who might wish to frustrate the requester.</P>
      <P>The more important of the two amendments I have tabled is that which proposes the deletion of section 7(1)(a) because such a matter should not be stated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 7(1)(a) states that one must state that a request for information is a request made under the Bill.  That is unnecessary and superfluous.  We are, after all, asking people to make a request in writing which is quite formal. I would hate to have a situation where a person made a request in writing and a fortnight later got a letter from the county manager saying that the request did not state that it was made under this Bill and asking the person to resubmit the request or refusing to give them the information requested.  This is another restriction on the right of access and is, in my view, unnecessary.  People looking for information will probably not be familiar with all the aspects of the Bill and will not know that it is required of them to state that their request is made under the Bill.  They will write a letter to the county manager or some official asking for information only to receive a reply saying they cannot have it as they did not request it under the Bill.  That is silly.</P>

      <P>The reason for section 7 is informed by experience in New Zealand which did not request people to specify they were applying under the Act.  As a result, people asked for information.  The staff dealing with it on the other side were careless about time limits because it was not labelled as a freedom of information request so they did not realise that it had to be answered within a certain period to allow access to an appeals system and so on.  Officials in New Zealand are now telling people to specify that their requests are under the Official Information Act so that it will kick in their rights.  It does not preclude people from making a telephone call looking for information.  This gives a mandate to public bodies but it could take four or five years for the culture of secrecy to change.  When a person applies under the Freedom of Information Bill, they will have a right to appeal the decision. However, it is uncertain if those rights of appeal will apply if they make a telephone call.  It was included as a pro-applicant clause based on hard experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity on behalf of Fianna Fáil to speak on the tourism industry and on the necessity to continue to invest in it.  Ireland's tourism industry has grown significantly in the past few years and it is anticipated that it will continue to grow into the next century. It contributes approximately £3 billion annually to the economy and employs over 100,000 people. Tourism is a highly labour-intensive industry and as such can have an important impact on our unemployment figures and on employment opportunities in remote regional areas.  It is important to expand and develop the tourism business and to maintain and enhance the high standards which have been a feature of the industry's success.</P>
      <P>Ireland has always had a positive image as a tourist destination.  It is a challenge for us to maintain that image, especially in view of major environmental issues, such as pollution.  It is a cause of serious concern that, at a time when we would like to promote Ireland as a destination for angling tourism, some of our unique angling resources and fisheries, such as the trout fishery in the Corrib, are threatened with pollution to the extent that this year's large scale angling competitions are at risk.  It is not only necessary to continue to invest in tourism and tourist related businesses, but is vitally important that investment, particularly through Cohesion and Structural Funds, is provided to deal with environmental problems which are preventing the development of areas such as Lough Derg, the Corrib and Lough Mask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £650 million investment in tourism under the operational programme and the £370 million <Col N="1432" /> in grant aid means that Ireland is in a good position to expand its tourism business.  Tourism can make a bigger contribution to the economy and to the creation of employment in the future so it is necessary to take every step to ensure that we do not neglect to deal with some of the major problems faced by the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>The AD Little report, which was commissioned by Deputy McCreevy before he left the Department of Tourism and Trade, outlines the changes necessary in Bord Fáilte if it wants to meet future challenges, many of which have already been implemented.  Bord Fáilte has been reorganised over the past year.  I want to put on record our appreciation of Mr. Padraig Ó hUiginn, the retired Chairman of Bord Fáilte, for the work he did in Bord Fáilte and in the Department of the Taoiseach where he planned the structural and operational programmes for the development of the tourism business.  I also express our best wishes to Mr. Mark Mortell, the newly appointed Chairman of Bord Fáilte, and to the board who have a daunting task ahead of them if they want to develop the tourism industry to its full potential.</P>
    <P>Almost five million people visited Ireland last year, which is an increase of approximately 10 per cent.  There has been a 12 per cent or 13 per cent increase in the North American and United Kingdom markets &mdash; the UK market will continue to be the most significant market for the Irish tourism industry.  However, visitor numbers from the European market were up only 7 per cent last year, which is below the national average and below the American and UK figures.  Bord Fáilte must address this problem in co-operation with the tour operators.  Bord Fáilte's decision to appoint an international marketing director with an impressive record in international marketing is a progressive step and one which deserves our full support.</P>
    <P>While developments in the tourism industry have been dramatic, there are mounting concerns about the failure to spread the visitor numbers evenly throughout the regions.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, will be aware that last summer there was criticism that the number of people who visited Dublin and the east coast did not move to the west or south.  Not only was there criticism in Cork, Galway and Limerick, but also in the north-west where some of the more successful hotels found it difficult to fill their bed complements.</P>
    <P>It is important to underline for the Minister, the Government and Bord Fáilte that new initiatives are necessary if the benefits of the numbers visiting us and of the transfer is to be spread evenly.  Western tourism should not decline further because those regions, particularly the resort areas, have always been the backbone of the Irish tourism business.  They are the most scenic areas, they offer huge opportunities for leisure and recreation and they allow the visitor to have an enjoyable stay in a relaxed atmosphere away from city life.  It would be unwise if the bulk <Col N="1433" /> of new activity was concentrated in Dublin and the east coast to the detriment of smaller towns and provincial regions as it would prevent the spread of resources into areas which need it most. We are concerned at the trend which is beginning to develop and call on the Government, Bord Fáilte and the other State agencies to find ways to redress it.  Last year this was a cause of concern for many hoteliers, not least the big hotels outside Dublin which had many beds available while the market in this city was saturated.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the huge number of hotel developments taking place in Dublin and it looks like these will continue.  Some are taking advantage of the benefits available in urban renewal and special incentive areas.  However, we should highlight the necessity to counterbalance this trend by making it attractive for small hoteliers in western provincial towns to benefit from the spin-off in the tourism business.  The grant schemes for refurbishment and additional accommodation in small provincial hotels were welcome but perhaps the Minister and Bord Fáilte would indicate how they will redress the imbalance and support, by way of incentive, people in the regional areas so that they can play a greater part and get more benefit from the current expansion of our tourism business. There has been trenchant criticism of the inability of smaller operators to get funding and resources and of the delay in the payment of European funding.</P>
    <P>I compliment Bord Fáilte and Shannon Free Airport Development Company for their work in the mid-west region which has enhanced the tourism product by developing new amenities, such as the adventure centre in Kilrush, &ldquo;Water World&rdquo; in Tralee, Lahinch and Kilkee, and the new product lines such as conference centres.  I also compliment both the current and the previous Government for taking the initiative to give tax breaks in resource areas.  These have transformed towns like Kilkee and Lahinch whose tourism development had stagnated in the last few years.  The huge investment since the renewal scheme was put in place is an example of what incentives and special encouragement can do to bring investment into areas and to make the tourism business work more satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to press ahead vigorously with the enhancement of the tourism product.  Far greater attention is required in areas such as the environment, heritage areas and the roads network. The tourism business can play a far more important role in the overall national economic drive in the future and we will be forthcoming with any support which will ensure that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and support Senator Daly's remarks.  Tourism is one of our country's lifelines &mdash; we earn about £3 billion in tourism revenue with an employment of approximately 100,000 people.  If our tourism industry were to collapse tomorrow it would have an awesome effect &mdash; we can see what happens if <Col N="1434" /> a factory closes, so imagine the effect of 100,000 people becoming unemployed.</P>
      <P>I have a personal interest in tourism because my wife has run a bed and breakfast business at my home in Dingle since 1970.  I used to be annoyed when people described unregistered houses as &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; bed and breakfasts &mdash; that was wrong because no one was operating illegally. Normally I praise Bord Fáilte highly but if houses were unregistered the fault often lay with the board, although there were other factors.  A number of people from my town were turned down because of the number of rooms available to let, but they put up their bed and breakfast signs anyway. I was glad to see that 90 per cent of those who formerly would have been &ldquo;unapproved&rdquo; are now included in the new Bord Fáilte book of bed and breakfast houses.</P>
      <P>We should remember that the bed and breakfast business started long before Bord Fáilte was established.  It was a traditional type of accommodation offered to tourists.  They were given exactly what the household had to offer, which was clean, good country and town living.  The rules and regulations were introduced later. While I am happy with those which cover adequate fire warnings and clean, hygienic food, it is possible to go overboard.  It is now specified that there should be a living room of a certain size for the tourists from which the family would be excluded.  That is not how bed and breakfasts operated at the beginning; tourists used to mix and live with the family.  We should not go too far and put people to unnecessary trouble providing special treatment for tourists.</P>
      <P>The accommodation provided by my wife is as good as any hotel in the country.  The rooms are <i>en suite,</i> are based on hotel accommodation and are extremely upmarket, as is all the <i>en suite</i> accommodation in Dingle.  However, we are in danger of pricing ourselves out of the market, particularly in the hotel sector.  According to the prices in the brochure published this week, ordinary hotels charge £60 per person during the peak season, which is far too much.  Such prices would not be charged in any other country.</P>
      <P>Guesthouse prices are pretty reasonable and bed and breakfast accommodation usually costs about £16.  My complaint is that when Bord Fáilte telephones a guesthouse listed on its computer and makes a booking at £16 per person, it charges the guesthouse 10 per cent &mdash; £1.60 &mdash; for making the booking.  If the guests pay by credit card the guesthouse has to pay a further 3 per cent charge. Therefore, people providing accommodation receive a little over £13 for accommodation for which they charge £16.  In most countries that cost is charged to tourists rather than to those providing accommodation.  I collected a good few brochures at the holiday fair and some countries charge tourists to leave their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism offices do a great job and I have nothing but praise for Bord Fáilte, although some things have gone wrong.  Gulliver, the tourist information and reservation system, has totally <Col N="1435" /> overshot the runway in terms of cost and, according to a report on tourism presented to the Dáil in 1996, has had very little effect.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful with our tourism industry, which is very important to my county and to that of the Minister of State.  Cork and Kerry were the two main tourist counties in the past but it is very gratifying to note that every county is now homing in on tourism in the same manner by promoting archaeology, angling and so on.  Tourism definitely has a very bright future which I wish I had more time to discuss.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be given another opportunity to debate the various issues relating to tourism and its phenomenal growth in recent years.  I have taken note of the points raised by both Senators, which I will convey to the appropriate authorities.</P>
      <P>Members will recall I spoke at length to this House on this topic in April and July of last year. In the course of those debates, Senators recognised that tourism development has had a dramatic impact on economic development and employment and that the drive to increase tourism had been very successful.  I am very proud to say that the growth in the sector is continuing and 1996 has been another record year.  I am happy to be able to appraise Senators of the various developments during last year and our plans for the future.</P>
      <P>In the context of the debates in this House last year some Senators expressed certain concerns. One of the main concerns related to the perceived imbalance in the spread of the growth in tourism throughout the regions, which was a point raised by Senators Daly and Fitzgerald. Issues such as the use of EU Structural Funds, the need to extend the season by attracting more people during the off-peak period and the need to continue to improve access and the infrastructure were also raised.  I will revert to these at a later stage.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to recall briefly our national tourism policy and Government objectives for the sector, which include strategies to deal with many of the concerns I have just mentioned.  As Members are aware, the operational programme for tourism sets the parameters for the tourism industry for the period 1994-99.  The strategy within the programme focuses on a large expansion in marketing activities; further product development to meet specific market deficiencies; major improvements in the conference, angling and cultural tourism products and an expansion in the range and scale of training to cater for the anticipated employment growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £652 million in overall investment is envisaged during the lifetime of the programme. Of this, £369 million will come from the EU, with the public and private sectors contributing £84 million and £199 million, respectively.  Programmes under the aegis of other Departments, <Col N="1436" /> such as the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry, the second Leader programme and the operational programme for local urban and rural development will also assist smaller tourism projects as part of their primary non-tourism objectives.  In addition, tourism projects in the Border counties may also qualify for assistance from the International Fund for Ireland, the EU INTERREG programme or the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for tourism recognises the role the sector plays as an instrument of regional policy and, in particular, the role it plays in the economic and social development of the more remote regions.  It, therefore, contains an indicative breakdown of expenditure on a regional basis to achieve a balanced distribution of investment throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Tourism performance over the past three years has been outstanding.  The preliminary results for 1996, announced by the Minister, Deputy Kenny, at the end of December, clearly show that the very strong growth in tourism, which is well above the European average, is continuing.  A particularly strong performance in the British and North American markets looks set to boost overseas visitor expenditure by 12 per cent to £1.445 billion in 1996.  Overseas visitor numbers are expected to increase by 10 per cent to 4.6 million. Employment in the industry will rise by over 5,000, bringing total employment to 107,000. These are record breaking annual results.</P>
    <P>Looking at the 1996 results by market area, current indications are that the number of British visitors exceeded the 2.5 million mark for the first time &mdash; an increase of 12 per cent on 1995.  Mainland European travel to Ireland is expected to yield high single digit growth on last year's performance of 1.1 million visitors.  This is a good result as European outbound travel is estimated to grow by a modest 2 per cent in 1996.  Strong consumer demand, stimulated by sustained advertising investment, has increased the number of North American visitors by an estimated 12 per cent to 720,000.  This performance compares well with the expected growth of 5 per cent in US travel to Europe this year.</P>
    <P>One of the major highlights of 1996 was the worldwide launch of one of the most important developments in the history of tourism marketing, Tourism Brand Ireland, which took place in Dublin in November.  Tourism Brand Ireland represents a critical change in focus for the marketing of the island of Ireland over the next five years.  For the first time, all Irish tourism will be able to unify behind a single marketing initiative &mdash; a tourism brand which will contain the same central message, with variations and modifications which meet the needs and expectations of individual markets and cultures.</P>
    <P>The industry led overseas tourism marketing initiative was the single largest investor in marketing Ireland as a holiday destination in 1996. The related press and television campaigns in <Col N="1437" /> Britain, the USA, France and Germany cost approximately £6.7 million.  The EU management board for marketing committed approximately £7.3 million to 266 marketing projects during 1996.  The largest single allocation was £1.7 million towards the development of the Tourism Brand Ireland project.</P>
    <P>The year saw further development of air and sea services to Ireland.  Aer Lingus commenced new services from Stansted and Chicago, and has recently announced an expanded transatlantic service in 1997 with Newark, New Jersey, as a new gateway.  Ryanair launched new routes to Dublin from three British airports and Stena Line introduced the HSS service from Holyhead to Dublin.  These developments will help to considerably improve access, which Senators had rightly highlighted during the last debate in this House as an important issue to the further development of the sector throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The EU management boards for product development&mdash;Bord Fáilte and Shannon areas &mdash;approved 75 projects for European Regional Development Fund grants under the Tourism Operational Programme totalling almost £30 million. The momentum for investment within the tourism industry shows no sign of slowing down. The range of grant aided projects include day visitor attractions, heritage towns, cruising facilities, tourism information offices and a variety of environmentally based activity holiday facilities.</P>
    <P>A new tourism council was appointed by the Minister for Tourism and Trade in early 1996 to act as a national forum for consultation between the tourism industry, the State tourism agencies and Departments and to act in an advisory capacity on tourism policy.  The council has already met on three occasions and is specifically examining ways to address the problem of seasonality in the sector, another issue raised in this House last year.</P>
    <P>The council formed a subcommittee to concentrate on the subject and the result was the launch of the &ldquo;Celtic Flame&rdquo; music festival to be staged at four venues&mdash;Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Cork.  The lead events will be supported with a series of fringe events to be organised by the regional tourism organisations, with the industry thus spreading the commercial benefits of the festival throughout the regions.</P>
    <P>Other sporting highlights of the year included the football game at Croke Part last November involving Notre Dame and Navy American, while the Smurfit Shamrock Classic attracted approximately 15,000 American visitors, the largest movement ever of Americans to Ireland for a single event.  In October, the Minister for Tourism and Trade responded positively to the initiative that the <i>Societie Tour de France</i> host the official start of the <i>Tour de France</i> in July 1998.  Plans are also proceeding for the staging of the World Equestrian Games in Ireland in 1998 while a bid has been launched to stage the Ryder Cup in 2005.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> By the middle of this year, over £30 million from the European Social Fund will have been spent under the tourism operational programme on a range of training and human resource development measures covering school leavers, the unemployed and those already in the industry. Moreover, the industry itself is now taking concrete steps to address emerging staffing and recruitment difficulties in the sector.  The recent initiative by the Irish Hotels Federation to introduce a quality code of practice for hotels and guesthouses is a good example.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the importance of the domestic market in the context of the development of the tourism sector.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the domestic tourism market I was successful in securing Government agreement last year for the allocation of up to £500,000 towards the cost of the domestic tourism marketing initiative.  I launched the initiative in February 1996 and I established a high level working group comprising representatives of the tourism industry, the relevant State tourism agencies and officials from the Department of Tourism and Trade to develop the initiative on a partnership basis.</P>
    <P>The working group has developed an integrated national marketing programme to accelerate growth in home holidays with specific emphasis on the shoulder and off-season periods.  Those involved in the tourism industry, many of them national figures in the industry, gave their services free of charge.  As yet, nobody has asked for payment, not even for travelling to meetings.  This is indicative of the spirit that prevails in the industry at present.</P>
    <P>The major question is what the future holds for Irish tourism.  The high growth rates in international tourism which were a feature of the early 1990s have been replaced by more modest increases.  The coming year is likely to see tourism arrivals in Europe increase by between 1 and 3 per cent.  Ireland is expected to continue to gain market share with a forecast of a 9 per cent increase in overseas revenue and a 7 per cent increase in visitor numbers.  This will bring the number of visitors to more than five million in 1997.</P>
    <P>Tourism growth does not happen by accident and cannot be expected to continue unless well thought out comprehensive strategies are in place.  As I have outlined, 1996 saw a number of important initiatives in this regard; these will be continued in 1997.  For example, a comprehensive programme for the use or roll out of the tourism brand is being put in place and already the new logo is becoming a familiar feature of tourism promotional material and publications.  The overseas tourism marketing initiative has committed its resources behind the deployment of the brand. I am happy to say that another £500,000 has been secured for the domestic tourism marketing initiative for 1997 and I will be launching a nationwide campaign on 10 February next.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> The overall strategy in the budget will benefit the development of the tourism sector.  Specific measures in the areas of taxation and social welfare will not only help to create and maintain employment but in so doing make the targets set for the sector more readily achievable.</P>
    <P>The strategy of reducing employment costs and the burden of taxation will be very important. Reliefs aimed at low paid workers will have an added significance given the numbers of part-time and seasonal workers in the industry.  The continuation of the process of reducing the corporation tax rate applicable to the non-manufacturing sector will benefit tourism development and will be acknowledged by the industry as a significant step in the long-term strategy by the Minister for Finance to bring the higher rate of corporation profits tax into line with our overseas competitors.  In addition, the positive changes in the budget on increased capital acquisition tax and capital gains tax relief will benefit family run businesses.  This is especially relevant in the tourism industry which has a high proportion of such businesses.  With the various initiatives in place and the complementary budgetary strategy adopted by the Government, I am confident that the future of tourism is bright and that its contribution to the our economic and social well being will increase beyond 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has addressed many areas of crucial importance.  With regard to the investment of money in parts of the country, we need to look at those places which were but are no longer successful.  What happened to Achill Island, Bundoran, Tramore and other such places?</P>
      <P>The studies taking place are too tightly focused and do not take a long-term view.  In Dingle we have learnt from a great mistake in the marketing of tourism: it falls down when individuals, individual hotels or industries in an area attempt to out-manoeuvre others.  There was a simple theory in Dingle over the years that everybody should work together to attract visitors and the best business would win.  That is how things should be done.  It is a philosophy that should be accepted by the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>We should get people involved and then ask them to spend money.  For example, Ireland is famous for its racing industry.  Given this, admission charges to race tracks should be scrapped to get people and families to attend.  They will then spend their money on services and entertainment rather than at the gate.  This is the way to ensure the viability of a part of Irish culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many tourism areas in Ireland are too tightly focused.  Achill Island became focused on one group&mdash;those with money.  Some places in Ireland become popular and then very expensive and when this happens they become popular with those who have money.  They tend to be middle aged or older, will be finicky with their loyalties, visit a place for a couple of years and then tire of <Col N="1440" /> it, or die, leaving such areas without a business base.</P>
    <P>By contrast, successful locations will attract a mix.  Like Dingle, they must be able to attract the backpacker student from east Germany who does not have much money while accommodating the man from Bavaria with his new, top of the range, Mercedes, who seeks expensive meals, the best quality accommodation and so on.  We should ensure that mix exists everywhere money is invested.  Mix is magic in tourism and places where there is a mix are successful.  For example, La Rochelle is important because it mixes yachts with fishing boats and millionaires and billionaires from international high society with people mending nets and trying to make money from fishing.  This could apply to places in the west but that mix is missing.  There is also a great need to ensure the mix can be accommodated.  Backpackers with good memories who come to Ireland and only spend pennies will return in ten years to relive their memories with more money and a love of the place.  It is similar to people who go to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish.  They may not speak much Irish but when they get older and think back, they want to return.  If their memories are happy and they were looked after, they will return for more.  It is the boomerang effect.</P>
    <P>Regarding investment, the Minister saw the submission about the licensing of commercial accommodation from the Irish Hotels Federation, the town and country homes organisation and the Irish Farm Holidays Association.  Their points are important in terms of standards in the industry. Achill Island, which was booming in the 1960s and the 1970s, is still one of the most beautiful places in the country but investment in hotels there is required because it reflects many other tourist destinations in Ireland.  Local bed and breakfasts can probably provide better quality accommodation in terms of en suite bedrooms and every other level of comfort than hotels because money is not available for hotels.  This aspect should be examined and we should attempt to ensure that small hotels become viable.  They are no longer viable but they were always an attraction.</P>
    <P>An election year is fraught with difficulty in terms of selecting particular parts of Ireland.  The Minister had a bad experience in the last fortnight and I did not intend to remind him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I realised I said something wrong when I saw the frown on the Minister's face. However, the scheme involving designated areas for capital allowances for tourism development is much too restrictive.  I do not have a vested interest in this area but although there may be many good reasons for including Achill and Westport in the scheme, they are already tourism destinations.  Will the Minister ask somebody in his Department to explain in layman's terms why Belmullet and the Erris peninsula are omitted? <Col N="1441" /> There is no development in those areas and they should be included.  They are in the Minister's constituency and he should do the business for them.  The areas without development need to be developed.</P>
      <P>Ireland is famous for its pubs and they should be deregulated.  It is a relic of old times that somebody in Dublin decides what time pubs will open in Dingle.  Who decides that a pub should close in Dingle at 10 p.m. or 12 a.m.?  Who decided that a person must have a licence to run a pub any more than one should need a licence to fish salmon? The people who colonised this country made such decisions.  Pubs should be deregulated and if people want to sell booze at 3 a.m. they should be allowed to do so.  It is none of our business and it is no different from selling fish, tea or coffee.  We should move away from such restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding pay in the industry, I spoke to people who had been on the picket line at the Royal Dublin Hotel for three months.  A young commis chef told me what he earned.  I cannot recall the exact amount but it was paltry, perhaps just over £2 an hour.  My daughter, a student, was working for the summer directly across the road, filling sandwiches in a shop, and I figured out that she, without any training or background in the industry, was earning more per hour than the young commis chef who was training to make a contribution to the industry and our future.  There is something wrong with that and I urge the Minister to consider what such people earn.  I will not listen to people on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; say that they cannot get people to work in the tourism industry.  We will get people to work if they are paid and treated properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would be easier to deal with on the tendering rather than the other side of the bar.  It was gratifying to hear the Minister state that tourism numbers and revenue have <Col N="1442" /> increased again this year and that 1996 was a record year for both in Ireland.  This growth must continue.</P>
      <P>A number of issues in the industry still need work by the Department, particularly with regard to marketing.  I appreciate Bord Fáilte has a new marketing logo which is modern and different and will be positive.  However, proper marketing can only be achieved if proper funding is invested in it.  The world is a large place and I spent some time in the United States of America.  Although there are 40 million Irish Americans, their perception of Ireland is ancient; they do not know about modern Ireland.  It would cost a huge amount of money for the Department of Tourism and Trade or a marketing company to change that, but there is much scope for development in the marketing of Ireland throughout the world. The Bord Fáilte logo is modern and will be seen for what it is in time.  Mr. Mark Mortell, the recently appointed chairman, is a marketing guru and I wish him every success in Bord Fáilte where such people and expertise are required.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the successful seaside resort scheme.  He also made the important point that tourism should be developed in areas which were not noted for it in the past.  I repeat my parochial and never ending cry that, unfortunately, County Leitrim is the only county which has no form of urban or rural tax designation.  It would be of immense benefit to the county and the entire area if a rural resort scheme was established on the same basis as the seaside resort scheme.  I ask the Minister to examine this suggestion and consider providing that type of designation to County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly and Senator O'Toole mentioned family run hotels, an area in which I was interested when I was the junior spokesperson on tourism in the other House.  At that stage hotels with fewer than 30 bedrooms did not receive any form of financial assistance, such as grant aid, for development.  This is an unfortunate aspect.  In every small town in Ireland there are a number of small, family-run hotels.  With the advent of bed and breakfasts, which provide an excellent service but are more competitive, these hotels are finding it difficult to survive.  If something is not done to correct the imbalance, we will see a lot of family-run hotels going to the wall.  That would be extremely sad for the tourism industry because they had previously and still have an important role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a great believer in grants and the Department could consider low interest loans. Most people in those family-run businesses want to stay in those businesses and to pass them on but find they do not have the capital to expand or redevelop their hotels.  If the Department gave low interest loans it would be much better than grant assistance because people in the establishment would work to develop their business once they knew they had to make repayments.  With grant assistance they do not know if they should put the grant assistance into the hotel or not.  The <Col N="1443" /> Minister of State and the Department could look at that.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly spoke of spreading the benefits of tourism all over the country and I fully agree, although with tongue in cheek.  When the Shannon stopover was put in place, the chance of a tourist making it to the northwest was extremely small because they stayed in the midwest or the southwest.  Those areas have developed dramatically over many years.  With the Dublin stopover there is a much better chance of that tourist making his or her way to the northwest, west and east coast.  There is also the potential to upgrade Knock Airport as access to the country is extremely important and should be developed.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the work he is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister of State on his performance in office and the clear statement of his position in his speech.  We all recognise the importance of tourism to the economy of the country and it is a very pleasant way to earn money.  Some years ago I was stranded in Jordan and people were very hospitable.  I was taken to the ancient city of Jerash and was extremely impressed by the way in which they had excavated, cleaned up and reinstated some of the great Corinthian pillars of that remarkable Roman society.  I said to the guide: &ldquo;It is remarkable what you have done&rdquo; and he replied: &ldquo;We do not care for these buildings.  They are not Arab but Greek or Roman.&rdquo;  I asked why they had done it and he said: &ldquo;Jordan is a poor country with no oil, steel and coal but they are dirty things.  We do not care for these buildings but one must dig up oil, steel and coal.  One must smelt them and they leave dirt before they run out and there is no more money.  We polish and clean the old buildings and have tourist guides.  They continue to make money and make no dirt.&rdquo;  I thought that was a classic argument in favour of tourism and cultural tourism in particular.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State mentioned cultural tourism and that Matt McNulty and others of his calibre in Bord Fáilte have always recognised the significance of this element in the tourist industry in Ireland.  I am also grateful to the Ministers for Finance and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for giving a grant of £100,000 to the James Joyce Cultural Centre in North Great George's Street.  We have had visitors from over 100 countries and a number of them indicated to us that the reason they chose Dublin and Ireland over the United Kingdom, France or Sweden was because of their interest in Joyce and the existence of the James Joyce Cultural Centre in the heart of Dublin.  That is very important because writers like Joyce, Yeats, Wilde and O'Casey have given a brand identification to this country which money would not buy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has referred to a marketing strategy and that is vital.  However good the product, if one does not get out into the marketplace <Col N="1444" /> and get potential customers aware that one has this outstanding product, one is wasting one's time.  We in this country start with an enormous initial advantage because our writers in particular have placed Ireland firmly on the map and given people a good impression of this country so that they will want to come and see it, even when the impression is realistic and harsh rather than the synthetically happy and well-groomed appearance. Films like <i>The Van</i> show a section of life a lot of people would find unappealling but it is so richly comic, full of vitality and the beauty of places on the northside of Dublin like Bull Island that, seen all over the world, it will inevitably bring further tourists.</P>
    <P>We have the music industry where people identify with U2, Sinead O'Connor and Enya.  People look down their noses at the Eurovision Song Contest and some even groaned when we won it three times in a row, but look at the immense potential for showing small video clips of the beautiful scenery of the country.  Again, this is marketing which we could not afford to pay for.</P>
    <P>We are extremely lucky.  We have a remarkable product in terms of associations with literature and music.  We have a clean environment and classic identification.  Various Governments have put money into tourism, sometimes in ways which do not please me.  There are enough golf courses in this country already.  Bord Fáilte should get away from the exclusively golf course-orientated marketing.  They are very expensive and cater largely for an elite, but places like the Strokestown Museum manages to merge two traditions. It pays tribute to the sufferings of the Irish people during the Famine and also pays tribute to the remarkable beauty of a vanished way of life.  I was there for the official opening.  I went upstairs and an old lady was trying on Olive Pakenham Mahon's shoes, which she had found under the bed.  I opened the door and she saw a fellow conspirator in me.  She said: &ldquo;Isn't it great?  We are in here and they are gone to hell out of it.&rdquo;  It was a slightly narrow point of view but made me laugh.  At least we were incorporating all these elements in a mature way into the product we are selling.</P>
    <P>I hope more will be done for the great houses of Ireland like Castletown and Westport House where the family clings on by the skin of its teeth. These people should be helped and I do not say that sentimentally.  We should pay tribute to the efforts of people like Jeremy Altamont.  I know the American tourism market well and they love to press the flesh.  Nothing sells a great house better than the subliminal snobbery of knowing that a real family with historic connections to the house survives there and that one may bump into them by accident.  It is also very important that great collections of furniture are retained and again I pay tribute to the work of people like Matt McNulty with Newbridge House in Donabate, where he secured a deal for the house to come into the possession of the State and, more importantly, a lot of the collection of furniture, <Col N="1445" /> which has greater significance in the context of the house for which the furniture was designed. The family were permitted to live on in apartments in the house.  Interiors should be listed. There was a recent theft of fireplaces from a house in North Great Georges Street.  This must be stamped out.  There are people stealing these valuable artefacts more or less to order.</P>
    <P>We should develop an integrated approach with the airlines.  Aer Lingus is a great asset.  It is a friendly airline and the attitude of the staff is exemplary.  We should also develop the air networks.  For example, why do we not have a regular, scheduled, even twice weekly flight between Dublin and Tel Aviv?  There is a huge outward market with pilgrimages and there is an immense market there that would come to Ireland if they could fly directly.</P>
    <P>There are an enormous number of tourists coming from America to London.  A very high proportion of them have Irish roots, but the vast majority do not come here.  We must use the airlines, as well as a marketing approach, in order to ensure that as much as possible of the tourist potential comes here.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise the malign influence of Dublin vocational education committee.  They have a number of historic buildings which they have systematically abused.  No. 20, North Great Georges Street, which was the home of Sir Samuel Ferguson, who wrote &ldquo;The Lark in the Clear Air&rdquo; and with a drawing room where W.B. Yeats attended his first literary salon, is now in the possession of the vocational education committee. They have flattened the eighteenth century garden and turned it into a car park.  The fireplaces were illicitly removed from the building, but it still has stunning eighteenth century ceilings.  They do good work in educating people from deprived areas.  However, it does not need to be done under ceilings by Francini or West or Michael Stapleton or Charles Thorpe.  Why not get the vocational education committee out of the building and turn it into part of a complex involving the Joyce centre, the Writers' Museum, the writers' centre and the Municipal Gallery and put into it a museum of eighteenth century costume, furniture and musical instruments?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Places like Strokestown House, Carriglass Manor and the King House in Boyle have become places of huge interest.  Tourists can build their holidays around these.  Our famous writers draw tourists as well.</P>
      <P>We are living in an age of marketing where you have to sell your wares at the fair.  Good marketing is important, something we have learned much about in recent years.  There is no doubt that the Minister and his Department are marketing Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county tourism committees were a very welcome development.  They do not need much funding but some on an ongoing basis is necessary. Most of the members of county tourism <Col N="1446" /> committees give up their time at their own expense.  Many of them are in the tourist industry. It is important that that structure is encouraged. I know that the Minister has been generous in the past.</P>
    <P>In the midlands, especially in the Shannon region, tourism is based on fishing, especially coarse fishing.  I welcome the various projects that have been funded.  I experienced one project in Lanesborough and the support received from the Department was excellent.  I compliment the staff and the Minister on that project.  It underlined how a local community with State and EU funding can come together to improve facilities.</P>
    <P>The inland areas, especially along the Shannon, and towns like Lanesborough, Clondra and Ballyleague may become special designated areas. Some of the coastal areas which received help were traditional tourist centres which had lost out for one reason or another and it was a good idea to bring life back to them.  We are asking for similar treatment for the Shannon region.  Traditionally, the midlands has been by-passed by tours. However, this is rapidly changing.  The effort and initiative is present in local communities if they get support.</P>
    <P>I welcome the outstanding tourist figures the country has enjoyed over the past number of years and the efforts being made to sell Ireland nationally.  Hopefully this progress will continue.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to CERT.  They have done a fantastic job over the years.  Jim Nugent and his staff are turning out people who can take their place in the catering and tourism industries.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy O'Sullivan to the House.  All of us agree that tourism growth has been phenomenal over the last number of years.  The implementation of the first operational programme for tourism from 1989-94 and the second one from 1994-9 has obviously created the required impact that its planners hoped it would. However, there are serious regional imbalances regarding the inward flow of people.  There is great concern over the explosion of hotel accommodation in Dublin and the east coast.  This is welcome in one way because, as a result of the urban renewal scheme, it has created an entire new inner city in many parts of Dublin, as similar schemes have done in other cities that were derelict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to focus on Dublin and the location of hotels there.  Hotel analysts indicate that the number of hotels in Dublin has not yet reached saturation point; there is potential for a 20 per cent increase in hotel accommodation before reaching that point.  One of the sad aspects of the explosion in the number of hotels in Dublin is the fact that we have yet to encourage one of the major hotel chains to locate here.  I am aware of the planning controversy that surrounded the siting of the Hilton Hotel in College Green and I understand it has gone through the planning process.  This will be the first major international hotel chain to locate in Ireland.  That is the upside.  The downside <Col N="1447" /> is that when this country has finally attracted a hotel of such stature to our capital it should locate in the heart of Dublin and take over what is effectively a listed building and part of our architectural heritage.  No Government can dictate where entrepreneurs will locate their businesses but I had a great deal of sympathy with those who opposed the location of the Hilton Hotel on Westmoreland Street, College Green.  It could have been located elsewhere and would still have done good business.  There must be inadequacy in our policies that we are unable to attract the Sheratons, Hyatt Regencies and other major hotel chains which operate across the world.  If Dublin is to be a truly international city it must look at that issue.</P>
    <P>I opened my remarks by mentioning the imbalance in the tourism industry.  Government will have to recognise that in areas with low population and low investment capital but high scenic beauty there is a need to provide some form of subsidy to involve people in the tourism industry. The operational programme militated against those who wished to get involved in the industry at the lower level.  If one wished to build a hotel it had to contain at least 18 rooms and, even if one were eligible for funding, one received only 20p in the pound.</P>
    <P>There are counties in the north-west of Ireland, such as County Leitrim, which cannot boast of having even one major hotel.  There are hotels in County Leitrim, and I cast no reflection on their service, ability or attractiveness; but it does not have a major hotel, even though the county relies almost exclusively on the tourism industry.  Only south Kerry and parts of west Cork have a similar dependence.  Whenever one meets people who have an interest in tourism one hears the same cry: &ldquo;We do not have the money or the venture capital to invest in tourism, we do not have the tax incentives that are available in large urban centres, so how are we to provide the necessary support services?&rdquo;.  One can have all the scenic beauty in the world and one can even improve the infrastructure, as has thankfully happened over the last two years, but without incentives one will not attract potential investors from outside the region into what are perceived to be relatively poor economic areas, and there are many such areas all over Ireland.</P>
    <P>Somebody once told me that if he had sufficient money to build a hotel he would look to a line south of Dublin to Galway because of lower population and less attractive returns north of that line.  The only way to develop essential tourist infrastructure is to help the indigenous population and those who are prepared to put their own finances into the industry but who do not have sufficient capital.  In the mid-term review of the operational programme, and certainly if Regional and Structural Funds continue after 1999, there must be a change in that regard. There should be a serious look at the lack of <Col N="1448" /> investment opportunities in regions which badly need tourist infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I am talking about tax incentives and I make no apologies for seeking Government hand-outs in that regard.  They are necessary in a situation such as County Leitrim's which does not have the wherewithal or the financial clout to compete for industrial projects but does have the raw material for the tourism industry&mdash;lakes, rivers, mountains and the essential ingredient of a friendly welcoming people.  It is and should be the social obligation of a compassionate and caring Government to try and slice the cake as evenly as possible within its ability to do so.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, referred to illegal bed and breakfast operators.  This is a scandal of national proportions that has been benignly ignored by successive Governments and by the Revenue Commissioners.  Surely it is unfair that somebody who invests their money in the bed and breakfast market, approaches Bord Fáilte to be included in its brochure and pays the registration fee of, in the north-west, £150 per year in order to put the shamrock sign outside their door must compete with people who are also bed and breakfast operators but who do not register and&mdash; although nobody can prove it&mdash;perhaps do not even declare their income from that operation.  I have raised this issue continuously since I was elected to the Seanad.  I do so, not to drive to the wall people who allegedly might not be paying the few pounds in tax that is due to the Exchequer, but to point out the inequities in the system.</P>
    <P>In County Leitrim there is an operator who by dint of his own endeavours has built a number of Irish cottage style houses which are operating very successfully.  His market is mainly European. This year the operator will not take part in Bord Fáilte promotions and will not register.  He will carry out his own promotional activities to fill the houses because the operator believes Bord Fáilte has done nothing for him.  If such a major operator, which he is in the context of County Leitrim, takes such action, there is a need to look at the effectiveness of Bord Fáilte in marketing Ireland. The board has had problems.  The Gulliver system, for example, was touted as the most wonderful thing that ever happened but it has not provided the returns that were expected.  The small to medium sized tourism providers at the lower level in the regions of Ireland&mdash;the big hotel chains can afford to do their own marketing promotion&mdash;require as much support as they can get.  There is a need to examine the relationship between Bord Fáilte at regional level and those operators to see how it can be strengthened and improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We can be proud of how the tourism industry has performed in the past two or three years.  Hopefully, it will continue to improve and contribute to our economy.  Like the previous speaker, I wish to refer to the inherent imbalances in the system with regard to the regions.  It <Col N="1449" /> is important that people who are endeavouring to develop tourism in areas which are not natural tourist destinations should be assisted.  County Limerick is not regarded as a traditional tourist destination but as a corridor to Kerry, Clare or the west.  The view was that one should travel between the west and Kerry via the Tarbert ferry rather than come through County Limerick.  Over a number of years the county has been endeavouring to offer itself as a tourism product.  These efforts should be recognised as they will create more jobs and bring additional revenue into the area.</P>
      <P>When one thinks of Limerick one thinks of Adare, which is a fantastic tourism product.  It has been assisted locally by the local authority and nationally by various Governments.  The results are there to be seen: between 100,000 and 200,000 people visit Adare every year.  Anyone coming to the region will visit the village which has some of the most excellent hotels in Ireland, in particular, Adare Manor, which is one of the top four hotels in the country.</P>
      <P>However, Adare is not the only tourism product in Limerick.  Over the past four years the various enterprises connected by the N69 coast road have come together to market themselves as a product.  I would like to draw the Government's attention to the work which has been done.  For a number of years we have tried to interest various Governments in the state of the roads in Limerick. That is not the issue for discussion today but I would ask the Government to seriously look at assisting the N69 tourism group.</P>
      <P>Many excellent products can be further developed to make County Limerick a product on a par with anywhere else in Ireland.  Celtic Park and Gardens contains 12 authentic, recreated features from Ireland's past, including a dolmen, ancient burial tomb and ring fort.</P>
      <P>There is a great opportunity to develop fishing in the Dromore lake in Pallaskenry.  The amenity is totally underdeveloped and is kept going by a local group which is trying to attract small grants.</P>
      <P>Askeaton is a mediaeval town with a Geraldine castle and 14th century Franciscan friary.  Much restoration work has been done but further work is needed.  The jewel in the area is the Foynes Flying Boat Museum which recalls Foynes as the first landing point for flights from the USA in the 1940s.  There has been considerable assistance given to this venture by Shannon Development and others and it is now marketed very successfully throughout the USA.  However, a visit to the museum only takes a few hours and by extending the product to include other amenities one would see visitors staying in the area for a day or two.</P>
      <P>The Boyce Gardens in Mountrenchard overlooking the Shannon have received national awards.  It contains a fantastic array of flowers and herbs, a greenhouse, rosebeds and so on. Glin Castle, built in 1790, is the home of the Knight of Glin and has a unique collection of 18th century furniture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> These products are there to be developed but they need assistance to collectively market themselves. They can create a tourism product which will hold people in the area and I ask the Government and the Department of Tourism and Trade to seriously consider their development.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the county is the Ballyhoura Country Farm Trail which consists of dairy and deer visitor farms.  Deer can also be seen grazing freely at the Springfield Deer Farm in Dromcollogher.</P>
    <P>Kilmallock is a historic, walled, Geraldine town with large sections of the old wall and one of the town gates remaining.  This could also be developed.  The Knockfierna Famine Commemoration Park in Ballingarry is an authentic famine site with a number of restored pre-famine buildings. The Plunkett Heritage Centre in Dromcollogher was commented on very favourably by President Robinson during her recent visit.</P>
    <P>We support the Kerrys, Galways, Connemaras and West Corks.  However, people in places like County Limerick are endeavouring to develop tourism products and they should be recognised and assisted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I would like to comment on registered and unregistered tourist accommodation.  People go to considerable trouble to be registered, conditions are imposed and that is as it should be. However, these people are then asked to compete on a non-equal footing with those who are not registered.</P>
      <P>I was approached by a constituent regarding a book of tourist accommodation.  This was quite a glossy publication and I was asked why it was not available through tourist offices.  I wrote to Departments and regional tourism organisations and the answer was that this book could not be distributed through these agencies because the accommodation included was unregistered.  I saw two very glossy pictures of two Ministers&mdash;the type of thing we are accustomed to getting from Departments&mdash;with introductions and forwards to these publications.  I found it curious that, although it was not possible for these publications to be distributed through official sources, they have the endorsement of two Ministers.  That is something into which we need to look.  Why can Ministers endorse publications for tourist accommodation which I was told was not registered?</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that guesthouses can register with Bord Fáilte and put up the Bord Fáilte sign when vetted.  However, after one year they can deregister and nothing is done to take the sign down.  We are creating an illusion.  The tourist assumes that when they see the Bord Fáilte sign there is a basic level of accommodation which is being monitored by Bord Fáilte. I was told that people are leaving signs up and nothing is being done to take them down and that people visit such accommodation expecting it to be Bord Fáilte accommodation, but it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> An aspect of tourism about which I know a little about is angling.  We have a huge natural resource, as the Minister of State knows.  He was down on Lough Mask earlier this year and I am sure from his trips around the country he knows the value of the resource.  The World Cup Angling Competition took place in Lough Mask in August.  Several hundred anglers took part in four days of heats and a final bringing an enormous amount of tourism revenue into the area&mdash; some from abroad, some from the island of Ireland and quite a number from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>What have we done to protect the resource creating that type of economic activity?  We began with the River Shannon.  I remember fishing from Banagher to Meelick Weir in clear water but Bord na Móna activities brought silt and peat in suspension down the river which is causing a problem at the top of Lough Derg and has damaged the quality of angling and the watercourse. We know what happened in Lough Derg earlier this year.  Phosphates from a sewerage system got into Lough Ennell, one of our premier trout lakes, and it become green, something to which I can testify.  It took years to recover.  Lough Sheelin was almost destroyed by people who had the same regard for the way they dealt with animal slurry as with animal growth promoters.  Quite cynically, they almost destroyed the lake which is, thankfully, beginning to recover.  It was regarded in all the angling literature as one of the premier trout lakes in Europe.</P>
    <P>Moving to the west, sea trout were brought to the point of destruction.  There is high quality angling in this area and people contribute large sums of money to the local economy.  I recounted the following story in the House before and I will do so again.  When I began fishing on Lough Corrib people came to Oughterard from America. They flew to Shannon Airport, hired a car, stayed in the area for one month and hired a gillie every day.  They contributed huge amounts to the economy of the area.  Such people can readily go to Russia, the Falkland Islands, Alaska, New Zealand or to wherever the sport is and they have the money to do so.  They are the type of tourist we need, that is, the high quality tourist.</P>
    <P>What has happened to Lough Corrib, Lough Mask and Lough Gara?  Predator control has been lost.  The old Inland Fisheries Trust did an excellent job in predator control.  There is a huge controversy between pike and trout anglers.  I have had representations from the people in Ballinrobe who organised the world cup and from others on what is being done to the western lakes. The Western Regional Fisheries Board has a development plan for the lakes.  To me, these lakes are primarily salmonoid waters, trout and salmon, and pike fishing is secondary.  There are plenty of other waters in the country to which pike can be brought or encouraged.  The two can be treated separately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> What happened to Lough Conn where there is algae growth?  It was impossible to fish the mayfly on Lough Arrow.  Let us not deceive ourselves; we are whistling past the graveyard if we are promoting angling tourism in Ireland.  One only has to pick up the angling press&mdash;<i>Trout and Salmon</i> is a classic example and an English publication&mdash; to read what it has to say about Irish tourism.  If we want to promote Irish tourism, we had better protect the resource on which tourism is based otherwise we will have nothing.</P>

      <P>I would like to clarify a point on the registration of bed and breakfast establishments. There seems to be some confusion in this regard.  If an establishment pays its taxes and complies with planning, health and safety regulations, one cannot put it out of business.  We should encourage those outside the fold to register. I would prefer to coax rather than coerce. They are not doing anything illegal, although there is a perception that they are violating the law.  I am aware of the publication because it was posted to me.  These people are not in breach of the law.</P>
      <P>As regards Ballinrobe, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, has agreed to meet the people from Ballinrobe following a meeting with the Western Fisheries Board, to discuss the problem with the western lakes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and the Minister on the work they are doing.  The tourism industry employs 107,000 people.  Foreign earning from tourism last year amounted to £1.850 million.  The domestic market contributed £700 million.  The way we market this country is important.  The problem has been that we did not go out of our way to do so.  It was only in the past number of years that we began to look at the situation in terms of proper staff training and providing proper facilities, including leisure and heritage centres, for those visiting this country. The number of people visiting Glenveagh in County Donegal has been phenomenal.  It all comes down to marketing.  The funny thing about Glenveagh is that the majority of visitors come from Northern Ireland which is, without doubt, the main market for County Donegal.  The British market is probably our biggest; I saw figures indicating that 2.5 million visitors came from Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> Bed and breakfast establishments were mentioned tonight.  Roads into County Donegal are not welcoming for people coming from Great Britain because there are signs by groups like Saoirse and Sinn Féin saying that the British must leave Ireland and that prisoners must be released. People are being asked to pay £40 to register a sign yet these groups are putting up disgraceful signs and the local authority does not have the gumption to have them removed.  They are doing a lot of damage to the tourism trade and to life in general.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund has generated massive funds for tourism not only for training but for initiatives of which most counties have taken advantage.  Over the years Bord Fáilte has sent those arriving in Dublin to Counties Wexford, Cork and Kerry.  County Donegal never received its fair share of visitors because Bord Fáilte, although it is doing excellent work, militated against people visiting the North.</P>
    <P>If one examines a year such as 1995, when we had peace, visitor numbers to Northern Ireland increased by 65 per cent.  The following year, when the ceasefire ended, the figures dropped dramatically, probably by the same figure.  Many people liked to visit not just Northern Ireland with attractions such as the Giant's Causeway and the Carrick-a-Rede bridge but also Donegal and made a north-south holiday out of it.  There should be more co-operation between the northern Irish and southern Irish tourist boards. Efforts were made during peacetime to bring the two groups together and this was effective.  We should not stop now that peace has broken down but continue to work at it strongly.</P>
    <P>The Government is to be congratulated on the initiative it showed in the budget in improving the tax situation which makes it easier to employ people in hotels and B&amp;Bs.  Until now, there was a massive black economy in that area and people were taking advantage of the situation.  With the changes taking place, it is important that we encourage entrepreneurs to create as many hotel and bed and breakfast places as possible.</P>
    <P>I congratulate people, especially in my county, who go to Scotland and organise busloads of people to come to the county.  It will be found in Donegal that hotels in places such as Letterkenny and Bundoran are packed out most weekends. Good business people have gone to Great Britain and sold their packages well.  This is good for the economy and for work in those areas.</P>
    <P>Another excellent initiative last year was the injection by the Minister's Department of some £100,000 into the Dublin parade.  If we were to market the weekend better this year and take real advantage of it, perhaps there could be other weekends we could sell which would bring decent money into the country.  Our approach and marketing ideas are good but we must maintain and develop them.</P>
    <P>Donegal has a serious problem with access, whether by land, air or sea.  It is important that the road network in the county be upgraded.  It <Col N="1454" /> only has a regional airport which is in the far west of the county.  It is 70 miles from where I live and it is nearly as handy for me to go to Dublin.  There is no sea service as such.  I ask the Minister to impress upon Bord Fáilte the need to prioritise Donegal.  It is close to Northern Ireland and Great Britain and has a great product.  I ask that it be kept in mind when any initiatives are considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to this worthwhile discussion.  As he comes from the same area as I, he will be well aware what tourism means to our region and to Ireland by the revenue it generates.  It is an important industry which will continue growing for many years to come.  We must prepare for the future and continue to develop and improve our facilities.  We cannot sit back and say that we have a lovely green country with a nice environment.  Tourists do not come just for that and there are many ways by which they can be enticed to visit. Senator Dardis mentioned angling as one.  There are many others, such as walking and watersports, which can develop our tourism industry.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there are many faults in the tourism industry as well.  My colleague from Donegal mentioned the infrastructure within counties.  The accommodation in this country is good compared to others I have visited.  Guest houses and other accommodation are registered and subject to control.  A person who is dissatisfied with the level of service they receive can make a complaint to the registration authority. Unregistered people seem to provide whatever facilities they want and that interferes with the genuine registered people.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also examine the grading of guest houses similar to that of hotels.  Today, there are different grades of guest houses in some areas and between different counties.  Tourists are entitled to a list showing the quality of guest houses, because they might stay in a reasonable guest house in Donegal, pay the same price to stay in a massive new development in Galway and then stay in an unregistered poor quality guest house in the south-west with poor facilities.  Such people leave the country with a wrong image.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first task for everyone who enters the tourism industry, especially the guest house area, is to get the shamrock symbol because Americans and Europeans are told not to stay in a B&amp;B unless there is a shamrock symbol outside.  Successful applicants sometimes think that once they have the symbol, Bord Fáilte will send them droves of people.  Everyone in the business knows that this does not happen and that one must generate business. After a year or two, some leave and do not pay their registration fee.  I can see various reasons why they do that.  For example, a person pays anything up to £300 to be a recognised guest house included in Bord Fáilte's listings.  When a booking comes from the tourist office in the high season&mdash;it will not come in the low season&mdash;it will charge the guest house a booking fee of £3 which will be charged on all subsequent bookings. <Col N="1455" /> The guest house ends up with perhaps only £13 out of £16.  Bord Fáilte charges a fee of £3 after already charging a registration fee.  Why would one be involved with it in the first place?  It would be better not to bother paying the £300 registration fee or the booking fee and instead to ring up the registered people and ask them to send on the overflow.  That is what is wrong with the business, but it is the way it is going.  One feels sorry for those in it who are legitimate and pay taxes, fees, guest house water charges, which were not abolished, and all other charges.  They are the ones who need the help.</P>
    <P>Dublin is crowded with tourists.  Anyone who visits Ireland wants to see Dublin and that is a known fact.  After that, they will select a few places they want to visit such as Donegal, Mayo or Killarney.  The infrastructure is not there for them to go to these places.  The Minister should examine this with the Minister for the Environment. There are 2,573 miles of road in my county and people's impression of them is that they are in a scandalous state.  I do not mind about small narrow winding roads.  They are an attraction in themselves, like the Ring of Kerry, which is a lovely drive.  However, they are lovely providing the roads have a good surface and are not full of potholes so deep one could drown in them or break a spring on the car.  That is also what is wrong with the business.</P>
    <P>Local county groups must be commended for the work they do to promote tourism in their areas.  They have invested money in heritage centres, etc., to attract people to their counties. There are at least 50 different types of hotels in County Kerry, for example, which try to promote their hotels abroad.</P>
    <P>A proper marketing service must be provided. I compliment Bord Fáilte for spending approximately £6.5 million on its promotion drive last year.  Although EU money is available, it is not being spent to market the industry.  Many countries, such as Japan, are not being targetted as well as they should.  Our facilities for wind sports, walking, fishing and shooting are the best in the world.  We also have beautiful scenery and a clean environment.  Farm pollution grants must be paid so that farmers can keep the environment clean. It is pointless trying to protect our environment if we do not have the proper finances.</P>
    <P>We must plan for the future.  Anyone involved in tourism knows there is not enough accommodation during August but there is no shortage during October or November.  We must lengthen the tourist season by providing alternative sports facilities which do not depend on the weather. People do not come to Ireland for the weather but for the facilities we offer.  Developments in aviation mean that people can travel to and from this country in a few hours.  We must provide sufficient accommodation and recreational facilities to attract these visitors to Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am one Member of the House who should be speaking in whispers because County Monaghan is the lowest tourism earner in the country.  Occasionally I travel to Kerry where <Col N="1456" /> I meet many tourists.  However, the situation is different in Monaghan, although there are good angling facilities in the county.  Many people work hard to attract visitors to the area but it is difficult because we do not have a coastline which is a great attraction.  We keep talking about the Bragan mountain but every county has a mountain. It is largely undeveloped because people do not come to the area in large numbers.  I hope the developments at Lough Muckno in Castleblayney will continue and that people will visit it.</P>
      <P>One project which could make a difference to County Monaghan is the development of the Ulster Canal.  This canal was built in the last century but it fell into ruin.  It runs from Clones to Monaghan across the Border and up to Lough Neagh.  If it was developed and accommodation provided, we would be able to attract families.  It would serve as a good tourism base.</P>
      <P>The standard of hotels in Monaghan is incredible for a county with such a small tourism base. One of the Minister's colleagues was in Monaghan a few nights ago and he was amazed at the standard of the hotel in which he was staying.  He was also surprised to learn that one person was working full time trying to attract visitors from the continent to Monaghan town.  The hotel has been included in fly drive holidays and it is being extended as a result.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to invest money in County Monaghan because, even since I came to Monaghan 30 years ago, we have been propping up tourism.  The Ulster Canal is an essential development which will pay huge dividends into the next century.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Ulster Canal is reopened because this would allow the county to make money from tourism. The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should do a feasibility study on this project.</P>
      <P>A small town beside Carrickmacross called Shercock is not included on any tourist map, although it has three or four great fishing lakes. That is a disgrace.  I hope the Minister rectifies that omission.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Government and the Minister on the record number of visitors coming here.  Dublin and many other locations are benefiting greatly as a result and I am sure there will be enormous growth in this area over the next few years.</P>

However, he did not mention Newcastlewest which is one of the main towns in the mid-west and is well worth a visit.  If we want to develop our tourism industry, we must pay attention to details.  Every road must be well signposted and we must pay attention to languages.  Each bank and restaurant in the major towns must employ someone who can speak French and German.  There must also be ATM machines in every bank so that visitors can access their money.  Our restaurants, shops and tourist offices must be open to suit the customer, not the person serving behind the counter.  I hope the Minister continues the good work.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to hear my views on why Cork regional technical college must immediately be upgraded to institute of technology status.  I regret that we are discussing this issue.  Following the protest outside the Department of Education last Monday, it is clear that the staff of the regional technical college and the business people and the community at large in Cork are fully behind the students in their endeavour to ensure that the college is upgraded.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, announced she would set up an expert group to monitor, adjudicate and lay down the criteria for the future upgrading of regional technical colleges to institute of technology status. However, that is a political smokescreen because a lot of pressure has been applied to Government Deputies and the Minister to ensure Cork regional technical college is upgraded.  If the Minister can, at the stroke of a pen, upgrade Waterford regional technical college to gain political advantage, I see no reason why she cannot upgrade Cork regional technical college, not for political reasons but because it deserves it, it warrants it and the city needs it.  Not only that, but the business community is fully integrated in providing support for the college and employing graduates.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the criteria, there is no doubt that Cork regional technical college should have been upgraded before Waterford regional technical college.  I do not begrudge Waterford its upgrading but there should be a level playing pitch.  The basic requirements of education today are that students should be given the greatest degree of flexibility in their degree courses and allowed the time and support to go into the workplace. Cork regional technical college has given this to its students.  Considering the investment that businesses have made in the college and the dedication of its staff, there is no reason why the Government should delay its upgrading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The college offers numerous degree, diploma and masters courses.  Some 4,500 full-time and 6,500 part-time students currently attend the college. It is everything a national institute of technology would be, except that it does not have the name.  If it is not upgraded immediately I fear people will consider it a lesser college than the <Col N="1458" /> institutes of technology in Dublin and Waterford. For that reason alone, the Minister must immediately upgrade it.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years Cork regional technical college has made numerous applications to the Department of Education to be upgraded, not because it wants the name but because it deserves it.  I have already indicated the determination and dedication of the lecturing staff and the quality of students coming from the college.  Most of the courses have a 100 per cent employment placement record, even before the students are fully qualified.  This demonstrates that the Minister should immediately accede to the request made by the students and staff of the college, Cork Chamber of Commerce, Cork Corporation, the city's Lord Mayor and Government Deputies.  If it is not upgraded in the short term, this campaign will not go away.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put herself in a difficult position. It was annoying that, for solely political purposes, she announced the upgrading of Waterford regional technical college just prior to the Taoiseach's visit to the city.  Cork regional technical college applied for upgrading at the same time as Waterford regional technical college.  It is a larger college, it offers more degree courses, it has met all the criteria satisfied by Waterford, along with many more.  If Waterford is being upgraded the Government should immediately do the same for Cork so that its status is not undermined and students who leave the college this year and in future years will have degrees from the CIT, the Cork Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the college should not be upgraded.  The Minister is obviously afraid that other regional technical colleges will also apply for an upgraded status, but if that happens let them be judged on their merits.  The leading regional technical college in the country should have been the first to be upgraded and the others should have tried to follow the achievements of Cork over the years.</P>
    <P>The protests outside the Department make it plain that the students are serious about this&mdash; 3,000 of them would not have travelled from Cork to voice their opinion if they were not.  For the sake of the students, the staff, those placing graduates in employment and providing valuable jobs in the area, and the economics of the city, I urge the Minister to upgrade the college.  Otherwise Cork will suffer in many ways.  Students may opt to go not to Cork regional technical college but to universities in Dublin, the Dublin Institute of Technology or the new Waterford Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>There is no need to worry about educational drifting as regards Cork regional technical college. This can be seen in the statistics available from the students union, the staff and the governing body, all of whom have met the Minister.  The biggest problem for Cork regional technical college at present is that its courses have higher points criteria that similar courses in other regional technical colleges.  It has a shortage of <Col N="1459" /> spaces because it has so many applicants.  If we are to downgrade Cork regional technical college, as this Government is doing by not granting it the status it requests and deserves, students will no longer accept a place there and will try to go to Waterford or Dublin.  The south-west region will be deprived of students as they will insist on travelling. A great deal of money has been invested in the college and its staff are highly qualified.  I urge the Minister of State to impress on her party colleague the urgency of this matter.  Let the students get on with the job of furthering their education so they can enter the workplace as graduates not of Cork regional technical college but the Cork Institute of Technology.</P>

      <P>I am responding to the Senator on behalf of the Minister for Education, who is unavoidably absent.</P>
      <P>It is important to say at the outset that the status of qualifications are enhanced where any grading of the college is based on objective criteria rather than on political considerations.  The White Paper on Education sets out the Government's approach for the overall development of the higher education sector, based on a differentiated system of third level education.  One part is formed by the universities and the designated institutions under the Higher Education Authority. The other part includes the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology, with State funding allocated directly by the Department of Education.  The White Paper outlined that the remit of the Higher Education Authority will be extended to include the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology&mdash;they will come under one umbrella group.</P>
      <P>The steering committee on the future development of higher education reported in July 1995. It concluded that the expansion of the Waterford regional technical college represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south east region.  That conclusion was based on an objective report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It considered that it would be appropriate that a major element of the expansion of the regional technical college would be at degree level, while still maintaining the thrust of its activities at technician level.  The steering committee accordingly recommended provision to be made in the medium term for an increase in the total number of places in the college and for the major focus of expansion to be at degree level, with the percentage of award recipients who terminate in a given year with a degree increasing from the current 22 per cent of the total to 33 per cent.  The committee considered that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum by comparison with other regional technical colleges in terms of provision of degree places and would <Col N="1460" /> enable the region to reach the national average participation in degree programmes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education's recent announcement on the future plans for Waterford regional technical college drew on the recommendations of the steering committee on the future development of higher education, buttressed by its technical working group report which was published more than one and a half years ago.  It is a planned response based on an independent report.  The Minister has responded to Waterford's needs on the basis of independent advice.</P>
    <P>The Minister's announcement has drawn a reaction from Cork regional technical college. Clearly, staff, students and graduates are proud of their college, and rightly so.  She is concerned that the announcement about Waterford has been interpreted as in some way diminishing the status of Cork regional technical college.  This is not the case&mdash;it is a college whose excellence is there for all to see.  On the contrary, the Minister for Education has on a number of occasions congratulated Cork regional technical college on its highly significant achievements and on the fact that its standards of excellence are internationally recognised and valued.  Her announcement does not change this.</P>
    <P>The Government last week arranged for the publication of proposals from TEASTAS&mdash;the Irish National Certification Authority&mdash;for a national qualifications framework.  The TEASTAS report sets out proposals which will facilitate the growth and evolution of Cork regional technical college and the other colleges in the sector.</P>
    <P>Officials from the Department of Education met with the authorities of Cork regional technical college yesterday and on Friday last.  Detailed discussions took place about a process to facilitate the future status and development of the college within a national framework for the technological sector.  Further meetings are planned for later this week with representatives of staff and students from the regional technical college.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education proposes to establish an expert group which will develop criteria for colleges which wish to apply to become an institute of technology within the national qualifications framework&mdash;an objective process, in other words.  The group will also advise on the process under which colleges would be evaluated against the criteria.  The Minister, together with her officials, is actively involved in refining the process at the present time, including contacts with the various concerned interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister will make a fuller statement in this regard very shortly.  I emphasise again that validating any change in the status of Cork regional technical college by an independent process is the best way to enhance the status of the qualifications awarded by that process.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 January 1997.</P>
