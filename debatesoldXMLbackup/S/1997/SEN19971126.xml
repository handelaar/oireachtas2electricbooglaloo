      <P>I have notice from Senator McGowan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources to make a statement on the returns for investment in the forestry industry.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cregan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources to make a full, comprehensive and factual statement in relation to the recent spillage from Whitegate refinery.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to review eligibility for the Christmas bonus for certain categories of social welfare recipients, particularly for those who have recently completed CE schemes.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to take urgent measures to reduce the hospital waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide funding for a full-time rehabilitation worker in Tipperary North to meet the needs of the blind in that county.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator McGowan's and Senator Cregan's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Doyle, Senator Costello and Senator O'Meara may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Col N="938" />
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8, Motion 10, regarding the county tourism committees, which will be taken from 6 to 8 p.m. Items 1, 2 and 3 are to be taken without debate.  The contribution of spokespersons on item 4 will not exceed 20 minutes and in the case of all other Senators, 15 minutes. Senators may share their time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have a problem with the Order of Business.  However, may I ask the Leader of the House a question in view of the recent arrests and appearances before certain courts of people on serious drug offences who had to be released because they had not been presented before a properly designated District Justice?  This shows up a serious systems failure in the Department of Justice.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice to give an explanation to this House in relation to these matters as he did in the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if we can agree to item 3 on the Order of Business.  We have not yet had a chance to discuss it together.  It is something to which I, personally, feel we cannot agree.  I can understand the Leader wanting to make the Order of Business as efficient as possible, but there may be occasions on which it would be inadvisable to have this 30 minute rule.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader again ask the Minister for Health and Children if he would produce the guidelines for dealing with raped, pregnant and suicidal 13 year olds?  In the Dáil the Minister said guidelines and protocols existed which the health board has brought into operation in the case which is now before the courts.  I have not been able to obtain these guidelines and I asked the Leader last week if he could obtain them for me.  I would be grateful if he would.  While suicide is not a danger in pregnancies which are wanted, it is not true that it is not a danger in unwanted pregnancies.  There is plenty of literature on that matter and I would like to be sure the health boards are taking this into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We find some difficulty agreeing to item 3 as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator agreed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can agree with the proposal that the Order of Business should not exceed 30 minutes.  I would like to hear the Leader explain why he thinks we should embark on this particular course.  As we know, there is a large number of Members who, from time to time, are anxious to get information and the Order of Business provides an opportunity for them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader facilitate us with a debate on unemployment in the food sector?  We have had serious announcements concerning the loss of 750 <Col N="939" /> jobs in Avonmore both in Dungarvan and in Rathfarnham in Dublin.  Traffic problems was the reason given for the loss of jobs in Rathfarnham, but that is nonsensical.  We need a full scale debate on that matter and I would appreciate it if the Leader would facilitate that.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation the proposals by the management of Wimbledon Football Club to relocate in Dublin which the FAI believes would destroy the League of Ireland.  The reason for doing so is financial.  Mr. Murdoch wants to put Dublin on the map in terms of Sky Sports.  The football world is concerned about this matter.  Perhaps the Minister will come to the House and debate the matter where a club from Britain could dominate the market here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to all Senators to confine their contributions to matters relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that agreement was reached on item 3 at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Something must be done to tighten up the Order of Business.  I know you, a Chathaoirligh, have endeavoured to ensure that debates do not take place on the Order of Business and that we confine ourselves to what is on the Order Paper.  That must be commended.</P>
      <P>There have been many criticisms about the delay in publishing official reports.  However, official reports have been speedily produced in recent weeks.  The people responsible should be congratulated and get the plaudits they deserve because they have been criticised often enough in the past.</P>
      <P>Job losses, particularly those in Avonmore, are a matter of serious concern.  My understanding is that the severance package being negotiated is voluntary and is generous by any standards.  It will ensure our dairy industry is competitive on international markets.  While it is unfortunate that people should lose their jobs, the wider national benefit dictates that the Avonmore-Waterford group takes this course of action.  It will ensure that those who lose their jobs are well looked after.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not allow a debate on item 3 on the Order of Business.  The Leader of each group agreed to place this motion on the Order Paper at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on whether we should continue to hold professional boxing fights here in which both fighters are managed by the same person who also promotes the event.  This is a recipe for disaster and it is only puts money in the pockets of people such as Mr. Hearn and Mr. Eastwood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> I would also like a debate on the 50th anniversary of the setting up of the state of Israel which occurred on 29 November 1947.  It is one of only two states which was set up by vote at the United Nations.  However, there were more abstentions than voters at that meeting.  The advice given by President Truman and others was to &ldquo;get them off our backs&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, that has not happened for other peoples.  There is a need to address this issue as a matter of urgency.  It is a matter of concern for Ireland because we are involved through our participation in UNIFIL, UNWRA and other bodies.</P>
    <P>We should have a debate on the Middle East in general, and the situation in Palestine and Palestinian-Israeli relations in particular, as close as possible to 29 November, which is next Saturday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science has announced he is bringing forward legislation to deal with school truancy which will have particular regard to the outer suburbs of west Dublin.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister my delight that he is doing so and ask him to include a provision, for which I have asked for ten years as a member of a local authority, under which gardaí would not be school truancy officers in the outer fringes of Dublin?  That is why we have the present problem.  The appointment of school attendance officers should not be left to a local authority which is underfunded.  If we, like Dublin Corporation, had school attendance officers, we would not have such a problem today. I wish the Minister well with the legislation and ask the Leader to take that on board.</P>

      <P>I hope, being a new Senator, that I am not going entirely outside the Order the Business but I am sure you will tell me if I am, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We must confine ourselves to matters relevant to the Order of Business. There are Standing Orders which allow Senators the opportunity to raise matters in other ways.  I appeal to Senators to avail of the opportunities presented by those Standing Orders and raise matters on the Adjournment, as matters of concern to Senators or as Private Members' business. I cannot allow speeches on the Order of Business. Next Senators will be issuing scripts of what they said on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am hoping that it may come under the heading of recreation.  It is a matter <Col N="941" /> of grave concern which I want to bring to the notice of the Leader of the House.  I hope he, in turn, will bring it to the notice of the appropriate Minister.</P>
      <P>There is a very thin line between satire and blasphemy.  I believe that line was breached on &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo; last Friday night.  It is totally unacceptable in a country which is largely Christian, North and South, that we must be subjected to what happened on &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo; because it is not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.  The Seanad has no control over what is or is not included on &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo; or any other show.</P>

      <P>This debate is out of order. This is an example of what will happen if we do not confine ourselves to matters which are relevant to the Order of Business.  Senator Ó Murchú, I have allowed you to raise the matter which you wished to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise relates to the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Bill, 1997.  I refer to the protests due to be staged tomorrow by students from plc colleges in respect of funding they did not receive for their courses.  These protests will take place in Galway, Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Some students have been forced to abandon their courses because they cannot pay their fees.  Will the Minister for Education and Science release the funding promised by the Government to enable students to continue their education?  I know two young students who have already been forced to pull out of their courses because their parents could not afford to pay their fees.  I am also familiar with students who have been obliged to take part-time work to pay for their education. This matter is relevant because I would not like those students to be forced to take to the streets tomorrow.  I hope the Minister will announce today that the funds will be made available.</P>

      <P>Those of us who work as a technical group on the Independent benches do not have a leader, we have a representative on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who can make whatever agreements he chooses.  We are not bound by such agreements unless consulted prior to their conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should inform the relevant Member of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Member can read my statement which is now on record.  The Independent Senators know how to work together without being supine to each other.  We see no need to genuflect to the leader in the way members of political parties do.  We are capable of conducting our affairs with a reasonable level of debate and dissent without the need to impose disciplinary Whips on each other.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader endeavour to arrange a debate on the appalling sanctions the United States has imposed on its near neighbour Cuba for the past 40 years?  We have requested a debate on this matter on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion Senator O'Toole referred to the desirability of a debate on the success of the education sector.  This matter was adverted to earlier in the week by a senior executive of a multinational who stated that our education system is among the best in the world.  The same could not be said for Independent Newspapers in the context of the print media. Members involved in the education sector would welcome the opportunity to place on record the <Col N="943" /> achievements of that sector.  I appeal to the Leader to allow us to do so.</P>
    <P>I support calls for a debate on the 1,200 redundancies announced by Waterford Avonmore.  I believe multinationals have a responsibility for the people they employ in countries outside the one in which they are based.  Similarly, multinationals from other countries operating in Ireland and Irish multinationals have obligations to their employees abroad.  I make no distinctions, multinationals are nasty institutions and they must be monitored.  This issue must be debated because the Common Agricultural Policy is the largest anti-competitive cartel in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of order, I suggest that Senator Ó Murchú should refer his complaint to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, which is often inactive, and see what happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on broadcasting in the near future because of the general decline in standards in that industry?  This might provide the opportunity sought by Senator Ó Murchú to discuss the blasphemous portrayal of Christ on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on Friday evening last.  I remind RTÉ &mdash; I am sure the DPP is considering the matter &mdash; that blasphemy remains a crime under the Constitution.  If a debate on broadcasting took place in the near future, we might be afforded the opportunity to discuss these matters in a wider framework than that available on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to clarify the present status of the now unoccupied Pretty Polly factory in Killarney, in particular with regard to its ownership?  It is a fine 120,000 square foot building on 14 acres which has been unoccupied since 1995.  Replacements have been found for industries in other parts of the country which have closed and there is a strong feeling that south County Kerry is being passed over.  The matter should be addressed urgently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader has agreed to an early debate on agriculture.  I am concerned about the quality control of imported milk.  Milk is being retailed at 79p for two litres and it is not <Col N="944" /> subject to quality control.  The debate on agriculture should cover this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House may consider raising at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges an extension of the number of matters raised on the Adjournment, which may help the Cathaoirleach on the Order of Business. Senators are frustrated that they cannot raise issues which are of concern to them from a vocational or constituency perspective.  In the Lower House four matters are discussed on the Adjournment of that House.  Such an arrangement might help the Cathaoirelach to rule more firmly on matters if Senators could raise their concerns on the Adjournment.  It may provide an alternative to this charade.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the third Statutory Paper laid before the House, referring to the Registrar of Friendly Societies, will the Leader ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to use her good offices to urge the registrar to approve the new rules for credit unions drawn up following the legislation passed by the Oireachtas this year?  The legislation came into effect on 1 October but the credit unions cannot offer the extensive range of additional services to their members because of a hold up in the rules, resolving which would help many credit unions.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend in the House for a debate on the Refugee Act, 1996, particularly in the light of the intemperate, ill considered and ill-informed remarks made about refugees and asylum seekers by a Member of the Oireachtas in the last couple of days?  The remarks would have done justice to Norman Tebbit in the worst days of the Thatcherite Conservatives.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Non-Statutory Papers laid before the House, Nos. 3 to 16, which refer to the annual reports of county enterprise boards, will the Leader arrange for an early debate on these annual reports?  They cover a wide spectrum and are of interest to Members.  It would provide a unique opportunity for the House to debate publicly the affairs of the boards, which do a good job, and would contribute to transparency.  Local authorities do not offer <Col N="945" /> the same opportunity and the Parliament is an appropriate place for such a debate.  Will the Leader find out if there is a statutory obligation on the area partnership boards and the Leader groups to lay their annual reports before the Oireachtas?  If so, the House could also debate them.</P>

      <P>I am greatly concerned at the state of well-being of the Almighty if he or she requires the assistance of Senator Ó Murchú or Senator Lydon to protect him or her.  I would have thought for somebody omnipotent, it was rather unnecessary.</P>
      <P>I support the call by my colleague and friend, Senator Lanigan, on the need for a debate on the Middle East.  However, holding such a debate to coincide with the celebration of the founding of the state of Israel is mischievous as this is a friendly state. I would welcome the opportunity to take part in that debate and to make considered criticism of the policy of the present Government.  If, however, it was held in a malign atmosphere, I would feel restricted in so doing.  I look to the wisdom of the Leader in organising an appropriate time as soon as possible to hold the debate but not mischievously to coincide with the anniversary which, in normal circumstances, would be an opportunity for celebration.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader intend instigating a debate on Sunday opening?  I note a Bill is before the other House.  Members would welcome an opportunity to discuss this matter in light of the fact that British multinationals are using commercial pressure to force Irish companies to open on Sundays against the wishes of many of their employees.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the establishment of the committees, a matter with which we will deal today. There has been a general welcome for the re-establishment of the committees and, indeed, their proliferation.  Will the Leader reassure the House that matters previously covered by a small number of committees will be covered by the increased number?  There is concern among my colleagues about the fact that, for example, no committee will cover completely the former Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  In addressing this, perhaps he will reassure the House that at least one committee will be able to investigate and examine the dealings of bodies such as CIE, RTÉ, VHI, ESB, Bord na Móna and Coillte otherwise it would appear that these bodies are so closely tied in with departmental responsibility that they will avoid discussing matters relevant to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I promise in future to be as brief as possible but I join with Senator Doyle in saying that there is a natural tendency among Members to wish to raise matters on the Order of Business which may not get ventilated otherwise and, particularly, when the gentlepersons of the press are in the House.  I have been asked to inquire of the Leader when item 7 on the Order Paper, the <Col N="946" /> Scientific and Technological Education Investment Fund Bill, 1997, will be taken.  I note an Order for Second Stage on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House as a matter of urgency to debate local authority funding?  The reason this is urgent is I understand a local authority funding Bill will be initiated in the Dáil shortly.  It would benefit the Minister to hear the views of Members of this House, particularly those at the coalface of the problem.  In my short time in this House and in politics, this is the greatest problem I have encountered.  In my county, local authority members receive £0.25 million towards local improvement schemes but in excess of £8 million is needed to bring schemes up to date.  I ask that the Minister come to the House to hear our views.  We have been told by the Minister for Finance that the Exchequer is awash with funds so perhaps we will get a proper share of that funding.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science the farcical situation where education grants are being paid by local authorities to students attending colleges in the UK?  I propose that the grants be paid in sterling because of the considerable difference in the exchange rate between it and the punt.  When the exchange rate between the two currencies favoured the punt, the Department of Education paid grants in sterling.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the position and ensure the grants are paid in sterling to hard pressed Irish students attending colleges in England?</P>

      <P>The Education Bill will be discussed in the House next week; this will provide Members with an opportunity to express their views when the Minister is present.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a statement in this House similar to that made to the Dáil yesterday.  The Minister will be here in two weeks' time when he will be initiating a new Bill, so perhaps the Senator could raise the matter with him then.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Henry's point about health board guidelines, I expect a reply this evening and will inform the House in the morning.  As regards the points made by Senators Dardis, Henry and Costello on item 3, I remind Members that this was agreed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges; it is for a trial period until Christmas.  I and the Cathaoirleach, who is Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, must know whether we are dealing with a group of Independents or independent individuals because we conduct our business with the Leaders of the groups in good faith.  The allocation of committees will take place this evening, and I need to know before 5 p.m. if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> Senator Costello expressed concern about the serious traffic congestion in Rathfarnham; I will convey his views to the relevant Minister.  I remind the Senator that after the 1991 local elections a significant amount of money to address the situation in that area was rejected by many political parties.  The unfortunate residents of that area are suffering the consequences of that regrettable decision made at the time for political advantage.  The tourism issue raised by the Senator can be discussed with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on the motion in Private Members' time this evening.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan and Senator Norris asked for a debate on Israel and the Middle East.  This is more suited to the Adjournment or, if they wish to pursue it further, we can see if they can be facilitated by having a discussion on it.</P>
    <P>No time is left in this session for the many good suggestions coming before the House.  I ask Members to use Private Members' time to raise issues.  Next week is the turn of the Independent Senators and the week after is the Fine Gael Party's turn.  If Members could make these suggestions at their group meetings, prioritise them and bring them before the House, it would help many Senators in their anxiety to have urgent issues discussed.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge raised the issue of schools attendance officers.  The Minister for Education and Science will be in the House next week to deal with the Education Bill and the Senator can make this point on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman expressed serious concern about students.  We should welcome the Minister's announcement about the provision of £1.5 million for all students of families who hold a medical card to ensure they will not have to pay examination fees.  That is very welcome and I am sure the Senator concurs.</P>

      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan called for a debate on Cuba.  I have no problem with such a debate in principle and I will try to make time available.  The Education Bill will be before the House next week and the Senator can raise the matter on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon called for a debate on broadcasting. Senator Mooney and I were spokespersons on broadcasting for a long time and I propose to allocate time for such a debate on Thursday week.  Perhaps Senators Ó Murchú and Lydon can express their concerns about last weekend's television programme during that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coughlan expressed concern about the Pretty Polly factory in Killarney.  This matter is more suitable for the Adjournment where the Senator would have time afforded to him as a matter of urgency.  The Senator's concerns are shared by the Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="948" /> Law Reform and a well known Deputy in south Kerry.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan can discuss his concerns during the agriculture debate.  Senator Hayes has raised this issue three or four times.  I have afforded plenty of time to discuss the Santer proposals. I encourage Senators to make use of the time available as it may be six months, or even next autumn, before we have another debate on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney proposed a debate on the annual report of the county enterprise boards. This is a worthwhile suggestion and perhaps Fianna Fáil will include it in its Private Members' time in the week before Christmas.  I will inquire into the annual reports of other programmes including Leader, and I will report back to the Senator.</P>
    <P>I will try to facilitate Senator Norris's call for a debate on Sunday trading.  This issue has serious implication for family businesses and a Bill on this subject is before the Dáil.  RGDATA and others have serious concerns about the 7,200 family stores which survive on whatever business they can attract on Sundays; multinational stores have taken much of the business on the other six days. I am anxious to facilitate the Senator's request.</P>
    <P>The select committee is meeting at 5 p.m. to elect the Members of the Seanad to the committees; the names will be announced before the conclusion of business today so that committees can meet from this evening onwards.  Senator Norris mentioned that the performances of semi-State companies are not included.  I will look at this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner called for a debate on local authority funding.  This issue is near and dear to the hearts of every Member and I will discuss it with the Department.  The Bill is at a very advanced stage and I will see how I can accede to the Senator's request.  Senator Burke referred to the payment of grants in sterling.  I will inquire into this matter and get in touch with the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak to the House on the proposals which were unveiled by the European Commission last July for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in the framework of Agenda 2000.  I believe that these outline Commission proposals present both challenges and opportunities and that they constitute the most important issue facing Irish and European agriculture at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 proposals have been considered by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers over the past months.  At the most recent meeting of the Council last week, it agreed on conclusions for submission to the European Council which will meet in Luxembourg next month.  Spain however, disagreed with that part of the conclusions dealing with the agricultural guidelines.  Among the conclusions reached were the following: the long-term outlook for the main agricultural markets given in Agenda 2000 was an acceptable working hypothesis and, without reform, significant surpluses could emerge; in those circumstances the reform process begun in 1992 should be continued and deepened; it is important to have adequate, suitable resources available to complete the reform process and achieve the desired model of European agriculture and to retain the Agricultural Guideline, <Col N="953" /> as a ceiling, both in principle and as at present calculated; the Commission should frame as quickly as possible its formal proposals on the basis of this agreed approach.</P>
    <P>The Commission is expected to table detailed proposals in the first quarter of 1998 in the light of the outcome of the European Council.</P>
    <P>I would like now to discuss the main areas of interest for Irish agriculture in Agenda 2000.  It must be stressed, however, that much of the detail of these broad proposals is as yet unknown and will not be available until early 1998.  Their full impact cannot therefore be estimated accurately at this stage.</P>
    <P>In general terms it is proposed by the Commission to cut the support price of beef by 30 per cent, to increase the various beef premiums including the introduction of a new beef premium for the dairy herd and to have a reduced role for intervention.  These proposals continue along the route charted in the MacSharry reform of the beef sector.  The result predicted by the Commission is a balanced EU beef market on the basis of increased domestic consumption of beef and greater penetration of non-EU markets without the aid of export refunds.</P>
    <P>Ireland accepts the need for reform but we have a number of serious concerns which I have already expressed at the EU Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The proposals are designed to increase beef consumption in the EU by reducing beef prices while at the same time enabling EU beef to be exported to third countries, in particular the south east Asian market, without subsidies, thereby avoiding WTO constraints on subsidised exports.  Beef consumption within the EU should increase if the price is substantially reduced but it is very difficult to predict by how much.  Also, it is debatable whether the EU can achieve the export market penetration envisaged with the level of price cuts proposed.  Much will depend on the price structures and production potential of the EU's major competitors.  Because of the uncertainty which must exist, I do not think that the future EU beef regime can afford not to retain an adequate safety net.  Reliance on aids to private storage, as the Commission envisages, would not be adequate in difficult market circumstances and where major market imbalance remains a threat.</P>
    <P>Another key element for consideration in relation to the future direction of the beef regime is the maintenance of a reasonable income for European beef producers.  I will be seeking to ensure that any cut in price is fully compensated. In addition, any final package which is agreed must ensure that extensive grass based systems are not disadvantaged as against the more intensive bull producing systems in the EU.  In addition to seeking enhanced production arrangements for extensive production, I will also be seeking appropriate measures to safeguard heifer beef production which would be endangered by a 30 per cent price reduction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> The outline framework for reform of the dairy sector in Agenda 2000 is as follows: an extension of the quota system until 2006; an improved flexibility and simplification of the common organisation of the market; a gradual decrease in support prices by an average of 10 per cent over the period; the introduction of a yearly direct payment of 145 ECUs for dairy cows, adjusted to average yield, in addition to a payment of 70 ECUs per cow in respect of the dairy herd's contribution to beef production.  One of the most important elements of this discussion is extension of the milk quota which is of concern to everybody in dairying.  It is important that this extension be debated.  The quota system has worked well in the Irish context and has saved many family farms.</P>
    <P>The Commission claims that its proposals represent a cautious approach and that such an approach is justified because expected market developments do not require extreme measures. However, the Commission clearly indicates that in its view the present system with its intrinsic rigidities cannot last forever.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that, despite the rigidities associated with strict supply control, the quota regime has largely benefited the dairy sector since 1984.  In general, the operation of the quota has maintained high income levels among dairy farmers and has been a successful tool of economic development in rural areas.  For these reasons, I agree with the Commission's analysis that there is no immediate need to make changes to the quota regime.  If change is required then it is preferable to signal it well in advance to allow the EU dairy sector and individual producers adapt and assist longer term planning.  Changes to the current system designed to enable the EU enhance its presence on world markets should not result in a worsening of the income of dairy farmers.  An overriding principle for me is, therefore, that any price reductions or other changes having an adverse effect on price should be accompanied by an appropriate direct aid system.</P>
    <P>In relation to the arable crops sector, the key element of the Commission's proposals is a reduction of 20 per cent in the intervention price with only half of this being compensated for by way of an increase in area aid payments.  The new rate of aid would be 66 ECUs per tonne applicable to all crops including oilseeds, linseed and protein crops and also to set-aside.  It is also proposed that these payments would be reduced if market prices remain at a higher level than currently foreseen.  A top-up of 6.5 ECUs per tonne is proposed for protein corps.  Aid for silage maize and other silage cereals would no longer be payable.  The standard rate for set-aside would be set at zero instead of the present 17.5 per cent. Voluntary set-aside would be allowed and the set-aside areas would receive the non-crop specific payment rate of 66 ECUs per tonne.  Penalty set-aside would be abolished.  The Commission's proposals stem from its analysis that intervention stocks are expected to reach 58 million tonnes by <Col N="955" /> 2005-6 unless some reform of the sector is undertaken.</P>
    <P>While the predicted growth in world demand and price trends would facilitate the disposal of increasing quantities of cereals without export subsidies on the world market, one cannot escape the conclusion that there is a clear risk of a return to substantial levels of intervention stocks with resultant strains on the EU budget and its capacity to fund adequate levels of support for farmers in all sectors.  However, if the Commission's response is to be accepted, then the reduction in prices must be fully compensated so that the incomes of growers are not reduced.</P>
    <P>Rural development is a very important issue and I am sure Members will have major contributions to make on this subject.  I believe that mainstream agriculture will remain crucial to the economic and social fabric of rural areas for the foreseeable future and that market policies will therefore remain of the utmost importance.  Having said that, other measures are required to enable farmers and rural dwellers enhance their incomes and thus enable them to remain in rural areas.  Given past trends in numbers employed in agriculture, the proposals for an increased emphasis on rural development in Agenda 2000 are therefore both necessary and welcome.</P>
    <P>I also support the idea of integrating environmental goals into the CAP and believe that the best way forward in this regard is the strengthening and extension of existing measures aimed at maintaining and enhancing the quality of the environment in general.  We all want a good environment as it is a very important part of our lives.  Budgetary resources must be made available for targeted agri-environmental measures and for the maintenance and promotion of low input systems as it is unrealistic to expect farmers to produce quality food in an environmentally friendly manner while ignoring the cost factors and effort involved.</P>
    <P>The CAP has already been subject to extensive reform and that process of reform is set to continue. It is in the interests of Ireland and other member states that European agriculture should become more competitive on world markets and be developed on a sound, stable and sustainable basis.  However, it must also be done in a way which ensures that the principles of the CAP are preserved, the interests of member states are taken into account in balanced way and, above all, the incomes of farmers and the viability of rural communities are fully protected.</P>
    <P>I am in the process of setting up four consultative groups, one each for beef, milk, cereals and rural development; Senators will understand that my Department, in setting up those consultative groups, is taking this proposed change very seriously.  I will be inviting farmers, processors and others with a direct interest, as well as academics, to serve on these groups.  These groups will remain in existence for the duration <Col N="956" /> of the negotiations and I expect an expert input from them so that the strongest possible case can be put in defence of Irish interests.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Seanad is being given an opportunity to debate these crucially important proposals. I look forward to a constructive debate and I assure Members that I will be happy to take on board any suggestions which may be put forward which would assist in advancing the interests of Irish agriculture and of rural areas as I prepare for the next phase of the negotiations. I thank Senators for their attention and I look forward to hearing contributions from both sides of the House in this very important debate. Changes will occur in both rural and urban Ireland because of the proposed reforms.  Under the guidance of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, we look forward to a very productive outcome to the negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for arranging this debate.  Since the formation of the new Seanad, there have been continuous calls for a special debate on agriculture.  It is very appropriate that we have the debate at this time. However, I am very disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture and Food did not see fit to come into the House this afternoon.  Agriculture is a subject on which many Senators wish to speak and this is the third occasion the Minister has failed to turn up.  It is grossly unfair that he is not present for this debate but that should not stop us proceeding.  As the Fine Gael spokesman on Agriculture I want this debate to be comprehensive, constructive, meaningful and informative. Above all, I want it to be a debate which will benefit not alone Irish farmers but the country in general.  That is what agriculture is all about.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is the backbone of the economy, despite the dwindling number of farmers, and will continue to be our main industry into the next millennium.  There are 140,000 people who depend on the land for a living, and thousands more work in related industries.  Villages and towns throughout Ireland are solely dependent on agriculture, and many industries in our cities depend on agriculture.</P>
      <P>Agriculture has changed greatly over the past five years.  There has been a resultant change in the rural way of life in comparison to what we knew many years ago.  Some changes are for the better; others are not so good.  However, the Santer proposals will cause even greater change. Those involved in agriculture are worried about what may happen, and as good Europeans we will take centre stage in this debate on these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef sector is our biggest industry, and there is concern about EU policies in this area. The Government must take a strong position on this matter and come forward with alternative proposals to fully protect the income and interests of the 100,000 livestock producers and <Col N="957" /> the £1.7 billion beef industry of which we are all so proud.  A beef price above the cost of production, which is approximately 80p a pound, must be maintained at all costs.  It is a tough task, but the Government cannot shy away from it.  A combination of intervention and export refunds must be fought for.  There are tough negotiations ahead that will require a hard approach from the Government.</P>
    <P>We must also conduct a vigorous campaign to get consumers to realise that Irish beef is probably the best, safest and nicest beef in the world. Despite recent bad publicity, the majority of our beef producers are beyond reproach.  I am a member of one of the first county councils to implement the Abattoirs Act which specifies that clean, healthy meat must be produced from slaughterhouses and butchers' stalls.  Securing full premium compensation for farmers is a must.  The Santer proposals will result in income cuts of £100 million for livestock producers; this must be fully negotiated.  The Minister of State should take a hard approach to this and fight hard, though it will be difficult to change attitudes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, has failed to open the live cattle trade to Egypt, and there is no excuse for this.  When we debated this matter we were guaranteed that there would be cattle going to Egypt within weeks.  That did not happen.  While canvassing in the general election, I was asked about the live cattle trade because Fianna Fáil canvassers had assured people that if Fianna Fáil were in power, markets would open as Deputies Bertie Ahern and Joe Walsh would go to Egypt, and cattle boats would sail from Waterford, and all the cattle Ireland could produce would float out of the country.  Those cattle did not float, and we are disappointed.  Cattle prices are £60 to £80 lower than they should be because the export trade did not reopen.  The failure of the Government to do so is a hallmark of its agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>The dairy sector must take pride of place because of the efforts of those involved in it to develop their industry over many years.  From Teagasc in research to the co-operatives and on to the farmers, many major developments have taken place which have put Irish dairy farmers at the top of the world league.  The Minister of State comes from the heartland of Munster where he was involved in great developments with Dairygold that benefited dairy farmers.  The dairy sector has enjoyed reasonable prosperity recently.  The Santer proposals suggest that milk price cuts be made and that farmers be compensated by direct payment.  This is a grey area and is at an early stage of debate, but it is a worrying proposal.  It would leave us very vulnerable to export refund cuts.  A decision can be made at the Council of Ministers to cut it in 12 months time, which is worrying for farmers.  The direct compensation payment proposals to offset the impact of the Santer price cuts on dairy farmers are a far more <Col N="958" /> expensive way, in EU budgetary terms, to support farmers' income than the existing market supports.  Most dairy farmers want to continue earning their income through sales of their output rather than through a cheque in the post.</P>
    <P>The Commission is not planning any significant increases in the EU budget in the context of the proposed enlargement of eastern Europe.  Direct payments to farmers will become increasingly political and publicly vulnerable.  Once the price cuts are forgotten, the reason for direct financial transfers to farmers will also be forgotten.  There will be pressure in the media and political circles which may endanger direct compensatory payments to farmers and Ireland will lose out because of this.</P>
    <P>When the dairy industry is discussed one must refer to the quota regime.  There are many positive aspects to the quota regime to which the Minister referred and with which I agree.  There are many younger dairy farmers who are anxious to increase their quota but cannot because of restrictions, financial and otherwise.  As a country largely dependent on dairying and with many small dairy farmers, we must try to negotiate a quota increase within the proposals.</P>
    <P>There is a special case to be made for Ireland. We are a country of smaller farmers with a precious and unique way of life.  We may talk of rural development and keeping people on the land, but there is no way of keeping a small farmer on land unless he has a reasonable milk quota.  We should make a special case at European level for an increase in our milk quota.  The Minister may say this is not on.  However, he should be looking for an increased Irish quota with an iron-fisted approach and a well fought case.</P>
    <P>I appeal to him to use his considerable influence in the Cabinet to restore installation aid for younger farmers.  I attended a meeting in my constituency recently where I heard from people needing installation aid to take over the family farm.  I know from experience when I took over my family farm that it is a difficult time for a young person.  There are many financial commitments such as stamp duty and reorganisation of the family structure.</P>
    <P>There is concern about people not receiving their premium payments.  Premium payments are now part of people's income, and they are entitled to receive them on time.  No agreement should be made outside the Charter of Rights which was agreed many years ago.  The charter recorded what premia people are entitled to.  I urge the Minister to ensure people get these payments on time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House where he started his successful political career.  Unfortunately he served here during my enforced leave of absence.  I agree with Senator Tom Hayes that agriculture is the backbone of our economy.  The reform of the CAP has been an ongoing phenomenon in Irish agriculture <Col N="959" /> since the late seventies in that guaranteed prices for farm products covered by the CAP were reducing in real terms.  Up to 1992 this price adjustment took place without compensation. However, the MacSharry reform package of 1992 introduced the concept of reducing price support and compensating farmers by direct payments &mdash; the so-called &ldquo;cheque in the post&rdquo; system.  As a consequence, we now have reduced prices for cattle, minus 15 per cent, and cereals, minus 30 per cent, coupled with limitations on cereal acreage and the ten and 22 month special beef premia, suckler cow quotas and sheep quotas, in addition to the milk quota which was established in 1983.</P>
      <P>To compensate for the price reductions in cattle and tillage there are area aid payments, suckler cow premia, ten and 22 month special beef premia and the CAP accompanying measures.  There are also extensification premia to encourage more extensive farming and a deseasonalisation premium to encourage a more even production spread through the year.  It should never be forgotten that the direct payments to farmers are in respect of compensation for reduced prices and not a bonanza as they are often described by less well informed people.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the future direction of the CAP are set out in the Santer Agenda 2000 package. The main areas of interest in the package as far as this country is concerned are the beef, dairy, cereals and Structural Funds proposals.  It must be stressed, however, that much of the detail of these broadly sketched proposals are as yet unknown and will probably not be available until early 1998.  Their full impact cannot, therefore, be estimated accurately at this stage.</P>
      <P>Despite some rigidities associated with strict supply control, the quota regime has benefited the dairy sector since 1984.  The operation of the quota has maintained high income levels among dairy farmers.  Of equal importance in Ireland is the role the milk quota plays in maintaining viable farming activity in less advantaged rural areas through instruments like restructuring and temporary leasing schemes as well as ring fencing of the quota in these areas.  The quota system has been a successful tool of economic development for Ireland and other EU member states.  For this reason, I agree with the Commission's analysis that there is no immediate need to make significant changes to the quota regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the momentum for change to the milk regime is gathering pace and will intensify over the medium term.  The main pressures for change, highlighted by the Commission in its analysis, are demands for further reform in the next World Trade Organisation round and enlargement to include the first six accession countries.  In the milk sector this will inevitably lead to pressure for reform of the guaranteed price system.  The Commission in Agenda 2000 has acknowledged that some liberalisation of the <Col N="960" /> milk regime is required.  If change is required it is preferable to signal it well in advance to assist longer term planning in the sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes said we should look for an increased quota.  I would like to see an increased quota as I am sure would the Minister of State and the Minister.  I am sure they will do everything possible to acquire such an increased national quota.</P>
    <P>The quota, which is the cornerstone of the milk regime, has, in general, maintained producer income.  Any move away from this system should not result in a worsening of dairy farmers' income and any proposed price reductions must be accompanied by an appropriate direct aid system. While this principle is explicitly accepted in the outline proposals, full details are still required on the actual level of, and the mechanisms for, compensation likely to be paid.</P>
    <P>Commission analysis suggests that the market for dairy products is expanding.  I broadly share this view and believe this will continue to be the case over the coming years.  If the EU dairy sector is to grow and develop to its full potential it is crucial that the EU maintains a strong presence in that expanding market.  Any retreat from this position over time would seriously undermine the long-term viability of the EU dairy sector.</P>
    <P>In order for the EU to retain world market share, possible adaptations to the quota regime might have to be considered to allow for more flexibility while at the same time minimising disruption to the existing system.  Serious consideration should be given to possible arrangements which would allow the EU share in the expanding world market and which could facilitate transition to a less restrictive regime beyond the year 2006.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, the beef sector is of key importance to the economy and accounts for over one third of agricultural output.  As the largest beef exporter in the northern hemisphere, we export some 90 per cent of our annual beef output both to other EU member states and outside the Union.  Clearly, with such dependency on export markets, we were in an exposed position when the latest and worst BSE crisis broke in March 1996.</P>
    <P>Prior to this disastrous event, the reform of the beef sector agreed in 1992 had been working well. The combination of reductions in institutional prices with increased direct income payments which were linked to supply control together with relatively favourable international markets meant that the European market was close to balance and producer incomes were more secure than had been the case previously.</P>
    <P>The fallout from the BSE crisis changed all that as beef consumption plummeted, third country markets closed and intervention again became the market of last resort for large quantities of EU beef.  In response, the Council agreed a number of compensation packages and reached agreement last October on a package of measures designed to reduce production, in particular by <Col N="961" /> the early slaughter of calves and the early marketing of veal calves.  In addition, the over 30 months slaughter scheme in the UK helped to bring better balance to the market.  Both of these schemes have removed three million animals.</P>
    <P>The impact of these measures will be felt in the medium term.  Nevertheless, the longer term forecasts are for further market imbalances in the context of the general trends in beef production and consumption together with the forthcoming world trade round.</P>
    <P>The Commission has responded with outline proposals which, broadly speaking, continue along the route charted in the MacSharry reform of the beef sector by proposing to reduce price support and increase direct income payments to farmers.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals are hugely important for Ireland because of the central role of beef production in our economy.  Market imbalance in the European beef market leaves us, as the major surplus producer of beef, the member state which is most vulnerable at the bottom of the price league.  The litmus test not only for Ireland but for all other member states is, will the Commission's proposals, if implemented, restore market balance and sustain producer incomes?</P>
    <P>The proposals are designed to increase beef consumption by reducing beef prices while at the same time enabling non-subsidised exports of EU beef to third countries, in particular the south-east Asian market.  Beef consumption within the EU should increase, but it is difficult to predict by how much and it is unlikely to reach pre-BSE levels given the longer term downward trend in beef consumption over recent decades.</P>
    <P>It is assumed by the Commission that the 30 per cent price cut proposed will enable EU exporters to export substantial quantities of beef without export refunds thereby avoiding GATT constraints.  It is debatable whether the EU can achieve the market penetration envisaged with the level of price cuts proposed.  Careful examination of the price structures and production potential of our major competitors is required.  In this context, I do not think the future of the beef regime can afford not to retain an adequate safety net in difficult market circumstances and where major market imbalance remains a threat.</P>
    <P>The second key element for consideration in relation to the future direction of the beef regime is the maintenance of a reasonable income for European beef producers.  We will be seeking to ensure that any cut in price is fully compensated. In addition, any final package which is agreed must ensure that extensive grass-based systems are not disadvantaged as against the more intensive bull producing system in the EU.  The proposals as they stand would appear to be more biased in favour of intensive beef production than the 1992 reform.  We should take great care before undoing the achievements of the past.  One of the lessons we must learn from the BSE crisis is that extensive methods of beef production, <Col N="962" /> which are environmentally friendly, must be encouraged now more than ever before.  I note that the Commission will reflect on how incentives to extensify production can be improved and I await its proposals with interest.</P>
    <P>With regard to cereals, it is difficult to quarrel with the Commission's analysis that increasing stocks by the year 2005 will pose a major strain on the Community's budget and will create market problems when these stocks are being disposed of.  The Commission's response is a reduction in the support prices for cereals, which will ensure that Community prices will be more in tune with world prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;thus facilitating the disposal of surplus stocks without subsidy and improving the competitiveness of cereals as a feed ingredient. The reduction in the intervention prices must, however, be fully compensated for so that growers' incomes are not reduced.</P>
      <P>The next round of Structural Funds will come up for examination at the same time as the future of the CAP.  These funds will play a major role against the backdrop of CAP reform and enlargement. Clearly, the Structural Funds have played an important part in developing all segments of the economy.  However, while we have undoubtedly made progress in closing the economic gap with the rest of Europe, considerable work still needs to be done and further substantial Structural Funds will be fully justified to complete the modernisation of the economy.</P>
      <P>As Ireland will be an Objective 1 region in transition, one of my main concerns will be to ensure that there will be no sudden fall in funding for our main structural schemes, which the Minister of State has outlined as being most important.  Mainstream agriculture will remain crucial to the social fabric of rural areas and to the local and national economies for the foreseeable future.  I support any wider rural development policies in Agenda 2000 which will enable farmers and rural dwellers to enhance their incomes and thereby remain in rural areas.  Given the agricultural situation, particularly the continuing decline in the number of farms and the numbers employed in agriculture as outlined in Agenda 2000, the proposals for an increased emphasis on rural development are both necessary and welcome.</P>
      <P>I also support the idea of integrating environmental goals into the CAP.  The best way forward is to strengthen and extend existing measures aimed at maintaining and enhancing the quality of the environment in general.  Budgetary resources must be made available for targeted agri-environmental measures and for the maintenance and promotion of low input systems as it is unrealistic to expect farmers to produce quality food in an environmentally friendly manner while ignoring the cost factors and effort involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> CAP has already been the subject of extensive reform which is set to continue.  It is in the interests of Ireland and other member states that European agriculture becomes more competitive on world markets and is developed on a sound, stable and sustainable basis.  However, it must also be done in a way which ensures that the principles of CAP are preserved, that the interests of member states are taken into account in a balanced way and that the interests of farmers and rural communities are fully protected.  While the general direction and preferred policy options have been put forward by the Commission, a huge amount of work at all levels of the decision making process will be done before decisions can be taken.  The European Parliament will have an important input to make and I am confident the Minister will ensure that Irish agricultural interests will be fully protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that four consultative groups will be set up for beef, milk, cereals and rural development and that he will invite farmers, processors and others with a direct interest, as well as academics, to serve on them.  These groups will remain in existence for the duration of the negotiations and he expects input from them so that the strongest possible case can be put in defence of Irish interests.  The interests of these groups will not displace the normal process of consultation with farm organisations, processors and other interest groups.  I wish the Minister every success in his negotiations to ensure the interests of Irish farmers are protected.</P>

      <P>He may be busy but it shows disregard for this House.  This debate was requested by our agricultural spokesperson many weeks ago, so it is surprising that the Minister did not make himself available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not dwell on the Santer proposals which have been discussed at length by Senator Hayes because I want to concentrate on current agricultural issues.  I want to quote from a questionnaire which was sent to all political parties last May by the country's largest organisation, the Irish Farmers Association, asking them for commitments on what they would do in Government.  The first question read: &ldquo;Does your Party support the provision of the necessary resources to prevent any cut in headage payments in 1998 and 1999?&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil's response was as follows: &ldquo;Yes.  FF are fully committed to maintaining present levels <Col N="964" /> of headage payments&rdquo;.  The Progressive Democrats also said yes.  Another question read: &ldquo;Will your Party ensure that the Control of Farmyard Pollution and Dairy Hygiene schemes are reintroduced following the mid-term review of the Structural Funds?&rdquo;  Both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats said yes.</P>
    <P>I contrast that with the figures in the 1998 Book of Estimates.  Subheads M1, M2, M3 and M4 deal with schemes operated to implement EU structural regulations and directives in Ireland by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The previous Minister, Deputy Yates, provided £64.74 million for farm investment schemes, such as the control of farmyard pollution scheme, the farm improvement scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme.  Now those who gave affirmative replies to the IFA's questions propose to cut expenditure in 1998 to £36.11 million, a decrease of 44 per cent.  How can the Minister defend that?</P>
    <P>I heard Fianna Fáil spokespersons give specific promises to meetings of Macra na Feirme and the IFA that the farm installation scheme, which was abolished in August, would be reintroduced.  Last year £5.677 million was provided for this scheme. However, the figures for 1998 show that only £1.159 million will be provided, which is an 80 per cent decrease.  How can the Minister defend the abolition of a scheme as important as the farm installation scheme?  This scheme encourages young farmers to take over farms by giving them a small grant.  It is the cheapest form of job creation.  Approximately £5,000 is given to a qualified farmer.  How can the Minister justify such a reduction?</P>
    <P>In 1997 £8.2 million was provided for farm diversification, which includes agri-tourism and mushroom production.  Agri-tourism is expanding as farmers become more involved in alternative enterprises, such as bed and breakfasts.  This is contributing to the economy, particularly the tourism economy.  The mushroom industry and other horticultural enterprises are also expanding and we should encourage them.  Our main lines of production, that is beef and milk, are in surplus. Of course we should encourage alternative produce and alternative enterprise on our farms, but what do I find?  Some £8.2 million was provided by the previous Minister in the current year whereas £7.7 million has been provided by the Minister for the coming year, a massive reduction of 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>These are just a few matters which are very important to the agriculture industry.  The Minister may be replying by and large to the points made on the Santer proposals &mdash; Agenda 2000 &mdash; but these are issues which affect farmers, the agriculture industry and its contribution to the economy.  Instead of the State withdrawing from issues, such as the control of farmyard pollution, installing young farmers on the land and putting in place schemes for proper dairy hygiene and agri-tourism, it should be increasing expenditure in these areas.  Will the Minister explain why he <Col N="965" /> made that kind of reply &mdash; a similar question could be put to the Progressive Democrats because they are also part of Government &mdash; which was published by the IFA in the leading farmers' weekly, the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal?</i> We stand over the replies which my party made but the Minister is not doing well in standing over or, worst of all, carrying out what he promised to do and that message was sent to the electorate.</P>
    <P>The delay in the payment of income supports to farmers is a scandal.  The Minister is bound by the charter of rights agreed between the then Minister, Deputy Yates, and all the farming organisations, principally the IFA, which was negotiated two years ago.  He is bound by that agreement to commence making payments for headage, that is, the beef cow scheme and beef premium where they become payable on 1 September and to ensure that all payments are made by 31 October.  That is written in black and white in the agreement.  Unfortunately, I do not have a copy of it with me or I would quote the clear commitment which was made in it.</P>
    <P>This year, at the end of October, over 40 per cent of all headage payments remain unpaid.  No doubt the Minister of State hears hundreds of complaints about unpaid income supports from farmers in his constituency every day.  Every one of my colleagues on this side of the House will testify that they receive telephone calls and letters on a daily basis from farmers awaiting these payments.  Why was that agreement broken?  Why did the system operate in 1995 and 1996 and break down when the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, in keeping with his previous reputation in these matters, returned to office?  Why must farmers wait until the end of the year and maybe next July until all of these payments are cleared?  I want an answer because there is a clear connection between Minister Walsh, delayed payments and broken promises. We have independent figures and even if we did not, we know from the farmers who are after us night and day about these issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister should remember that supports are needed in these difficult times because headage payments, for instance, are paid by and large to livestock farmers and nobody has suffered more in the recent BSE crisis.  I do not blame Fianna Fáil for the BSE crisis in the way they tried to blame us when we were in Government, but at least the response of the Government should have been to enhance that the income supports, many of which, such as the beef premium, are funded wholly by the EU, are paid on time to the farmers entitled to them.</P>
    <P>Livestock farmers' incomes fell by 13 per cent in real terms.  According to the best estimates, they will be down by 5 per cent in real times in 1997.  That is an accumulated drop in incomes in the major sector of agriculture in two years of 20 or 21 per cent or more.  No other sector of the economy has suffered like that.  The economy is booming and that leads to economic growth, <Col N="966" /> which is expressed in higher incomes and better living standards for everybody except&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the livestock farmers who are being deprived of their entitlement by this Government.  That is the reality.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few points which will graphically bring home to the Minister of State the effects of cutting the headage payments, that is, the cattle headage payment, the beef cow scheme and the sheep headage payment.  Normally, that involves finance of £110 million in a single year and the Minister is proposing to cut it to £87.8 million in 1998.  Will the Minister of State tell me how he can fit that pint into the half-pint glass?  Headage payments have not increased for several years.  If one looks at the Estimates for the past few years, the figure has remained constant at about £110 million.  Will the Minister of State explain how that headage money will be distributed without excluding some people?  Will he reintroduce the off-farm income bar?  Will he exclude farmers who are receiving a pension?  Will he confine the amount of money to £3,000 in any one case and no more?</P>

The Minister should remember if these proposals go ahead that payments to farmers &mdash; these are usually the smaller farmers who are on the lowest level of income &mdash; in his county, Cork, who will receive £9.77 million in headage payments in 1997, will be reduced by almost £2 million to £7.82 million.  The farmers of my county, Roscommon, one of the poorer counties which is almost totally dependent on livestock and grassland farming, received £6.8 million in the current year from headage payments.  If the Minister's proposals go through, we will get £5.44 million, a reduction of £1.36 million.  I do not know what the Minister is going to do about County Cork but I can assure him that I will fight to ensure the farmers in my county and the constituency which I have represented will not suffer <Col N="967" /> that because this is outlandishly unfair to them at a time when they are on their knees due to the income they receive from the commodity which they produce.  My advice to the Minister is to ensure that the funds for that scheme, which is primary to the farm income support of small farmers, is reinstated.  If it is not, he will sorely regret it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
      <P>A number of the points raised by Senator Connor are very relevant.  The situation with regard to the Santer proposals is such that the implications for this country are enormous.  It is that context that I put forward the suggestion to the Minister that it is time we had a national debate on the future of agricultural policy.  It should extend further into the area of land use.  The connection between agriculture and land use is extremely important and it has been neglected over many years.</P>
      <P>Production has been curtailed during the past ten to 15 years by means of quotas and various schemes.  In that context, the opportunities available to members of the farming community in particular have been restricted.  Consequently, these people have been obliged to work in a vacuum to try to maintain their living standards. While progress has been made in respect of making aid available to farmers to sustain their incomes, problems still exist of which the Minister of State is aware.  We must think in terms of the finite asset at our disposal, namely, the land.  That asset restricts us in respect of what we can do and it is important to consider how it will be used in the future.</P>
      <P>We can continue to discuss the Santer proposals and their implications for individual commodities until the cows come home and try to obtain the best deal possible for Irish agriculture within that context.  However, it is time we decided the direction we propose to take in respect of agriculture and the emphasis we intend to place on various areas in the next ten years. There has not been such a focus on agriculture since the 1970s, when the emphasis was placed on increased production.  However, the European situation was different at that stage and major surpluses, with which we were obliged to deal, resulted.  From the point of view of agriculture, we must not think only in terms of production and the production of various commodities &mdash; we must consider the entire system of production, right through to the consumer.  Every aspect of this system must be considered in the overall context of a national strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Horticulture is extremely important and is probably the one area, in terms of land use, where there is potential to expand.  Our horticultural produce, be it nursery stock or vegetables, is second to none in Europe.  There is enormous potential to develop this area which would lead <Col N="968" /> to greater import substitution.  We must focus on this area and see how it relates to agriculture.  Are there opportunities for producers to diversify into this area in the future?  If such diversification occurs, it must be carried out in a planned way. For example, potato producers could not suddenly decide to begin producing onions because their equipment is geared towards this.  Such behaviour would cause problems and, therefore, diversification must be planned properly.</P>
    <P>There have been particular problems in respect of forestry in recent years.  The general thrust of our policy in this area is positive.  It is important that we build up the stock of woods available in Ireland for various reasons.  However, the implications for the areas in which new trees are planted and their aesthetic effect must be borne in mind.  We must also ensure that people have access to proper amenities when using these areas for recreation purposes.</P>
    <P>It is also important to consider the species of trees being grown.  Rather than producing soft woods on poorer quality land where growth rates are extremely high perhaps we should place more emphasis on producing hard woods, possibly on better quality land.  In that context, a number of years ago a person was asked why hurling is good in certain areas.  They replied that it had to do with the quality of the land which produced quality ash.  Hence, the hurling and ash are good in east Cork and Kilkenny.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to areas where hurling is traditionally good.</P>
      <P>The environmental aspects affecting agriculture are important.  The recent debate regarding the level of phosphates and nitrates in our water is important.  From the 1950s to the 1970s efforts to increase production led to farmers being advised to use more fertilisers.  That was the correct approach at the time but the use of these fertilisers is now causing problems.  This is another aspect of the overall strategy which must be considered.  The debate which appears to be developing in respect of the measurement of phosphates in the land must be clarified in the near future because UCD disagrees with Teagasc with regard to recommendations for the use of phosphates on the land.  These recommendations, which are necessary in terms of the cost of production and the environment, are vitally important.  That is also true in the case of forestry and horticulture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Connor stated, another area of importance involves agri-tourism.  What is our policy on diversification into this area?  Diversification into agri-tourism would give a number of people who might otherwise be forced to abandon the land the opportunity to remain on it.  One of the primary objectives of a national policy on agriculture should be to sustain the highest possible number of people living in rural areas.  We <Col N="969" /> must consider introducing a form of rural renewal scheme similar to the one put in place in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should be careful not to leak any information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Efforts must be made to provide those living in rural areas with the opportunity to get agri-tourism off the ground on a constructive basis.  Tourism generates major income and the link between it and agriculture is vital.</P>
      <P>There are two other proposals I would suggest in respect of a national policy on agriculture, one of which involves consideration of our landscape. As a practising landscape architect, I must declare an interest in this area.  Greater consideration must be given to planning and the location of various things.  For example, in respect of forestry we must look at where trees are and are not being planted.  We must plan carefully where things are located.  As has happened in various parts of the country, the amenities we want tourists to see are hidden.  The beauty of our countryside must be enhanced, not hidden.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State consider the reintroduction of installation aid in some form?  It is vitally important for the continuity of agriculture that young people entering the area be educated to the highest possible standard so that they can compete in the difficult environment to which they are being exposed.  We must also provide them with the opportunity to become involved in working the land as early as possible.  When a person starts out in life they have vigour and fire in their belly but as they grow older they have greater commitments and the opportunities for diversification and high production tend to dissipate because of other responsibilities.  There is a need for more young people to make decisions in rural areas.  It would be a welcome development if installation aid could be reintroduced in some form to encourage this.</P>
      <P>With regard to brucellosis the present circumstances are worrying and many herds are under restrictions because of it.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the reintroduction of vaccination for brucellosis.  In the past when the disease was at a low level vaccination was available and, having been vaccinated, the cows carried forward a resistance to the disease for a number of years.  Therefore, when vaccination was discontinued its effects carried forward for a few years. However, the country's stock has lost that resistance to brucellosis.  We need to examine this matter closely.</P>
      <P>The time has come for a national debate on agricultural policy.  I would like to think that it could take place soon and for as long as is necessary to plan our approach for the next ten years, at least.  I would not object to the involvement of all interested parties.  Ultimately, we depend on the production and consumption of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> Senators from all parties could contribute to such a debate as vigorously as they have on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State.  I speak on rural development from a western perspective.  I was surprised and disappointed at how little time the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, devoted to rural development in his speech.  It does not reflect the gravity of the issue. His ideas were barren.  He said:</P>
      <P>. mainstream agriculture will remain crucial to the economic and social fabric of rural areas for the foreseeable future and . market policies will therefore remain of the utmost importance.</P>
      <P>Mainstream agriculture will not keep farming in the west economically viable and rural development comes into play in that context.  The Minister of State can only propose that:</P>
      <P>[He] is in the process of setting up four consultative groups, one each for beef, milk, cereals and rural development . [and he] will be inviting farmers, processors and others with a direct interest, as well as academics, to serve on these groups.  These groups will remain in existence for the duration of the negotiations and [he expects] an expert input from them.</P>
      <P>There is a plethora of development agencies which have been piling up reports on the problems of agriculture and the west for many years. They are largely ignored or shuffled into a bureaucratic siding to give the impression that motion on the paper trails will be accepted as a substitute for the policies of positive discrimination which are needed in the west, especially in relation to the next tranche of Structural Funds. Retaining Objective 1 status for the west must be a priority.  Structural Funds were provided on the basis of <i>per capita</i> income yet the west did not receive its fair share of those funds.  The new tranche of funds should address this problem.</P>
      <P>The prospects for rural development can be summed up in job terms.  I link industry and agriculture because in socio-economic terms they are Siamese twins &mdash; one cannot exist without the other.  There are 9,093 on the live register in County Mayo and north Mayo is plagued by inadequate roads and rail services.  The flagship industry in the area, Asahi, has announced its closure which will make the jobless figures worse.  It will wind down this month and it is little consolation to my constituents to hear announcements of jobs elsewhere in the country.  There is no proof of the Government's commitment to the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an over-concentration of development in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway and equating this with national growth or prosperity is &ldquo;spin doctoring&rdquo; at its most fatuous.  The public <Col N="971" /> is working out what is happening.  Dublin is like a suction machine, drawing more and more from the regions.  More job opportunities are being created in the main cities while west of the Shannon, in places such as Ballina, Kiltimagh and Claremorris, there is no evidence of commitment from the IDA to improving job figures.  Recently the IDA has begun to sell off the land banks it had for industrial development in small towns such as Ballinrobe and Newport.</P>
    <P>Instead of productive policies of encouragement the Government is sterilising large areas of scenic bogland by classifying them as special heritage areas and tourist reservations.  This combination of industrial and agricultural sabotage of the west's potential is overshadowed by the greatest betrayal of all &mdash; the ransacking of EU Structural Funds.  These funds were attracted originally for the development of disadvantaged areas but the money has been channelled to the east coast and other areas which are now bursting at the seams.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the Minister of State's commitment to rural development, especially in the west.  The west has been isolated from the other regions.  The Government's transport priorities indicate how less favoured the west is when compared to other areas.  The rail line from Dublin to Westport is the only one in the country that is not earmarked for co-financing.  As a result there is a substandard rail line to the west which must depend on Government funds for upgrading or development.  There was a near tragedy a fortnight ago when a train was derailed on its way to the west.  That event highlights the substandard rail infrastructure.  There was adequate rolling stock in use on the route to the west but it has disappeared from that route.  I found out from an Irish Rail official that it has gone to Kilkenny.  We are left with even more substandard rolling stock than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland was told recently that the reason Ireland attracted so much American technology was that we had the best education system in the world after Singapore.  One third of the per capita entry to third level education comes from the western region.  Students from the west, in particular Mayo, are prepared to travel anywhere, even abroad, to further their careers.  Indeed, bus loads of students may be seen travelling to and from the various third level centres in Dublin each week.  Not only is this denuding our population, but it is distorting census figures produced every four years because these students leave the west on a Sunday evening when the census is carried out.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the population is also reflected in the fact that the constituency of Mayo lost one of its Deputies in the last general election. Mayo was reduced from two three seat constituencies to a single five seat one.  Farming alone will not sustain the people of the west and <Col N="972" /> an imaginative policy for rural development is needed if we are to achieve population growth.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Ballina Industrial Development Association, I recently welcomed a new technology company, Lionbridge, to Ballina as an expansion of its Dublin base.  This company made a decision to reverse the national trend and locate its new venture with 50 new jobs in Ballina where it found the facilities and educated workforce it needed.  Its workforce will be trained free from poaching of trained staff by some of the bigger international companies in Dublin where competition for skills is at its fiercest.  Hundreds of such small companies are locating in Dublin causing a mounting problem both for management and staff.  New technology offers the west independence from the distance and peripheral factors which have militated against the location of heavy industries there.  The Lionbridge reverse strategy on location will be watched eagerly by other technology companies.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity to facilitate positive relocation thinking by companies in the computer and information technology areas by providing incentives to locate west of the Shannon.  This would be particularly desirable not only from the viewpoint of arresting western rural decline but from that of erasing Dublin's social problems. The country is hopelessly lopsided and the quality of life in Dublin under progressive Governments has deteriorated.</P>
    <P>Local initiative is not dead in the west, it simply needs to be taken out of the smoulder of bureaucratic red tape and the proliferation of confusion which mark existing piecemeal development policies. I have seen achievements in facilitating jobs on slender resources which mark the operation of voluntary agencies such as Moyvalley, IRD and other Leader groups.  In the context of rural development, the Minister should try to encourage greater liaison between Leader groups and the agricultural community because there appears to be a lack of cohesion between them.  Many Leader groups are showing much initiative in the area of rural development and they must be encouraged.</P>
    <P>We were all disappointed by the lack of funding for Leader groups in the last tranche of funds. Funding was cut by half and this is reflected in the amount of work Leader groups and voluntary organisations may take in hand.  One of the first integrated resource development companies was established in Ballina six years ago.  It took up the baton of rural development in the region and was a considerable success.  It is unfortunate funding in this area has been drastically cut by both Government and Europe.  It is the only agency which gets money directly from Europe and does not have to go through bureaucracy involving central Government and Departments.  That is an area of rural development at which I would like the Minister to look and see where improvements may be made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> Knock Airport also has potential.  An industrial estate has finally been recognised as a catalyst for tax incentive development.  The previous Government designated Knock as a tax incentive area but there have been no developments since this Government came to power.  Industry in this area is vital for the economic prosperity of the region because mainstream agriculture will not survive unless it is twined with a vibrant industrial atmosphere. The future lies in more dynamic rural development and positive discrimination in this area.  The bottom line is that more resources are required because funds to many development agencies have been cut, especially in the west.  I have firsthand knowledge of Leader groups which are desperately short of money.  Much of the State aid which they received has gone on administration and little has filtered down to those at grassroots level.</P>
    <P>Self-catering accommodation, which was a major development, has been cut by 50 per cent. Such accommodation attracts people to rural areas thus creating a more positive and healthy environment.  I would like the Minister to look at this and other issues.  No initiative has been shown by the Government on rural development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for providing time for this discussion on agriculture.  I resent the attack by Senator Connor on the Minister and the Minister of State.  He engaged in scaremongering by saying that Cork would be over £2 million short next year in relation to area aid.  He has no proof of that.  The country will not be short next year and I would safely say that the Minister and the Minister of State will ensure Cork is not short.  I resent the Senator's remarks about the Minister who, with the Ministers of State, is doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>Ireland is dependent on a successful agriculture industry.  With so much of the working population employed directly or indirectly by the industry, it is of obvious importance to the economy.  Rural Ireland and its villages and towns survive on the money generated by farming and the agri-business in their areas.  The recent fall in farm incomes has had a serious effect on rural areas as young people are moving out of agriculture to seek more rewarding work in the industrial sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU continues to reform its agricultural policies.  We are now presented with the Santer proposals which, if adopted unamended, will have a disastrous effect on agriculture, especially on the beef sector where prices are already bad at only 80p to 85p per pound, a 20p to 25p per pound drop from two years ago.  The proposal to cut intervention by 30 per cent is unacceptable.  I urge the Minister and the Department to ensure the protection of the largest agricultural sector involving 100,000 livestock producers.  A 30 per cent price cut will reduce output in the beef and livestock sector by £344 million.  With compensation of only £265 million, this will result in a net <Col N="974" /> loss to the economy of £88 million.  The EU must recognise our dependence on the market supports of intervention and refunds.  With our extensive grant aid production system, our dependence on exports and with the cost of production estimated at 80p per pound, does anyone think the industry can survive at a price of 60p per pound?  The future of the beef industry must be protected with a meaningful market price which gives producers a decent living.  Full premium compensation must be paid to producers for price cuts; a special heifer premium is now essential.</P>
    <P>The milk quota system has existed since 1984. The Commission President, Mr. Santer, suggests a 10 per cent price cut to be compensated for by direct payments which offer little guarantee of future income.  These proposals on the milk sector must be explained in greater detail.  With milk quotas now expected to last up to the year 2006, the system must be restructured to allow young farmers to enter dairying and to give greater opportunity to smaller dairy farmers to increase their quotas.  What was a reasonably sized quota in 1984 is now too small to provide a viable income for a farm family.  Recent figures showing a significant drop in the numbers of young people entering agricultural colleges are alarming. Young people turn away from farming because they see little opportunity for the future.  Dairy farming is one area which must be open to new entrants.</P>
    <P>Grain farmers will suffer serious income drops if the Santer proposals are accepted, with winter growers particularly affected.  Farmers cannot afford to sell crops at below production costs. While sheep and pig meat are not directly affected, the general price cuts in agriculture will also affect those key sectors.  It is very important that installation aid be reinstated; I know the Minister and the Minister of State are looking favourably on that.  It would give young people an opportunity to enter farming.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department for their continued work to improve the agriculture industry.  It is under great pressure, especially the beef sector where prices are set to fall again this week.  I am aware of the Minister's continued efforts to reopen the beef markets and the important live export trade.  I believe a delegation has travelled to Egypt, which is good news, and I hope that market will be reopened shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>These proposals are alarming and frightening.  Irish agriculture is at a crossroads and the Minister and the Government have an onerous duty in regard to its future.  We have depended heavily on agriculture in the past. Towns throughout the country are dependent on their agricultural hinterlands.  It is a pity and a tragedy there has been so much unfair, undue and unjust criticism recently of our hardworking farming population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> We need much more rural development.  Agri-tourism has not developed and more grant aid and guidance are needed.  Many people anxious to invest to improve their lot and that of their rural communities often do not know whether they should apply to the county enterprise board, to the Leader programme, etc., to obtain assistance and chart their development properly.</P>
    <P>The proposed cutbacks in headage payments are very serious and are unacceptable as they pose a threat to livestock.  The farming community is depending on the Government to tackle this issue.  The Santer proposals will prove a disaster and will require significant amending if we are to have a proper healthy agriculture sector in future.  I refer specifically to the proposals to cut back headage payments for small hill sheep farmers by 20 per cent.  It is imperative that the Government's proposals to restrict sheep headage in 1998-99 be reversed.  The Government gave a commitment before the election not to tamper with the headage mechanism until the end of the current round of structural funding.  The Government's proposals, if implemented, will greatly exacerbate the small hill sheep farmers' severe income problems because the payments of ewe premiums and sheep headage account for almost 100 per cent of their net income.  These farmers have no alternative to sheep farming.  The proposals to cut headage by £22.5 million would represent a reduction of £2 per ewe for each farmer who are already on their knees.  I say to the Minister and the Government enough is enough.  These farmers will not be able to exist if they suffer any further reduction in income.</P>

      <P>My understanding was we were going to have statements on the Santer proposals. There has been a great deal of wandering.  It was signalled this time last year that there was not sufficient funding for the installation aid to continue through this year.  It was not this Government who disbanded the dairy hygiene grants or the control of farmyard pollution grants but it will be this Government who will restore them.  With the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and Minister of State O'Keeffe all being from Cork, and the Minister of State present from just over the Cork border, together we will achieve that restoration.</P>

      <P>There was a time when it was popular to say &ldquo;my land is my own, I can do what I like with it&rdquo;.  That is no longer the case and many farmers have been worried about that for a considerable time.  There was a well known Dáil parliamentarian who said &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough&rdquo;. That day is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comments I make on the Santer proposals <Col N="976" /> will be general because the details of the proposals are not yet known, but the broad parameters are.  If we are to take those as guidance as to what the details of the proposals would be, then Irish agriculture, farmers and those allied to the industry are in for a shock.</P>
    <P>The CAP reform 2 proposals are an extension of the 1992 MacSharry CAP reforms.  This involves direct compensation for price on income cuts but with certain limits, overall in some cases or per hectare.  While the direct payment system is sold as an efficient method of supporting farmers' incomes, it is more expensive in budget terms than price supports.  Thus the CAP budget becomes a limiting factor.  A high level of dependence on direct payments also increases the political vulnerability of the CAP; for example, market supports through import tariffs are not viewed as subsidies whereas direct payments are not only seen as subsidies but their role as compensation for past price cuts may be quickly forgotten.</P>
    <P>It is apparent the Commission envisages the CAP direct payments would not apply to farmers in future member states of an enlarged EU on the grounds that they would not have suffered the price cuts in the first place.  The Commission intends to offer instead some structural aid which is obviously necessary.  It is unclear whether this would apply during the transition period only or on a more permanent basis.  The African countries are unlikely to accept that a cereal farmer on one side of the notional border would receive £300 per hectare in direct payments under CAP while his counterpart on the eastern side of the border would receive nothing, although both are selling their produce at world market price levels; enlargement on the cheap in other words.  That is what the Santer proposals as structured put forward. The former eastern bloc countries would not accept that.  It would be difficult to achieve with significant implications for the cost of the CAP budget in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The major implications for Irish agriculture are that the Santer proposals in the beef and cereal sectors would cut prices to below the cost of production. This has dangerous long-term implications for farmers.  When prices are lower than production costs the direct payment becomes more than 100 per cent of net farm income.  In that case non-production would be more profitable for many farmers unless a link between payments and production is maintained.  The concept of a direct payment system for non-production would be seen as rural dole funded by Brussels and it would be very vulnerable in political and budgetary terms.</P>
    <P>It should be noted the Santer proposals in the beef and dairy sectors have not advocated full decoupling.  In terms of area payment, the link between the direct payments and livestock numbers is to be retained.  Even where the link with production is to be maintained, cutting prices to below production cost equivalent will inevitably <Col N="977" /> result in a low cost, low output agriculture industry, with implications for the food processing, farm input and service sector of agriculture and the Irish economy.  The value of net output of Irish agriculture to farm household incomes after costs were covered would be as low as 15 per cent by 2005.</P>
    <P>The proposed 20 per cent cut in cereal prices has serious implications for grass based industry in Irish agriculture.  Cheaper cereals would make grain based livestock and milk production more competitive than grass based production.  The two major grass based areas would be put at a major disadvantage relative to our European counterparts. The proposed 30 per cent beef price cut and the proposed 20 per cent cereal price cut imply a rapid erosion of export refunds after June 2000.</P>
    <P>In the context of World Trade Organisation planning, export refunds are likely to be high on the hit list where further support cuts are being negotiated.  Ireland has a disproportionately high dependence on export refunds for beef and dairy products which means the adjustment process will be relatively short and more costly for this country.</P>
    <P>The Santer proposals that member states introduce differentiation of direct payments has many worrying implications.  This means the envelope of money would be provided for each sector in each member state.  The national Governments would then decide the rate of payment per hectare or per animal and the individual ceiling on the payment per farmer.  If governments interpret CAP direct payments as import supports then frontloading would be likely with serious implications. This has already happened in the context of headage payments over the past couple of years which is part of the problem.  The possibility is that the social agenda would supersede the long-term commercial agenda.  The differentiation proposal would also result in the distortion of competition between farmers in different member states.  The social agenda should not be forgotten, but it needs to be supported.</P>
    <P>In the longer term differentiation could be the first step towards rationalisation of the funding of CAP direct payments.  The accompanying measures are already on a co-financing basis.  It is conceivable that wealthier member states, in pursuit of their own rural policy agendas, could seek to supplement the CAP direct payments from national budget resources, the consequences of which for Irish farmers are self evident.  The thrust of EU agricultural policy, including lower product prices, direct payments and targeted environmental measures will impact directly on commercial farmers.</P>
    <P>The Santer agenda gives formal recognition to protection of the environment as a key objective. Clearly, there is significant political support in the EU to link agricultural policy with environmental protection.  As the proportion of farm income dependent on direct payments increases, the likelihood <Col N="978" /> of cross compliance with environmental standards will increase.  While the role of agriculture in protecting and enhancing the environment is very important, EU negotiators in the World Trade Organisation must ensure that environment related constraints imposed on EU farmers are fully recognised.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The CAP has already been subject to extensive reform and that process of reform is set to continue.  It is in the interests of Ireland and other member states that European agriculture should become more competitive on world markets and be developed on a sound, stable and sustainable basis.  However, it must also be done in a way which ensures that the principles of the CAP are preserved, the interests of member states are taken into account in a balanced way and, above all, the incomes of farmers and the viability of rural communities are fully protected.</P>
    <P>Having examined the Santer proposals and witnessed what has happened to agriculture and to rural Ireland for the last 25 years, I believe it is time we had a new debate on a land policy with structures which would maintain what the Minister referred to in his speech.  We must be serious in doing this, otherwise, harkening back to the Mansholt plan of the late 1960s, we will continue in the old way of the industrial nations of Europe which is not to establish and protect as many farmers as possible on the land but to have as few as possible, all carrying out commercial farming. This was not what the Treaty of Rome set out to establish.  It recognised the role of rural people in the countryside and the CAP was a social policy which set out to achieve a number of objectives, namely, to ensure Europe would never again be dependent on food imports and to protect a rural based economy and the farmers who operate within it.</P>
    <P>The MacSharry/Walsh reforms served Ireland well, but we have arrived at the stage where we need a full discussion on a new land policy which will cater for the needs of the people into the next millennium and beyond.  Whether talking about quotas in dairying or any other sector of farming, the production of food will not feed the world in 2050 by which time the population will have increased by 10 billion people.  This is what we are facing and the EU policies we are pursuing will not feed these people.</P>
    <P>We are also losing markets as a consequence of quotas.  Quotas may have served individual farmers well, but have they served Ireland well?  Cutbacks in quotas mean cutbacks in world markets which are being supplied by other countries. Nothing in the Santer proposals will control the transfer of food and food products from Australia and New Zealand which will result in the supplanting and taking over of our markets.  This is because industrial Europe is the driving force.</P>
    <P>Farming is a business concerned with producing <Col N="979" /> food and an income for the individual.  We have seen food used as a weapon in war.  Why, in so-called times of surplus, is there starvation?  Are our political markets, in a European or world context, so driven by other factors that we can control and limit food production and by the same token let millions of people starve?  It is man's inhumanity to man.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a new debate on a new direction and a new land policy which will help rural based communities, we must leave exotic ideas to one side.  The family who can make a living from 20,000 or 30,000 gallons of milk should be allowed do so.  The policies we have been pursuing have put the squeeze on such people.  We can talk about afforestation and many aspects of rural life, but until we have the will to achieve for the maximum number of families on the land we will not have such a debate.</P>
    <P>Let us have a debate on land use, how it relates to people and how we are controlling their livelihoods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on agriculture because of its great importance to the people, including those in the west, and the national economy.  I have been involved in agriculture for many years and have noticed the changes which have taken place, including a huge decline in the number of small farmers, particularly in the west.  I remember when parishes could be divided and it was possible to see where the maximum was being produced from the land and the work done by young farmers and the interest they had taken in their work.  There were opportunities for young farmers to increase production, maintain a livelihood and remain on the land.  There has been a huge decline, particularly in the last ten years since elderly farmers have sold their quotas. Young people are not interested in small farms. In the past, small farms, together with co-operatives, played a very important part in the production of milk and exports for this country.</P>
      <P>These are changing times; other countries are beginning to increase their production.  Consumers are very conscious of the quality and cost of produce.  One need only look around to see the change in people's eating habits; this applies throughout the world.  There has been a substantial reduction in the consumption of dairy products. The level of beef consumption has also decreased, especially following the worldwide incidences of BSE.  BSE frightened many people, although there has been some improvement recently in the level of beef consumption.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, we speak about increasing productivity and financing that increase and, on the other, we speak about developing the industry. There are many lessons to be learned.  Our produce must be of the highest quality and must be properly sourced.  It must stand up as food which people wish to buy and consume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> I recognise the strength of the Santer proposals in relation to the proposed reductions in the financing of beef for export and beef for subsidisation and the reduction of quotas and supports for the dairy sector.  That will put a great deal of pressure on the Government in its negotiations and a very strong battle will win the war in achieving agreement on this matter in the European context and in the context of world trade and the GATT proposals.  The principle of the reductions, if adjusted in a reasonable and fair way to Irish farmers and the Irish economy, seems rational and sensible.  One cannot indefinitely support the production of food at a price which is not saleable, that can only be achieved by amassing mountains of butter, beef and so on. The people who paid for the type of agriculture which prevailed in the past will not do so any longer.  We must adjust and, at the same time, we must introduce other support measures which will accommodate the changes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the four committees to support the negotiations which are taking place at Government level.  Will Leader programmes come under the new regional strategy groupings proposed for local authority level or will they still retain their position, within the agricultural framework, of playing a very important part in rural development?  It is expected that, as change occurs in the area of farming, there will be a reduction of 21,000 in the number of farmers in the west of Ireland.  In view of these changes, there is a serious need for the Government to address the issue of rural decline.  I believe that this is the right time to address that issue.  Cohesive policies must be drawn up in this area by all of the appropriate development agencies, including local authorities.  Whatever action is planned or taken now will lay the foundations for the future of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Proposed plans or rural development programmes should aim to develop existing natural resources to sustain jobs on a long-term basis.  In the long term, many small farms will not be able to sustain families without farmers having some other form of part-time employment.  The Government should address this through an overall policy of utilising the natural resources which exist in abundance in many Irish counties; it should make cohesive plans in order that we can maintain economic populations, villages, churches and schools.  Given the present wealth of the economy, action must be taken in this area. I invite the Minister to come to the west for a day's seminar on proposals to address the issue of rural decline, which would encompass rural development and farming.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the backbone and mainstay of the Irish economy and affects a great number of people.  I believe the Charter of Rights in relation to payments to farmers should be fully implemented.  It does not do the Minister or anyone else any favours if we fail to deliver on that; we are fundamentally obliged to do so.  I am <Col N="981" /> aware that there are certain difficulties to be overcome but we should be able to deliver on our promises.  Any outstanding payments should be dealt with, even if it is necessary to extend the rules to put things on a proper footing for the future.  People who are entitled to payment should be paid.</P>
    <P>I support the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I wish the Minister well in carrying out his tasks in relation to rural development in conjunction with the Santer proposals.  I hope the Irish economy continues to do well particularly in the area of agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an astonishing national consensus in this country that the CAP and the form in which it operates is a good thing and our prime national objective seems to be to minimise changes which would undermine it.  There has been an ongoing debate on competitiveness in this country for the past 15 years, yet we force all workers to pay food prices well in excess of the world average.  It must be a profoundly wasteful way of looking after the interests of a declining proportion of our population by imposing an anti-competitive cost on every member of society.</P>
      <P>If the ESB, Bord Gáis or any other body increase prices artificially, we denounce them as being an impediment to competitiveness but in the next breath, and virtually unanimously, we support uncompetitive food prices.  I would love to sustain thousands of jobs in the ESB or Telecom but the price to be paid for that would be expensive electricity and telecommunications. The price would be expensive electricity.  I would like to support thousands more jobs in Telecom Éireann, but the price would be expensive telecommunications charges.  I would like to support thousands of people in different areas, because keeping people in jobs holds communities together.  I would like a viable post office in every town in Ireland, but that would make postal charges prohibitively expensive.  I have never understood the logic that holds we must minimise costs in energy, transport and other sectors, but that we must sustain incomes in agriculture no matter what the cost to national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>This economic logic must be addressed.  I am a committed believer in the interventionist State and in the State's role in economic development and the protection of those who are economically vulnerable.  However, it is intriguing that those who believe in free market competition in every other sector defend restrictive practices, anti-competitive pricing, price fixing, cartels, import protection and anti-free trade positions when it comes to agriculture.  Let us have some economic logic for once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My position justifies the sustaining of farm incomes, because I believe in the State's role in doing so.  However, I also believe it is wrong to kick 1,200 people out of jobs in Waterford-Avonmore to make farmer shareholders richer than they are already.  I do not see the logic in <Col N="982" /> demanding that the EU fund almost 50 per cent of farmers' incomes for no economic activity. Most of that money goes to farmers who are already rich, not to the 20 per cent of farmers who have negative incomes, the 20 per cent of farmers who earn £5,000 per year or the 20 per cent who earn between £5,000 to £10,000 per year.  Most EU funding goes to those in the middle earning bracket or to farmers earning £20,000 or more.  The 20 per cent of farmers who are well off are getting most of the EU funds.  I see no logic in that and have never understood it. I believe passionately in sustaining the incomes of small vulnerable farmers in the same way that I believe in sustaining the incomes of everybody in society who is badly off.  However, something done in the name of sustaining small family farms has made 20 per cent of those in agriculture grotesquely rich at the expense of food prices for ordinary families and the national interest.  That seems ridiculous.  It is time we stopped saying our job is to defend the Common Agricultural Policy and time we said our job is to defend those in agriculture who need defending.  Those who speak loudest do not need defending; they have a vested interest in sustaining handouts to themselves to provide an income which is better than that of ordinary working people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hate to be misunderstood. We need a system of income support for everyone in society who cannot make a living.  I am moving toward acceptance of the principle of a guaranteed minimum income which is advocated by a number of lobby groups.  That is probably the fairest system and it should apply to those in agriculture who need it.  I do not believe in the present distorted, anti-competitive, anti-social and expensive system, which is also potentially disastrous for the environment.  That is the risk of encouraging intensive agriculture under the Common Agricultural Policy.  Industry is not the major cause of our major environmental problems; agriculture is.  Agriculture kills fish every summer, causes serious nutrification in the rivers and causes major water pollution.  Excessive use of fertilisers causes the river in my city to turn green every summer.  Individual farmers who are responsible cannot be identified because there are multiple sources of pollution which are difficult to regulate.  Farmers have received almost £1 billion from the State to protect the environment, but they have failed to do so.</P>
      <P>We need a fundamental review of what agriculture is for.  It should produce food for our society that can be sold and processed competitively for national and international sale.  Farmers need to go through the period of trauma experienced by workers in Aer Lingus, ESB, Telecom Éireann and most of the private sector.  They have been protected for too long, and those who are best off in agriculture are the best at defending their interests.  It is time that stopped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at Senator Ryan for blaming agriculture for pollution.  He is wrong to blame the farming community, as farmers everywhere have made great strides to clean up the environment.  Many generations of farmers have looked after the environment and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> While many sectors will grow under the Santer proposals, there is still no specific increase in finance for the areas.  The Santer proposals are an extension and acceleration of the MacSharry CAP proposals, which involved direct compensation for income cuts, but with certain limits, overall in some cases, per hectare.  While the direct payments system is an efficient method of supporting farmers' income, it is more expensive in budgetary terms than price supports and the CAP budget becomes a limiting factor.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that the Commission envisages that CAP direct payments will not apply to farmers in new member states on the grounds that they will not suffer sufficient price cuts.  The Commission intends to offer some structural aid instead, which is obviously necessary.  However, the applicant countries are unlikely to accept that a cereal farmer on one side of a national border should receive approximately £300 per hectare in direct payments under the CAP while his counterpart on the eastern side of the border receives nothing, although both sell their produce at world market price levels.  Enlargement on the cheap as envisaged by the Commission may be difficult to achieve, with significant implications for the cost to the CAP budget in the long term.</P>
    <P>A further major implication for Irish agriculture is that the Santer proposals in the beef and cereals sectors will cut prices to below the cost of production.  This has serious implications for farmers in the long term.  When prices are lower than production costs, the direct payment becomes more than 100 per cent of net farm income.  Non-production would then be more profitable for many farmers, unless a link between payments and production is maintained. The concept of a direct payments system for non-production would be seen as rural dole funded by Brussels and would be vulnerable in political and budgetary terms.</P>
    <P>However, it should be noted that the Santer proposals in the beef and dairy sectors have not gone for full decoupling in terms of area payments. The link between the direct payments and livestock numbers is to be retained in these sectors. Even where the link with production is maintained, cutting prices to below production cost equivalent would inevitably result in low cost-low output agriculture, with implications for the food processing and farm input sectors, the service sectors to agriculture and the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that the proposed 20 per cent cut in cereals prices has serious implications for grass-based agriculture.  Cheaper cereals will make grain-based livestock and milk production more competitive than grass-based production.  The proposed 30 per cent beef price cut and 20 per cent cereals price cut implies a rapid erosion of export refunds after 2001. Ireland also has a disproportionately high dependence <Col N="986" /> on export refunds for beef and dairy products which means the adjustment process will be greater and more costly.</P>
    <P>The Santer proposal that member states introduce differentiation of direct payments has many worrying implications.  It means that an envelope of money is provided for each sector in each member state.  The national government will then decide the rate of payment per hectare or per animal and the individual ceiling on the payment per farmer.  If governments interpret CAP direct payments as mainly income supports, then front loading is likely, with serious implications for commercial agriculture.  The social agenda will supersede the long-term commercial agenda.  This could be the first step to renationalisation of funding of the CAP direct payments.  The accompanying measures are already on a co-financing basis.  CAP direct payments could be supplemented from national budget resources. The consequences of this for Irish farmers are self-evident.</P>
    <P>If Irish grain prices post-2000 are tied to the intervention price of £75 per tonne, all growers will experience a serious reduction in income because of a shortfall in direct payments.  Income reduction will be more serious for winter growers of high yielding crops because of a further movement away from support on a tonnage basis to an area basis where average yields are the basis of payment.</P>
    <P>The Santer dairy proposals are not as severe as those relating to beef and cereals.  The proposals suggest a 10 per cent price cut to be compensated by direct payments.  These are costlier for the budget than the current market supports and are bound to be more vulnerable politically.  They are short on specifics and assessing their impact on dairy farmers' incomes involves making many assumptions.  Santer proposes that direct payments will be subject to a maximum per farm limit, although no figure is given for this ceiling. He also indicates that the amount of dairy cow premium will vary, depending on national average milk yields.  Stocking density criteria are not mentioned in the dairy package but would be coherent with environmental concerns and precedents in CAP Reform 1.</P>
    <P>An intervention price reduction on beef of approximately 30 per cent is severe.  Aids to private storage will be favoured over intervention where possible.  Increased direct premium payments will be necessary, particularly for the suckler cow and special beef premia.  The price cuts will reduce Irish prices from over 84p per pound to over 59p per pound, a price drop of 25p or £200 per head on the average steer.  A 30 per cent drop will cut output in the beef and livestock sector. The increased level of premium payments will be worth approximately £265 million, leaving a net loss of in excess of £88 million.</P>
    <P>With the cost of beef production at 80p per pound, a beef price of 60p per pound is well below the cost of production.  No farmer can stay <Col N="987" /> in production below cost.  Due to Ireland's dependence on market supports such as intervention and refunds, this level of cuts would impact more severely here than in any other member state.  If refunds are cut severely, will Ireland still be able to sell beef to our main markets in Russia and North Africa?  There is no compensation for price cuts on heifer beef in these proposals.</P>
    <P>According to farmers, the Minister's and the Government's priorities on the Santer beef and livestock proposals should be the protection of Ireland's largest agricultural sector, involving over 100,000 livestock producers, the maintenance of the beef price above the costs of production, the maintenance of a meaningful market price support system and the restoration of balance to the EU beef market through increased consumption and reduced production to support beef prices.  It is important to secure full premium compensation for any production or price cuts.</P>
    <P>Protecting the EU beef budget for beef and livestock farmers is also important, as is eliminating discrimination against the intensive grass based steer beef producer in favour of less intensive cereal based bull beef production.  Our suckler cow beef herd must be protected and premium compensation for heifer beef producers must be secured.  That sector of beef production has suffered more than most.  It is important to ensure that farmers remain in production during the year through the maintenance of deseasonalisation payments for winter finishers.  Equality of premium payments on livestock must be secured.</P>
    <P>The Santer proposals do not make much mention of the sheep sector but if the price of beef is cut by 30 per cent it will have a knock on effect on sheep production and lamb prices, thus posing serious implications for that sector.</P>
    <P>The Santer proposals for the beef and cereal sectors would cut costs to below production levels and when that happens farmers can no longer remain in production.  I urge the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and his Ministers of State, Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Davern, to make every effort to ensure that farmers can stay on the land.  Farmers themselves will take steps to ensure that no one can point the finger at them over pollution.  Farmers have been caretakers of the environment for generations and will continue to be so.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well.  I have no doubt that in negotiating this package of proposals he will ensure to the best of his ability that the interests of the farming sector are looked after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the response by the Leader and the Government to the repeated calls in this House for a debate not only on the Santer proposals but also on the future of agriculture. The Santer proposals mark yet another stage in the development and change of the agricultural sector of which we have seen so much in the past <Col N="988" /> 25 years, including the knock on effects for the economy and society generally.</P>
      <P>I would like to widen the context of the debate on the Santer proposals which are not just about prices and compensation for beef and cereals. The proposals paint only one part of an overall picture and are only one aspect of a bigger issue, which is the future of rural economies and communities. We cannot separate the two.  It has never been more true to say that when farmers sneeze the rest of the community catches a cold. Our rural towns and villages are closely linked to the health of the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>The Santer proposals provide an indication that the future has, in effect, already arrived. They constitute another stage in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which has been under way for a number of years.  I would like to draw attention to the future of our rural communities. The picture is one of a declining population engaged in agriculture and figures are widely available to support this.  The recently published ESRI report on occupational employment forecasts points to a steady increase in employment in every sector except agriculture. According to the ESRI, the only major occupational group in which jobs are expected to be lost is agriculture, which has been in continuing decline for a long period.  We can no longer ignore the implications of that.</P>
      <P>Similarly, recent labour force figures &mdash; which I have broken down to look at the mid west, part of which I represent &mdash; show that the number of people engaged in agriculture has declined from 21,500 in 1990 to 15,000 in 1997.  Even though the overall population is growing, there is a persistent decline in the rural population.  In other words, Ireland is becoming largely an urban society.  In the context of a declining rural population and declining numbers engaged in agriculture, we must ask ourselves what the future is for rural Ireland.  The reforms have started a process which, to a large extent, is inexorable.  That does not mean, however, that we cannot look at the whole issue of rural renewal, which is at the centre of any debate on the future of agriculture and rural communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a steady growth in the consolidation of large farms while there is a smaller but more affluent population on those farms.  That does not mean, however, that we do not have rural exclusion or poverty because we do.  In March 1997, the National Economic and Social Forum produced a report, <i>Rural Renewal: Combating Social Exclusion,</i> in which it refers to the factors contributing to rural social exclusion. When one examines the summary of those reasons, the extent to which EU policy has contributed to rural exclusion is stark and frightening. In summary, it points to centralisation as the main reason.  Since we joined the European Union in 1973 our policy has been hugely influenced by EU requirements and EU funding rules. The Common Agricultural Policy has had a particular <Col N="989" /> influence on rural Ireland in the areas of transport, tourism and communications.  This increased centralisation has not had a beneficial effect for everybody.</P>
    <P>The curtailment of services in rural areas is one element that has occurred as a result of increased rationalisation, which has become necessary as our membership of the European Union places greater demands upon us.  We have heard more than one reference in this debate and in others to globalisation and increased competition.  The intensification of this and the further enlargement of the European Union will, according to this report, further contribute to rural decline and social exclusion.  That is something we simply cannot and should not ignore.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future of rural Ireland from a lay person's point of view, towns which are currently being supported by the agricultural economy will have to adjust their economies to a large extent in the coming years as the rural population declines and the economy changes completely.  It creates a whole different set of needs for rural communities. For instance, jobs should be distributed to more than just the large centres of population and the infrastructure of cities.  Otherwise, the social cost does not bear thinking about.  Towns such as Nenagh, Thurles, Templemore and Roscrea are not getting their share of IDA jobs because its policy is to bring large employers to towns and cities such as Leixlip, Limerick and Cork.  That is great for those who work there.  An increasing number of workers in north Tipperary go to work in Limerick each day.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, to the House to debate this important motion.  I know he has sufficient energy to take the tourism industry by the scruff of the neck.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for his courage in tackling those who wanted to get rid of the shamrock as our tourism logo.  He got abuse from different people who wanted a shamrock which looked like it had green fly.  I could not understand those who thought it was a better logo because the Irish all over the world have no difficulty recognising the shamrock.  It is important to have a logo or symbol which is easily recognisable, particularly when people have access to the Internet.  I appreciate the stand taken by the Minister against his critics and the establishment. It showed he had courage to do his job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to be appointed spokesperson on tourism.  I see the value of promoting tourism in <Col N="990" /> the region I represent and on a cross-Border basis.  In 1996 the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, published a document to promote employment. However, it did not mention the tourism industry as having the potential to create jobs.</P>
    <P>The courage shown by the Minister will help him to deal with existing structures.  However, that is not a criticism of Bord Fáilte or of the regional tourism boards.  Bord Fáilte has done tremendous work in the past by establishing the importance of tourism.  However, the industry has overtaken Bord Fáilte.  It is only interested in supporting the large players to the detriment of the small businesses in rural Ireland.  I ask the Minister to focus on that part of the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to look for funding for small businesses.  Bord Fáilte &mdash; I refer to it as the glasshouse in Baggot Street &mdash; was a useful organisation in the past.  However, it is far removed from those who want help to provide extra rooms in their guesthouses or small hotels. There is no money available for extra accommodation in rural Ireland apart from that provided by the International Fund for Ireland and administered by Bord Fáilte.  That is not the best approach.</P>
    <P>We must trust the tourism organisations on a county basis.  I encourage the Minister to look at new structures.  Regional tourism boards did not receive funding so they were unable to make a contribution to their areas.  The manager of the regional tourism board in Sligo told me he did not receive funding so he could only attend conferences and festivals; he was unable to make a direct input.  Mr. Denis Doyle, an energetic man from Letterkenny, tried to promote County Donegal but he was not given any resources. There was an organisation on paper but no money was provided.  Why do we set up tourism organisations if we do not trust them?  The managers of our regional tourism boards are the best people we can find to promote regional tourism, yet they do not receive funding other than that necessary to pay office administration, travelling expenses and salaries.</P>
    <P>Small developers in dire need of recognition and support did not receive a recent grant in excess of £3 million for regional tourism in the north-west.  It was used instead to build a new office block in Sligo.  I cannot understand why a new office was provided for an organisation which does not give money to anyone.  The Minister will need all his energy to deal with an organisation which has been stagnant for a long time.  I appreciate the Taoiseach's decision to appoint a young energetic man, such as the Minister, to tackle this industry which has so much potential.</P>
    <P>Everyone recognises that families no longer live on the side of mountains.  Such areas are becoming depopulated.  Their only hope is that we develop tourism in rural Ireland.  The main focus should not be on the larger players who are competing to build seven or eight hotels in Dublin, <Col N="991" /> which, in itself, is good because it is great to see Ireland compete on the international scene. The potential which exists to develop the Dublin hotel industry can stand alone and we do not need to throw millions of pounds at it.  I strongly suggest that we provide assistance by way of grants and soft loans for the small players who have the training, expertise and a history of providing tourism facilities in rural Ireland.  I cannot emphasise that enough and I know I am encouraging a Minister who represents a number of the small tourism operators.</P>
    <P>A recent article stated that Ireland could price itself out of the market.  There is some truth in that because when I went to pay my bill for bed and breakfast after a conference in Limerick recently it cost £95, about twice what I expected.</P>
    <P>The Minister's job will not be easy because the established procedures and the existing organisations will make things difficult for him.  There is no point in the industry putting out a nice colour brochure every month containing a photograph of the director general of Bord Fáilte &mdash; a Donegal man who is probably one of the best directors general which the board has had for a long time &mdash; because that organisation does not have the capacity to develop the industry without reorganisation.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to welcome the Minister and to encourage him to take this most important Irish industry by the scruff of the neck and reorganise it.  I also encourage him to support the existing training organisations.  I read recently that he recognised that there is a serious shortage of trained people to deliver an up to date service in the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister many years of success.  He has a tough job but I have complete confidence in him.</P>

      <P>I second the motion. Tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil turasóireacht á plé anseo sa Seanad agus go bhfuil an tAire i láthair linn.  Tá áthas orm freisin go bhfuil béim á cur sa rún seo ar thurasóireacht ar leibhéal áitiúil mar is é seo bunchloch na turasóireachta.  Aon chabhair gur féidir linn a thabhairt, go mórmhór do the coistí contae, tá siúl agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire amhlaidh.</P>
      <P>I join Senator McGowan in welcoming the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation this evening and I also join him in striking a blow for the shamrock.  No doubt, in the same way, the Minister will put down a marker for Ireland in the field of tourism because he appreciates the great potential which exists for this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators are aware that tourism is one of the foremost growth industries.  It has one great advantage from a public representative's point of view, it is a decentralised industry which impacts on even the most remote parts of Ireland.  I am not suggesting that Cashel is remote by any means but coming from the home of the Rock of <Col N="992" /> Cashel, one of the foremost monuments in Europe which attracts almost 200,000 visitors each year, I can feel the winds of tourism and hear the aspirations which were enunciated down the years by those in the industry.  That is one of the reasons I am particularly pleased at the sentiments in the motion.</P>
    <P>When the county tourism committees were established some years ago they were received with great enthusiasm for two reasons.  First, a great effort was made in the structure of the committees to ensure that the different players in the industry on a nominated basis had an opportunity to bring their expertise and skills to bear on legislation and policy.  Second, because they are decentralised, they are in the best position to monitor the trends in tourism and take corrective action whenever necessary.  Above all, they are able to harness the voluntary and professional community skills which are related to tourism.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to review the workings, effectiveness, role and financing of the county tourism committees on some occasion.  I am aware that it is possible for them to seek financing, particularly under the heading of marketing, from Leader, the county enterprise boards, etc., but, because of the importance of these committees, it is important that they would have a budget of their own.  If each county committee was to receive a grant of even £25,000 per year, no doubt it would show an admirable dividend by the manner in which it would be used.  There is always the danger in boom times, particularly where tourism is concerned, to take continued growth for granted.  In the past we have seen how the reverberations from other aspects of life hit the tourism industry and that is why we must be prepared.</P>
    <P>We have one of the friendliest markets at our disposal because of the number of people of Irish extraction there are throughout the world.  In the US and Canada there are in excess of 40 million people of Irish extraction and there are tens of millions in Britain, Australia, etc.  Many of these people are potential customers and they should not be ignored.  When I travel abroad I often feel that, although these people may not be ignored in a blatant sense, we do not use the positive contribution which they can make by way of finance, influence and contacts.  If structures are being considered at some future date, the Minister might consider using these contacts on a committee basis in the countries to which I referred to ensure that we derive the maximum potential from what they are able to deliver.</P>
    <P>It is also important to remember that Ireland is successful in the tourism industry because of what we are, and we must always be careful and protective, although not overly protective, of the elements which make Ireland attractive to visitors. The Irish people are one of our main attractions.</P>
    <P>Six points emerged from one of the last major surveys on tourism which indicated the favoured pursuits of tourists visiting Ireland.  Of these, visits <Col N="993" /> to national monuments were most popular followed by genealogy and traditional entertainment. It is a pity that the nationwide scheme &mdash; Seisiún &mdash; for traditional entertainment, which was originally financed by Bord Fáilte, was terminated through lack of funding.  Will the Minister consider reintroducing that scheme?  I compliment Bord Fáilte for the work it carried out in the past.  It helped the country get up off its knees in terms of presenting itself to the rest of the world.  This was often achieved on a limited budget.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte still has an important role to play but it behoves us to examine and review structures. Things can change radically during a five or six year period.  For this reason I focus again on the main thrust of the motion, namely, the county tourism committees.  I have no doubt that the Minister, who has an admirable record in his constituency, appreciates the necessity to help, support, reward and encourage community effort, because at the end of the day that is the best investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well during his tenure at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
      <P>We must take this opportunity to consider what tourism, our second largest industry, means to us. Given that the greatest number of jobs have been created in the service industry in recent years, I cannot imagine that the former Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, stated that jobs are not being created in tourism.  It is obvious that tourism is very important to Ireland.  The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is keen to see it opened up and developed.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan referred to national symbols. The harp is the symbol of this House and the country in general, followed by the shamrock. There is no reason to move away from these symbols. I do not understand why anyone would wish to do so.  For example, if I am at an airport in a foreign country it warms the cockles of my heart to see the shamrock displayed on incoming Aer Lingus flights.  I am very proud of that symbol. Having said that, do we provide adequate promotion for our symbols?  Countries in northern Europe are always keen to promote the achievements of their citizens.  For example, many international golfers wear their national symbols on their clothing but Irish competitors do not seem to do so.  Providing such symbols at a small cost would promote the country internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a number of brilliant people competing in sport at international level, such as Michelle Smith.  We must remember the effect the symbol worn on her swimming cap &mdash; at very little cost &mdash; had on the rest of the world.  The same could be done for our competitors in international golf, rugby, soccer, etc.  Every opportunity should be taken to promote our symbols, particularly the shamrock, because people like to <Col N="994" /> see the Irish doing well.  As a people, the Irish are first to criticise their own competitors.  An example of that is the way we took to Michelle Smith, who did the country proud.  At the Olympic Games she won three gold medals and a bronze, a feat which I believe will not be achieved again by an Irish person.</P>
    <P>We should promote the achievements of Michelle Smith and others such as our winning team at the World Cup of golf.  The two golfers involved both come from Dublin &mdash; I am glad to state that Pádraig Harrington's father was born in County Cork &mdash; and I was thrilled by the fact that they, as Irishmen, were seen to be beating the rest of the world.  However, we tend to take such things for granted.  We should be promoting the symbol of the shamrock which should have appeared on the shirts of Paul McGinley and Pádraig Harrington.  I see no reason that the Minister could not investigate the promotion of our national symbol by our sports competitors. The cost involved would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>We must broaden our horizons in respect of tourism, particularly as the EU will demand that we do so in the future.  I visited Galway city yesterday and I could not believe the improvements brought about there.  The authorities in that city have grasped the nettle by recognising the importance of tourism opportunities.  Everyone involved in the business community in Galway to whom I spoke emphasised that point.  The authorities in the city see to it that particular areas are not upgraded but downgraded to ensure they retain their character.  As a result, there are some beautiful streets in Galway and in towns such as Kinsale, Killarney, etc.</P>
    <P>I question whether we are doing the right thing in respect of the business being attracted to Dublin. Is there a danger that too much air traffic is being attracted to the east coast?  We must ensure that other areas do not lose out because the majority of tourists fly into Dublin.  That city seems to be doing exceptionally well and I wish it the best of luck.  From Thursday until Sunday, Dublin is very busy with the numbers of people visiting from abroad.  Can this be done in other areas such as Kinsale in County Cork?</P>
    <P>People want to visit Ireland while Irish people want to remain here.  We should not forget the home tourist market, particularly in light of the numbers of people flying abroad for their holidays from Cork, Shannon and Dublin throughout the year.  Why can we not encourage more people to take holidays at home?  What would be the costs involved?  In that regard, Senator McGowan stated that it cost him £95 for a night's bed and breakfast in a hotel, which is very questionable.  Are our services being adequately upgraded and are we providing proper facilities?  We must consider the towns which have been successful in this area.  For example, Killarney is an eye-opener.  Anyone with an ounce of motivation is involved in business in Killarney as are their counterparts in Kenmare and <Col N="995" /> other places.  We should encourage such enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>The provision of £25,000 to local tourism committees is not much to ask.  I am a member of an enterprise board in Cork city and our moneys for the coming year have already been spent.  Tourism committees should be in a position to create more opportunities.  Perhaps they should be given £250,000 per year.  I do not know how many of these committees are in existence but the provision of such funds would be money well spent. Those committees are aware of the local initiatives, incentives and opportunities which can be created.</P>
    <P>I am not a promoter of County Meath but let us consider the way Kells has been upgraded in recent years.  The authorities in that town deserve great credit for maximising its potential.  Cashel, County Tipperary, is another example, particularly the way the Rock of Cashel has been promoted. The same can be said of cities and towns in other countries.  For example, consider the way the city of York in England promotes its castle. Everyone in Kilkenny deserves great credit for creating an opportunity and incentive for people to visit their town to see something different. Such opportunities exist in other places.  You cannot purchase property in Westport at present because of its success, which was long overdue. We must provide towns and tourism committees with further opportunities in respect of promotion. I play golf with reasonable success and I love the game.  I can see what it could mean to the country.  Many tourists fly to Shannon to use particular golf courses.  The Minister was at Doonbeg with Greg Norman last week; it is wonderful to have Greg Norman walking the dunes at Doonbeg and considering the site to be wonderful. If he cannot make something out of Doonbeg it will be an insult to golf and to Doonbeg. However, he will make something of it and the people who have shown the initiative on that project deserve great credit.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development is giving £2.5 million to the development at Doonbeg.  However, similar funding opportunities do not exist in other parts of the country and that annoys me.  Shannon Development can give the funds because the development is in its region.  Other regional authorities should be given similar opportunities.</P>
    <P>I worked in the licensed trade for many years and it is an insult that between April and October people cannot get a drink before 12 noon and after 12 midnight on a Sunday.  It is not good for business.  For too long we have closed our minds with the impression that we must stop the locals getting too much to drink.  We are now on top of the locals in that if they drink and drive they will suffer the consequences.  I would appreciate if the Minister would consider this matter seriously. The EU will tell us that we must implement the same rules and regulations as in other countries. We give the impression that everybody wants to <Col N="996" /> have a lot to drink.  However, many people do not, but they cannot have a drink after hours in a restaurant, for example.  The matter should be examined.</P>
    <P>There are golden opportunities in the service industries.  In many of our cities businesses are looking for full-time and part-time staff.  Irish people want to invest in Ireland, to stay at home for their holidays and make use of the services available, although not at a rate of £95 per night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid) Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for tabling this motion and allowing me the chance to speak in the House.  Many points have been raised and it will be impossible to deal with them all, but I assure the House that many of them have been brought to my attention already and I have commented on them.  While the points Senator Cregan and others have made may not be too popular in certain circles, they are relevant nonetheless.  Such points of view should be aired in the House because it helps in tackling the problems which exist.</P>
      <P>I compliment the county tourism committees on the role they play in the development of tourism in Ireland.  Senator McGowan is right that they have been underfunded in the past.  I have ideas to advance on how they should be funded. We take tourism very seriously and we have every right to do so.  It has enjoyed phenomenal success over the past decade, with new records being achieved each year in visitor numbers and in the yield in overseas revenue.  Tourism is now our second biggest industry and I have no doubt that it will soon become our largest industry.  It supports over 108,000 jobs, or one in 12 of the workforce, and it generates £1.9 billion pounds annually.  With such economic indicators it is easy to see that tourism is fast becoming a vital force in the Irish economy.  The tourism industry is one of the Celtic tiger's most vivacious cubs and it must be looked after.</P>
      <P>The benefits of a vibrant and expanding tourism sector have led to a continuing and increased emphasis on the sector as an engine for growth in successive national economic programmes.  The results of this have become evident to anyone who has travelled around the country in recent years.  The scale of private investment which has flowed into tourism since the late 1980s is evident in the development of Ireland's canals and waterways; in conference and leisure facilities at our hotels; in the upgrading of accommodation generally to meet and even exceed international standards; in the provision of all-weather facilities; in increased marketing and training and in the development of other new and different tourism infrastructures.  I compliment those who in the successive national development plan periods from 1983 to the present have used EU Structural Funds to create an obviously successful tourism product.  We will have seven million visitors by the turn of the century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> As we face the remainder of the decade the challenge to create further economic growth and employment has not been greater.  The targets the Government has set for the tourism industry are ambitious, but I have no doubt that further growth in the Irish economy is achievable. Recently, I asked Bord Fáilte in London to aim for a further 10 per cent growth on top of the 10 per cent growth projected this year.  Often, if we look to the past we can identify where resources should be targeted in the future, a point made by Senator McGowan.</P>
    <P>The available Bord Fáilte estimates on tourism revenue show that over the past number of years growth rates have been achieved in all regions of Ireland which are better than international and European annual averages and this should be seen for the unqualified success story that it is. There has been growth in all regions, but it has been at a rate of 85 per cent on the east coast, 41 per cent in the west and 20 per cent in the north-west. There is unquestionably a problem which must be addressed, although there has been growth in all areas.  I am conscious that the increase in tourism growth is not equitably distributed throughout all the regions and is not being experienced by all sections of the industry. I assure the House that my Department along with Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism bodies, including the county tourism committees, will try to ensure in so far as we can that the benefits of the continuing record growth in tourism are spread throughout the island.</P>
    <P>Promoting greater regional spread and extending the tourism season are vital elements in our tourism policy and I can assure the House that they are at the top of my list of priorities. Having said that, we cannot direct tourists to areas where they do not wish to go.  It is up to the industry practitioners to put in place the sound business strategies to successfully market their own facilities and areas.  The evidence would suggest that those operators who apply professional marketing practices are winning market share over those who sit on their laurels.</P>
    <P>Ongoing investment in marketing is vitally necessary to maintain the growth of tourism in the face of increased competition and that is why I have taken steps to ensure that a more intensive marketing campaign is carried out in 1998, my first full year as Minister.  Earlier this month I announced that Bord Fáilte would be in a position to increase significantly its level of promotional activity in the coming year.  I would caution, however, that the Celtic tiger and her cubs also have a propensity to devour unless they are catered for.  For the 1998 season, Bord Fáilte will have sufficient scope within their grant-in-aid to pump up to £5 million extra in Exchequer funds into the marketplace for direct marketing activities over and above this year's spend and it has been given a directive to direct it at the regions. This will represent an increase of 50 per cent in Exchequer expenditure on direct marketing <Col N="998" /> activity and I am grateful to my colleague, the Minister of Finance, for this.  Because I am particularly anxious that all the regions should get the maximum benefit possible from our growing tourism performance, I asked Bord Fáilte to design and bring to me a series of additional new initiatives for its 1998 campaign targeted not only at maintaining tourism growth, but most particularly at improving that regional spread.  I await its proposals which I expect to receive shortly.</P>
    <P>Selling Ireland abroad as a holiday destination is one of the most important investments we can make for the future of our economy.  To this end my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in his capacity as Minister for Tourism and Trade, had the foresight to commission a review of the role of Bord Fáilte.  Following the implementation of the recommendations of this review, undertaken by Arthur D. Little and Company, Consultants, the role of the board was clearly focused on marketing Ireland overseas as a tourist destination.  Unquestionably, this strategy has worked in the US.  Over the past three years Ireland has increased its take of US visitors by up to 71 per cent while other European countries combined have only been able to add approximately 70 per cent.  Overseas marketing is working and we are getting visitors to come here but we want to achieve a more even spread.  This strategy dovetails effectively with the operations of the regional tourism structures which were put in place in 1993, following a review of the co-ordination of tourism at regional level as recommended by the tourism task force and confirmed in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>It was also the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who agreed with the representatives of the regional tourism authorities the existing institutional structures for Irish tourism at regional and county level.  Resulting from that agreement a new structure based upon county divisions was established to replace the regional councils of the regional tourism authorities.  Consequently, each county was to be represented by a county tourism committee comprising representatives of the various membership categories within each regional tourism authority, including members of voluntary groups and organisations.  In this way, it could be said that they were truly representative of the industry in their specific regions.  In addition, new slimmed down boards of management were established to replace the regional tourism authority management committees.</P>
    <P>County tourism committees are actively involved in formulating plans for tourism development at local county level while the regional tourism authorities continue to have responsibility for tourism development at regional level agreed without the resources mentioned by Senator McGowan.  These developments include the co-ordination of the activities of the county tourism committees, the operation of the tourist information networks and the application of certain accommodation standards. <Col N="999" /> The county tourism committees are responsible for stimulating and co-ordinating projects in the tourism sector by identifying, influencing and bringing forward new products and initiatives in their operational plan and inputting into the county enterprise board action plans and the regional tourism authorities plans.  I met a number of people involved in the regional county tourism boards.  I agree with Senators on the accommodation situation at which I will look.  I am more inclined to look at existing licensed accommodation, which has received no further funding since being set up, with a view to improving it.</P>
    <P>There are those who say the county tourism committees can be regarded as talking shops with little real power or influence.  I do not agree.  The county tourism committees are in an ideal position to demonstrate a capacity for creativity and innovation by encouraging and developing product initiatives in their respective areas.  These committees can operate effectively as vehicles for attracting EU funds for marketing under the various tourism programmes.  In addition, the close links between each county tourism committee and its respective regional tourism authority help to ensure a consistency in developmental and promotional activity thus maximising scarce resources.  If a product is successful in one area, it is often copied elsewhere.  As with medicine, if one pill makes a person feel well, how good would they feel after taking ten pills?  That is not the way go.  We must maximise resources and devise planned activity for the regions.  I have always agreed that local people know best.</P>
    <P>The county tourism committees are working well and I have no immediate plans to change them other than to try to get them extra resources.  Their future role will be considered in the context of the broader review that is taking place with the objective of better integration, effectiveness and delivery of services of a number of committees, boards, partnerships and programmes that operate at local and county level.</P>
    <P>One of the key aims of the Department of the Environment's report &ldquo;Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change&rdquo;, published in December 1996, was to devise a framework for the better integration of the systems of local government and local development.  I understand a structure was proposed to commence this process of integration at local authority level but there were some delays in getting the process under way and no further action was taken by the previous Government, a matter at which I am looking.</P>
    <P>This month the Minister for the Environment and Local Government requested city and county authorities to submit proposals for the establishment of a number of strategic policy committees &mdash; SPCs &mdash; and of a corporate policy group &mdash; CPG &mdash; within each authority area.  I suggest Members take a comprehensive look at that.  In <Col N="1000" /> the context of my mandate for local development as well as tourism, my Department will continue to consult with the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the development of integration proposals and the future role of the county tourism committees will, <i>inter alia,</i> be examined in this context.</P>
    <P>Clearly, I cannot prejudge the results of this work but I want to make it clear that I am fully aware of the significant role the county tourism committees have played, and are playing, in the successful development of tourism and I commend them in this regard.</P>
    <P>If tourism is to continue to be a major success story &mdash; a number of Senators gave warnings with which I agree &mdash; future promotion and development will have to receive support not only from the Exchequer but in increasing amounts from all involved with the tourism industry.  In the past we have been fortunate in being able to rely on our European partners to help finance our development needs through the EU Structural Funds. While I believe that the case for a substantial level of continued EU funding can be made &mdash; and the Government is committed to pursuing this aggressively in Brussels &mdash; we will have to look to ourselves much more in the future, particularly in the productive sectors of the economy such as tourism.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer provided over £27 million this year through Bord Fáilte for the promotion and development of tourism.  This is a generous amount by international comparisons.  The European countries with which we compete draw on large contributions from the tourism industry.  It is only fair that the direct beneficiaries of the Irish tourism boom make a meaningful contribution to future development needs.  This concerns not only hotels and providers of accommodation but also retailers, publicans, gift manufacturers and food and drink companies. Many people in different professions and businesses believe they are not benefiting from tourism. As EU funds diminish in future, it is my job to ensure they realise that the economy is benefiting from tourism.  This applies across the board, especially in the product development, marketing and training areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators in the points they made, especially that if this boom is to continue, we must protect the Celtic tiger and its cubs.  I am disappointed that in certain areas of the country we may be cutting our throats on this matter, as pointed out by Senators McGowan and Cregan.  I recently paid £4 for a cup of coffee in Dublin; that is an example of the issues which must be examined.  The Irish welcome is coming under intense pressure.  Once success is achieved in the tourism industry, there is an inclination to become complacent.  Those who visit this country want to avail of what we have to offer: the landscape, the wonderful scenery, the golf and other sporting facilities and, above all, the welcome of the people.  The céad míle fáilte is not what it was <Col N="1001" /> and, unless we realise that, we are making a sorry mistake.  The Irish welcome belongs to us all and is something to which we must pay attention.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is engaged in discussions with the tourism industry to ensure Government funding is matched by funding from the tourism industry for international marketing programmes.  In France, for example, seven francs per night is paid by each beneficiary towards the marketing of the tourism industry.  County tourism committees should continue to try to convince local businesses they are benefiting from tourism so that they will invest in the future and provide the necessary resources to make this aspiration a reality.  I compliment two committees, Donegal and Galway, on their initiatives.  Donegal raised £920,000 from the private sector, and Galway asked industry to invest £1 million.  Both realise the potential they have on their doorsteps.  That so much has already been achieved is a tribute to the efforts and the commitment of those who operate within the industry.  I have no doubt the regional tourism bodies will continue to play a positive role in contributing to the achievement of the Government's objective for the future development of the sector.</P>
    <P>I stated recently that the image of the Temple Bar area is not what was intended when the project was first devised.  We must examine such areas which were heavily invested in.  We should be proud of them but we cannot afford to cut our throats on the matter.</P>
    <P>We have wonderful sportsmen.  I am delighted to have the sports portfolio because, for example, I was able to host a reception this evening for Pádraig Harrington and my Donegal colleague, Paul McGinley, who brought the World Cup in golf back to Ireland after 39 years.  All Senators will join with me in congratulating them on that.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for giving me the opportunity to speak on this issue.  One can only learn by listening, something I have been taught to do best as a doctor.  I hope to be able to do this for all my colleagues on both sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the Minister's congratulations to Pádraig Harrington and Paul McGinley on bringing the World Cup in golf back to Ireland.  They have been wonderful ambassadors for the country.  Golf is one of the fastest growing areas of tourism here and Ireland is regarded as one of the Meccas of golfing.  It is an area of enormous benefit and some 250,000 tourists come here to play golf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was horrified to hear the Minister paid £4 for a cup of coffee.  It is outrageous that any establishment would charge that amount.  It would be a tremendous turnoff for any visitors to be charged in that fashion.  The message should be sent out loudly and clearly that we must be careful not to kill the golden goose.  We must not get too greedy and charge exorbitant prices because the end result will be to earn an international <Col N="1002" /> reputation as a nice but very expensive place to visit.  It would be a terrible shame if that were to happen.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable discrepancy in the prices charged by hotels in the vicinity of Leinster House.  The Earl of Kildare Hotel and Buswells Hotel charge between £50 and £60 per night, the Mont Clare Hotel charges £150 per night and the Davenport Hotel charges a colossal £200 per night.  That is in proportion to the £4 the Minister was charged for his coffee.  If hotels so close to each other charge such widely varying prices, we should make it clear it should not be happening and that it does no good for our reputation or for the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Exchequer contributed £27 million last year to the industry, but it has not been a major contributor itself.  I like the Minister's idea that each establishment which gains from tourism makes a contribution.  It would be a worthwhile initiative.  To this end a surcharge is made on local authority service charges and commercial rates for bed and breakfast establishments in Galway.  I do not know if that is the way to go but there should be some contribution from the industry.</P>
    <P>While the county tourism committees deal with the tourism industry in the rest of the country, Dublin Tourism deals with it in Dublin. The industry is expanding rapidly in the city and the proof of that is in the 40 or more hotels under construction, a 50 per cent increase on the existing number.  In the past the main tourism information centre was located in O'Connell Street and it is where one went when one came to Dublin to find out everything one needed to know.  I am sure the Leader will be interested in these remarks as he is involved in the tourism industry on the north side.  Dublin Tourism moved from its Dún Laoghaire office and found a city centre location in Suffolk Street.  However, this is on the south side and is off the beaten track.  It then closed its offices in Dún Laoghaire and O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>The majority of people coming to Ireland enter via the north side of the city.  Dublin Airport, Connolly station and Busáras are all on the north side.  There are huge numbers of bed and breakfast hostels on the north side around Talbot Street, Gardiner Street and Parnell Square. Senator Cassidy is providing some top class hotels in this vicinity.  However, there is no tourist information office nearby.  One must travel to the south side to find tourist accommodation or sightseeing destinations throughout the country.  This is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>We are always talking about getting the right development balance.  The north side of the city is being run down.  Dublin Tourism has deliberately, and unfairly, downgraded the north side, despite its promise that there would be a central office in O'Connell Street.  It never fulfilled that promise and there is an imbalance in the development of the tourism industry.  The Minister should raise <Col N="1003" /> this matter with Frank Magee, Chief Executive of Dublin Tourism.  The business sector on the north side is tired of bringing this matter to his attention and getting no proper response.  I would be delighted if the Minister would assist in this matter. Otherwise, I cannot see us making much headway.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Temple Bar, which has been developing in a disproportionate manner. There is a danger that this area will fast turn into a ghetto if it continues on its present course. It is the area for stag parties and where tourists do their drinking.  Many tourists come to Dublin solely to drink.  The area is now being identified with these activities and it is only time before it turns into a seedy tourist ghetto to which real tourists will not be attracted.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the concern among the FAI and League of Ireland clubs about the proposals to relocate Wimbledon FC to Dublin.  I regularly attend Bohemians and St. Patrick's Athletic and they believe this will decimate the League of Ireland clubs.  There will be unfair competition and Irish clubs will have no opportunity to access this market.  The project is being promoted as a venture capital scheme.  It is tied up with Sky Sports, and Mr. Murdoch wishes this to be one of the jewels in his crown in that he will have a club in Ireland for which he could sell the rights to the games.  I am sure that there are some benefits to this idea; however, League of Ireland games would become second rate viewing if there was a spectacular game every second week in the city.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak about the promotion of tourism at county level.  It is time we provided funding for the county tourism committees. Not long ago we debated a tourism plan in County Offaly.  We had 14 different organisations involved in tourism promotion in the county.  One good tourism committee could do much of the work currently being duplicated by these organisations. The Midlands and County Offaly have much to offer &mdash; Clonmacnoise, Slieve Bloom, Birr Castle and so on.  However, in conjunction with tourism development, we also need to develop the infrastructure, such as roads.  A number of Departments are involved in these matters and the quality of services provided leaves much to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was correct in stating the need to increase the number of English tourists coming to Ireland by 10 per cent.  It is disheartening to see so many Irish people flying to foreign destinations. If we promoted our own tourist attractions, many of these people would stay at home and spend their money in Ireland.  The Minister <Col N="1004" /> is well known to the hotel trade.  It saddens one to think that he was charged £4 for a cup of coffee in a hotel Dublin.  One wonders what an ordinary punter would be charged.  I assure the Minister that he would not be charged so much in the Midlands, Cork or Kerry.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be a pioneer and I do not pretend to speak for publicans.  However, something must be done about bar extensions.  Tourists on the Shannon must vacate pubs at closing time. They can go to a night-club which has a bar extension and remain drinking until the small hours of the morning.  If one is going to grant extensions to night-clubs then this measure must be implemented across the board.  This may not be the position in the Minister's mind.  However, if he does not allow longer opening hours to publicans, he should curtail bar extensions in night-clubs.</P>
    <P>The Minister is committed to tourism.  He has the interests of the industry at heart and I hope that he will do all in his power to increase the tourist numbers.  It is a point he should examine, particularly in areas where there are not huge numbers of tourists and where we hope to develop; I am thinking of areas such as Tullamore. People are undertaking large expenditure in the hotel business and perhaps the Minister will be in a position in the future to help them financially to look after the interests of the many tourists we hope will come to the region.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well and hope that as elected Members of Seanad Éireann we can work with him to promote tourism in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and look forward to many visits from him and thank him for coming here to take this very serious motion.</P>
      <P>I concur with the previous speakers' comments that Bord Fáilte does not have a tourist office in Dublin.  This is a disgrace and is a reflection on the Department.  We look forward to the action the Minister will take now that we have made him aware of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 4,000 people visiting this office every day from April until the end of September. I know from experience that there is a downturn of business in the north inner city of up to 30 per cent.  There are very few museums or all-weather places of family entertainment which are vital to any capital city in this area.  It is a disgrace that this was allowed to happen.  To compound this, Dublin Corporation are giving £200,000 per year to Dublin Tourism to bring the tourists down the quays to a big signpost on O'Connell Bridge &ldquo;Turn right and move south side&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach's constituency is on the north side of the city and I am sure he is not pleased with this.  The Minister has been given one of the top three senior portfolios in the new Cabinet and we look forward to him delivering to all sides of the city of Dublin.  The north inner city of Dublin has seen nothing of the Celtic tiger.  It is time Dublin Tourism, <Col N="1005" /> Bord Fáilte and the Government woke up to what is happening there.  There are a few private individuals trying to uplift the north inner city but they are not getting one penny by way of help to employ people or regenerate the area.  Money is put into the south side where the millionaires and the billionaires live.  This is not fair and it is dangerous from a security viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Everyone who takes a portfolio is determined to do their level best and the Minister, Deputy McDaid is no different.  I look forward to him taking immediate action and opening a tourist office where people coming into the city centre can get literature showing where the Garden of Remembrance and the various museums in the north inner city are located.  It is a historic area and it has many tourist attractions, perhaps the best being the historic walk in the north inner city where so many decent voluntary organisations are doing their best to keep tourism alive.</P>
    <P>North-west Meath is an area with great tourism potential.  It boasts lakes, golfing facilities, fishing, walking and all the related activities.  We call it the hidden Ireland: Derravaragh, Lough Lene, Tullynally Castle, the seven wonders of Fore and the village of Finane which next year will celebrate the bicentennial of Miles the Slasher but in all of this area there is not one hotel.  People would invest in their own area if grants were available and 50 or 60 people could be employed &mdash; as many as any small factory.  There are many other places throughout the country where something should be done to encourage investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated accommodation and services are becoming very expensive.  The two star hotels in Dublin city are charging around £30 per room.  That is not excessive.  Ryanair mid-week flights cost £19 and, staying at two star hotels, these people do well.  The Minister quoted £4 for a cup of coffee.  That particular hotel is top of the range and charges £8 for a bowl of soup.  Ordinary people do not go there because they cannot afford it.  That is for the high and mighty.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that if we do not put money into training, Ireland of the welcomes may be lost.  Why?  The simple reason is that Irish people will not be serving you.  The money should be given to schools and colleges to train the young Irish people.  Tourism is a service industry and unless you have energy you will have little to contribute because the hours are long and the staff must have an outgoing personality.  The Irish people were always known for their character.</P>
    <P>When last week the Government donated £750 million to training in technology and industry, employers and employees applauded.  The multinational companies are telling their parent companies about the great work this Government is doing.  As regards providing Irish staff for the service industry, bar staff, waiting staff and chefs cannot be found.  If the Minister wants Ireland of the welcomes, money should be donated to training. At presently people are coming from other <Col N="1006" /> countries looking for jobs and finding them in the hotel industry.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the great work he is doing in sport.  It was terrific to see the golfing world cup come back to Ireland.  I congratulate the Minister for welcoming the players home on behalf of the Government.  We have tremendous sports people and entertainers.  The Minister sees what Daniel O'Donnell does for the tourist season in Donegal.  Perhaps these sports people and entertainers should be made ambassadors.  They do not want any remuneration but their contributions to promoting Ireland abroad should be acknowledged by the Government and be available to promote Ireland abroad.  Daniel O'Donnell will attract 12,000 people to one concert in Birmingham next April.  Here is an opportunity for Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and An Bord Tráchtála to endorse the country and the product they are promoting.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's stewardship of this area and I look forward to seeing him here again to discuss tourism further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

      <P>I welcome the Minister and concur with Senator Cassidy's remarks about the public acknowledgement of the outstanding contribution made by the golfers Pádraig Harrington and Paul McGinley to the image of Ireland. Given the Minister's wide brief it is inevitable we will stray into areas beyond the motion before us but it is an opportunity to compliment him on the position he has taken on a range of issues, especially in the area of sport.  I hope he will be able to resolve the seemingly unending controversy regarding the relocation of Wimbleton FC to Dublin, which is once again in the news.  I do not envy the Minister his task: it would take a Solomon like judgment.  However, I hope the issue will be resolved in the best interests of Irish sport.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with virtually all the Minister has said on the motion.  I wish to raise a number of issues as they affect a border county, matters which are close to the Minister's heart.  It strikes me that every year at this time there is public debate about tourist numbers and the revenue generated by tourism.  On the one hand Bord Fáilte gives what must be accepted as the authoritative position but the various tourist interests question this through their trade organisations, as has recently happened.  The problem seems to be the lack of a proper dispersal of tourist promotion funds to parts of the country which need them, something the Minister referred to.  It seems the Celtic tiger economy is not reaching all the parts we would like it to in the context of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regional structure is almost past its sell-by date.  The enhancement and encouragement of the county committee concept is excellent.  The regional structures have served their purpose to a degree, but Leitrim, which was in a regional structure like many other counties, suffered a crisis of confidence because of the big brother <Col N="1007" /> factor.  Donegal, with its highly developed tourist infrastructure relative to the region, was always seen as the main beneficiary of tourism in the northwest.  The decisions taken in attracting tourist numbers to the northwest invariably and inevitably benefited Donegal simply because of its size.  I could quote similar situations in Galway, Kerry and the southeast where there are smaller counties attached to larger entities.  I am convinced that the creation of the tourism committees has been of major help in assisting the tourist interests in those individual counties to regain their confidence about their product.  It has given them a semi-autonomy to develop the tourist products they have.  My impression is that the Minister wishes to further develop this structure.</P>
    <P>In many cases the regional structures as set up did not meet with the approval of those whom they were serving.  The northwest tourism region includes practically all the border counties, including Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  Donegal is a separate tourist product with a particular tourist ethos which is dissimilar to that of Leitrim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Monaghan has a different tourist ethos from Sligo.  In the southwest, Cork has a totally different tourist ethos in its culture and what it offers in comparison to Kerry.  This is not a criticism; it is a fact of life.  However, with the county committees now freeing up the regional structure and loosening the bonds, I hope things do not go to the other extreme and encourage parochialism to the point where Cork would glare across the border at Kerry &mdash; they do it in football anyway &mdash; or Leitrim would glare across the border at Roscommon, its nearest neighbour in football terms.</P>
      <P>I know the mid-Leitrim/north Shannon region best and there is a commonality of tourist product which incorporates County Roscommon, parts of County Cavan and County Leitrim.  Perhaps the Minister on an ongoing basis would encourage county committees to identify and work together on common tourist products, despite the fact that they cross county boundaries.  I am not suggesting another embryonic regional structure but that within the loose autonomy of county committees there be an acknowledgement that, for example, the best fishing river does not stop at the county boundary or that the best scenery does not end in the next townland because it happens to be in another county.  I do not know how this might be achieved but the Minister is in the best position to pull the pieces together.  I hope rampant parochialism which promotes one county and ignores others will not emerge.  We do not want an attitude which entices people only to County Leitrim or County Cork, for example.  In attracting people to a region it is hoped they will visit the various component parts of that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> Reference was made to Temple Bar.  I believe what is going on there is a national disgrace and is reflecting badly on the image of Ireland. Regarding the possibility of a premiership football team locating in Dublin, can Members imagine the amount of angst and hassle that would result in having security procedures put in place to shepherd bunches of beer swilling louts from the ferry through Dublin to Temple Bar before or after a football match?  Ireland should not be prepared to pay the price for this.  I do not know how the problem can be solved in Temple Bar but it is not the sort of place that was intended.  The most recent documentary on Ulster Television showed the monster we have created and I wonder if there is a need for the Minister to intervene in the context of pub licences.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a weakness in the marketing of our capital city.  We all have anecdotal evidence and the most recent I have concerns American friends who asked me if I had information on Kilmainham Gaol which they wished to visit. They were staying in a four star hotel on the southside of the city which did not have any information on it.  I had to telephone the Office of Public Works which said it had lots of information on Kilmainham, including a brochure. However, the brochure was not available.  We should be able to market major and impressive tourist products such as Kilmainham.  Is a similar problem being experienced by other tourist attractions?</P>
    <P>I emphatically support Senator Cassidy's point that there is a need for flagship tourist products in various parts of the country and in particular for a hotel in the border regions.  We do not have sufficient hotels.  I am not talking about a plethora of hotels but it would be wonderful if there was a Slieve Russell Hotel in every county because it has attracted visitors not only during the tourist season but also during the shoulder and off season.  It has generated so much income that it has created a buoyant economy in a part of west Cavan which badly needed it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that under the operational programme, investment in accommodation infrastructure is down played to the point where only 20p per £1 was available for providing accommodation.  This view was influenced by the enormous number of hotels centred in the identifiable tourism areas, such as Dublin, Cork, Kerry, the southeast and parts of the west, but there are large areas of the border counties with no proper hotel facilities.  In County Leitrim there are only two hotels &mdash; and I hope I am not misquoted on this matter &mdash; which are worthy of the name.  The northern part of the county, which the Minister recently visited for the opening of a sculpture school in Manorhamilton, is badly in need of a flagship hotel.  However, there will be no investment or fairy godfather or godmother of an entrepreneur coming to an area with a low population and a relatively poor infrastructure. <Col N="1009" /> They will inevitably be attracted by the large urban renewal tax schemes in various parts of the country, not least in Dublin.  Surely there is a case for an equivalent rural renewal tax scheme similar to the urban scheme which might encourage people to build, on a qualified basis, impressive hotels with facilities such as conference centres, golf courses and so on.  County Donegal is the best example I can cite as it has magnificent hotels centred in all of the major areas such as Bundoran, Donegal town and Letterkenny.  The future of rural Ireland rests with hotels of similar standard.  I know that if the Minister for Finance would loosen the purse strings it might be easier to achieve this.</P>
    <P>As a member of the National Economic and Social Forum, it came to my attention, in one of the reports which came before us in the past 12 to 18 months, that CERT does not allow apprentices to join before they are 16 years of age, yet there is a significant group of children leaving school at 15 years of age without having acquired proper talents.  I do not know why CERT has not introduced a lower age limit but as its training schemes have a 100 per cent placement rate perhaps the Minister would look into this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion refers specifically to county committees and although they are important the issue must also be viewed in a national context.</P>
      <P>Knowing County Leitrim quite well, I fully support the points made by Senator Mooney on the lack of hotel accommodation there.  There is also a lack of restaurants, even in the county town. That is a serious issue which must be examined.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, the Government cannot cope with the amount of tax revenue coming in and, on the other, it cannot increase public spending or the number of public servants.  It must find imaginative ways of giving taxation revenue back to the people without appearing to do so and the tourism industry provides a way in which to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister re-examine capital taxation allowances for investment in tourism?  I would like him to change the procedure where allowances are based solely on geographical areas. That has caused huge difficulties, even in political terms.  It is a terrible waste of resources to include a town such as Westport, County Mayo, in the capital taxation allowance area.  Capital allowances should be granted to areas in north-west Mayo.  The Government has set up a special task force to increase employment in this area but one cannot drive to this area or travel to it by train without experiencing difficulty or delays.  There are no special allowances made for tourism investment in these areas.  The town of Belmullet in north-west Mayo has a championship golf course and an airport runway but does not have a hotel as it is not included in the areas for capital taxation allowances unlike towns such as <Col N="1010" /> Enniscrone, Youghal, Kilkee, Westport and Bundoran.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, in the two weeks prior to the budget, the Minister should consider targeting specific projects rather than particular areas.  If someone in Westport or Belmullet comes up with a proper proposal which the Minister's Department feels will enhance the tourism product in the area and create employment on a year round basis, then that is how we should proceed.  The Minister could restrict the scheme to large areas but we should consider the western seaboard in particular.  The real difficulty lies with the infrastructure of the west coast from County Donegal to west County Cork.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance would consider allowing capital allowances to apply to projects rather than areas.</P>
    <P>There is such a lack of uniformity at county level on the approach to tourism that it would make one weep.  I come from Dingle, County Kerry, which lies at the heart of the tourism industry and is a major tourist destination. However, I want to consider areas, particularly the midland counties, which are neglected.  These are extraordinarily beautiful counties but they are not getting the breaks they deserve.  County Roscommon, from which the Cathaoirleach hails, has the most beautiful lakes in the whole country with the exception, perhaps, of Cavan and Leitrim. The Strokestown and Douglas Hyde interpretative centres are located in County Roscommon and the Shannon river flows through it.  A tourist could spend a couple of weeks in County Roscommon and find something different to do every day.  Recently, the town of Boyle twinned with a town in south east England.  It is a beautiful area but it is never marketed.  One could not imagine someone spending the August bank holiday weekend in County Roscommon even though it is a beautiful county.</P>
    <P>If one travels along the Shannon, one will see a complete disparity in terms of investment on both banks of the river.  Longford County Council has not spent any money on the River Shannon which is its major tourist magnet.  There are bridges at Tarmonbarry and Lanesboro along the river but the investment in both of those towns has taken place on the Roscommon side of the river.  Longford County Council has erected seven bridges across the Royal Canal which means that people cannot travel by boat into Longford town either by the canal or the Camlin river.  Neither can they travel on the ring route of the Grand Canal and Royal Canal.  For a very small input, we could create a huge investment draw in that beautiful county.  There is a lack of access to areas on the river such as Barna harbour, north of Athlone.  There are many such beautiful and untainted places.</P>
    <P>Someone already referred to the issue of pub licences; there is nothing as embarrassing as being in a town where there is zero tolerance of licensing <Col N="1011" /> laws and where people are thrown out of pubs at 11.30 p.m. when they are on their holidays.</P>

      <P>In places such as east Clare and north Tipperary people have set up tourism information centres without support from the Department of Tourism.  Those people deserve huge support. This issue must be looked at in the budget and all the county committees should be given a strategy to deal with the tourism resources in their area in order that they can be marketed as a county rather than one specific area, for example, people should not be going to the Downhill Hotel in Ballina, they should be going to Mayo.  That is the approach we should adopt.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion because it is a subject on which many Members have ideas that relate to both their counties and the entire country.  County tourism committees are part of the national framework for tourism development.  Bord Fáilte operates at national level, there are regional tourism organisations and there are county tourism committees which have a major role in promoting tourism at county level.  It follows therefore that some provision should be made for county tourism committees to carry out their duties.  They now exist on shoestring budgets comprised of whatever local authorities can reasonably afford and voluntary contributions from commercial outlets.</P>
      <P>As Cathaoirleach of Comhairle Contae na hIarmhí I have been proud to serve on the county tourism committee twice.  Despite operating on a shoestring, that committee has produced 10,000 copies of a tourist trail brochure for the Fore area in north Westmeath; 10,000 copies of a tourist trail brochure for the Glassin area of south Westmeath; 10,000 copies of a golfing guide to the many fine golfing facilities in Westmeath; and 20,000 copies of a holiday guide.  Those were produced without any contributions from Bord Fáilte and have been distributed to various holiday fairs and centres in Dublin, Belfast, Manchester, Birmingham and elsewhere.  Imagine what could be done if such committees were appropriately funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his performance to date with a demanding portfolio.  In promoting county tourism committees, he should consider shaping local tourism by emphasising the local influence.  Senators Moylan and O'Toole referred to infrastructure, and Senator Moylan mentioned our road network, which has a pivotal role to play.  Our rail network is also vital, and many rail networks were closed despite the fact that there is nothing nicer than observing the countryside <Col N="1012" /> from the comfort of a train, knowing one is in safe hands.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to canals.  The old town of Mullingar is encircled by the Royal Canal.  In 1955 the last through trip down that canal was made.  It started in Dublin and went through Clondara, Tarmonbarry and up the Shannon to the Grand Canal.  That was a round trip of 200 miles.  It was shortsighted of local authorities to culvert the Royal Canal.  The cost implications were blamed, but we are counting the cost now.  Imagine the attraction to overseas visitors if we could tell them we had 200 miles of waterway for a boating holiday.  There are old lock houses on many stretches of the Royal Canal.  My family comes from both a lock-keeping tradition, of which I am very proud, and a farming background. Farmhouse holidays have a pivotal role in the development of local tourism.</P>
    <P>The Gaelic Athletic Association also has a role to play.  We hear of weekend package holidays to soccer games.  How many people in Manchester, Leicester, where I worked, Birmingham and London would like to come back to their native counties to see the county final in hurling, football or soccer?  It would be wonderful if such a package holiday could be laid on.  We should also think of what could be done in coarse fishing.  Our county abounds in lakes and rivers and is known as the Lake County.  Some work has been done in this area but much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Celtic tiger, but the Celtic tiger is being killed.  It is becoming toothless because we are killing our image as a hospitable, welcoming people who give good value for money.  There are too many instances of people who want to become millionaires overnight. Senator Cassidy referred to north Westmeath, an area in which a hotel would be welcome. When this idea was mentioned in the past, others blew it out of the water.  People asked &ldquo;Who would go to a rural area?&rdquo;  One need only look at the Slieve Russell Hotel in Ballyconnell.  Many people go there although it is in a very rural part of Ireland.  It is a flagship for Senator Cassidy's proposal and the Minister can turn the tide on this matter.</P>
    <P>Far too often visitors get menus which do not reflect traditional Irish food.  When I travel abroad I like to taste the local cuisine, listen to the local music and listen to the native tongue.  I am delighted that we have our own teanga dúchais and our own song and dance.  If Daniel O'Donnell has put the Minister's county on the map, Joe Dolan has done something similar for Mullingar.</P>

      <P>I am very impressed with the Minister's commitment and energy, and that can be said for every speaker.  I agree with many of the Minister's points, in particular the exorbitant price for a cup of coffee.  It is a small thing but causes many complaints.  We will price ourselves out of the market with such small details.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> Unapproved accommodation is not a term I like, but if accommodation is not approved, people should not stay there.  During the Seanad elections I stayed in both approved and unapproved bed and breakfast establishments, including one in Tuam which was a palace.  The owners said they were refused registration by Bord Fáilte.  It was a disgrace that this establishment had the tag of &ldquo;unapproved&rdquo; which made it sound illegal.  I also checked unapproved establishments in my town.  They were not registered with Bord Fáilte because they did not satisfy its criteria.  For example, a family with a four bedroomed house and two children did not have three bedrooms available for accommodation to qualify for Bord Fáilte registration.  Bord Fáilte have relaxed this rule because a number of establishments in my town which were unapproved are now registered.  Bord Fáilte are to blame for much of this.  The Government should give a stamp of approval to those who have accommodation available.  It is up to Bord Fáilte, the RAC or the AA to then recommend establishments. The Government must have some control.</P>
    <P>Almost 75 per cent of tourists who visit my wife's bed and breakfast establishment have vouchers which are valued at £12.50. We provide <i>en suite</i> accommodation for £16 per night, for which we have to ask for payment of a further £3.50. This is clearly stated on the vouchers which are distributed by over 100 organisations, including Aer Lingus and Irish Ferries.  It is amazing that if these people did not get vouchers and went straight to bed and breakfast accommodation, they would have <i>en suite</i> accommodation for cheaper than the cost of the voucher.</P>
    <P>I was flabbergasted to find some pay £18 for a voucher.  The voucher does not state any value, but rather states that if it is presented at a Bord Fáilte approved establishment, standard accommodation will be provided.  Those issuing these vouchers are making £5 to £6 profit for doing nothing other than this.  They are also cutting the prices set by bed and breakfast establishments, who honour their commitment and take £12.50, as many people say they will not pay more than that.  Will the Minister to investigate this voucher system?  Those giving out the vouchers are making money, not those giving accommodation.  I congratulate the Minister on his statement and every Member of the House who made suggestions which will enhance our tourism industry in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in complimenting the Minister.  It is evident he listened to this debate and we recognise and appreciate that he did not send a substitute.  We know the procedure and it is good that the Minister is interested enough to come to the House.  I express the appreciation of all my colleagues for his dedication to this important motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He focused on the development of county tourism. We should take a cue from Kerry, which was <Col N="1014" /> first to develop its county tourism.  It has benefited tremendously as a result and Donegal and Galway are following its example.  I am pleased the Minister indicated he will support county tourism because there is no better place to support and promote it.  Those who do so should get maximum support.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will also recognise the serious deprivation in the west which has been ignored in the creation of jobs, whether in software or other industries.  The north-west of Ireland has not been included in this development. The tourism industry fits neatly into the areas which have not been developed.</P>
    <P>One example which supports every case I make for development is the £1.2 billion expenditure on the natural gas route, which resulted in much deprivation.  Not only did we not benefit from the £1.2 billion but we were put at a disadvantage. Anyone setting up an industry cannot afford to consider the north-west, as it does not have natural gas.  I ask the Minister to look at this.  He is on the right track and he will get 110 per cent encouragement across the board.  This is not a political matter &mdash; it is one of survival.  All of us represent areas which have to be given a fair opportunity to develop.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with hotels and guesthouses who build a small extension and are then revisited and revalued.  One such case was brought to my attention where the rate increase was £12,000. The money spent by visitors to the rural area of that establishment did not increase to this extent. It is important for the success of the Minister's mission that he recognises this rate demand is an unfair burden on people.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for a useful discussion with valuable contributions from those on both sides of the House.  The Minister took the motion seriously and we enjoyed the debate which will hopefully make a useful contribution and benefit the industry in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking in general about the social costs and implications of changes to rural communities, particularly where there is a decline in the population, and the questions they raise. To what extent will we allow what is happening to continue, for instance, the cost to rural towns of the growth of our cities and particularly the inordinate growth in the Dublin region and the eastern seaboard extending to counties Wicklow, Kildare, Louth and Meath?  Will the Dublin area continue to be allowed to expand at its current rate?  Looking at the implications of that, does it mean that as cities, and in particular Dublin, grow, is the rest of the country to be a kind of weekend playground where an affluent middle class go to breathe fresh air and take their children <Col N="1015" /> to see real animals?  Are tourism and recreation to be only non-agricultural sources of employment outside Dublin and the larger cities?</P>
      <P>It does not have to be like that.  We can and must make choices to halt rural decline and ensure that rural communities do not suffer the worst effects of the trends we are witnessing. Rural communities are far too important for that to be allowed to happen to them.</P>
      <P>The choices that have to be made include a deliberate policy of bringing jobs to rural towns. I referred earlier to what appears to be the current IDA and Government policy of bringing large scale employment to cities such as Limerick, Galway, Cork, Dublin and its hinterland including Leixlip, at the expense of rural towns.  I have carried out some investigation on this matter and, without going into it in great detail, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility to bring jobs to towns such as Nenagh, Thurles, Templemore and Roscrea.  It would require a policy change as well as more work and a different style of approach by agencies such as the IDA.  Shannon Development and other agencies are doing great work in that regard, but they need more Government support.</P>
      <P>Rural areas are ideally placed to take advantage of the potential of the information superhighway, which simply requires a high level of investment in technology which, in the long run, will pay great dividends.  The global village can be as real in Rearcross as in any of our bigger towns and cities.  Rural communities deserve to have as much access to the information superhighway, its positive spin offs and benefits by way of jobs and investment as any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>Another point that should be taken on board with regard to halting decline, promoting investment and developing a policy of rural renewal, is recognising the importance of the social economy. This was referred to in the NESF report on combating social exclusion in rural Ireland.  It talks about rural community employment programmes &mdash; a subject which comes up on a weekly basis.  The report recommends, on page 69, that such programmes should be upgraded to the highest level of training and work experience and that this should be a priority for FÁS.  It talks about the importance and potential of the social economy.  This has been taken up in Partnership 2000 and is the subject of a working group whose report and recommendations I look forward to receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community employment schemes are of huge importance in areas such as Silvermines, for example, where the traditional mining industry has ceased leaving behind a largely male workforce now in its late 40s or early 50s.  Because this workforce is unskilled it does not get the opportunity to partake in the normal economy.  Community employment schemes provide an opportunity, particularly to men who have become unemployed through changes in the employment <Col N="1016" /> market, to play a role in their locality.  Whether the type of work is with tidy towns competitions or the GAA, graveyards, heritage or schools, it is of huge value to those individuals and to the community of which they are a part.  Not a week goes by when I do not hear from somebody asking why they have to leave such a scheme after three years or take a break after six months?</P>
    <P>Because of the major changes in employment where we do not see the same levels of unemployment or labour market conditions, the Government should consider a change in policy by FÁS in relation to community employment schemes.  Such a policy change might involve a pool of workers in a community who get their share of such schemes and do not necessarily come off them after three years because there is no value in doing so.</P>
    <P>The younger workforce is, happily, largely employed.  Those younger people who are unemployed have a different set of needs that must be dealt with by training.  That would recognise the value of the social economy in rural areas and I intend to pursue the matter at a different level in the future.  I will be seeking the working group's report when it is published.</P>
    <P>Increasingly the farming community will have to take on the notion of partnership with the non-farming community in relation to two issues &mdash; consumers and the environment.  The BSE crisis showed us the extent to which our agricultural industry is dependent upon the vagaries of the consumer in the supermarket.  It demonstrated the need for a partnership approach between the agricultural community and the consumer not only to the issue of food quality but also in the battles ahead to support our agricultural communities.</P>
    <P>We know there will be compensation and that has been signalled, but it will be on the same basis as assistance which is offered to all other sectors across the EU both urban, which are growing, and rural, which are in decline.  If a townsperson loses his or her job, the compensation package is not offered to every dweller.  In the rest of the community those in need of help are identified and helped directly.  Large groups are not generally subsidised, only when some of their members are poor.  There are far too many other demands on the EU's purse to provide computers for the nation's schoolchildren or to cut hospital waiting lists, yet these are the competing demands against which farmers will be fighting.</P>
    <P>It is especially true in this country, where so many people are from a rural background, that the wider community is willing to help farmers who need assistance to adjust to a new world agricultural order.  However, permanent subsidies will not be on offer for much longer and the farming community will have to adjust to that fact.</P>
    <P>By selling the highest quality food both here and abroad we can show the non-agricultural community that working together benefits the <Col N="1017" /> whole economy.  We cannot take agriculture in isolation, we must see the issue as a whole.</P>
    <P>Eutrophication of water supplies in our lakes and rivers is a side effect of greater agricultural production.  This is an issue throughout the country, particularly in north Tipperary, where Lough Derg has suffered over the years.  I welcome the campaign by Teagasc, an independent research body, to reduce the amount of phosphates in our waterways.  Figures published by Teagasc show that farmers are using up to 30,000 tonnes of excess phosphate every year at an overall national cost of £25 million.  This means that in some cases farmers would not need to apply phosphate for four to five years.  This campaign operates on the basis of supporting farmers.  This issue must be tackled.  I hope that farmers work in partnership with the wider community and that we do not have to penalise them for overuse of phosphates and for causing pollution.</P>
    <P>We are not facing up to the need for an integrated policy on rural renewal.  This must be our aim for the future.  Any discussion of the Santer proposals or any other EU proposals for change must be seen in the context of halting the decline in rural communities and meeting the needs of not just those engaged in agriculture but those dependent on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise two issues with the Minister.  The seed potato industry in my county was destroyed thanks to one or two individuals in the Department of Agriculture and Food who set up a company for millions of pounds and then sold it for £10.  They destroyed a valuable industry which produced a cash crop. This country had a tradition of successfully selling seed potatoes in the Middle East for which we had orders every year.  I hope I have another opportunity to raise this issue which has been forgotten. Perhaps the Minister will refer to it in his reply.</P>
      <P>Has the Department of Agriculture and Food any machinery to assess the quality of imported milk?  This is a serious problem in the Border counties and in Dublin, where two litres of imported milk retail at 79p.  We have heard different stories about water hoses being placed in tanks after the fat content is tested.  This might be folklore but I ask the Minister if it is possible for the Department to examine the quality of imported milk.  It is important to allay the consumers' fears in this regard.  Two litres of home produced milk retail at 99p.  A 20 per cent reduction is substantial, so its quality must be questioned.  Many young families buy cheap milk, which is part of their staple diet.  I ask the Minister to allay the fears of those who buy the cheapest milk on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator McGowan for his short contribution.  I <Col N="1018" /> am used to his long contributions, which are always worth listening to because of his great commitment to rural development.  I will address his two points at the end of my reply.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the remarks made by Members.  A number of them raised questions about the implications of the Agenda 2000 proposals.  Any estimate of the net effect of the Agenda 2000 proposals on Irish agriculture must be regarded with extreme caution.  Any such estimate is crucially dependent on future market prices, which are notoriously difficult to forecast. Even if it is assumed that the market prices for the three commodities concerned &mdash; beef, milk and arable crops &mdash; will fall by the precise amount of the proposed reductions in support prices, there are still difficulties about arriving at a reliable estimate.</P>
      <P>There is the question of which rate to use for the conversion of ECU values to Irish pound values.  There could be a difference as big as 8.5 per cent between the two extreme options available. In addition, the Commission's proposals are incomplete and the crucial detail which could significantly affect the impact of the proposals are as yet unknown.  For example, we do not know what the Commission will propose in the form of measures to encourage extensification or environmental preservation and enhancement.</P>
      <P>With all these qualifications, the net effect of the proposals on prices and on premia could be a loss of approximately £125 million a year.  This necessarily tentative estimate is based on what is known of the proposals in relation to market supports at this stage.  It does not include any estimate of the effect of changes in Ireland's receipts under the structural heading where the Commission's proposals are, at this stage, even less developed than their market proposals.  I again emphasise the tentative nature of this estimate.  It is my intention in the period between now and the emergence of the Commission's detailed proposals and the subsequent negotiations that will follow in the Council of Ministers to ensure not only that no loss will accrue to any sector of Irish agriculture but that the final outcome will be positively advantageous for Irish farmers individually and will provide a platform for the further development of the Irish food industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural development and the Structural Funds were raised by a number of Members.  To be a real Union it was clear from the outset that interventionist policies would have to be adopted to level off economic development and standards of living.  The structural and cohesion policies of the Union will continue to play a key role in establishing those economic and social foundations for European integration.  Ireland has received significant transfers under those policies.  It has used the transfers in a wise and progressive fashion. We are testimony to the success of the EU's cohesion policy.  Care must be taken to ensure that this success is nurtured and sustained and <Col N="1019" /> that EU transfers to Ireland will continue to have an important role in achieving this.</P>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 negotiations must take account of the fact that Ireland continues to have significant development needs.  These include our relatively underdeveloped infrastructure and our continuing employment needs, particularly our high rate of long-term unemployment.  In addition, because our movement towards average Union GDP is so recent, we have not had the opportunity to accumulate the national stock of wealth and capital available in other member states which have been relatively prosperous over a longer period.  As we are an island nation, we will have transport problems.  That gives us confidence to challenge the reduction in the Structural Funds on that basis.  That must be taken into account in the future.</P>
    <P>It is essential for us that the aims of Objective 1 are met fully and on a sustainable basis.  It is in everyone's interest, especially that of the Community as a whole, that a cycle of dependency be avoided and that Ireland's relative success story continues.  A period of consolidation is definitely required if Ireland's present achievements are not to be undermined.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Structural and Cohesion Funds, the Commission has recognised that any transition from Objective 1 status must be gradual and has proposed transitional provisions for regions which exceed the threshold for Objective 1 status.  We will be exploring in more detail what the Commission has in mind.  The principle idea it has proposed would have to be effective throughout the next funding period in a way which would ensure a continuity of development. We will, however, require considerably more precision from the Commission as to what they have in mind in this regard.  I welcome the acceptance that membership of Economic and Monetary Union will not preclude countries from eligibility under the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely is of the view that we must increase our share of the world dairy market. Commission analysis suggests that the market for dairy products is expanding.  I broadly share this view and believe this will continue to be the case over the coming years.  If the EU dairy sector is to grow and develop to its full potential, it is crucial that the EU maintains a strong presence on that expanding market.  Any retreat from this position over time would seriously undermine the long-term viability of the EU dairy sector.</P>
    <P>In order for the EU to retain world market share, possible adaptations to the quota regime might have to be considered to allow for more flexibility while at the same time minimising disruption to the existing system.  Serious consideration should be given to possible arrangements which would allow the EU share in the expanding world market and which could facilitate transition to a less restrictive regime beyond 2006.  An A &amp; <Col N="1020" /> B quota is one of many ways of expanding production and all of these will have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien sought a premium for heifers. Clearly, the economics of heifer production would be extremely precarious following a 30 per cent fall in cattle prices and, unless appropriate measures are taken, there would be a serious question mark over the future of this segment of beef production, which accounts for 27 per cent of total cattle slaughterings in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A number of Members raised the question of limits on, and modulation of, direct payments per holding.  It is difficult at this stage, in the absence of definitive proposals, to comment meaningfully on the ideas put forward by the Commission to limit the amount of direct payments per holding and to allow member states to modulate their payments.  Any meaningful comment can be made only when we see, in the detailed proposals, what precisely the Commission have in mind.</P>
    <P>A number of Members were concerned about reductions in the level of funding being provided for certain schemes.  The reduction in the Estimates for 1998 in the four measures covered by the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry under the Structural Funds is due to the fact that we are now entering the fifth year of a six year programme of Structural Funds and the Department of Finance and the European Commission allowed us bring forward some funds into the earlier years, that is, 1994-97.  A special amount of £15 million has been provided in the Supplementary Estimate for on-farm improvement in the 1997 Estimates and this exaggerates the difference between 1997 and 1998.</P>
    <P>The delay in payment of premia was also raised.  Payments are continuing to issue to farmers under all premium and headage schemes. While the requirements of the Land Parcel Identification System, which is fully operational in 1997 under EU rules, have been a complicating factor in processing the various premium and headage applications this year, I expect substantial levels of payments to be made in the coming days.  The Department of Agriculture and Food have been working long and late to overcome this difficulty and substantial payments will be made to farmers this week.  It is about time we gave up the political nonsense of talking about late payments. Practically all the area aid payments to grain farmers are being made.  It is good political talk.  I suppose we can no longer make speeches at church gates.</P>
    <P>Senator Gibbons raised the issue of vaccination for brucellosis.  The issue of brucellosis has become one of major concern over the last year, not least the deteriorating disease position and the implications that this may have for trading purposes.  It is, therefore, fair to say that brucellosis is a nationwide problem which demands concerted national action.  This is especially true when one considers the consequences for our export trade in milk and dairy products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> Given the serious brucellosis situation, there is no alternative but to introduce further measures, including the tightening up of the pre-movement test requirement.  This will ensure our continued ability to trade all agricultural produce.  In order to maintain the official brucellosis free status for herds we would be reluctant to use vaccination but we are currently reviewing this issue.</P>
    <P>Farmers have more to lose as a result of brucellosis and animal disease than anybody else. There is a small minority of people who are causing the problem and, if there is not discipline at farmer level in the control of the movement of cattle, we will never get rid of animal disease.  It is up to the farming community, in conjunction with the Department, to put the issue of the eradication of animal disease to bed once and for all.  The Department and regional vets will make a concerted effort to rid the country of brucellosis. Brucellosis is a bacteria infection and it is not a major problem but there is a high instance of it at present.  Negotiations are taking place with the farming organisations and the Minister will make an announcement in that regard.</P>

      <P>Within a few days.  We cannot shy away from the fact that there must be a pre-movement test.  There is a vaccination but it is not approved by the EU and our status would be affected by the use of vaccination.</P>
      <P>There ought to be greater control in the movement of cattle.  I am disappointed that the livestock marts have withdrawn from the special sales because they were a way forward and an example of multidiscipline.</P>
      <P>There is a small minority of people who continue to behave in a bad way, blackguarding the system and causing the difficulty, and this problem will be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There will be a package. Following Minister Walsh's visit to Egypt in September, when he met both the Deputy Premier and Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Trade and Supply, work has been continuing on plans for a trial shipment of live animals which would meet the conditions set by the Egyptian authorities.  The possibility of such a shipment had been agreed at the September meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A detailed proposal for a trial shipment, which includes veterinary and technical assessment of the handling and slaughter facilities to be used for Irish cattle in Egypt, has now been sent by Minister Walsh to the Egyptian Ministers for their consideration.  This proposal, which was drawn up in a joint exercise by my Department and the Live Exporters Association, and which builds on the outcome of a recent visit to Egypt by technical experts, will hopefully allow a trial shipment <Col N="1022" /> to take place in the near future.  I regard this as the best approach to pave the way for a full resumption of trade.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the ultimate decision on the import of live cattle from Ireland is, of course, for the Egyptian authorities.  I believe Ireland has addressed the specific concerns raised by the Egyptians with a view to convincing them of the safety of Irish cattle.  No effort has been spared in this regard and I look forward to a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a large market in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I had a meeting with the Libyan Minister for Agriculture in Rome at the FAO Conference and I also met the Iranians.  The former Taoiseach met the Iranians and they promised to send a technical delegation but that did not come to pass.  They have now renewed that promise. There is a good market for Irish processed beef in Iran and the live cattle trade would be ideal for Libya, so we must keep our fingers crossed that something productive may happen in the new year.  The Libyans have contracted to buy Australian stock until about January from an Irish exporter but we can look into it.  Beef prices are good at present at 86p or 87p per pound.  They are better than they were this time last year, so the cattle industry is looking up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not saying that 86p per pound is good?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking at a good scene, and there are premiums on top of that. There is fear for the farmers of County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who spoke for their interest in this very important issue.  I believe that for the foreseeable future agriculture will continue to be a substantial employer and creator of wealth in Ireland as productivity improves, although employment in primary agriculture is likely to continue to decline.  There are 136,000 people in Ireland with agriculture as their primary occupation, with another 157,000 approximately working part-time in agriculture.  Gross agricultural production in 1996 was just over £3,514 million or 8.3 per cent of GDP.  Total Irish receipts from the CAP in 1996 were £1,365 million or 3.2 per cent of GDP.  It is in Europe's and Ireland's long-term interests that European agriculture should become more competitive on world markets and be developed on a sound, stable and sustainable basis.  A fundamental plank of our position will be to ensure the maintenance of a fair income for farmers or, in the words of the Treaty of Rome, &ldquo;to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farm incomes must remain at an acceptable level, not only for reasons of equity and social cohesion but also because the predominance of agriculture as an economic activity in rural areas makes it so important to those areas.  The system of compensation will have to be fair and equitable; <Col N="1023" /> this means that the economic interests of member states in the products concerned will have to be fully respected and that one type of production cannot be disadvantaged by reference to another.</P>
    <P>The future reform of agriculture should not be presented as the stark alternatives of responding to the markets, on the one hand, and preservation of the interests of the agricultural community, on the other.  The essential point is to respond to the realities of the market and at the same time to ensure that the aims of Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome are fully respected.</P>
    <P>My aims in the CAP negotiations will be two-fold: to protect farmers' incomes and have a vibrant rural development policy at home and to place Irish and European agriculture on a proper footing to meet the challenge of the next trade round and to avail of future world market opportunities. It is clear that the challenges facing the agriculture sector are significant and I want to assure all concerned that my aim and the aim of Minister Walsh is to ensure that we are well positioned to meet these challenges and that the agriculture industry overall continues to make a significant contribution to economic life in this country.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I compliment Senator Tom Hayes who led the debate on the Opposition side for the constructive approach he adopted.  I admire his knowledge of agriculture and I am sure he will be involved in public life for many years.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan referred to potato marketing. I met the Israeli Ambassador and his agricultural attaché for lunch today and we discussed Donegal seed potatoes, which Israel has imported for the past 70 years.  If I had been aware of the Senator's concerns I could have brought them to the ambassador's attention.  Senator McGowan also raised the assessment of imported milk by the Department.  This issue is probably covered by the Consumer Information Act and the dairy hygiene regulations.  However, I do not believe the latter are relevant because the product is not indigenous to Ireland.  If it is imported, it is covered by the Act to which I referred.  If the Senator continues to have doubts about such milk, my officials will take note of them and we will contact him about the matter later.</P>
    <P>Senator Gibbons referred to installation aid. This matter is currently being assessed.  He also raised the policy of a national management plan. Everyone recognises that there has been over-use of fertilisers such as phosphates, which are a major problem on the east coast, and nitrates.  I support any measures designed to improve the environment, reduce phosphate levels and maintain our water tables.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely referred to proposed standards and milk quotas, with which I have already dealt.  Senator Connor referred to farm investment <Col N="1024" /> and I assure him that payments will be on target.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and appreciate the opportunity to express my concern about the value of afforestation.</P>
      <P>I live in a county which has developed a substantial acreage of afforestation.  When the State was founded, de Valera stated that if the marginal land throughout Ireland could be developed the economic survival of the people would be assured.  Bearing that in mind, I had high hopes when proposals were made to develop forestry on marginal land or land not suitable for agriculture. In recent years much has been achieved, thousands of acres of forests have been developed and millions of pounds of European aid have been spent.</P>
      <P>Everyone is aware that there is a substantial acreage of mature forest in existence at present. We have moved away from the notion that Irish timber is second class, that it is not up to standard or that it could not be used for domestic or commercial purposes.  However, we have learned to become professional producers of timber which is important.  I welcome that we can now produce quality timber.  Everyone recognises and values that achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Coillte was established, I was enthusiastic about its potential and believed we would begin to reap the potential benefits of the timber industry.  However, I was disappointed because <Col N="1025" /> many of the senior staff and officers working for the Department of Lands obtained employment as timber buyers in the Republic for Northern Ireland companies.  Perhaps that was a wise approach on their part because timber mills in Northern Ireland could not survive without supplies from the South.  In my area there is a consistent daily traffic of lorries drawing substantial loads of timber from the South to the North.</P>
    <P>Are we obtaining maximum value and providing employment in this industry?  From my investigations I have discovered that we are obtaining little or no return because the three large timber mills in Northern Ireland employ their own workers to harvest timber in the South.  Not only that, our Government provided substantial grant aid to timber harvesters which are costly pieces of equipment.  Perhaps the Government was right to do so under EU regulations but in my area four timber harvesters were purchased by people from Northern Ireland.  I do not object to their doing so because I do not have a partitionist approach.  Nevertheless, I share the disappointment of those who believed that employment in the timber industry would increase.</P>
    <P>People in the community in which I live are alarmed to see numerous lorry loads of timber leaving the State without any added value.  In fact, this is very much to our disadvantage.  The small county roads which run through our local forest are being seriously damaged.  The lorries transporting timber use what are called &ldquo;jacks&rdquo; to withdraw that timber from the forest.  The lorries park at the side of the road where the jacks are anchored thereby causing serious damage.  We have received no reimbursement in respect of this damage from the Department, Coillte or any other body.</P>
    <P>The lorries which collect timber do so on a Saturday and the local people were so concerened that they monitored the collections.  There is an unorthodox method of checking lorryloads of timber out of the woods.  In Meenglas Wood near Ballybofey, Coillte had made arrangements whereby a small box was nailed to a tree and those leaving with loads of timber would write a docket and put it in the box.  On one day local observers checked the box after three lorries had gone through and found only one docket there.  I rang the head forester about it and he said &ldquo;I thought you no longer believed in folklore&rdquo;.  He was nasty.</P>
    <P>I have no alternative but to raise this matter in the House and make the Minister and his officials aware of the loose and unacceptable arrangements which apply.  There is concern that added value to the timber industry is being excluded and that the methods for checking the timber being taken from woods are inadequate.  I ask the Minister to put in a place a satisfactory method.  Many people are concerned about the loss of jobs, the loss of timber and the unfulfilled expectations of added business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> An article in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> pointed out that Coillte is to take shares in timber mills in the North and that the Irish Timber Council intends to veto that proposal.  I support the timber industry in strongly opposing that move.  If Coillte was to take such action small local producers and sawmills will be put out of business.  A plan for a timber processing factory in Ballybofey was refused because the Department could not give a guarantee that timber would be available.  The Minister must allay the concerns of those who believe that the timber industry must be put back on the rails.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator expressed his alarm to see timber exported without value added to the product.  There are several ways in which timber is exported at present with value added.  The Senator was concerned about the collection system on Saturdays and mentioned Meenglas Wood near Ballybofey in particular.  If the Senator could provide me with any further information he might have I will have the matter checked.  The Senator also referred to Coillte; there is a proposition under consideration at present and I cannot comment on it at this stage.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to speak about this most important topic.  I am keenly aware of the need to encourage investment in this sector and to achieve a substantial and sustained return on that investment.  The structure and scale of Irish forestry have seen dramatic changes over the past decade.  Total annual afforestation increased from a level of some 7,000 hectares per annum in 1986 to almost 24,000 hectares per annum in 1996.  Over the same period private forestry increased its share of total annual afforestation from 33 per cent to 73 per cent and farm forestry has emerged as a major new component of the sector.</P>
      <P>The importance of the forestry industry is underlined by the fact that Irish forests supply around 60 per cent of domestic requirements for structural and construction grade timber while exports, comprising some 250,000 cubic metres, consist mainly of pallet wood destined for the UK market.  An estimated 16,000 people are currently employed in the forestry industry and the wood products sector.  Of these, 7,000 are employed directly in forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The return on investment from the forestry industry may be considered under two headings &mdash; the return in investment from forestry itself and the return on investment from sawmilling. The returns from investment in forestry depend on the potential of the land for growing trees, on the cost of establishing, managing and harvesting the crop, on the availability of markets and the price which may be obtained for the timber.  Agricultural crops are generally planted and harvested within one year.  With forestry, on the other hand, although the initial financial return from thinnings can become available after about <Col N="1027" /> 20 years, there may be a time lag of 40 years or more between planting conifers and harvesting and the time lag is substantially longer for broad-leaf species.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on a forest crop is highly concentrated in the early years and the greater part of the income comes at the end of the rotation.  It is estimated that, based on current costs and prices, a hectare of conifer forest would produce approximately £12,000 of timber over its rotation of 40 years, representing a return of 4 per cent above the likely rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the lead-in time, my Department operates a generous afforestation grant scheme and forest premium scheme which extend over 20 years for farmers and 15 years for non-farmers. When grants and premiums are taken into account, depending on the status of the land-owner and the composition of the plantation, returns of up to 15 per cent can be achieved.</P>
    <P>In the future, development of new production and processing technologies should reduce costs while forecasts of demand growth indicate that timber prices will grow in real terms into the next century, thereby increasing the return.  Historically, Irish timber prices have risen in excess of inflation.  It is worth noting that investment in broadleaf forestry yields lower returns because of the long rotation periods, but the environmental benefits can be higher.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of the return on investment from sawmilling.  This sector has been subject to significant over-capacity in recent years leading to increased prices for limited supplies of sawlogs.  I understand from a review of the investment profile over the past five years of the top seven sawmills in Ireland that three of the largest invested £8 million to £9 million between them. In relation to the return on that investment, the most recent information is available from the McKinsey report of December 1996.  This report was prepared for Coillte Teoranta in 1996 and provided recommendations on how reserve log prices should be calculated for the purpose of introducing Coillte's new log sales system.  The report stated that &ldquo;In many cases and notwithstanding strong roundwood prices, mills appear to be generating positive cash margins&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The conclusion that can be drawn from the sawmills' willingness to invest in new processing capacity and the McKinsey report finding is that, while the sawmilling sector has not generated spectacular returns due to intense competition for logs and intense competition in both the Irish and UK markets, above average sawmill operators have earned acceptable returns.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Cork Oil Spill.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the oil spill at Whitegate and the way information was disclosed. On Monday morning after the spill <Col N="1028" /> occurred we were told it was less than 300 gallons, the amount in a domestic heating tank.  The impression was given that not much harm would be done to the inner harbour area of the port of Cork, one the best natural harbours in the world. Further confusion was created when no information was given about what was being done on the beaches.  The impression was given that one only beach, Grauballe Bay in the Crosshaven area, and no other beach would be affected.  I am familiar with the inner harbour area as I spent many holidays in the Fountainstown area.  Subsequently, other areas in the inner harbour were mentioned and a massive clean up operation took place.  The refinery used a helicopter to assess the damage.</P>
      <P>Approximately eight days ago the refinery said a little more than 300 gallons was spilled.  People in the area were aware that 300 gallons would not have caused the damage done to the inner harbour area.  If 300 gallons could cause such damage, we should be particularly worried about a major oil spill.  The spokesperson for the refinery, Mr. O'Carroll, the general manager, compared the spill to that at Milford Haven where 73,000 gallons of oil spilled from a ship and he spoke about upgrading at the refinery, which was long overdue.  The refinery has always operated to its fullest capacity and has given excellent service to the State.  I visited the refinery as Lord Mayor of Cork and as a Member of the Oireachtas and am aware that staff must use equipment which might not be up to present day standards.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Carroll spoke about the £40 million investment in the refinery, the rationalisation programme and the upgrading of the refinery.  I would be annoyed if he said the oil was spilled while loading a ship during heavy weather because this happened in the inner harbour area which is sheltered and where much damage could be done.  At first the spokesperson said that less than 300 gallons was spilled and then subsequently said that more was spilled but he could not say how much.  The Minister may be sure that the amount spilled was not small.</P>
      <P>If upgrading took place at the refinery, why did it not occur in the area where the oil was spilled?  I ask for the truth in this regard.  I do not carry a flag for an environmental organisation; I represent people in that region.  In the future I would like to be able to say how well the harbour looks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has there been rationalisation in terms of staff numbers?  Did upgrading take place in this part of the refinery?  Did a reduced staff have to use equipment which was not upgraded?  I am not saying rationalisation or upgrading should not take place but we should not put the cart before the horse, which I am afraid happened here. Were staff numbers cut before this part of the refinery was upgraded to save some money?  We could have destroyed the harbour and the entire region.  People have told me there is evidence of the oil spill in Ballycotton.  I do not what to be an alarmist but I did not get answers.  The impression <Col N="1029" /> was given that this section of piping was not upgraded.  Why were staff numbers not maintained until the upgrading took place?  I hope I am wrong in this regard as serious damage could have been done.</P>
    <P>The impression should not have been given that less than 300 gallons.  Such a spill could have been cleaned up very quickly.  The county engineer, Mr. Devlin, said that a substantial bill would be sent from the county council to the Whitegate refinery and admitted that it would be a six figure sum.  Such clean up operations are expensive.  I hope this spill, which could have been extremely serious, will be cleaned up within a month and that it was not caused by a reduction in staff numbers so the refinery could save a few pounds before upgrading equipment was brought in.  I would like a truthful answer in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Cathaoirleach's office decides which Minister should respond to an Adjournment Matter.  The matter raised by the Senator relates mainly to the Whitegate refinery for which I have no responsibility.  I am responsible for pollution at sea by ships and for dumping at sea but I will do my best to respond.  Senator Cregan said that at first the refinery said 300 gallons were spilled.  I understand the eventual figure was 3,000 gallons.</P>

      <P>Compared to spills from some ships, it is a relatively small amount but significant in the area.  Such spills should not happen. Some 73,000 tonnes of oil spilled from the tanker, the <i>Sea Empress,</i> in Milford Haven.  The Senator referred to upgrading at the refinery.  I understand the spill occurred because of a fractured pipe in the area close to the shore.  I agree with the Senator that the pipe must not have been upgraded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House I am very concerned about any oil spillage occurring in our coastal waters and the resultant threat to the marine environment.  My main concern is the possible deleterious effect the resulting pollution may have on the wellbeing of marine natural resources which it is my statutory responsibility to protect and conserve.  I am also concerned for the economic wellbeing of the many fishermen and their families who depend for their livelihood on the fisheries resources in our maritime area.  I am aware that the occurrence of oil pollution in an area, although it might not adversely affect fish stocks, can result in catches from that area being difficult or impossible to market because of consumer resistance. There will obviously be implications for the local fishing communities in Cork Harbour and along the adjoining coastline from the recent incident at Whitegate.  The consequences could have been far worse were it not for the speed and efficiency of the response of the various agencies involved in dealing with the spillage.  Senators will be <Col N="1030" /> aware that the herring fishing season is in full swing off the south coast and I am glad this has been spared disruption.  I congratulate all the people, private individuals and officials, who worked so hard to contain the spillage and restrict as far as possible the level of consequential pollution and damage.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty in dealing with the matter as it is not my ministerial responsibility to regulate activities at refineries or oil handling facilities such as Whitegate.  What powers I have reside in the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, which restricts me to the making of regulations in regard to pollution caused, or potentially caused, by shipping.  I am constrained to dealing with pollution arising from casualties to ships and from operational or accidental discharges from ships while at sea, in harbours or alongside quays or jetties.  The spillage in question occurred as a result of the fracture of a shore pipeline at the Whitegate jetty.  The House will appreciate that I cannot intervene directly in this incident or bring any prosecution in the matter, if such should prove necessary. Subject to these constraints, I directed the marine emergency service of my Department, which responds to oil pollution incidents involving shipping, to work closely with the authorities directly involved and to provide any assistance and advice it could.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the public and Members of the House are concerned that this incident occurred at an installation owned and operated by a semi-State company.  As a member of the Government, I share that concern.  However, I am confident that my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, to whom the Irish National Petroleum Corporation reports, will ensure the corporation learns the necessary lessons from this incident so that there will not be a recurrence.</P>
    <P>Two other agencies are directly involved: Cork County Council and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The former will be concerned as a planning authority with assessing whether the terms and conditions attached to the planning permission under which the Whitegate refinery operates have been fully observed in this instance.  The regulatory authority most involved is the EPA, which is responsible for issuing the necessary integrated pollution control licence for the plant and ensuring the terms of any licence are complied with.  I am reluctant to go further in setting out what the EPA has done or may do in the incident involved as the question of court proceedings may arise and I do not want to prejudice what may occur in that respect.  I have every confidence the agency will carry out its statutory responsibilities to the full and will keep the Department of the Environment and Local Government fully in the picture.  I will continue to take an interest in proceedings, as I have done up until now, in the capacity of watchdog for the welfare of marine natural resources in general.</P>
    <P>I gave a detailed account of the circumstances surrounding the recent spillage incident and the <Col N="1031" /> follow-up action when I spoke on the Adjournment in the Dáil last Wednesday.  I believe there is nothing further to add by way of elaboration except to say that I am informed the clean-up operation is continuing and will continue as long as the appropriate authorities consider it necessary and efficacious.  I understand the wildlife service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has become involved in dealing with the welfare of seabirds and marine mammals affected by oil in the area.  Arrangements have been made for the collection of oiled seabirds and for laboratory examinations to be carried out to firmly establish the origin of the oil concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply and accept he does not have direct responsibility for the refinery.  While I accept his word that 3,000 gallons of oil was spilled, such was the number of people and organisations involved in the clean-up, we should keep in mind <Col N="1032" /> what would be required if more had been or were to be spilled.  I believe more than 3,000 gallons was spilled.</P>
      <P>When I raised this matter some time ago, I did not know which Minister was responsible and I am now informed that an organisation is responsible for licensing the refinery.  I am sorry this licence must now be reviewed as I do not bear any ill will towards the refinery.  However, we should ensure in future that we do not do what I believe was done in this case, rationalising before upgrading.</P>
