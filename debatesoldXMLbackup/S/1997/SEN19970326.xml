      <P>I have notice from Senator Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement on the proposed extension to Tallaght regional technical college, given the serious problems of overcrowding in the college.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to expedite his decision to grant approval for stage three of the Fermoy water augmentation scheme.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Item 1 will be taken until 2 p.m. Item 2, which is very brief, will be taken at 2 p.m. and item 3 will be taken from 2 p.m. until 6 p.m. It is proposed to allow 20 minutes per speaker and speakers may share time.  The Minister will be called to conclude not later than 5.45 p.m. Item 4 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. with 20 minutes per speaker, and item 5 from 8 p.m. until the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for allowing the Daly/O'Kennedy Bill to be taken during Private Members' time.  It is a very good Bill and I hope it will be successful.</P>
      <P>This is our last sitting day before Easter and I thank the Leader for his co-operation during the current session.  I believe information about the possible date for the general election might be blowing in today's strong gale force winds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader clarify the situation in respect of item 5?  He stated that Second Stage will be concluded this evening and I accept that an adequate amount of time has been provided for this purpose.  However, in the event that speakers are still offering at 11 p.m., I assume the debate will not be decided by putting a question at that time and it will continue?  I realise that this is an unlikely eventuality but we must be aware of the necessary arrangements were it to come about.</P>
      <P>It is important that the House register its strong disapproval and condemnation of events surrounding the explosion of two devices in England this morning.  This appears to be the work of the Provisional IRA and we must re-emphasise that such conduct is unacceptable, irrespective of whether people are injured or loss of life occurs. The House must express its hope that there will not be a proliferation of these incidents in advance of the general elections in Britain and Ireland.  Such action is totally anti-democratic and must be rejected.  People must not be influenced in how to cast their votes in the elections as a result of these activities.  It is important that the House register its strong condemnation of these acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House recently debated early school leavers and youth unemployment.  I understand the interdepartmental committee established to consider the report of the NESF on that issue is due to publish an interim report at the end of the month.  If that is the case, the House should be given information because Members on all sides expressed interest in this issue when it was debated.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Finance Bill, particularly with regard to the provisions concerning the removal of VAT from creches. Recently, on the Order of Business, I stated that creches and child care facilities should not be subject to VAT.  I understand that this matter will be specifically dealt with in the Finance Bill and such facilities will not be subject to 21 per cent VAT. The Revenue Commissioners decided to withdraw its earlier recommendations in this regard, but the Government has decided that creches and child care facilities will not be obliged to pay VAT at 21 per cent in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with Senator Dardis in respect of this morning's incident in England.  I do not know whether the identity of those responsible has been confirmed, but the indications seem to be that the Provisional IRA was involved.  Like <Col N="1143" /> Senator Dardis, I utterly condemn this act.  The idea that any organisation would seek to strike fear into the hearts of ordinary British people for some political motive is condemnable.  I agree with everything the Senator stated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister for Justice's announcement about the implementation of the measures relating to the bail referendum, I welcome the fact that she has added to the provisions decided upon by the people by strengthening the legislation concerning concurrent sentences for those on bail.  During the debate in this House on bail it was suggested that people who commit crime while on bail should serve consecutive sentences rather than just one sentence for a number of offences, so this legislation is welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Sullivan, I welcome the Government's wise decision not to impose VAT on child-minding and related services. We should also consider the wider implications &mdash; when we discussed this issue we suggested that other matters could be regularised and it would be in everyone's interest to do so.</P>
      <P>I asked previously for a debate on educational funding and the Leader undertook to provide for one.  It should also deal with political involvement in educational decision making, which has pluses and minuses and should be examined carefully.  I was delayed on the plinth by a strong rumour that the Taoiseach would declare the &ldquo;end of the rainbow&rdquo; this afternoon.  That may be another of the wild rumours circulating, but perhaps the Leader could confirm it and save us difficulties so that we could start licking envelopes.  Nonetheless, I ask that the education debate take place as soon as possible.  The INTO has concluded a survey on the funding of primary schools and we will circulate information to every Member of both Houses.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and I have often mentioned the increase in interest rates and the changes to and pressures on the Irish economy which could result from the introduction of economic and monetary union.  Last night interest rates increased in the US, so we need to be more informed and have greater debate.  This is a crucial issue &mdash; our currency may be revalued, we may enter economic and european monetary union without Britain and problems are being created in Germany &mdash; and these problems should be clarified.  It would be better to maintain the firm consensus which exists at present rather than have people worrying and adopting a herd instinct.  I would particularly welcome such a debate before a general election so that people could be prepared and to prevent it becoming a fring election issue.  There is a consensus among the social partners and political parties and we should try to keep it that way.</P>

      <P>Following today's publication by the National Youth Council of Ireland of an opinion poll showing that 17.5 per cent of eligible <Col N="1144" /> voters are not registered, I urge the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment to conduct an advertising campaign to ensure that people are registered to vote and to make them aware they can do so up to 14 days before the upcoming election. I further ask him to request the Government to introduce Friday voting because it is vital that people living away from home have an opportunity to vote, which they will not have if the election is held on a Thursday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for agreeing to take the Bill promoted by Senator Daly and myself in Government time today.  In view of the broad welcome it received when it was initiated, I hope the purpose of the Bill can be supported on Second Stage.  We are open to any changes which colleagues may suggest which would make the Bill more effective in dealing with the growing level of pollution in Lough Derg.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As this may be the last opportunity in the House, I wish to note the record of public service of yourself, a Chathaoirligh, and your family.  I understand you will not be contesting the general election and this will be the first time since the foundation of the State that a person bearing the distinguished name of Cosgrave will not be standing.  I would like to record our appreciation of that honest and honourable service to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We should always respect and honour the contribution to democracy made by the founder members of the State.  I am privileged to acknowledge that in the context of the Cathaoirleach's family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Naughten's point about the arrangements for polling day.  Due to enlightened programmes for education introduced by successive Governments &mdash; I served as a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education &mdash; we have a high percentage of young people in third level education.  It is essential that those young people will have the opportunity to vote in the election.  As they face examinations it is unreasonable to expect them to interrupt their studies during the course of a week.  For most of them it would be physically impossible and intellectually draining.  It is essential that the young people who will play a vital part in the future of the nation are facilitated in the date of the election. I urge the Leader of the House to recommend that the election be held on a Friday, Saturday <Col N="1145" /> or Sunday to enable young people to exercise the franchise for which the founding fathers of the State fought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, people are required by law to vote where they are normally resident.  Anybody organising buses to bring people from Dublin to vote in other areas is breaking the law.  Students should vote where they are normally resident when attending college. That is the rule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider inviting EU Commissioners to the House?  Commissioner Neil Kinnock addressed the House in the past and I would like a mechanism put in place to facilitate such addresses.  I appreciated the opportunity to put questions to Commissioner Kinnock, his having readily accepted the invitation to address the House.  The Leader should consider organising a format whereby Commissioners might occasionally be invited to address the House.  It would give Senators an opportunity to raise questions on European issues of interest to Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the condemnation of the Wilmslow bombs.  I hope they will not have the practical effect which the IRA desires, but I fear they may, because extra democratic methods have been rewarded traditionally, not merely by politicians but also by the media.  I have just taken part in a BBC programme about members of minority Churches in the State and the first two thirds of the programme were taken up by a debate on the bombing.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House raise with the Government the murder by a so-called punishment beating of the Rev. Templeton, a Presbyterian minister, and particularly the role played by the RUC, the customs authorities at the airport and a squalid newspaper which splashed the story of the seizure of an erotic video from this man?  That newspaper is morally responsible for this man's death.  In the context of intergovernmental relations the matter should be raised on the grounds of the abhorrence we feel at punishment beatings and to examine how an unpleasant individual in the customs or immigration services or in the RUC maliciously released information to a tabloid newspaper, thereby causing the death of this man.  In the past the RUC has contained elements that not only targeted sections of the Nationalist community but which organised witch hunts against the gay community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Dardis and other Members in condemning this morning's bombings.  Attempts by any group to bomb its way onto an election agenda are unacceptable.  I <Col N="1146" /> hope there is no recurrence during the British or Irish general elections.</P>
      <P>A related issue, which in no way excuses the bombing, is the current state of the peace process. Will the Leader tell the House whether the Taoiseach intends to make a statement to the House regarding the peace process?  Is the process frozen in the run up to the general election, or are contacts between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister continuing?  The problem in Northern Ireland can never be put in a vacuum. It behoves us all to work on a full-time basis towards solving the problems there.</P>
      <P>I am gravely concerned at the suggestion by the Garda Síochána to make Garda pay an election issue.  Crime will form a major issue of debate in the election.  It would be distasteful and negative and not in the public interest if that debate was clouded by the separate issue of Garda pay.  The Minister for Justice should make an urgent statement on this issue in the context of the impending general election.  The public will thank no politician if Garda pay is allowed dominate the election agenda.  It would be distasteful if gardaí march on the Dáil on 15 or 16 April.  It is not appropriate and would send a very bad signal to law abiding members of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in condemning the bombing in Cheshire.  The resumption of a bombing campaign in the United Kingdom will not advance the prospect of a settlement in Ireland or of establishing long-term peace.  My party totally condemns this outrage and hopes it is not an indication of resumption of a bombing campaign in the UK or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of primary schools.  We have discussed this matter on a number of occasions in the House but we do not seem to have been successful in getting the Minister to announce decision on the number of new schools awaiting sanction from the Department.  The Leader is aware that Leinster House was picketed by those concerned about the school in Ennis. The Minister has also been criticised regarding the position in Kilkee.  A number of schools are awaiting approval from the Department to proceed to the tendering stage.  The Minister should give an indication of her intentions before Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators in totally condemning the bombing outrages in England this morning.  Whoever planted those bombs had only one purpose in mind, which was to ensure that the peace process would be damaged and that it would be even more difficult to resume some sort of normal politics in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald and other Opposition Members for their co-operation during the past session.  The resumption date for the next session is Wednesday, 9 April and I expect the session will be a lengthy and full one.  At a meeting of the Legislation Committee this morning, I was informed there are 32 Bills which the Government hopes to enact between now and the <Col N="1147" /> end of this Parliament.  Fianna Fáil seems to be the only party starting rumours about a general election at the moment.  Even Mr. de Valera's Constitution does not give the Leader of the Opposition the right to dissolve Parliament.  We can all expect to be back for a lengthy, productive and friendly session after Easter.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised a question in relation to the Universities Bill.  Members may speak for 30 minutes and may share time.  There is no question of the debate concluding until all speakers who wish to do so have had an opportunity to have their say on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan raised a number of issues.  I pay tribute to her role in ensuring that the case against VAT on creches was made.  She was the first person to raise the issue in this House and did so very effectively.  The decision which has been made in relation to that matter is a very sensible one.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised a number of issues on the question of education funding.  There will be a debate on European Monetary Union midway through the next session.  My environmental spokesman informs me that, on the rather dubious point of order raised by the Senator, students do have the option to declare to vote in their home constituency or in their college one, but may not vote in both.  We will leave that issue for another day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Naughten raised the question of the registration of voters, as did Senator O'Kennedy.  The points made by them were valid.  It is a shocking statistic that 17 per cent of younger voters are not registered.  I do not accuse Senator Naughten of having a vested interest in ensuring that younger voters are registered; his point is well made and if some way can be found to speed up that process between now and October, it should be availed of.  I agree with Senator O'Kennedy's point about possible weekend or Friday voting.</P>
      <P>I share in the tribute paid by Senator O'Kennedy to the Cathaoirleach and his family.  I imagine that the Cathaoirleach is merely taking a temporary respite and that we will see him back in full action at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan raised an important point in relation to having a Commissioner come in to address the House; this has worked well on a previous occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris made the important point that the murder of the Reverend Templeton was an appalling act.  Apart from the sheer horror of the so-called punishment beating carried out by thugs who are the scum of the earth, the way in which he was set up is something which should be seriously investigated.  There is no doubt that somebody in the RUC, the customs or in the appalling newspaper to which the Senator referred did set him up.  Reverend Templeton was <Col N="1148" /> a marked man and even if he had not been killed, his life would not have been worth living from that point onwards.  I am glad the Senator raised the issue and I am sure Members join with me in condemning what is a hideous and barbaric breakdown of law and order.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised two points, one in relation to the IRA bombs which I have already mentioned.  I find that this House is having an extraordinary effect on Senator Mulcahy, who is increasingly sensible.  I found myself in agreement with everything he said today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Garda pay should not become an election issue.  There would be an element of scandal in the Garda Síochána marching on Leinster House in the manner which has been advocated.  People respect the Garda and do not expect to see them behaving in this manner.  I thank Senator Mulcahy for having raised the manner in such a constructive way.</P>
      <P>I will refer Senator Daly's request to the Minister for Education once again.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 85, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Tá fíor áthas orm a bheith ar ais sa Seanad leis an mBille um Fhorais Chultúir Náisiúnta, 1996.  I am very pleased to be back in the Seanad with the National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996, which had been introduced in the Seanad.  I was very appreciative of Senators' constructive work and input into the Bill during the course of the debates and look forward to this one today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> Since the National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996, was passed by the Seanad before last Christmas, and in the course of debates in the Dáil, further amendments have been made to the Bill.  These changes arise from discussions in the Dáil, representations made from various interests and ongoing internal re-examination of provisions within my Department.  While some of the amendments are of a fairly substantial nature, they do not change the thrust of the Bill.  They are designed to either deepen existing provisions or to move further in the direction set out in the Bill as initiated, and I commend them to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The amendments may be variously grouped.  In the main they relate to a number of areas which will be familiar to Senators: care of the collections; the functions of the National Library; general admission charges; representation on each board for staff interests; definition and compilation of registered cultural objects; creation of record of such objects; export licensing provisions and mandatory deposit provisions; and care and custody of archaeological objects by local authorities. Other tidying up provisions of a broadly technical or drafting nature are also being made in various amendments.  It may help if I refer to the topics covered by groups of amendments.</P>
    <P>Grouping the substantive amendments in broadly chronological order, first, a series of technical drafting amendments are being made that will replace phraseology in the form of &ldquo;objects in the collection of a Board&rdquo; with alternative phraseology in the form of &ldquo;objects in the collection of the Museum or the Library as the case may be&rdquo;.  This is to change the emphasis from board to institution concerned, while taking care not to change the substance of what is proposed. I should explain that either type of phrase in the Bill does not constitute ownership as ownership of objects is not being transferred by the Bill.</P>
    <P>References had been to the board rather than the institution simply because that is the corporate body being established.  However, it had been represented on Committee Stage in the Dáil that the emphasis on this point should be on the institution rather than on the board, and I can accept this.  These amendments occur throughout the Bill, in sections 2, 11, 16, 18 and 47; and for ease of reference the amendments are numbered 1, 2, 3, 5 to 13, inclusive, 17 to 19, inclusive; 22 to 25, inclusive; 29 to 35, inclusive, and 47.</P>
    <P>Amendments were also made to section 12, widening the functions of the National Library to make it clear that while the primary functions of the board are in relation to material relating to Ireland, it should also have a role in contributing, in co-operation with other libraries, to enlarging human knowledge generally.  This could be done, for example, by way of inter-library loans, both with libraries in Ireland and outside the country. A power to engage in such inter-library loans is made explicit in another amendment to section 12.  This is to allow the Library to enter into inter-library loan agreements outside the State at its <Col N="1150" /> own discretion.  Other agreements outside the State are covered by section 12(2)(k) which allows the Library to enter into such agreements with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the issue of general admission charges.  It provides for by-laws in respect of general admission charges to the National Museum and National Library.  This issue has given rise to a considerable amount of debate and I am pleased to be in a position to have taken a further initiative in section 14 to ensure that the maximum amount of real public access can be secured should any general entry charge system be contemplated by the boards of the Museum, Library or Gallery.</P>
    <P>The initiative takes the form of criteria which must be taken into account before any scheme of general entry charge can be introduced.  Any scheme must still ensure an enhanced quality of service to the public on a sustainable basis and actively contribute to the level of appreciation of the collection concerned within the Irish public as a whole.  These provisions are to ensure that the primary aims and objectives of the Bill &mdash; to contribute to a widening and deepening of sensibilities in relation to the collections &mdash; are amply met.  The other significant item in the criteria is the need to ensure a reasonable degree of access without charge for children in particular, described in the relevant amendment as &ldquo;persons under the age of 18 years of age&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments are in addition to that already provided in section 14, following the Seanad debate, that no general entry charges can be introduced by a board unless approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Short of an absolute statutory prohibition, this is the maximum regulatory protection that can be afforded.  This recognises that, if it should arise, it would be a major policy issue that should and would be considered by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another amendment to section 14 provides that in any by-law being framed on this issue there will be the option to introduce different scales of charges.  As presently worded, it could be interpreted that no such discretion was possible.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with guidelines for Museum loans to include bodies.  In the section, amendments of a largely drafting nature ensure that in the drawing up of guidelines by the National Museum for the loan of artefacts, there will be a broad interpretation of the meaning of the word &ldquo;institution&rdquo; so as to ensure inclusion of all relevant bodies with a cultural remit.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with staff involvement on the boards of the institutions referred to.  In the section a novel and important measure for involving the staff of the National Museum and National Library on their respective boards is now being provided for.  I am taking this initiative because I accept that as stakeholders in their respective institutions the staff concerned should be actively encouraged to obtain a direct insight and input into the various processes and operation <Col N="1151" /> of boards in their respective institutions.  It was always my intention to make appropriate provision for staff involvement on the board through administrative action, but it has been represented that this should be on a statutory basis.  While I am not absolutely convinced that a statutory route is necessarily the best or only way in which to involve the staff interests in the operation of the boards, I am anxious to provide a structure that permits the staff to have a staff member on the board on an ongoing basis. Action by way of legislation is at least a way of providing a reassurance to the staff as to a commitment to a direct engagement in the longer term.  This can only be to the mutual benefit of both the staff, the board and the public.</P>
    <P>The approach I have decided to take to the issue of staff representation is similar to the approach I have adopted in respect of the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society.  A panel of nominees will be provided from which the Minister will select one to serve in a personal capacity.</P>
    <P>Section 23 deals with the length and conditions of service of advisory committees.  An amendment has been made to section 23 which provides for limitations on length of service of advisory committee members, and provision for terms and conditions of service.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide a reasonable limitation on the length of service that may be provided by a person on the readers advisory committee of the National Library and on the general public advisory committee of the National Museum.  The restriction is similar to what is provided in respect of membership of either board.  It is also being provided that the terms and conditions of service would be as determined by the relevant board. Technical or drafting amendments are made in sections 19, 23 and 29.</P>
    <P>An amendment is made to section 42 in relation to the definition of a cultural object.  In the text as passed by the Seanad, the definition includes, as well as museum heritage objects and library material, any object or thing considered appropriate to be exhibited by a relevant institution. While this should cover all relevant objects, there may be some objects which would never be appropriate for exhibition but would be collected or borrowed or held for other purposes &mdash; for example, for research purposes.  This amendment will widen the definition to include objects considered appropriate to be exhibited or kept by a relevant institution.</P>
    <P>Amendments to section 48 include the Irish Manuscripts Commission among the bodies that may be requested by the Minister to put forward lists of objects for inclusion on the register of important cultural objects.  Given the commission's important role in relation to historical documents, this seems appropriate.  The aim of other amendments to section 48 is to create a record of important heritage objects held outside the State.  This is to allow for the recording of <Col N="1152" /> important Irish moveable heritage artefacts wherever they are situated outside the State.  The purpose is to provide a structured system for identification of such objects situated outside the State while not attempting to extend any jurisdictional or control application to outside the State.  These amendments should be seen as being of a symbolic nature, recognising and signifying that what is important to the heritage of Ireland cannot be limited by considerations of geographical location.</P>
    <P>Section 49 deals with export licences.  Some amendments to section 49 are primarily a tidying up exercise arising from the partial repeal in section 6 of this Bill of export licence provisions in relation to archaeological objects.  Section 25(4) of the National Monuments Act, 1930, as inserted by section 14 of the National Monuments Act, 1954, and which is still in place, permits the Minister of the day to declare for export licence purposes that an object is an archaeological object.  Another provision in that same section declares that the decision in this matter cannot be challenged.  I am providing that all the elements relating to export licences should be consolidated in this Bill.  The amendments being proposed will mean that the entire section 24 is repealed and re-enacted in an amended form in section 49.  A small consequential amendment in section 6, amendment No. 4, is also required by this action. In re-enacting the archaeological object declaration provision into section 49 of the Bill, I am also availing of the opportunity to repeal the prohibition on a challenge to any such declaration, which prohibition it seems to be difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>Another amendment to section 49 seeks to provide a reasonable measure of flexibility so that certain categories of cultural object coming within the scope of the export licence requirement do not unnecessarily become subject to the export licence requirement.  An example of what would be envisaged to be cited under this heading would be cultural objects imported into the State temporarily for the purpose of exhibition and sale.</P>
    <P>This proposed legislative structure for making exclusions from the export licence requirement also provides a general framework for the citing of other instances where export licensing would not be considered appropriate.  The use of this provision will be focused as clearly as possible on the cultural imperatives involved.</P>
    <P>Another amendment to section 49 adds &ldquo;burial and cemetery records&rdquo; to the example of documents quoted for the purpose of export licences. Genealogical interests had expressed their concern to me that the definition in the Bill would not include such records.  While I am satisfied the term &ldquo;document&rdquo; is broad enough to cover these, it is useful, in view of the concerns expressed, to make this specific.  Other amendments to section 49 are of a technical or drafting nature.  The most significant one is to ensure any new category of cultural object made subject to the export licence <Col N="1153" /> requirement will be included in the provision contained in section 49 (4) permitting licensable classes of cultural objects to be excluded from the licence requirement.</P>
    <P>I undertook in the Dáil debate &mdash; and I am pleased to reiterate it here &mdash; that I will provide by order that, where a licence is not issued after a period of six months following an application, the objects in the question will be deemed to be exempt from the licence requirement.  I repeat here an undertaking given in the Dáil that before implementing the export licence provisions I will consult with the relevant trade interests involved, including the Irish Antique Dealers' Association.</P>
    <P>In relation to export licence requirements for certain types of cultural objects, amendments to section 50 allow a time limit to be specified for the validity of an export licence and make it obligatory to comply with conditions for issue of the licence, that is, apart from the condition that the registered cultural object in question may not be exported before one year has elapsed since the date of application for said licence.  There is provision for penalties in the event of non-com-pliance. The amendment allowing for a time limit for use of a licence is to facilitate trading in cultural objects.  It will allow a trader to get an open licence in advance for an object &mdash; for example, a painting &mdash; a licence which then could be used if the painting was purchased for export.  This would mean a dealer would not have to wait until such time as an object was bought for export to request a licence.</P>
    <P>There are also drafting amendments to section 50.</P>
    <P>Amendments to section 51 empower the Minister to delegate export licensing functions to the Heritage Council.  These will have the effect of including the Heritage Council alongside the National Museum, National Gallery, Irish Museum of Modern Art, National Library and National Archives as bodies to whom the Minister could delegate some of his export licensing functions.  While at present it is not envisaged that such functions would be delegated to the Heritage Council, it may be that in the future, as the council's role develops, it might be appropriate for it to take on such functions.  These amendments leave this option open.</P>
    <P>A technical amendment to section 60 concerning the National Gallery clarifies that the Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery, when disposing of property other than the cultural objects in the collection of the National Gallery, only require the consent of the Minister when disposing of land or of an interest in land, including buildings, and not when disposing of any other property, excluding paintings.</P>
    <P>An amendment to section 62 concerning liquor on-licences extends the ownership criteria for premises for which certain listed institutions can get liquor on-licences to those vested in the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht as well <Col N="1154" /> as the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Bill envisages that the only premises for which such licences would be granted would be premises vested in the State.  While currently where the institutions concerned occupy State-owned premises these premises are vested in the Commissioners of Public Works, certain other State properties are vested in the Minister.  It is not envisaged that there would be any change in this arrangement.  However, it is considered desirable to allow for the possibility that at some time in the future some of the State-owned premises occupied by the relevant institutions might be vested in the Minister.</P>
    <P>Technical amendments to the mandatory deposit provisions contained in section 65 permit the Minister to activate the mandatory deposit provisions pending the establishment of the board of the Library, since there will be an inevitable time lag following the enactment of the Bill before the board will be formally established. Other amendments are designed to fine-tune the mandatory deposit provisions as they effect books and other library material while at the same time providing some extra flexibility when the provision is being operated by the National Library.</P>
    <P>The amendments provide that the provision which widens the definition of publisher as set out in (b) of the definition on page 42 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad will only apply in respect of the National Library rather than all the institutions listed in the Copyright Act, 1963, and that paragraph (b) will only apply where the Library requests such material, whether in the form of books as defined in the Copyright Act, 1963, or the types of library material covered in section 65 of this Bill.  The amendments also provide for a time limit of one year following publication for the making of a request.</P>
    <P>The basic time limit of one month for deposit of the library material, other than in the form of books, after publication is also proposed to be extendable at the discretion of the National Library.  The possibility of a longer time limit is seen as desirable.  It had been represented by certain interests as alleviating fears of film interests where there might be a reluctance to make a deposit of a film reel in mint condition while the film in question still held a strong commercial value, as would be the case shortly after its general release.</P>
    <P>Amendments of a technical and drafting nature to section 66 bring up to date various references in section 56 of the Copyright Act, 1963, which deals with mandatory deposit of books.</P>
    <P>Sections 68 and 69 deal with the care and custody of archaeological objects in the ownership of the State.  Section 68 has been amended so as to set out a relationship between local authority museums, the National Museum and the Minister where the care of archaeological objects is concerned. The amendment concerns the charge and custody of archaeological objects in the ownership of the State found since the passing of the <Col N="1155" /> 1994 National Monuments (Amendment) Act. The amendment sets out the respective relationships which are to apply between a museum operated by a local authority, the National Museum and the Minister, the latter as the owner of the objects in question in the name of the people.</P>
    <P>In general, the scheme provides a means whereby, without compromising the principle that the State owns the objects, the archaeological object involved may be held under the permanent control of either a local authority museum or in the National Museum, depending on whether the objects is predominantly of local or national interest.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme it is proposed that the Director of the National Museum would decide on a designation for a local authority museum with the consent of the Minister.  Once an object is found and reported to the Director, the Director would decide, in consultation with the nearest designated local authority museum involved, which museum should hold the object on a permanent basis.  In the event of a dispute between them, the matter would be referred to the Minister for his or her decision, which would be final.  There is also a proposed enablement for the Minister to make regulations governing the monitoring of the objects in the care of the local museum.</P>
    <P>The amendment arises from local museum interests which have expressed concern that the effects of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994 have been that archaeological objects of predominantly local significance are claimable by the National Museum and that only the Director of the Museum can decide where they are to be kept.  While there is already a power of designation under the 1994 Act providing that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht can designate where such objects may be held for &ldquo;safe keeping&rdquo;, this provision was always envisaged to be utilised in emergency situations only.</P>
    <P>This amendment should be read in conjunction with amendments to the mechanism in section 47(5) of the Bill, as passed by the Seanad, for the resolution of disputes concerning the custody of archaeological objects owned by the State and held by any public authority from before the enactment of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.  Section 47(5) provides a mechanism for resolving disputes between a public authority and the National Museum concerning which museum should hold State owned archaeological objects.  This procedure, which I introduced in the Seanad, was considered necessary to deal with potential situations of dispute regarding the State's claim to ownership of archaeological objects found since 1930, when controls were first imposed by the Irish State, but before 1994.</P>
    <P>The amendments to section 47(5) made in the Dáil are to be found in section 69, as I have taken the opportunity afforded by these initiatives to relocate subsection 47(5), as amended, more appropriately.  The preceding section 68 concerns <Col N="1156" /> the care of the archaeological objects found in the State after the passing of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.  The provision to be relocated deals with such objects found before the passing of the 1994 Act.</P>
    <P>The amendments to section 69 drop the five year rule and substitute the Minister for the Heritage Council as the determining authority in respect of the arbitration role, while retaining a consultation role for the Heritage Council.  A five year limit had been incorporated within the disputes procedure only because it was not anticipated that a situation of dispute would arise in that period.  However, the five year limit has given rise to interpretative difficulty and is now being dropped from the Bill.  Making the Minister the determining authority arises out of the Minister's role as the owner of the archaeological objects found in the State and is consistent with the amendment to section 68 providing for a system of designation for local authority museums in respect of archaeological objects found after the enactment of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>The package of amendments are all designed to create a more integrated structure of regulation for the charge and custody of archaeological objects owned by the State which have been found in the State since the enactment of the National Monuments Act, 1950.  I am also making minor adjustments to the Schedules contained in the Bill.  An amendment to the First Schedule corrects an omission in the compilation of the list of core repositories cited in the Schedule.  The inclusion of the National History Museum building arises out of the National Gallery Act, 1854, which included provision for the erection of a public museum in Dublin.  The building erected pursuant to this provision was opened in 1856 and now forms one of the core buildings of the National Museum.  It was handed over to the State by the Royal Dublin Society under the provisions of the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act, 1877.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the Third Schedule therefore also includes costumes among the list of objects in the Third Schedule for export licence purchases.  In discussion with interest groups it was represented to me that this was a category that needed to be included.</P>
    <P>I believe that the amendments now being proposed constitute a further significant strengthening of the Bill.  Accordingly and in the same spirit in which the Bill was introduced to the Seanad, and again expressing my gratitude to Senators for having improved the Bill so much in discussions thus far, I have no hesitation in commending these amendments for its agreements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of identification of core buildings in the First Schedule, I am pleased to see that the Hunt Museum has been included.  I congratulate all those involved <Col N="1157" /> in the completion of its excellent facilities.  I am disappointed I was not invited to the opening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Hunt Museum is an excellent development in Limerick city.  Will it be necessary to amend the Bill further if additional buildings are acquired?  For example, if an important building in Cork city was being developed, how would it be included if it was not mentioned in the Schedule?</P>
      <P>There is likely to be a big expansion in the provision of museum buildings, in the next number of years.  For example, there is a proposal for grant aid and funding for a new museum for Ennis, which would be a welcome development.  How will such buildings be incorporated into the network of core buildings mentioned by the Minister?</P>
      <P>I support the further provision regarding export licences.  The illegal export of valuable artefacts from Ireland has been a damning development over the past number of years but for some reason we still have not come to grips with that problem.  Discussions have taken place and legislation has been enacted over the years to deal with it, but a small number of professionals are still engaged in this activity.  I do not understand why the legal exportation of valuable items which have been stolen from important historical sites cannot be controlled and eliminated.  For example, some years ago valuable stones from Clonmacnoise were found in the boot of a German man's car as he was waiting to board a ferry. The Minister indicated some changes in the penalties but I am not certain they are adequate to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>Regarding the theft of important items which are being exported from this country, particularly those which can be traced, will it be possible to institute proceedings to have those items returned?  The Minister referred to the record of items in museums overseas which he intends to establish.  Some valuable items from Scattery Island are in a British museum and local organisations and societies have sought their return.  Will the list identify important items and enable negotiations to take place to have them returned permanently to museums in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will acknowledge the high level of co-operation of the United Kingdom authorities in particular.  However, has this matter has been raised in Europe because the problem does not only relate to Ireland and the United Kingdom?  There is a European dimension, particularly in view of the number of items which I understand have been exported to Germany. Will the Bill ensure this area is tightened up?  Will it give further direction to the enforcement authorities? While the necessary legislation is in place, there is still a question mark over how protection can be enforced on important sites.  Many of these are isolated and illegal activity has taken place <Col N="1158" /> which is almost beyond the bounds of supervision because the areas are so remote.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the amendment which relates to the record of burial grounds?  He is aware that there is a number of unmarked burial places throughout the country, which in the main are unconsecrated graveyards used for the burial of children.  Some work has been done in terms of the consecration and conservation of these important sites.  However, Lios a Toughach, which is adjacent to the area in which I reside, is an overgrown and almost forgotten site; but it is most important because a large number of children are buried there.  Many people are concerned about it, particularly local communities. Will the amendment in relation to the records allow the Minister to identify such sites and protect and preserve them?  Otherwise, some of them will be lost.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced amendments regarding the custody of archaeological items and the determination of ownership.  After the arbitration process, I presume the Minister will decide ownership.  It is not clear whether the final decision rests with the Minister after all the negotiations and discussions have taken place, which is how it should be.  This aspect was discussed in detail on Second and Committee Stages and I will not labour the point.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this matter.</P>
    <P>Much work has taken place at Collins Barracks, which is an important site.  I am not sure what stage the project has reached &mdash; perhaps it is complete &mdash; but more needs to be done about the appearance of the outside of the building.  I am not sure what advice the professionals could give the Minister in that regard and whether they considered it in terms of its important location in the city.  Will the buildings become part of the overall museum structure?  Will the Bureau of Military History, which is attached to the Department of Defence, form part of the overall museum concept? Can the private collections held by some Departments be incorporated in the museum concept?</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the Bureau of Military History, which is located in a barracks. Much important and valuable work was done by the bureau in compiling local historical records of events which took place, particularly during the War of Independence.  The archives of the Department of Defence also contain valuable photographic records of events which involved the Department over many years.  Will these collections stand alone in the Department as its own records or will they be incorporated in the museum under this legislation?</P>
    <P>It would desirable to include the Bureau of Military History and the photographic records of the Department of Defence archieves in the overall National Museum concept.  This also applies to the valuable records held by the Commissioners of Public Works, many of which were miraculously saved when a fire broke out in its offices some years ago.  It was most important <Col N="1159" /> that those archieves were saved because they are important documents and photographs.  I support the thrust of the legislation and the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the strengthened Bill.  There was extensive debate on the legislation in this House and the amendments made in the other House are positive.  They demonstrates the willingness of the Minister and his Department to respond positively to views expressed in both Houses by accepting amendments and introducing others to further strengthen the Bill.  I welcome the developments since the Bill was last discussed in this House. The Minister outlined the details of each amendment. I have no difficulties with any of the amendments as they improve the Bill.  I particularly welcome the inclusion of the Irish Manuscripts Commission, and that it may be requested by the Minister to put forward a list of objects for inclusion in the register.  That is a positive development.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the provision on important heritage objects that have been kept outside the State; it is important to know where objects are and to have them in proper order to ensure nothing goes astray.</P>
      <P>The sections that consolidate exports licences are also to be welcomed.  There was extensive debate on this matter.  I am concerned, however, about one aspect of the Bill.  If a licence is refused or not issued within six months, the objects in question will be deemed to be exempt from licence requirements.  In the course of administration within the Department, a licence may not issue within six months.  In the future, when the present Minister and efficient staff are not in the Department, this loophole may be used by people who do not have the best interests of the items at heart.</P>

      <P>The Minister might elaborate on this.  The Bill is to be commended.  It is a response to positive debate and it is unfortunate that Senator Mooney and Senator Lee are not present, as they made knowledgeable and detailed contributions to the Bill.  That is not a reflection on the competence of my Clare colleague, Senator Daly, but we had an entertaining debate with those two Members, even if it was highly academic and not as practical as some of our aspirations.  The Minister, a former lecturer of mine, has a capacity to bring high-minded ideology to anything he deals with and he has done so very successfully with this Bill.  I wish him continued success in the future with his work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> When this Bill was published and was to be brought to the Seanad, there was a lot of misunderstanding about it.  I apologise for that.  We felt this Bill would banish the Genealogical Office to the darkness of some musty cellar or dungeon in a museum.  Thankfully, the reverse has happened and the work of the Genealogical Office has been brought into the open.  We all have a greater and deeper understanding of that work.  On the first day of the debate on the Bill, there were many people from that office in the public gallery.  They must be satisfied because they are not here today.</P>
    <P>I too agree with the amendments, having spoken on some of them.  There was an addition to the Bill of relevance to the Irish language which pleased me but, of all people, it would not have been the Minister's intention to do anything wrong to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Many amendments have been accepted. Senator Daly mentioned the records of cemeteries, which are more important now than ever. The last generation has passed on and their knowledge has died with them.  In my county old people point out where particular graves are in old cemeteries.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Senator Mooney in his absence, as he put his heart and soul into the Bill and was responsible for many changes to it.  The Minister was quite open to accepting reasonable amendments and it is now a far better Bill.  It is good legislation and I support the Bill in its amended form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins) Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their continued interest in and co-operation with improving the legislation.  The Bill has their mark on it; it was introduced and improved upon in the Seanad, and is to be completed here today.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly asked about additions to the Second Schedule for institutions recognised for the purposes of State indemnities for exhibitions. Section 45 provides that the Minister may amend the Schedule by order, which would need a resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the First Scheduled, the buildings listed are the core buildings of the museum and the library, designated for purposes of movement of objects in the collection.  Additional premises can be added by Ministerial order, as is the case with Collins Barracks.</P>
      <P>That is a good project and I expect it to open with an exhibition in September, or perhaps earlier. We will then move on to the next phase.  I agree with the Senator on the necessity of work on the outside of the building and that will be done in preparation for the official opening. Many Senators, including Senator Daly, referred to the need for a proper home for the national collection and we will move on in that spirit of co-operation.  There will be an architectural competition for phase 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army museum artefacts will be included in the phase 2 exhibition and the relevant army staff are involved in discussion on the exhibition. <Col N="1161" /> Senator Daly also raised the issue of important objects outside the State being acquired for Ireland.  The record referred to in the Bill is a first step.  There are other legal developments and initiatives at European level, although these are to take effect in the future rather than deal with the past.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Senator on the issue of Scattery Island items which are held in the British Museum.  Any request for their return would have to take into account the terms of an international convention known as the <i>Uni Droit.</i> Unlike the convention, illegally exported cultural objects may be returnable to countries of origins. However, it is not retrospective in that formula and it only applies to future illegal exports.  While we are not a party to the convention, it forms a cornerstone of law in the area.</P>
    <P>I also assure the Senator that I recently advised a representative from India who was assessing funerary objects that might be held in different institutions in Europe to take the matter up with Commissioner Marcelino Oreja.  The matter will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator in respect of the type of individual who takes pieces of the national heritage and exports them for personal gain, thus depriving future generations of the chance to enjoy such objects.  In recent years we have successfully pursued objects on the west coast of the United States and in Germany.  It is our intention to continue to do so with vigour.  Any amendment to the law will increase the penalties because I cannot sufficiently describe the damage done by people who our heritage.</P>
    <P>In preparing this Bill and previous legislation I have always interpreted the word &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; in terms of the Finaly judgment in the Webb <i>v.</i> Ireland case, namely, that the heritage of Ireland is a possession of all the people of the country. Therefore, these rights transcend other particular rights.  From my interpretation of the Constitution, personal property rights are secondary to such larger rights.</P>
    <P>With regard to the museum of military history, this issue relates to the National Archives.  I appreciate Senator Daly's interest in this matter and the advisory council of the archives is currently considering where this should be located. It is currently situated in Cathal Brugha Barracks and is likely to be located in phase 2 of the Collins Barracks development.</P>
    <P>In respect of export licences, one must try to strike a balance.  The six month period was my response to an amendment which suggested that there would be undue delay of an administrative nature.  However, we must also consider controls. The provision does not apply to objects on the register.  Senator Taylor-Quinn raised this issue and her concerns are well founded.  For example, if I had to choose between protection and care, in a conservative sense, and the administrative problems which might be created, I would come down in favour of the former because one's interests must lie in the protection of objects in <Col N="1162" /> the first instance.  I believe the six month period will provide an adequate incentive to eliminate undue delays.  It must also be remembered that nothing on the register can remove the export licence requirement.</P>
    <P>The definition of records is dealt with in connection with graveyards and cemeteries.  A section in my Department is responsible for issuing pamphlets on the care of graveyards and in that context, there are issues which must be considered by the Minister for the Environment. However, this matter is worthy of consideration and as consciousness rises people's interest will grow.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Taylor-Quinn's point about the six month period.  Senator Fitzgerald made reference to the amendments that were accepted.  I acceded to them willingly because they improved the Bill.</P>

My inclination is to favour the convention but I was advised, as were my predecessors with responsibility in this area, to refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Members of the Seanad will be aware that the Health (Provisions of Information) Bill, 1997, passed all Stages here on 13 March.  The Bill provides for the establishment of population registers for programmes of cancer screening and safeguards the position of the National Cancer Registry Board in relation to the obtaining of certain data from hospitals.  During the Seanad debate a number of Members were of the view that the Bill should be extended beyond its original scope of screening for breast and cervical cancer so that <Col N="1164" /> other appropriate cancer screening programmes could also be covered.  I undertook to take legal advice on an appropriate wording and introduce an amendment covering this issue in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Last night the Dáil passed all Stages of the Bill which includes the amendments I promised in the Seanad.  It now applies to any programme of screening for cancer authorised by the Minister for Health.  It can be applied immediately to the screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer which I have already announced and may in future be applied to any screening programmes for other forms of cancer which have been authorised by the Minister.  As I mentioned to this House on 13 March, these programmes were not to be authorised unless it was established that they were medically effective.</P>
      <P>Since the Seanad debate I have also had the opportunity to consider the wording of other aspects of the Bill.  As originally drafted it referred specifically to &ldquo;national&rdquo; programmes of screening for cancer.  However, it was pointed out to me that there may be good reasons for establishing locally based or regional screening programmes which may or may not subsequently be organised on a national basis.  It would be unsatisfactory, therefore, if the wording of the Bill operated to preclude the establishment of appropriate local screening programmes.  I, therefore, introduced an amendment to the Bill removing any reference to national programmes.  This was accepted by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Finally, on legal advice from the parliamentary draftsman, I proposed an amendment which inserted the words &ldquo;the Minister for Health&rdquo; at section 1(2)(a).  This was also accepted by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators, particularly Senator Finneran who brought this matter to our attention in the first instance and did not press it on the understanding that I would amend the Bill in Dáil Éireann.  I have done so and now report this back to the Seanad.  I recommend the amendments and the Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for being as good as his word and amending the Bill in the Dáil.  Although we do not have facilities for screening other forms of cancer, the Bill has been improved by providing the opportunity to do so in the future.  I am also pleased by the provision for local screening, which had not occurred to me previously.  We are aware of the worries in the north-east about the effects of Sellafield.  In so far as this legislation provides for local screening in that area it has been improved.  I compliment the Minister for taking on board the wishes of this House and my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Before I deal with the terms of the motion I feel it incumbent on me to make a number of points of relevance.  First, I know that I speak for everybody in this House and throughout the <Col N="1166" /> country, regardless of political affiliation, when I say that it is almost impossible to come to terms with the enormity of the scandal surrounding the hepatitis C infection of the anti-D product and the blood supply.  Notwithstanding our best efforts to do so, I believe it will take a considerable length of time for all of us to comprehend fully the horrendous effect which this scandal has had, and continues to have, on the health and everyday lives of innocent victims and their families.</P>
      <P>I truly believe that no words of mine, or indeed of any previous holder of the office of Minister for Health, can ever adequately apologise to the 1,600 women and men for the damage done to them by a system in which they had previously placed their fullest trust and confidence.  Trauma and fear have been engendered in many innocent people by this experience.  Yes, there is some recompense in the recognition that grievous wrongs were committed.  Yes, there is some recompense too in the unequivocal allocation of responsibility for these wrongs by the tribunal of inquiry.  There is some minor recompense also in the monetary awards to the affected victims &mdash; awards which we can only hope alleviate the suffering and distress expressed so heartrendingly by the victims and their immediate families.  However, nothing can ever fully or irrevocably compensate them for being infected with hepatitis C &mdash; a condition for which, as yet unfortunately, there is no cure.</P>
      <P>The formidable task of disentangling the complex facts of this tragedy, of putting order on them and setting them out plainly in language which precisely and exactly conveys the awfulness of these events, was entrusted by the Houses of the Oireachtas to Mr. Justice Finlay and has been discharged by him with unprecedented efficiency and expedition, for which I wish to record my thanks, the thanks of the Government, and, I am sure, of this House.  The result of the House's decision to establish the tribunal is that there is now available for all who wish to avail of it &mdash; victims, participants, politicians, doctors and the public &mdash; a clear and coherent account of this matter, who is responsible and what is now to be done.  The truth has been laid bare, a number of recurrent controversies laid to rest and responsibility allocated in a fair, just and impartial manner. It does not make happy reading.</P>
      <P>No citizen, be he or she victim or participant in the events described or a mere concerned observer, can fail to be moved and humbled by the account of the distress and fortitude of those who have suffered and continue to suffer from the events described.  The report gives us a coherent account of what occurred and why, but it is considerably more than merely a history.  It is an unemotional indictment of past procedures at the BTSB and is unequivocal in its apportionment of blame to certain named members of staff.  It offers a welcome and succinct illumination on a number of difficult legal issues &mdash; for example, the application of the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> However, it also looks to the future.  From the victim's point of view it sets out the factual basis upon which their claims for compensation, either in court or before the tribunal, will henceforth be based.  The State will not seek to repudiate or resile from any of the tribunal's findings in any such forum.  From the point of view of the blood supply it sets out a number of important recommendations, all of which have been accepted in full.  The exceptional command of the facts exhibited by Mr. Justice Finlay lends to his recommendations an authority and a widespread acceptance that ensures the implementation of his recommendations in full will provide a sound basis for restoring full confidence in the blood supply.</P>
    <P>I cannot allow this opportunity to pass, however, without commenting on the most recent incident involving the BTSB, namely, the contacting of an infected victim with a view to obtaining blood.  Mistakes such as these, even when there is no risk to the blood supply, are simply unacceptable.  I have made my views known trenchantly to the chairman and chief executive of the BTSB; and while I accept that great strides have been made in reforming the operations of the BTSB, it must be fully recognised that this latest incident has added to the negative perception of that organisation which the current management has done so much to dispel.  Notwithstanding the real difficulty people may have in coming to terms with what has happened, the truth is that we need blood, our hospitals need blood and it is grossly irresponsible to call for the closing down of the BTSB or for the sacking of a public servant who has devoted such an enormous amount of time, effort and dedication to resolving the problems of the BTSB.  Undoubtedly, mistakes can occur; but I will not be satisfied until such time as we can with total confidence rule out even the most minor error, because each such error, no matter how small, can undermine confidence in the BTSB.</P>
    <P>Huge strides have been made to improve standards at the BTSB.  The work of Mr. Liam Dunbar and Professor Shaun McCann has been invaluable in reorganising the BTSB and in setting and implementing new standards and procedures which ensure that the mistakes of the past will not recur.  Management has drawn heavily on the recommendations of the Bain consultancy report in forming a strategic plan, much of which is already implemented.  The acceptance of recommendations in Mr. Justice Finlay's report will further improve standards at the BTSB.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with these recommendations in some detail because they are important for the future.  I have already stated publicly that the Government accepts in full the recommendations of the report.  These recommendations will be implemented as quickly as possible.  The report makes six significant recommendations in relation to the future workings of the BTSB and the Irish Medicines Board.  Those portions of the <Col N="1168" /> development plan for the BTSB for the period 1996-99 which have not yet been implemented will be implemented without delay.  I will ensure that the 1999 target date for completion will be met.  In particular, I have approved the relocation of the art headquarters of the BTSB from Pelican House to a new site on the campus of St. James's Hospital.  This new building will ensure that state of the art laboratories, including all the necessary equipment and staff, can be put in place to ensure that our national blood service will have the required range of facilities to carry it through to the 21st century.  The renewal or replacement of the BTSB unit in Cork will be commenced immediately.  The estimated capital cost for the completion of the development plan is £20m.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has made detailed recommendations in relation to the monitoring of the BTSB by the Irish Medicines Board.  In response to the expert group report of April 1995, I have given the Irish Medicines Board statutory responsibility for the inspection of the collection, screening, processing and quality control facilities and procedures in respect of blood, blood products and plasma derivatives with a view to ensuring their safety and quality.  The tribunal has recommended that the Irish Medicines Board should carry out at least two full inspections of the BTSB each year.  This has already been implemented in that the arrangement is that the IMB carries out four inspections of the BTSB each year.  My Department has commenced discussions with the Irish Medicines Board with a view to implementing a recommendation that it should be required to make an annual report to the Minister, for publication, on the outcome of these inspections and also on any reports received by the IMB of abnormal reactions to blood or blood products from any person or institution.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has recommended that there should be a statutory obligation on medical and nursing personnel to report contemporaneously all abnormal reactions to blood or blood products both to the IMB and the BTSB and that the BTSB should also be obliged to report to the IMB on all abnormal reactions of which it becomes aware.  The tribunal also recommends that failure by any employee of the BTSB to report such abnormal reaction if committed intentionally or by gross negligence should be a criminal offence.  I am accepting this recommendation. There are potentially difficult legal issues which will have to be teased out in the course of its implementation and I have already instructed my Department to proceed immediately with this work.</P>
    <P>A blood service consumers council, including representation from those who regularly receive blood and those who regularly donate blood, will be set up in the immediate future.  This will make a major contribution to the maintenance of public confidence in the supply of blood and blood products.  I believe it is vital that members of the general public should have an advisory role in the BTSB.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> The report of the tribunal is critical of the recall of the anti-D product undertaken by the BTSB in 1994 and has recommended that the BTSB should forthwith prepare a new standard operating procedure for a recall of any product, the safety of which is suspected.  I have instructed my Department to commence the process of implementing this recommendation with the BTSB.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has also looked at the difficulty which could arise if it was again necessary to stop using a particular blood product at short notice but there was no product authorisation in place for alternatives which could be imported quickly as an emergency replacement.  The tribunal points out that a commercial undertaking may not be concerned to undergo the trouble or expense to obtain a product authorisation on the off chance that its supplies may be needed in an emergency. The tribunal has asked that a possible solution should be considered whereby the present regulations would be amended to provide for what it terms &ldquo;standby&rdquo; or &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; product authorisations to cover such situations.  This is a most worthwhile suggestion which I have instructed my Department to investigate without delay.  I accept the tribunal's recommendation that if such a scheme is feasible the BTSB should be required to make use of it so that &ldquo;standby&rdquo; authorisations will be in place for products such as anti-D and factor VIII.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the tribunal's recommendations will build on the work already undertaken by the new management in the BTSB to ensure as far as possible the safety of blood and blood products into the future.  The necessary groundwork has already been put in place by the new management of the BTSB over the past two years in respect of many of these matters.</P>
    <P>Hundreds and thousands of people in this country have given freely over decades millions of donations of their blood in order to maintain, sustain and extend life for those critically ill or critically injured.  Our blood supply system in this country is among a small handful of unique voluntary blood supply systems.  I appeal to people on all sides of this House to approach the current debate on how best to protect and promote the integrity of the national blood supply with humility, with a sense of proportion and balance and with a real sense of responsibility for a public duty in its broadest meaning.  In the interest of the nation Members on all sides of this House, while exercising their absolute right to scrutinise all Government policy at all times, will accept that the voluntary blood supply is a national asset which should not be unfairly exposed to partisan politics, whatever about particular criticisms.</P>
    <P>I met recently with representatives of Positive Action in response to a letter which they sent to me on 14 March last outlining their views arising from the publication of the tribunal report.  Positive Action has requested a full reappraisal of the compensation tribunal.  The reappraisal upon <Col N="1170" /> which the Government is embarking is principally required because our knowledge has been altered by the publication of this report.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to place the compensation scheme on a statutory basis, but has resolved that the operation of the compensation tribunal should not be disrupted or delayed while the scheme is being prepared and the statute drafted and enacted.  This will take some time and in the meantime I am determined that the operation of the compensation tribunal will not be disrupted or delayed.  It will continue to operate as normal under the direction of Mr. Justice Egan so that people who have already applied for a hearing will get that hearing as arranged.  I will seek to ensure that everyone who has either gone through the tribunal, is currently before the tribunal or will be before the tribunal in the near future will retrospectively benefit from any changes made.  It is also my intention that the terms of the compensation scheme should provide for an appeal to the High Court on the amount of awards made by the compensation tribunal.</P>
    <P>Considerable attention has been given to the prohibition in the existing terms of reference of an award of aggravated or punitive damages.  It has been pointed out that the option of awarding such damages is available to the High Court but not to the tribunal and that it would be preferable if it had the same freedom as the High Court in this regard.  Accordingly, I will be proposing that this restrictive provision be removed from the terms of reference of the tribunal so that it will be free to award damages on exactly the same basis as the High Court.  It will be for the tribunal to decide whether such damages are appropriate and how they should be measured if that question arises.  In considering that question the compensation tribunal will be informed that the Government accepts the findings of the tribunal of inquiry and that the report's findings of fact should be accepted by the compensation tribunal.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday I indicated the Government's intention to reappraise and amend the terms of reference of the compensation scheme following consultation with representative groups and the chairman of the compensation tribunal.  I am hopeful that this consultation process can commence with the groups at an early date.  I have also asked the BTSB to forthwith make known its position on liability on all outstanding cases in the light of the report's findings.</P>
    <P>Regarding the National Drugs Advisory Board, the tribunal concluded that: &ldquo;In the period 1975 to 1994, successive Minister for Health and the Department of Health failed adequately and appropriately to supervise the NDAB in the exercise of its functions concerning the licensing of the manufacture of products by the BTSB and the authorisation of products by the BTSB, in that they failed to provide to the NDAB the appropriate resources for carrying out those functions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The tribunal found that the levels of staff, <Col N="1171" /> particularly on the technical side including inspectors, was inadequate.  Consequently, the NDAB did not carry out regular and adequate inspections of the BTSB.  While the tribunal found that such inspections would not have revealed the particular batches which gave rise to the infection of anti-D except by some form of chance, it states that:</P>
    <P>If those resources had been provided and if there had been appropriate inspections and investigations, it is possible that the reactions of the recipients of anti-D in the period 1976 and 1977 to the contaminated product, would have been revealed and that the persons involved in the BTSB would have made further investigations than they did if they were aware of the likelihood of further inspection and interrogation.</P>
    <P>The position now is very different as a result of the steps which I have taken in the last two years. The NDAB has been replaced by the Irish Medicines Board, on foot of the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995.  All statutory licensing functions previously held by the Minister for Health have been transferred to it to eliminate the unnecessary additional layer of administrative process which contributed to the backlogs in the licensing system in the past.</P>
    <P>A major management consultancy exercise was commissioned in 1995 to identify the staffing, systems and operational procedures which the new board would require to carry out its functions properly and the previous organisation has been restructured in line with the recommendations which emerged.  In particular, the licensing fees charged to the industry have been set at a more appropriate level to ensure that the board has adequate resources to carry out its functions thoroughly, efficiently and without undue delay. The organisation is now driven by a streamlined board with a management rather than a technical orientation.  It has also been relocated in new premises as those used by the NDAB were inadequate and a hindrance to increasing the efficiency of the organisation.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office I have addressed and resolved the organisational and resourcing problems which the tribunal found to have beset the NDAB for the previous 20 years.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the supervision of the BTSB by the Department of Health since February 1994.  Chapter 13 of the report of the tribunal deals with my response and that of my Department and the response of my predecessor, Deputy Howlin to the hepatitis C issue.  This response included the establishment of many programmes and schemes to support the victims of this terrible tragedy and to alleviate as far as possible the human suffering occasioned by the hepatitis C infection of the anti-D product and the blood supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> I wish to briefly outline the various programmes and schemes and the findings of the tribunal in relation to these.  A national blood screening programme was announced by my predecessor, Deputy Howlin, on 21 February 1994 to screen all women who received the anti-D product in order to identify those who were infected with hepatitis C.  For persons who were diagnosed positive for hepatitis C under the screening programme, acute hospital services were put in place in special units in six designated hospitals, namely, Beaumont, the Mater, St Vincent's and St James's in Dublin, Cork University Hospital and University Hospital, Galway.  These services, provided under the Health Act, 1970, are free of charge and include access to both inpatient and out-patient treatment as required. Special funding has been and will continue to be provided by the Department of Health for these services.  For example, in 1996 a special sum of £2 million was provided and a similar sum will be allocated for 1997.  The Tribunal of Inquiry concluded that: &ldquo;The overall picture appears to be that treatment as far as treatment has been developed by the medical profession in general for this unfortunate disease was adequately provided in these units&rdquo;.  The special secondary healthcare services are included in the healthcare package agreed with the groups representing persons with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal of Inquiry stated that the <i>ex-gratia</i> expenses scheme apparently worked &ldquo;reasonably satisfactorily&rdquo;.  It concluded that it was satisfied that the decision of the then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, to set up an expert group was &ldquo;an adequate and appropriate response to the problem of trying to find out what actually happened in regard to this infection of anti-D&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has been widely alleged that I engaged in a cover-up by failing to immediately set up a tribunal of inquiry in March 1996 when laboratory test request forms or quantitation reports indicating the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis discovered by the BTSB in the action being brought against them by the late Mrs. Brigid McCole became public.  Both I and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, informed the Dáil that these test request forms did not constitute any fundamental difference in the information available with regard to the wrongful use of patient X's plasma. It was claimed by some Senators that these quantitation reports were of fundamental importance and altered the entire situation concerning the events of 1976 and 1977.</P>
    <P>The tribunal concluded that the quantitation information did &ldquo;not constitute new, dominant or fundamental medical evidence&rdquo; and did &ldquo;not form a foundation for any particular conclusion which would not have been reached without them to the general wrong doing in the use of the plasma from patient X&rdquo;.  It further concludes that my decision not to set up a tribunal of inquiry at that time &ldquo;was an adequate and appropriate reaction to the facts as they then were&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> In addition, the tribunal indicated that &ldquo;the attitude taken by [myself] and Minister O'Shea, in reply to the Dáil questions in relation to this issue would appear to have been correct&rdquo;.  In all fairness, I would ask those Members of both Houses who laid those charges against me and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea to come forward and withdraw the charges.</P>
    <P>The tribunal concluded that from the evidence of the communications between the Department and the BTSB with regard to the targeted look-back programme that, at all relevant times, it would appear to indicate an adequate and appropriate reaction.</P>
    <P>I announced, on 12 September 1995, the national optional testing programme.  This programme was introduced to ensure that all recipients of blood transfusions and blood products, who might have become infected with hepatitis C through the receipt of transfusions or blood products, were given the option of being tested free of charge.</P>
    <P>The health care package agreed with the representative groups includes primary healthcare services as provided for in the Health (Amendment) Act 1996.</P>
    <P>In respect of the health care package, the tribunal concludes that: &ldquo;on balance the position would appear to the Tribunal to be that the Health Care Package, when finally provided, was appropriate and that it was, when provided, adequate but that some element, although not a great one, in the delay in bringing such a package into statutory from, was not an adequate response to the particular urgency which attached to that task&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to this conclusion, I would like to outline the timing of the various stages of the passage of the Bill in both Houses of the Oireachtas and the consultation and arrangements which took place for its implementation.</P>
    <P>In November 1995 negotiations took place with Positive Action on the health care services and on 4 December 1995 the Government authorised the drafting of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995.  On 11 December 1995, I sought Government approval for the text of the Bill and on the 12 December 1995 the Government approved its publication.  The Second Stage debate on the Bill took place in the Dáil after the Christmas recess on 27 and 28 February 1996.  During March and April, further negotiations with Positive Action and other representative groups on the amendments to the Bill took place.  On 8 May 1996 the Committee Stage debate took place in the Select Committee on Social Affairs and Report and Final Stages were taken in the Dáil on 30 May 1996.</P>
    <P>The Second Stage debate in this House took place on 13 June 1996 and the Committee and Final Stages were taken in this House on 20 June 1996.  In July and August 1996 negotiations, including negotiations regarding fees, took place with professional organisations, particularly with GPs, and health boards on the implementation of <Col N="1174" /> the provisions of the Act.  Consultations with the representative groups on the design of application form, health cards and arrangements for service delivery followed and on the 28 August 1996 I signed the commencement order bringing the Act into effect on 23 September 1996.</P>
    <P>On 17 December 1996 I announced my intention to establish an optional HIV testing programme offering screening to blood transfusion and blood product recipients who may be at risk, however small that risk might be.  Before commencing this programme, it is absolutely essential that the risk, if any, involved for recipients, according to the year that they received the transfusion or blood product and depending on the risk, if any, of particular products, must be determined, as far as possible so as to enable each recipient to make a fully informed decision, in consultation with his/her general practitioner in relation to availing of screening.  I am hopeful, that the preparations for the optional HIV screening programme, which are well advanced, will be completed in the coming weeks.  In the meantime, the HIV targeted lookback is continuing.</P>
    <P>On the 28 January 1997 I announced the Government's intention to establish a tribunal of inquiry to examine specific urgent matters of public importance; (a) the HIV infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB, and (b) such further matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in the light of the report of the hepatitis C tribunal.</P>
    <P>I stated that it would not be possible to submit the terms of reference to both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval until the report of the tribunal of inquiry had been submitted to me as it would not be possible to say what matters of urgent public importance would remain unaddressed. As Members are aware, the report was submitted to me on 6 March 1997 and the detailed terms of reference will be finalised, in consultation with the Irish Haemophilia Society, at an early date.  The success of the hepatitis C Tribunal of Inquiry can, in part, be ascribed to its very specific terms of reference.  Accordingly, great care will be taken to ensure that the terms of reference of this proposed tribunal will be very tightly framed to address specific issues.</P>
    <P>As Members of the House know, the Government has agreed, at my request, to refer the report of the tribunal of inquiry to the DPP.  This issue was argued before the tribunal of inquiry and the tribunal considered that it would not be appropriate for the tribunal to make such a referral.  However, because of the enormity of the tragedy and the contents of the report, I have, with the authority of the Government, referred the report to the DPP.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House, who have served in Government, must bear some responsibility for the events which have occurred.  The tribunal comments adversely on the failure of successive Ministers for Health to adequately fund the NDAB between 1975 and 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> I am aware that no member of the Progressive Democrats has held office as Minister for Health. The Progressive Democrats, however, were in Government between 1989 and 1992, when some of the most shocking events occurred; the lack of action when the Middlesex letter clearly informed the BTSB that patient X had suffered from hepatitis C and the use of patient Y's plasma when she had tested positive are examples of this.  They must also bear collective Cabinet responsibility for the inadequate funding of the NDAB during their period in office.  They should also recall that two of their leading members were Cabinet Members in Fianna Fáil Governments from 1977 to 1981 when the original infection was occurring and spreading through many unsuspecting women.  Spokespersons for the Opposition should remember this before they launch political attacks.</P>
    <P>I welcome and invite contributions from all sides of the House regarding the management and delivery of the blood supply service.  What I do not welcome are unfounded or ill-advised headline seeking or sweeping statements about matters requiring clear medical direction or medical expertise.</P>
    <P>A number of persons asked why the conduct of the McCole case was not a matter into which the tribunal inquired.  A tribunal of inquiry such as this is set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Our Constitution guarantees the separation of powers between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the courts.  Consequently, it is not constitutionally possible for the Houses of the Oireachtas to initiate an inquiry into how a case was conducted before the courts.  The Government has strong legal advice that the Oireachtas cannot attempt to deal with the issue of how a court case is handled or to make findings on the way it is handled.  Any such issue is a matter for the courts themselves.</P>
    <P>Once again the issue of the conduct of the McCole case has been raised.  The position is as I have explained it on a number of occasions previously and as was explained by the Taoiseach on the order of business in the Dáil this morning. There were three defendants in the case in question: the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the National Drugs Advisory Board and the State.  As far as the BTSB and the NDAB are concerned, they had separates boards, separate legal teams and separate insurance in regard to liability and pursued their own independent legal decisions and strategy on the basis of their advice and authority. State boards of all kinds daily take decisions on legal cases being taken against them which are not the subject of direction, authorisation or decision by Government.  It would be impossible for the State board system to function in any useful way if the decisions about acceptance or otherwise of liability by a State board were to be referred to the Cabinet for decision. They were not referred to the Cabinet for decision in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> As far as the State defence is concerned, the Government did receive formal legal advice that the State, as distinct from the BTSB, did not have a liability in this matter.  That is obviously legal advice which, when received by any Government it must take due account of, particularly from the point of view of accountability for public funds. It is not possible for the Government to ignore legal advice about liability in regard to taxpayers' funds.  When the advice was given as to the State's liability in this matter, that advice had to be taken seriously, as it was, in any discussions we had on this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope Members will appreciate and understand, however, that the Government's priority was to set up a non-adversarial system for the quickest dispensement of compensation to the victims.  We did not want to get involved, as a priority, in legal cases in an adversarial setting but rather to ensure, through the establishment of a non-adversarial tribunal for compensation, that compensation would be paid to the women as quickly as possible and, subsequently, to the other victims, both men and women.  That was our priority.  This problem existed for some time but the Government establishment of a tribunal of compensation ensured, without the requirement of being engaged in adversarial faultfinding, that there would be quick compensation for the victims.  The issue of fault and liability is a separate matter.  Our first priority was to ensure there would be a speedy and effective way of compensating the victims as their concerns come first.</P>
    <P>I know that many Senators are anxious to contribute to this debate and that they will have many questions and comments about the report of the tribunal of inquiry and the BTSB.  I welcome such comments and I will endeavour to answer the questions when I conclude this debate this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank and compliment former Chief Justice Finlay for producing the report on hepatitis C.  His work was hamstrung in so far as the political accountability of Government was not an issue on which he could investigate or report.  That was a major omission in the terms of reference of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>There are many matters outstanding in this debacle.  Political accountability has not been and is not being addressed even today.  There has been no Government apology to the victims of the State's malpractice and the actions of the Government in the McCole case have not been explained adequately.  Nobody who has read newspaper reports or this report could be satisfied that the State could involve itself in an attempt to blackmail the McCole family when Mrs. McCole was trying to establish her rights through the courts.  That matter has not been resolved or addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hepatitis C scandal is the biggest health scandal in the history of this State.  Over 1,000 women were infected by an agency of the State and, while fingers have been pointed at people <Col N="1177" /> who were responsible and who did not act properly, no blame has been accepted by those in charge politically.  The fact is that many of those who were responsible for infecting over 1,000 women retired with golden handshakes.  They left the service without being brought to book.  I welcome the fact that the report of the tribunal has eventually been referred to the DPP.  This was a matter of grave negligence over many years.  I have been involved on many occasions in forcing the Government to address this situation properly.</P>
    <P>Since we last debated this issue, a number of more disturbing situations have arisen, one of which relates to the actions of the former Minister for Health.  A claim was made in the other House that he failed to bring this matter to the attention of his Cabinet colleagues.  If that is the case, it is most serious.  Indeed, the same Minister indicated yesterday on radio that the Cabinet had decided on certain matters; this constitutes new evidence.</P>
    <P>The simple facts of the case are that the women who were infected by the State agency had to involve themselves in all kinds of activities to get their cases heard and have their rights acknowledged by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I remember the debate in which we sought Government agreement for a statutory tribunal and were voted down and an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal was put in place. That has now taken a turn in so far as there is now provision for a statutory tribunal.  I welcome its extended powers which are equivalent to those of a court.  This is not before time.</P>
    <P>There is still one major outstanding matter, and that is, how many more people have been infected with hepatitis C?  Will the Minister provide a national screening scheme to establish the full extent of hepatitis C?  That is now necessary to address this matter and bring it to a conclusion because many people who have not been contacted are worried that they are infected and they want the State to act on their behalf.  The Minister should provide a national screening service to establish the extent of infection.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister in complimenting all those who have contributed to the blood supply over the years.  I agree that Ireland is almost unique in that people give their blood voluntarily to help save lives.  I join with the Minister in asking the people of Ireland to continue to give blood.  To show their care for their fellow human beings, they should continue to provide a voluntary blood service.</P>
    <P>The State has a responsibility to ensure that those who donate blood are fit to do so, that the blood is stored and made available to those who need it and that blood products provided by the State are safe because that was not the case in the past.  Defective products were provided to Irish men and women who became infected and these people now have a disease for which there is no cure.  Let this never happen again.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that to date no person has been charged with an offence in relation to this <Col N="1178" /> major health scandal.  The Minister has said that the Blood Transfusion Services Board, the National Drugs Advisory Board, the Department of Health and other agencies had independent responsibilities, independent legal teams and were like independent republics.  There has been an attempt to create a barrier between the agencies, the Department and the Minister, but any such barrier is fictious.  All those boards are there at the behest of the Minister if he wishes to intervene at any time.  Under law the Minister for Health can intervene in any situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister created this imaginary wall so that he does not have to accept the political responsibility for what happened.  There may be others for all I know, including his predecessor, Deputy Howlin, but, given the information available to us, we have to deal with the present.  That is too bad.  At the end of the day the Minister has the responsibility.  He should not spread the blame and distance himself from State negligence which concerns both the Minister and the Government.  While the Minister wants to save himself politically, he is to some extent covering his own tracks by passing it on to the State agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the terms of reference given to Judge Finlay had included political responsibility, more might have been established.  However, the report is restricted in so far as the terms of reference did not allow the judge to evaluate political accountability.  If the Minister had nothing to hide, why were the terms of reference not broad enough to take political accountability into consideration?</P>
      <P>The full truth of what happened has not yet been given and we may never get it because it is unlikely there will be any further inquiries.  I do not believe, however, that the full truth regarding this matter has come out.  It is highly unlikely that State boards and agencies could have acted thus over the past few years while the Government or the Attorney General stood that far back and did not get involved, take advice or acquaint themselves with what was happening.  I find that hard to believe and I doubt if, in fact, that was the situation.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said in the House as a person but the facts are that even at this stage no apology has been made to those women on behalf of the State.  The apology and liability issues have been pushed onto agencies and seem to have been kept at arm's length from the political head and the Government itself.  I cannot but think that was done to save political skins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister spread it around, saying other Minister and different parties were involved over the years.  This happened some time ago but it is important that matters should be dealt with when they come to light.  Other than a statement made in Dáil regarding one former <Col N="1179" /> Minister, it has not been established that anybody had information and did not deal with it.  To my knowledge that is the situation.</P>

      <P>Information came out in the last couple of weeks that somebody who was infected had been asked to donate blood again.  We needed that like a hole in the head.  That type of activity lessens public confidence in the BTSB. The Minister said he does not accept that but the people who spoke up were right to ask for accountability in this matter.  Irrespective of who is head of any board, they must take responsibility and must state that mistakes cannot and will not be made in matters of life and death.

      <P>Whether chief executive officers, directors general or chairpersons of any board are <Col N="1180" /> involved, if they have responsibility for something working in a certain way which is found to be flawed or defective, there is a responsibility on the Minister to say either you do the job or move aside and we will get somebody else to do it.  As far as I know, what was said at that time was that if it was not working properly then the board or person should be removed.  If it was not working properly and a genuine mistake had been addressed, well and good, but we must have confidence. That is important.  Unless confidence is there, the public will not feel the State is providing a proper blood supply or blood product service.</P>
      <P>I hope what the Minister has put in place will safeguard blood supplies to the public.  I also hope that, as a priority, the Minister will introduce a national screening service for people who may be infected but who have not yet been identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Mr. Justice Finlay for his Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board, which is easy but sad to read.  It is damning of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and of several key officials and it sets out a litany of mistakes made by the BTSB.</P>
      <P>The primary cause of the infection of anti-D with hepatitis C was the use of plasma from patient X who underwent therapeutic plasma exchange treatment and developed jaundice and hepatitis C. The use of this plasma was in breach of the BTSB's own standards for donor selection which prohibited the use of blood or plasma from a person with a history of jaundice or hepatitis and from a person recently transfused.</P>
      <P>It is clear from Mr. Justice Finlay's report that by the middle of December 1976 all senior medical staff at the BTSB were concerned about the plasma obtained from patient X.  They were aware that hepatitis had been diagnosed and that this patient was suffering from jaundice.  Unfortunately, however, they continued to manufacture the product.  They also failed to recall the contaminated batches and to prevent the issue of further batches made from the plasma obtained from patient X.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the report that the BTSB acted unethically in obtaining the use of plasma from a patient without seeking her consent.  It is also clear that a further cause of the infection of anti-D with hepatitis C was the use of plasma from donor Y who was undergoing a course of therapeutic plasma exchange in 1989 and whose plasma was stored and then subsequently used in 1992, although the stored plasma had been tested for hepatitis C and four separate tests had proved positive.  The BTSB's chief biochemist decided to use the plasma notwithstanding the result of at least one test which she was informed had proved positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most damaging aspect of this saga was the BTSB's response to a letter from the Middlesex Hospital in 1991 concerning the infection of patient <Col N="1181" /> X's plasma with hepatitis C. Mr. Justice Finlay states in his report:</P>
    <P>With regard to the position upon the receipt of the letter of the 16th December 1991 from the Middlesex Hospital, the reaction of Dr. Walsh, and to a lesser extent of Mrs. Cunningham, to that letter can only be construed as a blank refusal even to contemplate the consequences of what had been done in 1977 and a vague hope that by ignoring the problem it would go away.</P>
    <P>This was a dereliction of duty which was compounded by the fact that the BTSB failed to inform the women who had or might have been infected in 1991 after the letter from the Middlesex Hospital had been received or to inform the Department of Health or the National Drugs Advisory Board of that infection.  The officials in the Blood Transfusion Service Board were not prepared to face up to the consequences of the wrong committed in 1977.</P>
    <P>Much has been written and said about ministerial responsibility and many allegations have been made against the Minister for Health, which Mr. Justice Finlay found unjustified.  In 1989 I moved a Private Members' motion in this House seeking compensation for haemophiliacs who were suffering from AIDS as a result of infected factor VIII.  I did not condemn the then Minister for Health or ask him to accept responsibility.  I attended meetings where the number of AIDS patients was written on the wall but this number decreased each week as patients died.  It was a moving experience to deal with these people who just wanted compensation.  The Minister for Health at the time, who was a member of Senator Finneran's party, said the State would not pay compensation.  I told him that another Minister for Health would because these people had good cases.  A Private Members' motion was also defeated in the other House which caused a general election.  This is not the first tragedy as a result of infected blood, but this Minister has dealt more humanely with it than a previous Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>It is also wrong for politicians to try to rewrite sections of a report, such as this one, because its findings are unacceptable to their political views. If a tribunal is set up and publishes its report, it should be accepted by every Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Many charges have been made against the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department of Health.  When documents were discovered in 1996 in relation to the McCole case which referred to the original donor of the infected blood, the Minister was accused of engaging in a cover up by failing to establish a tribunal of inquiry in March 1996.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Shea, was also accused of deliberately misleading the Dáil by not divulging this information. However, Mr. Justice Finlay came to the conclusion <Col N="1182" /> that the discovered documents did not constitute new fundamental medical evidence.</P>
    <P>Another allegation made against the Minister for Health was that he published the report of the expert group chaired by Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien knowing it was inadequate because it did not deal with the failure to grant a manufacturer's licence under the Therapeutic Substance Act, 1932.  However, Justice Finlay disagreed with this allegation.  He also supported the decision by the Minister for Health to establish a compensation tribunal for the victims of hepatitis C.  The Minister for Health was also vindicated in terms of the timing of the change of personnel in charge of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the health care package provided for the victims.  Mr. Justice Finlay said he was disappointed it took so long to get the legislation through the Houses.  He might not have made that remark had he known the difficulties involved in getting it passed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health has played an important role in this sad episode.  Ministers for Health come and go but the Department is a permanent arm of the State which is responsible for protecting the health of the citizens.  However, in this instance the Department of Health failed to fulfil its responsibility.  Mr. Justice Finlay states in his report that in the period 1975-94 successive Ministers for Health and the Department of Health failed to supervise the National Drugs Advisory Board in the exercise of its functions in relation to the licensing of the manufacture of products by the BTSB and that it failed to provide the National Drugs Advisory Board with the appropriate resources to carry out these functions. He further states that if those resources had been provided and appropriate inspections and investigations carried out, the reactions of those who received anti-D between 1976-7 would have been relieved and the persons involved in the BTSB would have been made more aware of their roles and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The report is also critical of the Department of Health which delayed introducing the hepatitis C screening test at the beginning of 1991 when its reliability and safety appeared to have been universally established.  The Department of Health eventually introduced a screening test in October 1991.  However, it was probable that a number of people were infected in the period of the delay in the introduction of this test.  The tribunal held the view that the chief medical officer at the Department of Health had to bear responsibility for the delay.  However, the export group report revealed that when the chief medical officer finally agreed to the introduction of the test in May 1991 the BTSB was not informed of the decision for several months.  It was also not informed that officials from the Department had set aside funding for such a screening test.  Almost a year was lost haggling before the screening test was introduced. The administrative side of the Department must bear major responsibility for the delay, which appeared to have been unnecessary and unwise having regard to the safety advantages of <Col N="1183" /> introducing hepatitis C screening between the earlier part of 1991 and October 1991.</P>
    <P>From June 1994 Positive Action, on behalf of its members, was making it clear to the Department and the BTSB its objections to the counselling of women.  Mr. Justice Finlay was of the opinion, in regard to the counselling of victims of hepatitis C, that the solution eventually achieved in 1995 was appropriate; but having regard to the importance of the element of the treatment of victims, the reaction of the Department earlier in 1994 in failing to insist upon a more rapid putting in place of an independent council was inadequate.</P>
    <P>Chapter five of the report was one of the most harrowing, where Mr. Justice Finlay outlined the consequences of the infection of anti-D.  Our sincere sympathy must go to anyone who has been infected with this terrible problem.  I concur with the sentiments of the motion before the House which acknowledges the extraordinary anguish and distress experienced by the victims and their families and acknowledges the widespread sense of public outrage at the matters disclosed in the report.  The House supports the Government's intentions to amend the scheme of compensation and its terms of reference and that the tribunal should be established on a statutory basis.  The Government has undertaken that it will not repudiate any of the findings of fact of the report of the tribunal into the BTSB in any proceedings either in court or before the Compensation Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the Government has decided to grant additional special damages to 1,600 victims of hepatitis C in recognition of the extraordinary anguish and distress experienced by the victims and their families.  It is very important that we have confidence in the BTSB and in the blood supply.  In order to sustain the confidence of the public in the BTSB and in the blood supply, certain steps have been taken by the Minister to ensure the organisation and running of the BTSB would be such that it will be recognised by those dealing with it as having effective and safe controls.  Unfortunately, there has been severe criticism recently of the BTSB, including an error made by an official which could amount to the public losing confidence in our blood transfusion service.  Such comments made by public representatives are totally irresponsible.</P>
    <P>Even though the report sets out the defects of the BTSB and the mistakes it has committed in the past, nevertheless it has to be recognised that it has supplied, with the exception of anti-D and factor VIII products, a safe supply of blood to our hospitals over a long number of years.  This is due mainly to the generosity of the people who give donations.  Many people who have had operations and or have been in accidents depended solely for their survival on the blood supplied by the board. They are alive and well and that must be taken into account to bring balance to the issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> It is a sad saga, but the Minister, Government and Department of Health have dealt as sympathetically as possible with this terrible problem. I am grateful the Minister accepts the majority of the recommendations of the Finlay report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (d) of the motion states that Seanad Éireann &ldquo;notes and acknowledges the widespread sense of public outrage at the matters disclosed by the report.&rdquo;  Public outrage is even less than that felt by the medical profession, along with a sense of betrayal, because we put such confidence in the BTSB, which had constantly assured us of its high standards.  Paragraph (e) states that &ldquo;we fully understand the extraordinary anguish and distress experienced by the victims and their families&rdquo;.  This is seen on a day to day basis by members of the medical profession and I hope we will be forgiven for any inadequacies or perceived inadequacies in our dealing with these patients.  I apologise to anyone infected who feels I have not done enough to help them.</P>
      <P>Therapeutic misadventure on such a scale has mercifully never happened before in this country, but hepatitis C is an international problem and similar disasters have unfortunately happened elsewhere.  Whenever I have spoken on this topic, I stressed that anything we can do to help those infected must be done; but we must also ensure, in so far as we can, such an occurrence does not happen again and that we learn from the mistakes made here and internationally.  I will do anything I can to deal with those infected.  I went to the first meeting of Positive Action and made that promise; but after attending two other meetings I had to draw back, because as Jane O'Brien, who had so skilfully organised Positive Action, said, my role as a doctor and a politician were becoming somewhat confused.  Naturally, not being an expert in transfusion medicine or hepatology, I did not feel my advice as a doctor was the best those patients could get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Positive Action on its role in this sorry saga and the responsible way in which it has handled publicity.  It is essential from the point of view of those infected that the group should continue to receive support because its help will be needed by all of us for some time.  It was also important in helping those who had to deal with victims to understand the situation.  The expert group report went a long way in explaining the disaster; but, while I do not wish to accuse anyone of mendacity, some people appeared to have been economical with the truth, to quote a famous British civil servant.  What a pity a subpoena was required to get the most essential medical practitioner to give evidence about what happened in 1977.  The saga around patient X is almost unbelievable.  So many international transfusion rules, as well as their own regulations, were broken by those working in Pelican House.  The doctors involved knew she had infective hepatitis. It was the only possible diagnosis, but they had to decide between hepatitis A, hepatitis B and <Col N="1185" /> what was then known as hepatitis non-A or non-B, and once a negative result was given for hepatitis B, they decided she had hepatitis A. However, even giving that blood was incredibly irresponsible because, as I pointed out in a debate when quoting from a copy of <i>Muir's Pathology</i> written around that time, undergraduates were able to see that it was possible for hepatitis A to be transmitted by blood.  It was a most extraordinary decision and the unfortunate people who were infected have had to live with it since.</P>
    <P>In regard to the excellent reporting by the general practitioners whose patients became jaundiced and their questioning of the association with anti-D, what happened smacks of the experts telling the underlings not to question their betters. I applaud these people who did their utmost to try to get the BTSB to take some notice of the fact there was a connection between anti-D being given in maternity hospitals in Dublin.  It was an appalling example of not taking notice of those working at the coal face.  Much emphasis has been placed on the finding of forms with infective hepatitis written on them.  As the Finlay report says, the expert group's report would not have been changed by knowing these papers existed because it was obvious they existed at some stage. The amount of documentation regarding donor Y not shown to the group was incredible.  It was impossible to work out what happened regarding donor Y.  This was in the recent past.  By 1989 much more was known about hepatitis C.  Yet plasma was taken once again from a patient who was undergoing plasmapheresis.  It is an international rule that blood for blood products should never be taken from such a patient.</P>
    <P>By 1989 the presence of unidentified viruses was also known and hepatitis C had been identified, but we had no reliable test.  This plasma was stored and used in 1992 when tests for hepatitis C were available and the plasma had tested positive four times.  The BTSB was also aware there were some deficiencies in its production of anti-D because it was trying to introduce a solvent detergent stage in the process.  It had been pressing for this possibility in 1990 and 1991 and had investigated the possibility in New York; yet it went ahead with this stage of the process without clearance that the patient had been retested and clear of infection.  It kept using this anti-D until 1995 when testing was widely available for hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>The report states on page 148, paragraph 10, that the main reasons why these wrongful acts were committed were:</P>
    <P>An undue emphasis on the necessity to use plasma from therapeutic plasma exchange patients so as to maintain the supply of plasma for the making of anti-D; an undue and unsupported belief in the probability that the method of production of anti-D would inactivate any virus that existed; and a reluctance to admit the possibility of having been wrong and the possibility <Col N="1186" /> of a failure of the production of anti-D which would be involved in the recall of the product.</P>
    <P>That is a shocking paragraph.</P>
    <P>The report further states on page 154, paragraph 5:</P>
    <P>The documentation concerning the plasma from Donor Y was not available to the expert group, and had it been so they would have been in a position to make a decision which they were not in a position to make, that the infection arising from that was something that should have been avoided and was due to wrongful practices on the part of the BTSB.</P>
    <P>This is most serious because at that stage the BTSB knew its manufacturing process was inadequate because it was trying to introduce another stage.  It also knew the product could be tested.</P>
    <P>I will pass over my own problem, where I was given the impression by the BTSB that the new imported anti-D was FDA approved, except to say I have rarely been so shocked as I was in Washington when I was told the truth by the haematology section of the FDA.  When Miss Moran was giving evidence to the tribunal she was right in saying she thought a telephone call from me to give this information preceded my letter to the Minister.  It is interesting to note that on the day I telephoned Ireland with this good news, going straight from the FDA to the Irish Embassy to make the calls, the Blood Bank wrote to the Minister to say FDA approval was actually only pending.  I am sure that was just a coincidence.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, political accountability in this sad history.  I hope anything I say will not be considered to be party political because all the Ministers for Health I have known have been most honourable people.  However, page 151 of the report states:</P>
    <P>In the period 1975 to 1994, successive Ministers for Health and the Department of Health failed adequately and appropriately to supervise the NDAB in the exercise of its functions concerning the licensing of the manufacture of products by the BTSB and the authorisation of products by the BTSB, in that they failed to provide to the NDAB the appropriate resources for carrying out those functions.</P>
    <P>I used to go to the old NDAB when it was at the top of Harcourt Street The situation then was dire enough.  I hope any solicitor present will excuse me for saying it looked like the crazy solicitors' offices one sees in films with boxes of paper and files everywhere.  I also went to its new headquarters in Adelaide Road.  That place was an incredible fire hazard because there were even files on both sides of the stairs one had to climb to see Dr. Scott.  Mr. Justice Finlay was right to say, when told that she used to work 18 hours a day and did not take her annual leave for 18 years, that that should be a terrible warning to us not to do the same.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> I wonder if any Minister for Health ever went there, apart from opening the premises, to see what was happening.  Did they realise it was impossible to police the pharmaceutical industry or examine new products with the resources which were given to that unit?  The underfunding of that unit was an incredible indictment, which, as far as I know, successive Ministers were constantly told about.</P>
    <P>As one who used the products passed by the NDAB, this chapter makes chilling reading.  It is very sad to see these one page reports.  I have not heard of any legislation regarding this being passed by the Oireachtas.  The Department of Health cannot pretend it was unaware of the problems and worries in the BTSB because it contacted the Department on two noteworthy occasions, first, in regard to ALT testing and, second, regarding the introduction of testing for hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>In 1989 there was a general international appreciation that non A and non B was a serious post transfusion hepatitis risk.  A non specific test, ALT, alamnie amnotransference, was used in some European countries and in the United States to screen blood.  It was reckoned a 40 per cent reduction in the transmission of non-A/non-B hepatitis was achieved in the US, with similar results in other countries.</P>
    <P>In Canada, a group in McMaster University initiated a research programme with the Canadian Red Cross, the liver study units in Mount Sinai Hospital and the University of Manitoba. One group of patients was given blood which was ALT tested and the other non-ALT tested blood. Canada was not generally screening blood with the ALT test at that time.  It reduced the post-transfusion rate by 40 per cent; but when these patients were subsequently tested when hepatitis C testing became available it was found that the hepatitis C infection rate had been reduced by 70 per cent.  Mr. Justice Finlay did not feel the Department of Health had been remiss in failing to introduce ALT testing, but I wonder if he had access to the article on this in <i>The Lancet,</i> 1995, section 345, pages 21-25.</P>
    <P>The BTSB wrote many times to the Department regarding ALT testing and was supported by leading haematologists from three of Dublin's major haematology departments.  However, it appears home grown advice does not carry much weight in the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>From December 1989 the BTSB sought leave to introduce hepatitis C testing.  In February 1990 it tried again.  The then chief medical officer seems to have been aware of the importance of this but over the year came to the decision that screening in the Republic should not be introduced until it was introduced in the UK.  When that CMO, Dr. Alfie Walsh, left office in August 1990 the new CMO, Dr. Niall Tierney, appears to have decided this was the right thing to do. Everywhere in Europe had introduced testing by the end of 1990 except the UK and Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> There was then a most extraordinary development. The CMO received a letter from the Department of Health in the UK saying it was further delaying testing because of the Gulf War, so we delayed testing too.  How high up in the Department of Health was our reason for delaying testing known?  Did the then Secretary or the then Minister know?  Both are very sensible and responsible men and I would find it hard to believe they would agree to such a plan of action, or rather inaction.  If such a situation arose again would such a serious decision be made without ministerial consultation?  This could happen to any Minister, so it needs to be explained.</P>
    <P>Many cases could have been avoided if screening had been brought in then.  An independent haematologist consultant in the UK, whom I contacted when I was trying to find out if there was any significance in the late introduction of testing, told me it was reckoned 3,000 cases of hepatitis C infection occurred in the UK because of late testing.  We can expect the same proportion of patients here, relative to our population.</P>
    <P>There are probably many cases of which we do not yet know.  It is very important to remember this blood was not just given to old people with serious illnesses &mdash; it is well known that about 50 per cent of people die within two years of receiving a blood transfusion, which is nothing to do with the transfusion &mdash; but also to babies and children.  It is impossible to say how important infections from hepatitis C at that time were in the deaths of ill people who were given infected transfusion.</P>
    <P>If in that period, 1989-91, we had not blindly followed what was happening in the UK we may have been in a better position.  Reading papers from the Department of Health there appears to have been an enormous reliance on what was happening in the UK, although we seceded from the UK a long time ago.  While the UK is closest to us geographically, it would be an idea to look at the smaller Nordic countries when addressing health matters.  They now have the lowest incidence of hepatitis C in Europe.</P>
    <P>At the time in question, the BTSB appears to have been woefully understaffed at the higher level.  There was only one haematologist.  Not only was this a stand alone unit, which is always dangerous because the staff can become isolated, it was being run by one person.  Efforts were made to recruit further staff but this was impossible because of the public service cutbacks.  We must be much more careful not to apply such a blunt instrument to future cutbacks because it allows these situations to arise.</P>
    <P>Dr. Emer Lawlor was not even confirmed in a permanent position.  Furthermore, she had not been appointed to deal with transfusion medicine but to establish a bone marrow register to improve the treatment of leukaemic patients.  We were also trying to deal with an increasingly complex and expanding transplant situation.  These problems were not addressed by the Department of Health.  In addition, the HIV disaster <Col N="1189" /> exploded.  Indeed, at the time, juniors were not even sent to the Department on an emergency basis.</P>
    <P>In view of this, we must consider the extraordinary lack of personnel who could have been useful at that time.  Again, Mrs. Cunningham is described as the chief biochemist.  Over how many was she chief?  There was a terrible shortage of biochemists at that time.</P>
    <P>We must address the fact that, at present, there are only 11 haematologists in the country while it is reckoned that approximately 28 are required for the proper, modern medical staffing of haematology departments.  For example, Dr. Power is still working alone in Cork.  Surely something could be done to appoint a second person there on an emergency basis?</P>
    <P>When the disaster hit, both the BTSB and the Department were reluctant to face the facts.  Dr. Boothman was the Minister's appointee on the board, but she said her role was to give the benefit of her expertise to the board, not to report back to the Minister about problems.  However, she appeared to modify this approach in February 1994.  Could the Minister clarify what his appointees to boards are supposed to do?  Are they supposed to report back to him?</P>
    <P>The Department of Health was again less than helpful when the hepatologists complained that the BTSB was not referring women they considered should have been referred.  It appears senseless for the Department to have sent this letter to the BTSB.  Surely it should have taken a more active role in disputes such as this, especially when the crisis was so serious?  The Department also advised against sending to GPs the letter Dr. Emer Lawlor and Dr. Joan Power wanted to send alerting them to the fact that there had been a second period of contamination from 1992.  Certainly, most of the emphasis in the campaign appeared to be on 1977.</P>
    <P>No money ever repays a person for lost health. However, let us hope that the money given at the compensation tribunal will at least make it possible for those infected to lead a more comfortable life.  Their medical care appears to have been properly organised.  Patients should be told to try not to look on the worst case scenarios because that will not happen to everyone, please God. They should also be told that improvements in treatment are not impossible, indeed they are being discovered all the time.  Looking, as a doctor, at the people involved I say there but for the grace of God go I, and I am sure that the remorse expressed by those involved is real.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has established a tribunal to deal with the problems faced by haemophiliacs regarding hepatitis C and HIV.  It should meet as soon as possible.  Similarly, the recommendations of the Finlay report, which have been accepted, should be speedily implemented.  The first and most important step is to rapidly appoint more haematologists because it will take some time to get the BTSB onto a green site.  The transfusion service and use of blood products can <Col N="1190" /> never be totally risk free, but we must learn from the terrible mistakes which made in these two dreadful episodes which have led to so many people being infected by anti-D, through transfusions and other blood products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Doyle on a thoughtful speech.  I will prioritise my remarks under the headings of victims, blood supply, political responsibility and political reputations.</P>
      <P>The Minister eloquently expressed his sorrow and heartache at the damage inflicted on these 1,600 women.  He apologised on behalf of all in this House.  The chilling account in the Finlay report of what happened to those women makes salutary reading because it links together the responsibility of an agency, a Department and political responsibility.  We do not have a good record for accepting responsibility in some of these areas, and sometimes in all three.  That has been the history of the State.  No amount of money can compensate for what has happened to these women, but it is one way of expressing regret.  They were the victims in this saga.</P>
      <P>We have an immediate responsibility to protect the blood supply.  Whatever about sacking the board, it is not possible to close down the BTSB and the operation of supplying blood products. These products are vital to the survival of men, women and children and any comments about the BTSB must be made against that background. This does not avoid responsibility nor does it evade establishing proper mechanisms and procedures to ensure that the blood products supplied by the BTSB are the best in the world.  To that end, the chief executive of the BTSB, Liam Dunbar, has a primary reputation in his field.  It is accepted by most people that he is the best person to hold that position.  Likewise, the chairman of the BTSB, Joe Holloway is respected on all sides as a senior civil servant who held responsibility as Secretary of a Department for many years.</P>
      <P>Human error cannot be excluded.  Measures can be put in place to prevent that through a series of checks and balances.  It is most important Members ensure that confidence in the blood supply is maintained.  As Mr. Liam Dunbar said recently, millions of units have been supplied over the past two years, saving lives in every accident and emergency department of every hospital in the country, without any mishaps.  He also stated that he believes our blood supply system is one of the best in Europe, if not the world.  The type of confidence which is required should be expressed by all speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of political responsibility has occupied the other House, various radio stations and newspapers.  It has been the subject of ministerial and Opposition statements.  The resignation of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn as the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Health and the emergence of Deputy Cowen as the new spokesperson brought the debate to a new low level.  He insulted in a most wounding way all the victims of this scandal <Col N="1191" /> when he linked it to the collapse of the Fianna Fáil/Labour Government in 1994.  I will deal with the Deputy Cowen school of politics in the context of the role of the current Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, and the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Noonan, if I had to entrust an office of State to a particular person from any party, he would occupy a top spot.  He has proved himself one of the most effective Ministers in this and previous Governments.  I suspect the Deputy Cowen school of politics has never forgiven Deputy Noonan for taking over the Department of Justice and exposing the malpractices and politicisation of that office in a most disgraceful fashion by the previous Fianna Fáil office holder.  The Minister has never been forgiven for that; as far as Deputy Cowen is concerned, that is his crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen made personal, bitter and divisive allegations against Deputy Howlin.  He claimed he was ashamed to share a Cabinet table with him.  However, Deputy Cowen was not ashamed when it emerged that he had shares in a mining company while he was the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  He was not ashamed to allow Deputy Howlin defend him; Deputy Howlin took the view that no personal responsibility should be attached to the then Minister, Deputy Cowen.  However, Deputy Cowen, with the accumulated bile of 1994, could not wait.  He made a number of false allegations and brought this debate to a new low.</P>
    <P>He was joined in that endeavour in the Dáil today by Deputy McDaid, who said: &ldquo;Is it logical for Ministers to claim in post-tribunal interviews that they have been exonerated when the tribunal has been fixed in such a way....&rdquo;  Is Deputy McDaid suggesting that one of the most respected members of the Judiciary would accept a mandate from a Government knowing a tribunal was fixed?  Is that Fianna Fáil's position at this stage?  If so, it is not election fever but politics at its lowest and most base.</P>
    <P>I am proud to have many friends in the Fianna Fáil Party with whom I shared office in the previous Government.  In the main we did a good job together and I have no hesitation in saying that I would include many Fianna Fáil people on my list of those who are fit in every way to hold the highest offices in the State.  However, the performance of some Members, particularly Deputy Cowen recently, leads me to believe that he, had not Deputy Noonan or Deputy Howlin, is unfit for office.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the other House, Deputy Cowen dropped a few octaves and made a number of allegations with which the tribunal dealt. The actions of few Members have been put under such a clear and well defined microscope as the Finlay tribunal and the many senior counsel who posed questions.  The tribunal exonerated the Ministers with regard to some of the charges <Col N="1192" /> made by spokespersons on the other side, specifically Deputy Cowen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I can find another name for him and I am happy to use it if that is in order.  My colleague, the current Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, was judged under a number of headings.  The first was ensuring that no further infection occurred on his watch.  The finding of the tribunal was that from the day Deputy Howlin was informed of the infection of anti-D, nobody has been infected with hepatitis C from anti-D.  Another issue was the question of ensuring that a replacement product free from infection was immediately available.  The tribunal found that, on Deputy Howlin's instructions, a Canadian blood product was specially flown in within 24 hours and circulated to every hospital and accident and emergency centre in this country.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of finding out who was already infected with hepatitis C, the tribunal found that within three days of finding out about the infection, a major national screening programme was put in place.  By the end of the year the programme had screened 56,000 women. Deputy Howlin was criticised for allowing the BTSB to carry out the screening programme. However, Judge Finlay found the only organisation with the expertise to carry out such a procedure was the BTSB.  The other side did not suggest who should have carried it out in the absence of the BTSB.  That was overlooked because the political points were much more important than trying to determine the truth or accepting the truth as determined by the Finlay Tribunal.</P>
      <P>The maintenance of confidence in the BTSB and the blood supply was a responsibility of the then Minister, Deputy Howlin.  The tribunal found that he established the expert group to examine the operation of the BTSB and sent it to outside experts to supervise the operation of the board.  The arrangement of treatment, counselling and help for the victims was another responsibility of the then Minister, Deputy Howlin.  Apart from criticising the delay in putting independent counselling in place &mdash; criticism which Deputy Howlin accepted and he apologised for the delay &mdash; the Finlay report found that treatment facilities, arrangements for <i>ex gratia</i> payments and arrangements for the help provided to the victims was adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the cause of the infection was another responsibility of the then Minister.  The tribunal found that the setting up of the expert group within two weeks of the discovery of the infection was the proper procedure to adopt at that time.  Having reviewed dozens of different actions by the Minister, Judge Finlay found Deputy Howlin's handling of the crisis inadequate <Col N="1193" /> on three points, which have already been acknowledged by the Deputy.  The political charges laid by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Health in the other House have insulted the dignity of the women concerned and done nothing whatsoever to assist in ensuring that procedures in the future and accountability in the past were the focus of the debate.  Two Ministers have been subjected to an unprecedented examination and review of every decision they took between 1994 and 1996.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry quoted page 151 of the tribunal report which relates to the period from 1975 to 1994.  On this occasion I will not name names.  I have no intention of trying to throw a cloak over every Minister for Health since 1975.  It would not assist the situation because every holder of that office exercised due diligence in so far as their responsibilities were concerned.  In their hearts, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are well aware that Deputies Noonan and Howlin are, without taking away from other past and present officeholders, probably two of the most competent people to hold office in the State. However, this is an election year and that is why the debate has sunk to a new low in Irish politics.</P>
    <P>The reality in dealing with a matter such as the hepatitis C crisis is that it behoves us to raise the standard of what we say and to try to address what has been the biggest health scandal in this State.  We all share the responsibility collectively. The behaviour of the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Health in the Dáil has led me and many others to the conclusion I reached this afternoon when I spoke to a very respected political columnist.  He said that the only rationale for the irrationality of Deputy Cowen's attack on Deputy Howlin is that he has never forgiven him for the fall of the Government in 1994.  Deputy Cowen's argument was graphically illustrated when he broke down on television after that Government's collapse. That bile was a long time coming.  He has done himself, his party and the women of Ireland no service by making this the lowest political debate in recent times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Pre-election frenzy can explain many things but not the preceding contribution.  I found it absolutely astonishing, because I have the utmost respect for Senator Magner.  He sits in the same ranks as a leader who over the years elevated personal abuse and vituperative and slanderous allegations to an art form.  I was in the Dáil when politicians who are not above blame were regularly referred to by Senator Magner's party leader as the cancer in Irish politics, among other things.  It is difficult to keep my peace while Senator Magner complains about people treating his party to the same coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with many of Senator Magner's comments. This is the worst health scandal the State has ever seen.  In France, those responsible for that country's blood scandal went to jail.  Whatever happens here and however deserving the culprits may be, they will not spend any time cooling <Col N="1194" /> their heels where they rightly deserve to be. We will get involved in internal political savaging and not try to learn about the problems.  The problems illustrated in this case are a combination of political incompetence and maladministration of the most criminal type.  That is what we should be discussing.</P>
    <P>This scandal is rightly described as the worst debacle in the history of the State.  It has been made much worse by the manner of its handling by those with political responsibility for dealing with it.  I do not know by what standard one judges a Minister &mdash; and the current Minister for Health is a competent, extraordinarily intelligent and adroit man &mdash; but I remember his reprehensible lapse in the Dáil, which was a backward hand to the women affected by this and to their families.  That does not suggest compassion to me, but arrogance and an unwillingness to apologise until one is put to the wall.</P>
    <P>Openness, honesty or compassion were singularly lacking in the manner in which this scandal was handled in its earliest days.  Instead of those qualities, this Government responded initially with secrecy, mendacity of the most despicable order and a lack of compassion that could only be described as breathtaking.  The instance in the Dáil, when the Minister insulted every woman infected by this horrific disease, was just an example of a breathtaking lack of compassion.  To then suggest that the rhetorical excesses pursued by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Health can somehow be regarded as blame in this issue is nonsense.  We should be discussing the issue before us and not the rhetoric in another House.</P>
    <P>Ministerial energy and administrative ingenuity have not been used to seek a remedy for the great ill in this case.  They have been used to seek scapegoats, as we have seen just now.  A search for scapegoats and excuses is all we have as a response from the current Government to this crisis.  We saw it in the Minister's contribution, and, regrettably, in my friend Senator Magner's contribution.  I regard him as a friend and not just as a competent politician but as a politician who normally looks at the issue.  He normally addresses the ball rather than the player, but on this occasion we must be very close to an election because everybody has lost their senses.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary culpability in this matter was graphically illustrated when the Minister, Deputy Howlin's professional spin doctor, who is a GP, was caught by the media whispering into his State funded cellphone to tell Deputy Howlin that he had not been hung out to dry by an honest and decent civil servant who had given his views to Mr. Justice Finlay.  That says everything, because all that mattered to Deputy Howlin or his private Svengali was not the horror that faced us; the real concern to the Minister and his Svengali was his political reputation and saving face.  It was an almost Chinese fixation among Ministers.</P>
    <P>The cost of State failures and destroyed private lives did not feature in that discussion.  Yesterday on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, let <Col N="1195" /> the cat out of the bag on one issue.  It is the matter of the way the State, as a corporate entity rather than through one Minister, has responded collectively to this matter.  Deputy Howlin, in a moment of uncharacteristic candour, raised the most serious questions about the State's response to this scandal.  The position he and his colleagues have adopted on this issue is totally untenable and wrong.  To go further, it is at variance with the truth for a Minister to suggest that the strategy adopted by the BTSB in court actions, and particularly in the McCole case, had nothing to do with the State.  It went far beyond executive responsibility.  That strategy was hatched at the top and Deputy Howlin made that very clear on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; yesterday.</P>
    <P>In the interview, he disclosed, in relation to the despicable conduct of the State in the handling of the McCole case, that the legal strategy was decided by Government but earlier the Minister for Health stated that it was decided by some nameless individual in the BTSB.  However, the Minister for the Environment admitted that it was decided by the Government.  I do not know how this happened. While I differ with the respective Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, I do not suggest that they lack humanity.  I cannot understand what collective madness marched the State down this particular route.  Following the initial coverup, scandal and breakdown, the matter which must be subject to the most rigorous condemnation is the way the State decided to handle this issue.  Yesterday the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, stated that the legal strategy was decided by Government.  When asked if he took the decision, he stated that he did not because the Government makes the decisions as to how these things happen.</P>
    <P>We are discussing this Government, not one of its predecessors or the current Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Health and whether he is a good or bad orator or was upset by what occurred in 1994.  Everyone was upset by events in 1994.  The issue at stake is the way the State decided to respond to this case.  I cannot understand the lack of compassion displayed by certain people.  How could Ministers of any political persuasion decide to handle the McCole case in the way it was handled, knowing what they knew?  In his radio interview the Minister for the Environment admitted that he accepts this did not suit the McCole family and they were correct to take the route they did. That must be the understatement of the year.</P>
    <P>The interview in question did not include an apology and while one was made today by the Minister for Health it is somewhat late.  The Minister for the Environment's radio interview explains why the fifth issue in the McCole case was excluded from the terms of reference of the hepatitis C tribunal.  The previous speaker referred to comments made by Deputy McDaid in the Dáil.  Deputy McDaid inquired why the <Col N="1196" /> fifth issue raised in the McCole case was excluded from the tribunal's terms of reference and why were the other four issues were included.  The only honest conclusion I can reach is that it was not politically expedient for that matter to be the subject of Mr. Justice Finlay's forensic examination. In that context, it must be clearly stated that the Finlay report is excellent.</P>
    <P>In the Minister for the Environment's contribution yesterday, we have been given the first public admission by any Minister that the Government was collectively responsible for the strategy adopted in the McCole case.  This admission is a damning indictment of the Government from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste down.  To his discredit, he must have known that the cat was out of the bag and the Minister for Health tried to maintain the fiction that the Government was not involved in forming the legal strategy which was so insensitively pursued against a defenceless and dying woman.  In the most recent Dáil debates and during his earlier contribution in this House, the Minister tried to shift responsibility for the debacle to the shoulders of others.</P>
    <P>The decision regarding the handling of the McCole case was a political one.  There is no gainsaying that.  We suspected this from the outset but the proof was provided yesterday by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.  It is my view that if said Minister is the compassionate and caring person Senator Magner suggests, he would consider packing his bags and leaving office because he was Minister for Health at the time these events occurred.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the entire political debate on this issue is merely heated rhetoric and will do nothing for the lives of the 1,600 people infected with hepatitis C.  Money alone will not address the great injustice visited upon them but, as Senator Henry stated, it will help make their lives more comfortable.  The greatest debt we owe those 1,600 people and ourselves is the truth.</P>
    <P>We must understand where the breakdowns occurred in addition to coming to terms with the pathological obsession in Irish public life to defend one's back and the corrosiveness of official secrecy.  Someone in the Department of Health was aware of what was taking place during the period in question.  There must be something fundamentally wrong with the way the State is governed that so many Ministers, all of whom are good and decent people, could have been kept so abusively in the dark.  When one reads the report there is a nagging doubt about the respect some public service bodies have for democracy and the people.  The staff of such bodies are not invaders from another planet.  Those who are responsible for this matter and who knew that what they were doing was wrong are Irish public servants in whom a major amount of trust was invested.  We trusted them with the lives of the people.  At the outset I stated that in a similar scandal in France, the ramifications of which were less serious <Col N="1197" /> because it was focused over a shorter period, people spent time in prison.  Apparently, that will not be the case in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In last weekend's <i>Sunday Business Post,</i> an unnamed spokesperson stated that the Government had been forced into granting aggravated damages.  I hope and believe that is not the view of members of the Government parties who are at least as plentiful in compassion as are members of my party.  However, I do not suggest that Fianna Fáil has any monopoly in that regard.  It is sad that it took much haranguing and badgering during the past two and a half years before the Minister for Health could accept that fact.  This again indicates that something is wrong and rotten in the way we do our business.  I believe the Minister's instincts would have been as generous as mine in respect of this matter but why do politicians always find themselves cast in the role of defending the indefensible?  The victims of this scandal are entitled to the best the State can do for them because it has done the worst it can do to them.</P>
    <P>The magnitude of the U-turn on the statutory tribunal is considerable because not so long ago the Minister for Health was completely against such a tribunal.  Nonetheless, I welcome that turnabout because it is good that a politician can listen to the arguments put forward and reverse his decision, even belatedly, from negative to positive.  I do not suggest that he is doing so for other than the best of motives.  However, it is extraordinary that this debate has focused on the contributions of a number of spokespersons in the Lower House rather than on the important issues.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Health referred to annual inspections of the BTSB.  As a result of this scandal, the findings of inspections of any of the bodies involved in this matter should be published as early as possible.  I am sure the Minister will move in that direction and, if he has not already done so, I ask him to make a clear commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>We are discussing not only the largest scandal to befall the State but also one of the saddest matters with which it has been obliged to deal. An extraordinary thing occurred at one of my clinics yesterday &mdash; I will investigate the facts before communicating with the Minister &mdash; when a man informed me that he is a hepatitis C victim. He stated he had discovered this by accident when the doctor examining him in hospital went to wash his hands and left the man's file open on his desk.  I do not know the exact details and facts of the case but I will communicate with the Minister about it.</P>
    <P>This matter returns to a point I raised in the past on which I had intended to focus primarily today.  Within the public service there is a pathological obsession with secrecy.  There is also an unhealthy attitude and absolute view among those employed as public sector administrators in State-sponsored bodies, semi-State bodies and <Col N="1198" /> the Civil Service that they have an enormous monopoly on wisdom.  So many disastrous mistakes have been made in public administration that it is time we recognised the fallibility of those institutions.  I winced when I saw on television last week a senior medical personage, associated until recently with the BTSB &mdash; it would not be fair to name him &mdash; haranguing politicians for debating this issue and suggesting that in so doing we were undermining confidence in the board.  As the Minister said, the BTSB is our only source of blood.  We are not suggesting that the public should lack confidence in that institution, we are highlighting the deficiencies which existed in the past and the urgent need to bridge the gulf between the board and the public.</P>
    <P>I hope we can learn from this case.  I wish we could walk away from political recrimination &mdash; I have engaged in it today because if one side calls the other a name, it will respond.  This is stupid and makes no sense.  What we should do is learn the lessons and ensure no more horrors will be visited upon us.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  When the report was published almost two weeks ago I put myself in the shoes of the victims who had contracted hepatitis C as a result of the negligence of a State board and in that context I found the report's language measured and bland.  It used the words &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;, &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo;, &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; to describe what everyone regards as the greatest health scandal in the history of the State.  If I had been a victim I would have been angry at the report's descriptions of the actions of the major players in the BTSB and the Government.  The criminal negligence which led to the catastrophe was described by the judge as resulting from &ldquo;undue emphasis... an undue and unsupported belief... and the reluctance to admit the possibility of having been wrong&rdquo;. After all the shocking evidence we heard at the tribunal I expected the report to be stronger.  Perhaps this is the language of judges when dealing with the facts before them, but considering the appalling tragedy which had taken place one had expected something different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Government has at last acceded to the demand for a statutory tribunal, whose terms of reference were published last Friday week.  The motion called on the Dáil to commend the Government's acceptance of the recommendations and to commend the Minister for Health for arranging the expeditious publication of the report.  Since then, due to the Opposition's action in amending the motion and the interventions of a number of its own Members, the Government was forced to accept that a statutory tribunal was needed.  As with everything which has been achieved since the scandal first broke over three years ago, it has had to be dragged from the Government and comes about as a result of the <Col N="1199" /> courage of the women of Positive Action, particularly the late Brigid McCole.</P>
    <P>When this first emerged none of us expected it to have the consequences which have since unfolded.  It was seen by the Government as a problem which could be dealt with as quickly as possible.  The women would be herded into a compensation tribunal, paid off and that would be the end of the matter.  We would never have heard the truth about what happened but for the courage of these women.  It has been a long and hard battle, with all the might of the State pitched against them.  Health provisions were put in place, but it took a long time to get exactly what the women wanted.</P>
    <P>From the beginning they demanded a statutory compensation tribunal; they were told they could have everything else they wanted but it could not be statute based.  They were told that if applications for compensation were not received by last June they would not have an opportunity to go before the tribunal.  That closing date was set in order to frighten the women and force them into the tribunal.  If they did not follow that path they, like Brigid McCole, would be hounded by the State to the Supreme Court and pursued for costs if they did not win.  It is totally unacceptable that this was done to women who contracted a life threatening disease due to the criminal negligence of a State board.  If this had happened in any other country we would have been shocked, but it happened here with the compliance of our Government.</P>
    <P>No one has accepted responsibility for this shocking tragedy.  These appalling and unforgivable breaches of duty and trust have cost some lives, shortened others and brought the shadow of tragedy to almost 2,000 families throughout Ireland; but only the victims have paid the price for this appalling scandal.  No one has been brought to court except Brigid McCole, who was mercilessly bullied by the State into revealing her identity when all she wanted was the dignity of privacy in taking her case.  No penalty has been exacted from those who, through their actions and inaction, decisions and indecision, set the stage for this tragedy.  Some of them left office with a golden handshake, other received cosy retirement deals.  Some were moved sideways within the structures of the State, holding onto their salaried positions and retaining their pension rights.</P>
    <P>We should contrast the treatment of those responsible for the Irish infections with that of the French officials responsible for contaminating their blood supply with AIDS, who ended up in jail.  We have a culture whereby those in whom we place our trust and who hold the highest public offices are absolved from full responsibility for their actions.  In every major scandal to date, those responsible have walked away.  At a time when we are discussing zero tolerance of crime it is ironic that there is 100 per cent tolerance of <Col N="1200" /> gross negligence, malpractice and worse among those who hold high office.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government has at last conceded the women's demands for a statutory tribunal, but it has taken over three years for this to happen. After the publication of the Finlay Tribunal report I would have expected more generosity and a greater willingness to acknowledge what happened and the State's responsibility in that regard.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers said, many Ministers for Health were in office between 1975 and 1994 and it is unfair to blame the two most recent Ministers for this tragedy.  I do not blame any Minister for Health for the infection of the victims with hepatitis C, but the actions of Ministers since the issue came into the open must be subject to scrutiny. My main criticisms of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, relate to the hounding of the late Brigid McCole through the courts and the threat made to the other women that if they did not take part in the compensation tribunal they would be pursued by the full might of the State.  That is totally unacceptable.  No member of the public elects politicians to Dáil Éireann to act in such a manner on his or her behalf.  No one would insist that the State should force Brigid McCole to disclose her identity in court.  That is not the way Ministers should behave.  Perhaps they believed it was their function to defend the institutions of the State rather than the people.  If that was their interpretation they were wrong.  I do not believe we have received an adequate explanation from the Minister for Health why the full rigours of the State were employed in pursuing the late Mrs. McCole.  She was within hours of her death when she was offered a settlement and an apology from the BTSB.  Even at that stage she was told that if she refused it she would pursued to the Supreme Court and costs against her would be sought if her action failed.  I hold the Minister responsible for the actions taken in this case.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, was not responsible for the infection of the victims of hepatitis C but he had a duty to disclose that there was a second source of infection when the scandal first came to light.  I have spoken to women who contracted hepatitis C as a result of the second infection in the early 1990s. They were treated in a shocking fashion by the BTSB.  It should never have happened.  Had it been disclosed at the beginning that there was a second source of infection it would not have happened. The Minister for Health is the person with ultimate responsibility for health matters and for the agencies under his or her control.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has a responsibility in this regard and he owes us an explanation.</P>
    <P>While examining my files on this issue I came across a copy of a letter which I raised in the House on the first occasion the hepatitis C scandal was discussed.  The letter was sent on 21 February 1994 by the BTSB to all GPs with regard to the discovery of anti-D being infected with <Col N="1201" /> hepatitis C.  It is extraordinary to compare what was known then with what we know now and how the scandal has unfolded.  It states:</P>
    <P>Dear Doctor,</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board...is carrying out a lookback study of Hepatitis. Arising from a recent BTSB study, we have reason to believe Rh Negative women who received Anti-D Immunoglobulin in 1977 may have been exposed to the Hepatitis C virus.  A small number of recipients may have contracted the virus, although they may have continued to feel perfectly well after receiving Anti-D.  We know that there is a risk of chronic asymptomatic carriage of this virus which may eventually cause significant liver disease. However, recent reports support intervention and therapy in the pre-symptomatic phase.</P>
    <P>It is important therefore that Rh D Negative women who received Anti-D in 1977 are afforded a screening test for Hepatitis C. Women who received Anti-D at other times may also be tested.  The BTSB is committed to contacting these women with a view to offering such testing at designated clinic locations.  A national campaign is being launched on Tuesday 22 February.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that three years later the BTSB still has not seen fit to contact all the people they know have been exposed to suspect batches of anti-D or batches which it knows were contaminated. The public would be astonished to know that the BTSB did not make direct contact with each woman who had been treated with the batches involved as soon as it became aware of the contamination.</P>
    <P>From the beginning the BTSB's primary duty ought to have been to the women who were infected.  This was not the case.  The women have faced an uphill struggle every step of the way in trying to get information.  Making direct contact with every woman exposed to the contamination ought to have been the first step in the BTSB's response to the crisis.  It said it would do so in February 1994 yet it still has not done so.  I would have thought that, on assuming office with a brief to clean up the BTSB, its new management ought to have contacted each potential victim directly and without delay.  It has failed to do this.  This indicates a lack of awareness of the dreadful fate which hepatitis C has visited on the infected women and their families.  Until the BTSB contacts everyone treated with infected batches and tests them accordingly we will not know the full extent of the infection.</P>
    <P>Some people are discovering only now that they have been infected.  As late as last week I was contacted by the husband of a woman in my constituency who was tested for hepatitis C only recently and has been found positive for antibodies and virus.  She assumed that she would <Col N="1202" /> have been notified by the BTSB that she had been exposed to a contaminated batch.  When she approached the BTSB she found out that it knew the batch numbers and that she had been exposed to it but it had not contacted her.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the BTSB is proactive in its look-back programme and that it accepts its duty to inform every woman who has had contact with a suspect or an infected batch.  It is important from a woman's health perspective and what an individual decides to do once contacted is her decision.  However, the BTSB has a duty to inform her.</P>
    <P>I was contacted about the case of a former constituent of mine who died in January 1990 after a liver transplant.  She was 38 years of age and she left behind a husband and six children, the youngest was just three years old at the time.  She had a normal lifestyle but she became unwell gradually over a long period, starting with feeling tired and run down and culminating in liver failure in late 1989.  She suffered symptoms during several years which we now know to be consistent with hepatitis C infection.  She became unwell in 1987 and her husband had to take so much time off work to care for her and their children that he was forced to give up his job.  Since then her husband's only source of income on which to raise his six children has been social welfare benefits.  Their lifestyle has altered radically and they must forego many of life's necessities, never mind luxuries, in order to survive.</P>
    <P>This woman attended her doctor and her local general hospital over the years where she was treated for various ailments.  In September 1989 she became severely jaundiced and was admitted to the local general hospital.  She tested negative for hepatitis A and B.  She was detained in hospital for a month and then discharged.  She was readmitted on 27 December 1989 with a recurrence of jaundice.  She was transferred to St. Vincent's Hospital on 28 December 1989 and the referring consultant queried hepatitis C as a possible cause of her liver disease.</P>
    <P>The doctors in St. Vincent's Hospital spoke to her husband about her lifestyle and asked if she had received blood transfusions.  Her husband indicated that she had received transfusions during the birth of her children.  At that stage they decided to perform a liver transplant if a suitable organ became available.  The liver transplant operation took place on 8 January 1990 but two days later she died but the family has since discovered that she had a positive test for hepatitis C carried out on 4 January 1990 prior to her death.  The family was not informed of this at the time.  Her husband and children have had to suffer the stress and trauma of wondering if they have contracted hepatitis C since the hepatitis C scandal came to light in 1994.  There was no counselling or support for the family.  Their bereavement was compounded by the lack of information, understanding and support, be it moral, emotional, physical, psychological or financial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> The family asked me to raise this case because it is concerned that people who have contracted hepatitis C through blood transfusions are being dealt with in a different way from the women who contracted hepatitis C from anti-D.  The family was astounded that it was told by Mr. Dunbar of the BTSB that if the cases of people who are deceased came to light in the look-back programme it was not the BTSB's policy to notify their families.  The validity of the Department of Health allowing the Blood Transfusion Service Board to conduct a look-back programme for the board must be questioned.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take account of cases where the victim has died and the difficulty relatives have in pursuing their case.  One difficulty they have is the testing that is now available but which was not available in 1990.  The other difficulty is the limit of compensation that can be awarded.  Families such as the one about whom I have spoken are only entitled to £7,500 in compensation. This is extraordinary considering all that has happened to them and what they have had to go through since the death of their mother. The Minister should reassess the work of the compensation tribunal to ensure that families are not insulted by paltry compensation sums of £7,500.  The tribunal should have power to grant higher amounts than the courts in these special circumstances.  No amount can sufficiently compensate the family.  In dealing with the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society and the issue of HIV infection in the context of another tribunal, the Minister should ensure that outstanding issues relating to infection with hepatitis C not covered in the Finlay tribunal are addressed. Otherwise, the victims will never get justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Tribunals have had a bad press, often with good reason.  The Finlay tribunal, however, has demonstrated that a tribunal can work quickly and produce a cogent report outlining all the salient facts and making practical recommendations.  We owe Mr. Justice Finlay a debt of gratitude for the sensitive yet probing manner in which he conducted the inquiry into the worst public health scandal, and perhaps the worst scandal ever, in the State.</P>
      <P>The hepatitis C scandal has provided ammunition for parties on all sides of the Oireachtas to score party political points.  To watch the debate in the Dáil yesterday one would have thought politicians rather than ordinary citizens were primarily affected.  There is a danger that the human dimension will be lost sight of in the debate.  Sixteen hundred women, citizens who depended on the State to ensure a safe blood supply, have been infected with a medical time bomb.  It has already claimed one victim, Mrs. Brigid McCole.  Other victims fear that they may be living on borrowed time, whether measured in months, years or decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal report outlines what happened.  It paints a picture of almost unbelievable incompetence <Col N="1204" /> and sloppiness over many years.  To make matters worse we heard last week that a woman infected with hepatitis C was requested by the BTSB to give blood.  This cannot be glossed over nor can the appalling mistakes which were made be airbrushed out of history.  Lessons must be learned and have been learned.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Finlay's recommendations when implemented, together with the steps already taken by the Government, will guarantee the safety of the blood supply and ensure that it is operated to the highest standards dictated by current medical knowledge.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to place the compensation tribunal, chaired by Mr. Justice Egan, on a statutory basis and to reappraise and amend the scheme to allow victims receive additional special damages.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that those who have gone before the tribunal, or are currently before the tribunal, will benefit retrospectively from any changes.  The course outlined by the Minister is the only proper response to the grave situation.</P>
    <P>Financial compensation will help alleviate the material problems of the women and their families and provide them with peace of mind for the future.  However, no amount of money can compensate these women for the physical, mental and emotional suffering which they have endured and continue to endure.</P>
    <P>The twin challenges facing us are to ensure the future safety of the blood supply and, equally important, to enhance public confidence in that supply.  Our voluntary blood supply is a great strength.  However, the revelations surrounding the present scandal combined with irresponsible statements from some politicians have undermined confidence among donors and recipients.  I was especially concerned to read a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> indicating that an increasing number of patients are reluctant to receive blood or blood products even when they are vital to treatment. Such concerns are unwarranted in view of the measures taken by the Government to ensure the safety of the blood supply.  I appeal to those in need of blood or blood products to rely solely on the advice of medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>Last week Senator Henry reminded us that, during the 1960s, the primary cause of death among women of child bearing age was haemorrhage. Blood transfusions prevent that tragedy. We must ensure that we do not turn the clock back in expressing our outrage at what has been done to the women infected by hepatitis C.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Senators for their contributions and wish to refer to a number of issues raised over the past week and in the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my speech I referred to the recent incident in the BTSB involving the contacting of a victim infected with hepatitis C with a view to obtaining a blood donation.  I wish to state again that mistakes such as these, even when there is no risk to the blood supply, are unacceptable.  The BTSB <Col N="1205" /> has a statutory obligation to ensure an adequate supply of blood.  When a situation arises where there is a shortage of blood or a particular blood group is needed urgently, a comprehensive list of all donors containing relevant information, including their donor status, is produced for the donor organising department.  This list is used by the clerical staff to make telephone contact with the donors in the local clinic area to boost clinic attendance.  Such a list was produced by the BTSB for the evening of 3 December 1996 for the local clinic because the BTSB needed to increase donations.  The clerical officer who telephoned this donor who had been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C did not note the deferral information on the list.  During the telephone call the error was identified and the clerical officer apologised to the donor.  The following day, 4 December, the donor's husband telephoned the BTSB to complain about the matter.  It was investigated by one of the doctors on the staff and the donor's husband was telephoned on 6 December.  An explanation for the error and an apology was given. However, the donor's husband again telephoned on 11 March 1997 requesting a written explanation of the incident.  The BTSB responded in writing on 21 March 1997 expressing regret to the family.</P>
    <P>Arising from this incident, the staff in the BTSB have been urged yet again to be extra vigilant when checking lists so that all relevant donor history is noted.  Likewise, as a result of the meeting which I had with the chairman and chief executive officer of the BTSB last week, that organisation is implementing necessary changes to their computer system.  When I gave this explanation previously, persons asked me why donors who had been deferred were listed at all.  The reason is that donors who have been previously refused at blood clinics continue to turn up.  The BTSB has examples of people who have been screened out because they were HIV positive returning to clinics and offering blood.  The way in which the controls operate are that those who are eligible to give donations are listed, those who are deferred indefinitely are listed and those who, because of colds, flus or whatever were deferred for three to six months are also listed.  It is a failsafe mechanism to ensure that somebody whose status is deferred and who turns up to give blood has their blood refused at that point.  Any mistake such as this is unacceptable.  The BTSB will once again review its systems but there was no danger at any point that infected blood would get into the blood supply arising from this incident.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the donor selection procedure currently operating in the BTSB and whether these procedures ensure public safety and confidence.  As a result of the incident last week, the general public are understandably concerned about the safety of the blood supply.  I reiterate that there was never any risk to the safety of the blood supply arising from this incident.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> The number of donations with which the BTSB is dealing is very big.  Approximately 170,000 blood donations are collected annually by it. There are well defined steps taken by the BTSB in relation to donor selection and donor eligibility. As Senators are aware, blood donations in Ireland are on a voluntary, non-remunerated basis.  Only donors in good health are accepted and the decision as to whether a potential donor is suitable rests with the medical officer who evaluates the donor on the day of donation.  The donor questionnaire must be satisfactorily completed after the donor has read and fully understood the special notice concerning transmissible diseases.  Where there is a doubt about the suitability of a donor, the donation is not accepted.</P>
    <P>The first step in ensuring that all those receiving blood are not put at risk at any time is to take maximum care when selecting persons who donate blood voluntarily.  The guidelines for donor selection by the BTSB medical officers are revised regularly in line with the UK National Blood Authority Guidelines for medical assessment of donors and the Council of Europe guide for preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components and blood collection.  These guidelines have a dual objective &mdash; to protect the recipient from any ill effect through transmission of disease by blood transfusion and, secondly, to protect the volunteer donor from any harm to his or her health.  I am assured that, in applying these guidelines, the BTSB is among the most stringent transfusion centres in the world, a fact that is attested to by all objective commentators internationally. I am further assured that the standard of testing which the BTSB now applies to the testing of blood donations is fully in line with best practice in Europe.  The average annual deferral rates of donors attending clinics is between 13 and 15 per cent which is among the highest in the world.</P>
    <P>I now turn to an issue which has arisen since the publication of the report of the tribunal of inquiry.  It relates to 74 anti-D recipients from 1977 who had an episode of jaundice.  In Appendix G of the tribunal of inquiry report it is stated that:</P>
    <P>We [the BTSB] are thus aware of 74 recipients of 1977 anti-D who had an episode of jaundice at that time which is most likely to be related to exposure to hepatitis C.  As these persons do not show any reaction on laboratory tests for hepatitis C an epidemiology study is planned to investigate transient infection which has subsequently cleared.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has confirmed that the 74 women referred to in the tribunal's report have all been contacted and tested and are all antibody negative. The epidemeiology study in relation to transient hepatitis C infection will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The issue has been raised as to whether a national epidemiology study to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C in the population at large should be undertaken.  This would be a <Col N="1207" /> major logistical and organisational undertaking. Given that the majority of the general population has no known risk factor for hepatitis C infection, that there is no constructive intervention such as vaccination which can be used and that there exists no satisfactory cure for hepatitis C, the ultimate value of the information produced by a national survey would be limited.</P>
    <P>Apart also from those who contracted hepatitis C through infected blood or blood products and apart from other groups with well know risk factors, I am reliably informed there is no evidence to suggest that the prevalence of hepatitis C in this country is any higher than in other comparable countries.  Accordingly, there are no proposals at present to conduct a national survey to establish the prevalence of hepatitis C in the population as a whole.  It is an issue which requires further examination, however, and I propose to seek the advice of the statutory consultative council on hepatitis C which I established last November and which recently held its first meeting. The remit of the consultative council includes the monitoring of matters relating to research and has a broad spectrum of expertise including nominees of the four main representative groups, namely, Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry commented on the delay in introducing the tests in 1991.  Apart from what is in the report, I cannot shed any further light on that.  I know it is an issue which has concerned Senator Henry for some time and it is dealt with comprehensively in the report.  We must learn from incidents such as this.  The practice which has obtained in this country for so long in simply following UK procedures and practices must be discontinued.  We must be in a position, and must have the resources, to ensure that independent decisions are made.  At the time, there was a great reliance on what was happening in the UK because neither the Department nor the BTSB had the critical mass of medical expertise which would be necessary to make a series of independent decisions in respect of medical matters.</P>
    <P>The decision to transfer Pelican House to the campus of St. James's Hospital will rectify that to a large degree.  As Senator Henry would know better than anybody here, if professionals, particularly medical professionals, are isolated for a significant period of time and have to work far removed from medical colleagues with similar expertise, they frequently become rusty, to put it in lay terms.  It is necessary to have a critical mass of persons, not only those working in the area of the blood transfusion service but also haematologists, working in a major acute hospital where the delivery of blood by way of transfusion is part of their day to day work.  It is the interplay of the professional expertise between the two on the campus of a major acute hospital which will give us the critical mass to enable the BTSB in future to advise the Department of Health when particular <Col N="1208" /> decisions should be taken in respect of matters which are pertinent to the blood supply.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed that all recipients of potentially infectious blood and blood products should be traced.  The BTSB has a substantial duty of care to trace each and every one of these recipients.  To fully comply with this duty an experienced and professional team has been put in place with a view to achieving the objective of the targeted look-back programme.  This dedicated team comprises medical, nursing, clerical and administrative support.</P>
    <P>The <i>modus operandi</i> of the targeted look-back programme is to identify the infected issues and to trace the issue to a named recipient; the person is then located and arrangements for testing are made in as sensitive a manner as possible.  Extensive efforts are being made to trace all the issues of blood and to locate the named recipients.</P>
    <P>Specific concerns have been expressed as to why the BTSB has not contacted persons whom they know received potentially infectious blood or blood products.  In a number of cases, the BTSB only has the name of recipients and no other information.  In other cases, the name and the date of birth is known and the person's GP has been contacted but no current addresses are available.  I reiterate that every conceivable effort is being made to first identify and then locate such recipients.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that a number of persons who received anti-D in 1977 have not come forward for screening.  In 1977 and 1978, a total of 17,214 vials of anti-D made from plasma, which included that of patient X, were issued.  Of these 4,062 vials of anti-D were issued from the 12 batches which were prepared after patient X became jaundiced.  The Finlay report has summarised various efforts in relation to the targeted tracing of those persons who have received these infected vials.</P>
    <P>At the request of the tribunal of inquiry the medical consultants at the BTSB prepared a document which is summarised in Chapter 5 of the tribunal's report and reproduced in full at Appendix G.  In relation to recipients of infected 1977 anti-D, the document states: &ldquo;we have previously directly invited known recipients of infected 1977 Anti-D for Hepatitis screening. However, a number of recipients have not yet presented for testing and we [the BTSB] are therefore following this up with individual recipients and hospitals with specific attention to recipients of PCR positive batches&rdquo;.  As I said earlier, all recipients of potentially infected blood products are, as far as possible, being traced under the targeted look-back programme.</P>
    <P>Finally, to ensure that no one escapes the net and to ensure that all recipients of blood transfusion and blood products are given the option of being tested for hepatitis C, as I have already mentioned, I announced the national optional testing programme on 12 September 1995.  Testing is free of charge to all and has been regularly advertised in the national media.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> Former Chief Justice Finlay has produced a report of great clarity and candour; it does not shirk any of the hard questions posed in the terms of reference, and it has thrown clear light and imposed order on medical, administrative and legal controversies which were previously shrouded in mystery and confusion.</P>
    <P>Before I thank the generality of Senators, I thank, again, Senator Henry for bringing to the attention of the then Minister for Health the fact that the replacement anti-D product was not then licensed by the FDA.  Senator Henry had made inquiries in relation to this matter and her interest and diligence in this and other matters should be commended by all of us.</P>
    <P>I welcome unreservedly the report of former Chief Justice Finlay.  I hope that the acceptance of the motion by this House will mark a significant step forward in dealing with these tragic events.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Government and the Leader of the House for allowing the Bill to be taken in Government time.  I hope it represents a consensus among all parties in this House.  During the debate many useful suggestions will be made to strengthen the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a Shannon River Council to combat the growing level of pollution and degradation of the Shannon waters, particularly in Lough Derg.  The quality of the <Col N="1210" /> water on the Shannon and especially in the major inlets and bays on Lough Derg, has deteriorated in recent years due to pollution and enrichment from a wide variety of sources, including untreated sewage, agricultural effluent, industrial and chemical pollution, domestic detergents, peat silt and Shannon cruisers.</P>
    <P>The Shannon is the most magnificent waterway in Ireland from its source at the Shannon Pot to its outlet at Loop Head.  Since time immemorial it has been a haven of relaxation and recreation for anglers, boatmen, swimmers, gamesmen, archaeologists, school outings and family picnics along the length of its 214 miles.  It is part of our history and culture, and the monastic establishments from Holy Island to Clonmacnoise bear witness to the vital role the waterway played in the development and enhancement of our Celtic civilisation over the years.</P>
    <P>It is totally unacceptable that in the space of the last 20 years approximately the nature and quality of the Shannon and its waters have been utterly degraded so that urgent and effective action is now called for to save them from total destruction.</P>
    <P>Voluntary bodies along the Shannon and Lough Derg &mdash; I mention Lough Derg because I am more familiar with it, for obvious reasons &mdash; such as SOLD &mdash; the Save Our Lough Derg group &mdash; Greenpeace, An Taisce, angling, boating and swimming clubs as well as all kinds of community organisations, have been protesting for years against water pollution of the river.  I pay tribute to those organisations for the assistance they have given Senator Daly and myself in the preparation of this Bill and for their readiness to serve as statutory watchdogs and protectors of the Shannon River and its wildlife habitats.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives a statutory function for the first time, through membership of the proposed Shannon River Council, to all voluntary bodies, agencies and local authority members connected with the protection, conservation, water management and control of pollution in the Shannon River catchment.  That includes not just the river basin itself but the tributaries from the Shannon Pot to its estuary.  The council proposed in the Bill shall be independent in the exercise of its functions and will be empowered to propose policies and priorities for the enhancement of the water quality of the Shannon River and its catchment basin as well as for the protection and enhancement of the environment and all natural habitats of bird life and fish life in the catchment.  I have personally witnessed the degradation of bird life along the Shannon and particularly in Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill proposes the establishment of the Shannon River Council as a body corporate with perpetual succession.  This job will require constant monitoring and control for a long number of years.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the functions of the council which shall, <i>inter alia</i>, propose policies and priorities for the enhancement of water quality on the Shannon River and shall co-ordinate the activities <Col N="1211" /> of public authorities and other organisations in the promotion of the council's functions.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the Bill is limited in its immediate scope and function.  The ideal I would wish to see, and that anyone living alongside the Shannon who knows and loves the river would wish to see also, is a Shannon River Authority that would take over and embrace all functions of the various statutory agencies now involved.  These include the Office of Public Works, fishery boards, the Department of the Environment and county councils, some of whom have contributed more to the degradation of the Shannon than to its protection.</P>
    <P>As an Opposition Member it is not within my scope to propose such a farreaching, though essential, authority.  I would be happy, however, to hear the views of my colleagues on strengthening such a council, which might eventually become an authority.</P>
    <P>Among its other roles, the council shall promote public interest in and respect for the water quality of the Shannon and its natural bird and fish life habitats.  It will also be empowered to make recommendations to regulate and control pollution and polluting agents within the Shannon catchment as well as providing an adequate and effective inspection and supervisory service. At the moment such a service does not exist.  The only effective inspection and supervisory service we have is that provided by fishermen and boatmen on the river.  I cannot say the same for swimmers because no one swims there anymore.  As a youngster, however, I swam every day in Dromineer Bay, Garrykennedy Bay and Luscagh Bay, but I would not put my toe into the water now.</P>
    <P>Fishermen and boatmen have noticed the degradation of the river.  They are anxious to do something to correct it and, hopefully, to enhance the quality of the water.  It is clear that the existing statutory and local authority bodies have been unable or unwilling to cope with the growing level of pollution or to take effective action to penalise or sanction those bodies, enterprises, organisations or individuals responsible for causing it.  I particularly want to pay tribute to the IFA which was available for consultations and I greatly appreciate its contribution to the proposals.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Agriculture, I introduced grants to enable farmers to control effluent from silage pits.  Their main priority was to enhance productivity which was sometimes done at great cost to the environment and to rivers, streams and inlets, particularly the Shannon and Lough Derg.  I am satisfied those grants have been reasonably effective but not to the extent we would like.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives voluntary bodies, which will be represented on the council, a statutory function to draw up a plan in relation to water management and pollution control on the Shannon.  It also allows them to prepare a water management and pollution control plan not later than one year from the commencement of the Act and after <Col N="1212" /> consultation with public authorities and relevant organisations which they shall then submit to the Minister for the Environment with specific recommendations for action and control.</P>
    <P>The public's awareness of and involvement in the activities of the council is of vital importance. For that reason the Bill provides that the council shall publish in at least one national newspaper and, I hope, a number of local newspapers a notice of the existence of the plan which the council will prepare and the means by which a copy may be obtained by the public and through which the council will propose to implement it. This Bill provides that the council shall furnish the Minister for the Environment with information and advice &mdash; I am satisfied the Minister is not getting it to the extent necessary &mdash; arising from the exercise of its responsibility and shall furnish reports and recommendations to the Minister at least twice a year or more as may be requested by the Minister in respect of all relevant matters.  These reports and recommendations will be used as a test of performance and implementation but not, I hope, further degradation.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that local authorities are unable or unwilling to control the level of pollution in the waterway and, in some instances, have not provided adequate sewage treatment in the major towns along the Shannon, some of which need secondary treatment plants, such as my home town and Athlone.  We have been dilatory in the extreme by allowing that to continue over the years and the fish and the birds which inhabit what we used to call the lordly Shannon have paid the price.  The council is empowered to consult with and advise the local authority in relation to the operation, practice, management, maintenance, modification and improvement of any plan it prepares and of any plant facility and process owned by the authority in respect of which the authority has a responsibility as custodians of the environment and of any matter related to the performance and functions of the council.</P>
    <P>The council cannot take over the statutory functions of existing bodies &mdash; I wish it could &mdash; such as the ESB, the Office of Public Works, the Department of the Marine and county councils. However, it can ensure through its monitoring recommendations and publication of its reports to the Minister that these various bodies act in a co-ordinated and effective way to deal with the level of pollution, which is a scandal.</P>
    <P>To be effective, the council requires a full-time chief executive who will have the status and security of an established civil servant and shall perform such functions as may be assigned to him or her by the council.  The council shall also employ its own staff subject to such terms and conditions, including remuneration and superannuation, as may be determined with the consent of the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance.  The council will be required not later than six months after the end of each <Col N="1213" /> year to submit a report to the Minister of its proceedings and recommendations in the previous year and the report shall be published by the council so that the public and the voluntary organisations concerned will be able to monitor the action or lack of it taken by the Departments, State agencies or local authorities involved.</P>
    <P>This is the first time such legislation has been proposed.  It is hoped that not only will it be an effective means of prohibiting any further pollution or degradation of the Shannon and its catchment waters but that it will also be used as a precedent to achieve the same result in the other beautiful waterways of Ireland.  Senator Daly and I want to express our appreciation to all the voluntary organisations which have been of great assistance to us in the preparation of this Bill.  We are confident that for the first time they will have an effective statutory function to enable them to ensure that the level of pollution in the Shannon, from whatever source, will be strictly prohibited under law from now on.</P>
    <P>Lough Derg, in particular, has become the cesspool of the Shannon river basin instead of its most beautiful and lordly expanse of water.  I was fortunate as a child living along the Shannon to swim in its clear waters, to fish the rich grounds from Islandmore to Dromineer and Garrykennedy and to relish the unique quality and flavour of the tea I made with my father from the Shannon water off Islandmore.  I still remember the flavour of that tea.  However, it has reached the stage where I cannot now dip my toe into the water from which I drank tea some years ago.</P>
    <P>This Bill is intended to be the first step in restoring the Shannon water to its pristine quality and to give the young people of this and subsequent generations the same rights and privileges that I and my contemporaries and generations since time immemorial have enjoyed. Those of us who live along the Shannon and love every inch of it know it is the most beautiful waterway in Europe.  Now that it is linked into the Erne waterway it would be a major boost for our tourism industry and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>I am privileged to have been involved in drafting this Bill with Senator Daly.  I commend the Bill to the House and I hope it will be improved as a result of our discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Daly for bringing this Bill before the House.  This Bill rightly highlights the environmental resource represented by the Shannon system. We have also heard about the importance of the system in economic terms and its recreational and general amenity value, together with the developments and pressures which threaten the Shannon.  It is understandable there should be concern to preserve the quality of the Shannon's environment so that it can continue to be enjoyed and exploited in a sustainable manner.  In this way, the welfare and prosperity of communities within the Shannon catchment and all economic <Col N="1214" /> sectors dependent on high quality water can be safeguarded; the national economy will be in a position to continue to benefit substantially from tourism income generated by angling, boating and cruising activities while wildlife habitats and other water based ecosystems will be protected.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the important resource represented by the Shannon and all our rivers and lakes.  Water quality and environmental considerations generally have become cross sectoral issues affecting decisions relating to infrastructure, agriculture, industrial development, tourism and trade.  That is why the Government has put environmental protection high on its agenda and is committed to integrating it into all policy areas.  Ireland's green image has been used to good effect by many sectors of the economy to gain comparative advantage over our competitors.  This marketing strategy has conferred particular benefits on the agri-food sector and the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Maintaining a clean and attractive environment is essential to the continued expansion in tourism. This sector has been one of the success stories of the Irish economy over recent years.  Foreign earnings have increased from £991 million in 1989 to an estimated £1,850 million in 1996, while the overall earnings from the sector are further boosted by the contribution from Irish citizens who take holidays at home.  One in four foreign tourists participate in active pursuits, including angling, cruising and sailing.  Angling alone is estimated to have attracted 133,000 foreign tourists in 1996.</P>
      <P>The present operational programme for tourism also recognises that Ireland's clean physical environment is one of the major strengths of our tourism sector.  It offers an ideal setting for the further development of a wide range of recreational and leisure pursuits and water resources are central in this regard.  Local surveys have established the attractiveness of resources such as Lough Derg.  A survey conducted in 1991 found that one third of tourists were first time visitors while two thirds were on return trips to the area, indicating that the lake was simultaneously generating new business and maintaining the loyalty of those who had visited previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of effective strategies to protect water quality is strongly influenced by the availability of reliable monitoring data to determine trends, identify polluted waters and the factors responsible.  The Environmental Protection Agency put an extensive monitoring system for rivers in place, involving 3,000 sampling locations on 13,200 kilometers of river channel. The agency is currently finalising a monitoring programme which will significantly expand the present national database on lakes.  The data from these programmes provides an essential input to the ongoing review and, as necessary, the development of pollution control policy within the Department of the Environment.  The data also ensure a focused approach to the implementation of legislation and the adoption of new strategies <Col N="1215" /> by the principal statutory pollution control authorities, the local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency itself in the case of those activities with a significant potential to pollute which come within the agency's integrated pollution control licensing system.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency's most recent report on water quality in Ireland covers the period 1991 to 1994.  The report confirms that the great bulk of our rivers and lakes continues to be unpolluted and are suitable for the most sensitive uses, such as abstraction for drinking water supplies, bathing and supporting salmon and trout fisheries.  Seventy one per cent of river channel length and 77 per cent of lakes surveyed come within the unpolluted category.  Serious pollution has all but been eliminated from our rivers and now affects only 0.6 per cent of channel length.  That reflects the success of efforts to tackle point sources of pollution due mainly to sewage and industrial effluent discharges and, in some instances, to the closure of industrial activities previously associated with pollution problems. I join with Senator O'Kennedy in commending the many voluntary organisations which watch our rivers and lakes so carefully because they are our intelligence on the ground for protecting this vital resource.</P>
    <P>The report notes a slowing down in the rate of increase of moderate pollution which now affects 11.4 per cent of river channel.  The situation is less satisfactory, however, in the case of slight pollution which occurs in 16.8 per cent of river channel surveyed, up from 12 per cent in the previous four year reporting period.  Where earlier data are available for lakes surveyed in the most recent reporting period, the situation generally indicates no appreciable change in conditions.  A continuous improvement has, however, been noted in lakes such as Derravaragh on the Shannon system, as well as Leane, Muckno and Kinale, as a result of successful municipal and agricultural waste management strategies.</P>
    <P>The agency has identified eutrophication caused by the excessive enrichment of waters brought about by inputs of phosphorus as responsible for the incidence of moderate and slight pollution. This condition represents the major threat to the quality of our rivers and lakes.  While sewage discharges and effluents from certain industries contribute to phosphorus loading, the major source of this nutrient reaching waters comes from agriculture, in particular, diffuse sources associated with run off from land which has received applications of chemical fertiliser or slurry or other organic farm wastes.</P>
    <P>Conditions over a total of 2,228 kilometres of river and stream channel in the Shannon catchment were surveyed as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's 1991-4 national overview of water quality.  Findings were broadly similar to the national situation just outlined as regards unpolluted, moderately or slightly polluted channel length.  Agricultural activities were suspected <Col N="1216" /> to be the cause of nearly half of the incidence of slight pollution while industrial discharges accounted for the bulk of the small length of channel subject to serious pollution.  During the most recent review period, 14 of the larger lakes in the catchment were surveyed.  Eleven of these, including Loughs Derravaragh and Owel, were found to be unpolluted.  Lough Key showed characteristics of slight pollution while Loughs Ree and Derg were classed as moderately polluted.</P>
    <P>There has been comment about the ability of current lake monitoring practice to detect early, subtle changes in water quality conditions, particularly in shoreline waters, which could eventually have implications for conditions in the lake generally. The matter is currently being addressed by the Environmental Protection Agency with a view to developing an ecological early warning system which would alert water quality managers to incipient eutrophication problems.  Five research projects costing a total of over £1 million are currently in progress under the environmental monitoring, research and development elements of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99, with the objective of developing new lake monitoring programmes and ecological assessment Protocols.  A team of Irish, UK and US limnologists are involved in this major effort in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency.  As part of the present research effort the position in Ireland regarding the occurrence of toxin producing forms of algae, such as those found in parts of Lough Derg in 1996, is being investigated.  Special attention is being given to such matters as the environmental conditions which promote and sustain the development of toxin emitting algae, test methods to establish the presence of toxins, the standards for safe levels of toxins in waters used for the abstraction of drinking water supplies and for water contact activities, the toxin levels which may entail animal deaths or human health illness if affected waters are ingested and the evaluation of existing techniques for removing toxins in water treatment plants and proposals to upgrade these techniques where, and if, necessary.</P>
    <P>Three locations within Lough Derg are being examined as part of this investigation which also involves the collection of samples of algae from more than 40 lakes throughout the country.  The lakes concerned are representative of waterbodies in each water quality category with existing or potential uses such as water abstraction, water contact sports, angling and shoreline facilities. Pending the findings of this investigation, local authorities should continue to follow the general advice issued by the Department of the Environment in 1992 and 1993 in regard to algal bloom occurrences and the protection of drinking water sources.</P>
    <P>A central element of Government policy in regard to water quality involves a major programme of investment in urban waste water collection and treatment facilities at a total estimated <Col N="1217" /> cost of £1.3 billion.  This investment is being driven by the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive and will be enhanced from EU Structural and Cohesion Funds and Exchequer sources.</P>
    <P>Lough Derg and Lough Ree are major priorities in terms of environmental protection and the water quality problems in these lake catchments are being tackled on a number of fronts.  Lough Derg and Lough Ree have been identified as sensitive areas for the purposes of the EU directive on urban waste water treatment and a programme of investment is under way to upgrade sewage treatment facilities within their catchments. The overall investment involved is estimated at £50 million for Lough Derg and £20 million for Lough Ree.</P>
    <P>In the case of Lough Derg, major schemes involving secondary treatment facilities and/or phosphorus reduction facilities are being provided at Ballinasloe, Birr, Nenagh, Roscrea, Moate, Portumna and Tullamore at an estimated cost of £16.3 million.  Construction of sewage collection schemes will commence in 1997 at Athlone and Monksland, County Roscommon, at a cost of £4.8 million.  A sewage treatment works for Clara in County Offaly is also planned.</P>
    <P>As regards Lough Ree, the Edgeworthstown sewerage scheme was completed in 1996 at a cost of almost £2 million.  Waste water treatment plants and/or phosphorus reduction facilities are being provided at Roscommon, Ballyjamesduff, Boyle, Ballaghadereen, Ballymahon, Granard and Longford at an estimated cost of £12.7 million. In addition, schemes under construction or planned for the Cavan and Leitrim areas, at a total estimated cost of £5 million, will contribute to the protection of water quality in the Lough Ree catchment area.</P>
    <P>Approval has also been obtained for Cohesion Fund assistance for comprehensive catchment monitoring and management programmes for Loughs Derg and Ree to assess the overall effectiveness of the investment in sewage treatment infrastructure.  These programmes will also determine the effects of other points and diffuse sources of pollution, in particular, pollution from agricultural sources.</P>
    <P>The main elements of each of these catchment monitoring and management programmes involve the setting up of an integrated monitoring system for the catchment covering point and non-point sources of pollution, the lake itself, the relevant section of the River Shannon and tributary rivers and streams in the catchment; the upgrading of laboratory capacity to cope with the more intensive monitoring system; studies and surveys of agricultural operations in each catchment; enhancement of existing hydrometric monitoring stations, including the development, as appropriate, of mathematical models; the development of a geographical information system management tool which will allow integrated analysis using data on topography, soil characteristics, land use, <Col N="1218" /> point source discharges, etc, both on a total catchment and subcatchment basis; the development of a water quality management system for the catchment incorporating the geographical information system and the development of appropriate indicators to communicate information on environmental status and performance.</P>
    <P>Welcome as all these scientific mechanisms are, I know nothing replaces the personal observations of those who use the river continuously over a long period of time.  As I said, the element of drawing in the voluntary organisations is quite important in that regard.</P>
    <P>Under the monitoring and management programme approach careful attention will be paid to the particular characteristics and requirements of each catchment.  The development of these systems will be overseen by separate project operational management groups, which will be representative of the wide range of statutory and sectoral interests having functions or otherwise interested in water quality protection and management. This approach offers a mechanism for arriving at consensus leading to the adoption of a comprehensive series of integrated actions necessary to further enhance the management and development of these water resources.</P>
    <P>The Government is also pursing an extensive programme of measures to reduce nutrient losses to waters, particularly phosphorus, from sources other than sewage.  These include, first, the promotion of the code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution which was launched jointly by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in July 1996.</P>
    <P>Second, water pollution legislation is being amended to allow local authorities to require farmers to prepare nutrient management plans. The objective of these plans is to achieve the correct balance between water quality protection and nutrient requirements for crop production, taking account of recommended application rates and nutrients already available in the soil.</P>
    <P>Third, last December the revised Teagasc recommended application rates for phosphorus fertilisers for grassland were launched.  The reduced rates recommended should curtail phosphorus losses to waters with benefits for the condition of rivers and lakes.  Fourth, the integrated pollution control licensing system under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, has been extended since 3 September 1996 to new intensive agricultural activities in the pig and poultry sectors.</P>
    <P>The fifth measure is the rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the farm improvement programme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, which are specifically geared to the adoption of environmentally friendly farm practices and provide grant assistance for investment to support such practices. There has been a good response by farmers to these schemes.  Over 30,000 farmers received <Col N="1219" /> grants for pollution control works under the control of farmyard and farm improvement schemes, while a significant proportion of the £195 million in the 1994-9 operational programme for on-farm investment will go towards similar works.  About 40,000 farmers are expected to participate in REPS, which was launched in June 1994, and will benefit from projected grant expenditure totalling £230 million.</P>
    <P>Sixth, under Partnership 2000 and the Finance Bill, 1997, provision will be made by way of improved capital allowances for a targeted and monitored measure to support investment by farmers in necessary pollution control projects. Seventh, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency are imposing controls, as appropriate, in respect of phosphorus discharges from industrial activities through the exercise of their statutory licensing control functions.</P>
    <P>The eighth measure is the provision of pump out facilities at ten locations on the Shannon system. These are Carrick-on-Shannon, Ballyleague, Lough Key, Dromineer, Mountshannon, Shannonbridge, Ballina, Belturbet, Dromod and Portumna to cater for sewage from cruisers.  A further such facility at Athlone will be completed in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment will shortly launch a strategy to combat the eutrophication of rivers and lakes aimed at providing better co-ordination of the foregoing series of actions and to intensify pollution prevention efforts.  The strategy will encourage an integrated approach to management and protection of waters based on catchments and will seek to involve all economic sectors and stakeholders together with the statutory pollution control authorities.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to establish a Shannon River Council covering the entire Shannon catchment, from outer estuary limits to source.  As defined, the catchment would include every tributary river and stream, every lake on the system and canals on, or connected with, the Shannon.  This would involve an extensive geographical area and would, for example, extend the remit of the council as far as the east coast by virtue of the presence of the Royal and Grand Canals; going northwards, the area of influence would reach the Border because of the presence of the Shannon-Erne waterway.  I am happy to say it would also reach my constituency of Dublin West because we enjoy the value of both the Royal and Grand Canals there.</P>
    <P>The council's primary functions would be to propose policies and priorities for protecting and enhancing the environment, water quality and natural habitats for bird and fish life within the catchment area.  In fulfilling this role the council would be required to undertake a range of measures, including the co-ordination of the environment, water quality, habitats and water management activities of public authorities; the making of recommendations to regulate and control water pollution; the provision of an inspection and supervisory service and the preparation <Col N="1220" /> of a water management and pollution control plan for the entire Shannon catchment.</P>
    <P>The functions of the council would impinge on a great number of public authorities including Departments, the Office of Public Works, local authorities, regional authorities, fisheries boards, harbour authorities, health boards and boards or other bodies established by, or under, statute.</P>
    <P>As we have already heard from Senator O'Kennedy, a case can be made for the type of body he is seeking to put in place.  It would be necessary, however, to give more detailed consideration to the practical ramifications of the role envisaged for the Shannon River Council and how this would interact with the statutory functions of existing bodies with responsibility for pollution control, habitat protection and environmental management generally.  In addition, greater account should be taken of existing legislation and practice which serve to ensure a high degree of co-ordination in relation to these matters as they concern the Shannon and our environment generally.</P>
    <P>There is already a unified statutory authority in relation to waterways navigation and habitats in the form of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  That Minister wishes to see the management of inland waterways integrated rather than fragmented and is at present pursuing the drafting of legislation for the establishment of a central waterways authority.  The authority's functions would cover the Shannon navigation and its associated canals, as well as the Barrow navigation, the Erne and Lough Oughter navigation, the Tralee Ship Canal, the Eglington Canal and the Boyne navigation.</P>
    <P>Key responsibilities of the inland waterways authority would concern the management, development, protection and control of designated waterways.  The promotion of recreational and commercial use of the waterways as well as the development of tourism related services and activities and the protection of the industrial heritage and ecology of the waterways would also be attended to by the authority.</P>
    <P>While the Bill's concern to promote the co-ordination of actions is understandable and in line with existing policy and practice in many respects, the assumption that this co-ordination can only be brought about by a single body with a remit covering the entire Shannon catchment warrants further examination.  Senator O'Kennedy expressed particular concern about Lough Derg in this regard.  There are good hydrological and ecological reasons for dividing the Shannon system into at least three catchments for the purposes of water quality management and protection. In effect, the major lakes on the river act as filters and retainers of pollution.  The fresh and estuarine waters of the overall system display different characteristics which could further justify separate management strategies tailored to the particular needs of the waters concerned.</P>
    <P>The flexibility inherent in the Water Pollution Act, 1977, regarding the waters to be included in <Col N="1221" /> a quality management plan can be availed of, as appropriate, to fully cater for the diversity in conditions encountered in the Shannon catchment. The local authorities concerned have already made use of these provisions and have jointly adopted statutory water quality management plans for the upper Shannon, the lower Shannon and the Shannon Estuary.  Prior to their adoption, the draft plans underwent a period of public consultation and submissions received were taken into account in their finalisation.  The plans contain objectives for the prevention and abatement of pollution.  Regard must be had to these objectives by local authorities in the performance of their functions under the Water Pollution Acts of 1977 and 1990 and by the Environmental Protection Agency in the operation of the integrated pollution control licensing system for activities with a significant potential to affect the environment.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements regarding water quality management will be further improved under the major EU Cohesion Funds monitoring and management systems for Lough Derg and Lough Ree to which I have referred.  Careful attention needs to be paid to the relationship between the proposed co-ordinating role of the Shannon River Council and the co-ordinating functions assigned to regional authorities in 1994. The council's involvement in the areas of inspection and supervision could entail significant duplication of the structures already put in place by local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency and fisheries boards as regards environmental issues and by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in the case of wildlife and habitat protection.  This aspect merits more detailed examination.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding the performance of environmental functions by local authorities, which also come within the scope of the Bill, is already well catered for under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  The agency is in a position to make recommendations and provide advice, general support and assistance to local authorities.  It can initiate steps, where appropriate, to ensure satisfactory performance of environmental functions.  In addition, the agency exercises a supervisory role over the monitoring activities of local authorities.  Its role in relation to advice and recommendations for the purposes of environmental protection also applies to Ministers. This function may be exercised at the agency's own volition or in response to requests made by Ministers.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that the Government has funded the significant and ongoing expansion of the Environmental Protection Agency to enable it to move in a phased manner towards the full exercise of its statutory powers with regard to the licensing, regulation and control of activities for the purposes of environmental protection.  The agency's functions also provide for the monitoring of the quality of the environment, supervision of local authority performance of their statutory <Col N="1222" /> environmental protection functions and the provision of advice, support and assistance to local authorities and other public authorities.  The Government's commitment to the agency is reflected in the increase in its annual Exchequer grant from under £2 million in 1993 to £5.84 million this year.  Staff numbers in the agency have more than doubled during this period and it currently employs 159 people.</P>
    <P>While the Government is not opposed to the principal objectives of the Bill, it will be clear that there are important issues of concern regarding the proposed Shannon River Council which warrant further attention.  Apart from the Private Members' Bill considerations, there may be scope to take on board certain general aspirations of the Bill as regards waterways management in the legislative proposals currently being prepared by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for the establishment of an inland waterways authority.  The Minister for the Environment will liaise with the Minister for the purpose of ensuring that possibilities in this regard are explored.</P>
    <P>There is a strong appreciation in rural communities of the importance of our rivers and lakes and there is now an acceptance of the kind of controls which have been introduced.  A few years ago some farmers found the introduction of controls an interference whereas most farmers now welcome the REPS scheme and other schemes that are being introduced.</P>
    <P>I have had the privilege to holiday on the River Shannon on a couple of occasions.  The increasing numbers of tourists to the river, especially from abroad, indicates that it is an enormous source of future revenue.  It is also an important amenity for Irish people in addition to providing a livelihood for many who work along the different areas of the river.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for producing this Bill and I especially thank Senator O'Kennedy for his broad philosophical approach when introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the practice of Senators initiating Private Members' Bills.  It should be encouraged.  Given that this is a Private Members' Bill and has probably been produced without the benefit of the parliamentary draftsman, there is an obligation on us to subject it to close examination.</P>
      <P>The Senators who have produced the Bill should bear in mind that the Minister of State raised questions regarding the overlap of functions proposed under the Bill with functions already exercised by statutory bodies, local authorities, etc.  To that extent they may welcome the opportunity to consider how they may reconcile what would appear to be duplication and overlap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of points and give the sponsors of the Bill an opportunity to respond to my reservations and convince me that they are without justification.  Criticisms I may make of certain aspects of the Bill are only for the purpose of identifying weaknesses and not just to attack <Col N="1223" /> the measure.  I will not criticise the Bill for the sake of it but because questions arise about certain sections.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy said he would regard the establishment of the council as the first step in the context of the development of the River Shannon, its basin and tributaries.  When I first read the Bill I felt its functions were limited.  I agree to an extent with the Minister of State's observation that there would be overlapping and duplication.  If it was possible or practical, I would favour the introduction of legislation to establish an authority or developmental body for the entire Shannon region.  The River Shannon is a valuable national and natural resource which, for various reasons, has not been utilised to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I must be persuaded that the proposed council is necessary in the first place.  Is it the best organisation to do the job?  To what degree can the overlapping and duplication which will arise be avoided?  How can its proposed duties be reconciled with those of existing bodies?  I would happier if the council had a developmental aspect.  If one wanted to be critical of the Bill for the sake of it, one could point out that it only mentions the habitat and welfare of birds and fish twice.  I have no problem with that but I would expect it to take a wider view of what is involved.</P>
    <P>The other reservation I have is that the Bill does not appear to cover enforcement powers.  It appears the council will be solely an advisory body.  However, there are existing advisory bodies so why establish another advisory body unless it is capable of doing something which the other bodies cannot do.  If the Bill is to improve the existing structures, it should contain enforcement powers.  The sponsors of the Bill will have considered this aspect and they must have discarded the inclusion of enforcement powers.  What were their reasons for that?</P>
    <P>I share the Minister of State's view that the Bill will duplicate functions already discharged by other bodies.  Water quality management plans are already in place and bodies are already charged with responsibility in that regard.  The implication is that they are failing to fulfil their functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>How can we be sure the existing bodies are not fulfilling their functions effectively and fully and that the new body, without enforcement powers, will be in a position to do what it is alleged the other bodies have failed to do to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the council is to be effective, it must displace to an extent, if not in its entirety, the role of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Is that a good move?  The agency has inspection and supervisory roles.  Do the sponsors suggest that the agency is just monitoring and examining cases but not enforcing legislation?  How will this Bill overcome <Col N="1224" /> that position, if it exists?  To what extent can we be satisfied that the council would be a more effective organisation in promoting these worthy objectives?</P>
    <P>The River Shannon is a great national resource. It has unfulfilled potential in many areas from its source until it reaches the Atlantic Ocean. Senator Daly, Senator Fitzgerald and I live on the estuary and Senator O'Kennedy does not live far from it.  Its development as a source of industry and a transshipment point has been neglected at considerable cost to the local and national economies over many years.  There is a move away in certain quarters from that type of thinking because it conflicts with other options which are being considered for the River Shannon. However, I remain convinced that the estuary's potential for transshipment and industrial development has been neglected and should be examined.  The sponsors of the Bill should consider giving the council the capacity to involve itself in that type of work.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and Senator O'Kennedy mentioned the tourism potential of the River Shannon.  This potential is being developed but there is major scope for further growth.  Undoubtedly, this is being inhibited by such things as pollution. I accept that unless pollution is controlled, the potential for tourism development will be seriously disadvantaged.  There are four major sources of pollution, particularly in Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>Like Senator O'Kennedy, I live close to Lough Derg and I am aware of the problems there; I have been called to account for them on more than one occasion.  Local authorities are expected to enforce measures to limit, control and eliminate pollution yet, in many cases, they are major contributors to the problem.  Obviously there are conflicts here and perhaps that is why Senator O'Kennedy feels he can solve that difficulty by bringing in his council.  Let us acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and Senator O'Kennedy referred to the problems caused by the rising level of phosphorus in the water.  I accept this was a problem that arose from agricultural practices but account has been taken of them.  There is a great consciousness among farming communities and the organisations that represent them of the need to recognise and deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am critical of one aspect of the Minister of State's contribution.  She said agricultural activities were suspected to be the cause of nearly half the incidence of slight pollution while industrial discharges accounted for more of it.  If the source of the pollution cannot be identified, agriculture is blamed.  That attitude exists in too many quarters and is an unjustified reflection on those who make their living from the land.</P>
    <P>Another major source of pollution recognised by the Minister of State is the pleasure boats and cruisers, particularly the method by which they dispose of waste.  This practice is very prevalent in the Lough Derg area and I welcome the Minister <Col N="1225" /> of State's announcement that at least ten points with pump-out facilities are to be provided on the river.  We must ensure that boat owners and users are obliged to avail of these facilities.</P>
    <P>Another factor that damages the tourism potential of the Shannon has been the accumulation of silt from the operations of Bord na Móna.  Because that is a semi-State body there is a tendency to push this aside and forget about it. We should point the finger at the difficulties this silt causes as much as we do at industry and agriculture. There is evidence that Bord na Móna has contributed to and created problems in this area. Let us examine how that body can be made to rectify those problems.</P>
    <P>I would have been more impressed if there was a developmental or promotional aspect to this Bill.  I leave it to the Bill's sponsors to respond to that.  I do not want to be perceived as cynical but I will now express what others will say outside the House.  The Shannon and related matters have a remarkable capacity to surface in election time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be presumptuous of Senator O'Kennedy or me to suggest that this Bill would resolve all the challenges of this great waterway. It is already successful in that we have had some very constructive suggestions from the Government side on improving the Bill.  I also appreciate the contributions of the Minister of State, who has given, perhaps for the first time, a comprehensive, overall view of the Shannon catchment area and some of the initiatives being taken to deal with problems there.  While we have raised issues such as flooding, navigation and drainage over the years, we have rarely been given a comprehensive analysis of the overall initiatives and efforts put in place to deal with problems in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shannon is a major national economic resource which has made a big contribution to the <Col N="1226" /> development of the centre of the island.  From my time in the Department of the Marine I recall it touches 26 of the 32 counties, which shows how important it is to look at the area as a unit.  My criticism of the Minister of State's proposals is that they suggested breaking the area into three catchment areas.  That would be unwise as it is far better to look at the overall catchment as one unit and deal with it in that way.  With three catchment areas and different responsibilities, one would have the kind of overlapping and duplication Senator Howard mentioned and that would waste both financial and human resources.</P>
    <P>When producing the Bill we were very conscious of the various responsibilities of the different semi-State bodies.  For example, the Commissioners of Public Works would have responsibility for ensuring the proper navigation system for the Shannon catchment area and connections to that area and their powers are set down in detailed, comprehensive legislation. The ESB, because of their requirements, also have certain powers.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy and I considered devolving some of the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works, the ESB and Bord na Móna to the new authority but that would be a recipe for overlapping and duplication and would lead to further complications and unnecessary bureaucratic delays.  Therefore, the Bill does not interfere to any great extent with the present legislative powers of the Commissioners of Public Works on navigation or the ESB on fisheries.  At the same time, we must remember that there are some important considerations to be taken into account.  If one looks at the studies, discussions, analyses and political debate that took place in the past, it has never been possible to set down a formula to bring the various agencies under one umbrella.  This is what we are endeavouring to achieve in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy and I discussed the definition of the catchment area in great detail because we could have excluded the lower Shannon area. However, as Senator Howard stated, this area is very important because the Fergus catchment and other catchments empty into the Shannon estuary below Sarsfield Bridge in Limerick.  If, as Senator Howard advocated, large scale developments were to take place in this area it would be vitally important to protect and conserve the existing high standard of water quality found in the lower Shannon estuary.</P>
    <P>A number of major industrial concerns are situated in this part of the estuary &mdash; the ESB station at Moneypoint, the Aughinish Alumina plant and the oil generating station at Tarbert.  It is an indication of the success of State agencies and the companies involved in the lower Shannon area that these operations have managed to successfully develop without creating significant pollution. Recent surveys on the quality of water in the estuary indicate that it is probably one of the cleanest in Europe.  Major research work carried out by Irish and German authorities discovered <Col N="1227" /> that the quality of water in the lower Shannon area was equal to, if not greater than, any similar estuary throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Efforts have been made to co-ordinate the efforts of the various agencies.  In 1989, an informal forum was established which involved many of the bodies and voluntary organisations under discussion.  I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Kennedy in acknowledging the valuable work carried out by angling associations, inland waterways associations and bodies such as the Save Our Lough Derg organisation which have constantly highlighted the necessity to take urgent remedial action to deal with some of the immediate problems.  I compliment the IFA which not only provided a secretary for that forum, Mr. Adrian Leddy, but also employed a firm of consultants to carry out research.  The IFA's conclusion was that the Shannon Forum, which operated successfully for a number of years, was the forerunner for the establishment of the kind of authority advocated in the legislation. Following receipt of the opinions of consultants and others, the considered view of the IFA was that the forum, as an <i>ad hoc</i> committee of the 25 various interested bodies involved, was a forerunner of a permanent statutory Shannon council or authority.  To some extent, we have incorporated this suggestion into the Bill.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was introduced and we indicated our intention to promote it, there have been suggestions that it arrived too late and that the damage had already been done to the upper Shannon catchment area in particular.  We reject that and we do not accept that the legislation is too late in arriving.  We accept there are certain problems in the Shannon catchment area and we believe that co-ordinated action from local authorities is required.  It is true that some authorities are not <i>au fait</i> with the work being carried out by others.  This is one of the strengths of the regional authorities which would not go beyond the area comprising north County Tipperary and Counties Limerick and Clare.</P>
    <P>Clare County Council and Limerick County Council engage in very little co-operation with regard to the amount of discharges entering the River Shannon at Limerick city.  To some extent, Limerick Corporation and County Council carried out their own work as did Clare County Council.  The development of the entire region is in a state of paralysis because an overall scheme has not been put in place to deal with matters such as effluent disposal, etc.  For this reason, the county councils employed professionals to undertake consultancy work a number of years ago and I am not sure whether this was ever concluded. The county councils were concerned with the development of water and sewerage schemes and ring roads in the vicinity of Limerick.  The area comprising the borders of Counties Limerick and Clare has been held back in terms of its development because the authorities involved did not institute a clear policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> The suggestion that the Bill is untimely in its arrival is not well thought out.  It is never too late. A start can be made and if the legislation does not represent the correct way to deal with this matter it should be amended and strengthened. In that context, I appreciate the Minister of State's comments.  We would not press the issue if the Government took a different line but we are intent on encouraging the Government to follow the line we advocate and refrain from dividing the area in question.  If this is done, the impact and overall view of the legislation will be lost.</P>
    <P>It was also stated that implementation of the Bill's provisions would be too costly.  If a &ldquo;super&rdquo; authority with many new powers and responsibilities was established it would become cumbersome and expensive.  As Senator Howard inquired, would it be necessary, given the number of agencies already in existence?  I do not believe we can afford not to proceed with this measure. The cost in terms of the continuing erosion of public confidence in the existing agencies and the fragmented approach adopted by those agencies and other authorities is detrimental in the long term to the catchment plan.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the authority we propose need necessarily overlap with other agencies.  We would be prepared, on Committee Stage, to consider how we can put in place some protection that overlapping does not occur.  We are seeking to achieve the Bill's objective to co-ordinate and put forward proposals and plans.  The Minister of State and Senator Howard did not suggest that there was not a necessity for an overall plan for the Shannon catchment area.  That proposal is fundamental to the Bill.  When drafting the legislation we set down a definite time limit which is probably one of the areas with which we now have difficulty.  We recommend that the plan should be prepared and put in place within one year of the council's establishment.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy and I discussed this matter in detail because we do not want a situation where work was being carried out in the preparation of an overall management plan for the Shannon for the next five to 20 years.  We believe it necessary to establish a timeframe within which the council will have a mandate to put in place an overall plan to set out the priorities, bearing in mind that each body which it would co-ordinate would have its own statutory responsibilities and legal obligations.</P>
    <P>We provided that the body would have powers of enforcement.  As Senator Howard rightly said, it would be pointless to have a council if one could not be reasonably sure that people could comply with the advice or directions it would give.  We are interested in strengthening that provision and we support the Senator's remarks.  He was correct to identify that, even if we follow this route, the council must be in a position to effect whatever decisions it makes.  We have few problems with accepting ways to strengthen this Bill to provide for the effective implementation of any directives the council might put forward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> We also set out an advisory role for the Minister in some matters.  Perhaps at an early date the council could examine the management of the Shannon adjacent to Limerick city.  A major obstacle to fisheries development on the river is the Thomond weir, which is no longer fished by the ESB other than as an eel fishery.  Is it necessary to maintain the weir?  It is having a considerable impact on the catchment and it may be desirable to dismantle it.</P>
    <P>Given that this exercise springs from a concern about fisheries, we should also consider the fish pass at Ardnacrusha.  One consideration which led us to proceed speedily with the legislation was the deteriorating state of Shannon fisheries. Before the development of the Ardnacrusha power station, about 1,000 stake weirs operated in the lower Shannon area providing employment for hundreds of people.  No one objected to the building of the hydro-electric power station at Ardnacrusha and no one has any objections at present but, when it was built, no consideration was given to fishing in the lower Shannon.  The fish pass at the station was put in some 30 years later but by then the livelihood of thousands had been wiped out, the stocks of salmon were irreparably damaged and have not recovered since. We destroyed the greatest salmon fishery in the world through 30 years of inaction; let us not make the same mistake again.  When people say it is too late to fix it now, we should look at the challenges the Shannon presents as regards employment and the value of fisheries.  It was neither by accident nor by design that this year, for the first time, Lough Derg anglers cancelled all their trout fishing competitions; it was the result of neglect.  Action is now needed and we are proposing it in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill with many positive proposals.  It recognises that the Shannon is a great national asset which is used for a variety of purposes including electricity generation, water supply for urban, industrial, regional and group water schemes, and effluent and waste disposal.  It is an outstanding tourism attraction which is used for boating and fishing. The midlands stretches of the river are nationally and internationally famous for their important wild fowl populations.  I am pleased that a number of areas along the Shannon have been specially designated for the preservation and survival of wildlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrettably, in the past 15 to 20 years the level of pollution in the river has increased and there are no signs of a decline.  Senator O'Kennedy spoke about swimming in Lough Derg and the Shannon, which was always a great attraction of the river &mdash; I spent many happy hours swimming there over the years &mdash; but few people would now risk it.  That is sad and it is a challenge we must face.  Similarly, fish numbers in the river are falling dramatically according to those who fish the regularly.  We must examine this also.  The Senator also mentioned the problem of water <Col N="1230" /> quality in Nenagh last year but the problem exists along the whole river.  Where there is a lot of boat traffic, it may even be unsafe for cattle to drink the water.</P>
    <P>Many bodies are responsible for the management and running of the Shannon &mdash; the Department of the Environment, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, local authorities and the Inland Fisheries Trust.  Are we happy with the current management of the river?  The answer must be an emphatic no.  Will the Shannon River Council solve the current problems? With the best will in the world I doubt it will but it will help improve the Shannon and if it does, it is going in the right direction.</P>
    <P>To a large extent the council will act as a coordinator and highlight problems and difficulties, many of which are mentioned in the plan drawn up by the people who prepared the Bill.  If the council is truly independent it could make an impression and play an important role in the administration and management of the Shannon. However, as a Government Senator, I am unhappy about paragraph 2 of the Schedule which authorises the Minister to appoint a chairperson and up to 20 ordinary members of the council.  The Minister should have the power to appoint some members but surely he should not be allowed appoint them all.</P>
    <P>Also the criteria for the appointment of board members are too broad.  Every citizen would qualify, no matter where he or she lives.  The Bill provides that each member of the council shall be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, has an interest in or knowledge of or experience in relation to the matters connected to the Shannon River catchment.  That is too broad.  If one is to have successful legislation, people with expertise and qualifications are needed.  The council should comprise people with experience, qualifications and relevant knowledge.  It would be important that people with experience in engineering, hydraulics, tourism and water control were appointed.  If a Minister appoints a large number of people there is a danger of appointments being made for the sake of it.  We do not need a talking shop or a quango.  If the Bill is to be a success it needs considerable refinement.  The council has no power to take action in terms of prosecution or imposing sanctions.  If it is to succeed it must have powers to impose sanctions against those who flout the law, whether local authorities or individuals.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with important matters and it goes a long way to address the problems.  I have seen the decline of the Shannon and I am saddened by what has happened to one of the finest waterways in the world &mdash; I do not say that lightly.  On 19 October 1977 I tabled a parliamentary question on waterways to the then Minister for Tourism and Transport, Pádraig Faulkner.  A certain amount of mileage has been clocked up since then by some of us here.</P>

      <P>Every year there is flooding along the Shannon and Senator O'Kennedy can often be seen out and about wearing wellington boots, a heavy overcoat and a hat.  Deputy O'Rourke often goes out to visit flooded areas in Westmeath and I go on similar visits using a tractor and trailer to get through the floods.  We must address the annual flooding problems along the Shannon because every year the farmers and householders in the Shannon basin suffer great losses.  If the river floods and one's home is damaged one might suffer for years given the likely level of damage.  This year, luckily, there was no serious flooding. However, I have seen people along the Shannon suffer great losses in the past.  The matter must be addressed.</P>

Close to 200,000 acres of land in tributary catchments associated with the Shannon system are subject to flooding and about 50,000 acres along the main stem of the river are affected by flooding each year.  That is a total of about 250,000 acres of land in the Shannon basin, mainly in the midlands, which is subject to flooding each year.  The losses experienced by those living along the Shannon, especially the farmers, must not be allowed to continue.  Remedial action is needed.  Finding solutions to the issue has been put off for some time and this Bill does not address these problems.</P>

      <Col N="1232" /> There is too much fragmentation at present in the powers relating to the Shannon River, spread as they are between the local authorities, the fisheries authorities and a number of Departments. There are other rivers in the midlands, including the Brosna, the Nore and the Barrow.  There should be a national waterways authority with strong powers to ensure the water supply is safe. Clean water and clean air are fundamental to life. If we can ensure a supply of clean water under a national waterways authority we will have done a good day's work.  I wish the Bill well.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I compliment Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Daly on their initiative and excellent work in its preparation. The two Senators are well aware of the issues that concern the Shannon and its catchment and they have brought their knowledge to bear on the Bill. They have opened a debate which is necessary by bringing forward a worthwhile Bill which I hope will pass through the Seanad.  The Government may wish to amend the Bill if it thinks it might be enhanced and I have no doubt Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Daly will co-operate fully as will the other Members on this side of the House. This Bill is the basis for legislation which will take a broad view of the various activities related to the Shannon.  Senator O'Kennedy indicated his hope that this Bill would finally lead to a Shannon authority to deal with all functions in the Shannon catchment area, particularly along the main channel of the river.</P>
      <P>I feared that we might be accused of being involved in electioneering.  It has always seemed in the past that prior to a general election somebody would emerge with a proposal to drain the Shannon and one could be assured that within a matter of weeks an election would be called.  The proximity of the general election and the appearance of this Bill have nothing in common &mdash; it is mere coincidence.  Furthermore, this is not a Bill to drain the Shannon; it is a Bill to clean the Shannon and make the waters as pure and safe as they were.</P>

      <P>There is major pollution in the Shannon.  I appreciate what the Minister said, but there are other reports which have been placed before the local authorities regarding pollution to which we can add our own experience.  Fifty thousand acres of peatlands are being drained into the Shannon through the outfalls of subsidiaries.  This is flowing into a river which is not being maintained. Neither a shovel nor a machine have been used on the main channel of the Shannon for many years, yet it is expected to take the drainage of 50,000 acres of bog and absorb all the peat and dust.  I know from people who work the Shannon for tourism, shooting and fishing that there are major deposits of peat at different parts of the river.  Lough Ree and Lough Derg are polluted. <Col N="1233" /> From Meelick Weir it is possible to see large deposits of silt with the naked eye.  The river is in a deplorable condition.  One can imagine the problems in the connected tributaries, rivers and drains.  There is nothing but weeds and rushes on the River Suck and the River Hind.  The streams, which were clear and free-flowing and often teeming with trout and other fish, are now effectively dead.  People can no longer freely bathe in these rivers.  They are no longer used for recreational purposes and this is a shame.</P>
      <P>There are too many interests controlling the Shannon.  I appreciate that the navigation structures are necessary and that the ESB's interest is necessary but there is no co-ordination between the interested groups.  The proposal for a Shannon council is one way of addressing this issue.  I hope a Shannon authority will be appointed.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and compliment the work done by Senators O'Kennedy and Daly.  I hope the House will accept the Bill so that a council co-ordinating the activities of the Shannon can be established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senators O'Kennedy and Daly for introducing this Bill and for providing us with an opportunity to debate the problems of the Shannon.  It is a wonderful waterway with many amenities from source to sea.  It provides much recreational pleasure and other benefits to those who live along its banks.  It flows through a number of counties.</P>
      <P>I support the principle of the Bill and the establishment of a council to co-ordinate the various activities on the river.  There are a great number of bodies with an interest in the Shannon and it is difficult to co-ordinate their responsibilities and activities.  I am a member of the Mid West Regional Authority, which was given a specific duty in co-ordinating the activities on Lough Derg in particular.  Co-ordination has been extremely difficult because it involves so many different agencies and interests stretching upstream.  Many of the problems relate to what happens upstream.  In trying to co-ordinate the control of pollution in Lough Derg it was necessary for the regional authority and the various bodies concerned to examine what was happening upstream and to support treatment of pollution in Athlone and County Roscommon.  It was also necessary to address the problem of peat silt entering the lake and to examine how far it was responsible for the eutrophication of Lough Derg.  Pollution has caused serious concern on both sides of the lake and downstream where I live.  In Limerick we have an interest in the quality of the water because it flows down stream from Lough Derg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recreational facilities of the lake are widely used by people in the mid west.  I am concerned that the programme which has started be continued. In this context I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Environment of programmes to the tune of £50 million for Lough <Col N="1234" /> Derg and £20 million for Lough Ree, with secondary treatment and phosphorus reduction facilities in a number of different areas.  Some of these projects have already started and it is expected that others will start in the near future. Until such projects are embarked upon we will not see a pollution free Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>Other measures are also necessary, which would include the involvement of Bord na Móna. Agricultural pollution, a major factor in the condition of the lake, must also be addressed.  From speaking with people in Northern Ireland I understand that a major programme of sewage treatment plants was carried out around Lough Neagh in the hope of solving the pollution problem. However, the problem continued because due attention was not paid to agricultural pollution and farm monitoring.  This proves that an approach involving the different activities is necessary to ensure success.</P>
    <P>Action on agricultural pollution has been taken under the REP scheme, but also in establishing an information scheme for farmers to inform them of things such as the type of fertilisers which should be used.  The use of phosphorus and nitrogen must be addressed.  I understand a programme will be put in place for Lough Derg which would involve the visiting of farms and the provision of general information and education for farmers.  Farmers do want to play their part and are a sizeable part of the lobby interested in cleaning up Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>The water quality management plans which were adopted by local authorities were intended to ensure that water quality would be adequately monitored and that problems would be dealt with.  There are three plans relating to different parts of the Shannon, namely, the upper Shannon, Lough Derg and the lower Shannon and the estuary.  As a member of a local authority involved in both the estuary and lower Shannon and Lough Derg plan, I do not think these plans have been as effective as they should have been. This is partly because of lack of funding but also because of confusion over responsibility.  I wrote to the Department of the Environment to clarify the situation regarding a clean up of the Shannon. It was difficult to get that clarification as there were at least three different bodies involved &mdash; the Office of Public Works, the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Shannon one is obviously dealing with a number of local authorities.  It is extremely difficult to achieve the kind of co-ordination that is necessary in this matter.  If this authority is to be set up, it will certainly have to be given adequate staffing and adequate teeth in terms of implementing the necessary co-ordination measures.  The experience of the regional authority has shown that it has been very difficult to get the various bodies together in order to achieve the necessary co-ordinated response. Attempts continue to be made to achieve co-ordination between the various bodies but it is extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> In relation to the value of the lake and the river in terms of tourism, I think there is a huge potential there which has not yet been tapped.  Other countries make a great deal of use of their inland waterways, particularly for boating and also for bathing, fishing and so on.  We have a fishing tradition in Ireland, but fishermen themselves are concerned that there should be a proper authority with the necessary powers in relation to the co-ordination of activities in the Shannon area. There used to be a gentleman's agreement in operation as to how different uses of the lake and the river would be co-ordinated.  For example, people using boats would respect the needs of the fishermen and bathers, but this does not always apply.  There is a particular concern now about power boats and jet skis, especially on Lough Derg.  It is necessary that these activities are properly controlled so as not to interfere with the rights of other users of the waterways.  There should be a determination that these activities would not occur where people are fishing or bathing.</P>
    <P>In regard to Lough Derg, I am thinking in particular of areas such as Dromineer, Tineranna, Killaloe, Ballina and so on where recreational use of the lake is sometimes interfered with.  I presume that co-ordination of activities would be a duty of the proposed authority.  Reference was also made to pump out facilities, of which there are some at the moment.  However, these are not always available for use and people wishing to use these facilities are sometimes unable to do so. That is clearly a duty of local authorities which perhaps has not been fully addressed.</P>
    <P>I note that there is a reference to staffing in the Bill and details of the way in which staff should be appointed and so on.  It is essential to have adequate staffing and funding if such a body is to be effective.</P>
    <P>Overall, I congratulate the two Senators for bringing this Bill before the Seanad.  It should be debated at length and the necessary changes should be made to strengthen the powers of such an authority and its relationship with other bodies which already have duties in this area, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Public Works and the local authorities.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I will not need more time but, in the unlikely event that I do, I thank the House for its indulgence.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion, I named two particular areas of difficulty not only in the universities but among the graduate bodies.</P>
      <P>First, there is the problem of political appointees.  I see no possible reason for a Minister of a Government of any complexion to make political appointments to the board of a university. That seems untenable.  There are many ways in which the Government can control universities and there are many pressures which it may bring to bear on them through this Bill without the particularly penal measure of making political appointments to the board.  One cannot justify that when a Government appoints people to the boards of State agencies or bodies.  I will not go into the details of recent appointments although I saw yesterday that there had been appointments to a semi-State body which were so blatantly political that there can be no other reason for them except that one person had a loyalty to one party and the other had a loyalty to another.  The people concerned are not here to defend themselves so I will not name them but we have seen people appointed by Governments time and again who have no qualifications for the positions except their loyalty to a political party.  That is untenable in the case of State-sponsored bodies and agencies and it is unforgivable and unacceptable in the case of universities.</P>
      <P>The other area where there is such blatant scope for political interference that it is impossible to accept is in admissions.  In section 34(1), where the chief officer makes a report on admissions according to various criteria, with which many of us would agree, there is a phrase which betrays a thinking behind this Bill which is deadly dangerous.  That subsection states &ldquo;...the chief officer, in preparing the statement, shall have regard to such policies on those matters as may from time to time be determined by the Minister.&rdquo;. There is unlimited scope for political interference in that phrase and it is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Nowhere in that section is there mention of academic ability or prowess.  I have read it many times and it seems to me that people can be admitted to universities on criteria which are different from academic criteria or the passing of certain examinations, that the Minister of the day has the power to say certain minorities are under-represented, and he may direct the chief officer, therefore, to report with them in mind and, if he does not produce the right report, send him back to produce another one.  That is not an exaggeration because we legislate for exceptions and not for the rule.  The result could be that significant minorities without any academic abilities will be admitted to universities before people with academic qualifications simply because they are minorities.  That is unacceptable and is open to political abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> Those are two specific problems with the Bill but it also contains rigid guidelines which are totally unnecessary.  The power in section 8 to incorporate an educational establishment into a university is extraordinary and unnecessary.  Again it gives a Minister power over academic standards. Two sections deal with this issue.  One is the section which allows the Minister to consider that an educational institution or part of it should form part of a university.  He or she may then make an order to provide that the institution shall become part of that university after what is called &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.  That word appears time after time in this Bill but it means nothing.  It is purely a political fig leaf for giving more ministerial power.  When I see the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; in this Bill, I see red because it means that the Minister may consult, ignore the consultation and then decide.  It is meaningless and it is wrong to put it into the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9, provides that the Minister may set up an educational institution as a university where the Minister &ldquo;may, at any time, appoint a body, the membership of which shall be recommended by An tÚdarás and shall include international educational experts and such employees of universities to which this Act applies... [and they can recommend]... an educational institution should be established as a university.&rdquo;. Why should a Minister, a politician, decide that an educational institution should be established as a university?  It is no good saying that international experts will be involved.  That is meaningless. Who will be these international experts, these people who we suddenly decide are experts?  Is that the subjective decision of a politician who sets up a committee to decide that an educational institution will be a university and chooses those people to be on that panel?  There is no place in legislation for so-called international educational experts.  It means nothing.  It is rhubarb and it is cosmetic.  Wherever there is anything dangerous in the Bill, cosmetic fig leaves are inserted to make it look innocent.</P>
    <P>The power of setting up a university is specifically with the Minister and that is open to abuse. I would not go so far as to say that there has been abuse but it is open to abuse.  No number of so called international experts making so called recommendations will make any difference.  The power here is in the hands of the Minister.  It is no good saying, as it does in certain sections of the Bill, that there is no need to worry because an order must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas before various of these powers can be enacted.  Everybody knows that is cosmetic.  The provision for an order to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas or passed by the Oireachtas is a rubber stamp inserted into the Bill as some sort of phoney democratic protection.</P>
    <P>Throughout its provisions this Bill is about ministerial power, which goes right up to the establishment of a university.  Unscrupulous Ministers could if they felt like it, establish universities in favoured political places to curry favour <Col N="1239" /> with various people in their own party.  That could easily be done regionally and it undoubtedly will be.  I am not saying it has been done but it will be done.  Places which do not deserve university status on academic merit alone will be granted it by politicians because it will benefit their careers as well as their political parties.  This section, like others throughout the Bill, is open to appalling abuse and there is no doubt it will be abused in the future.  It is in the nature of party politicians to favour their own and use patronage of this sort to benefit themselves.  No one can blame them for that and much of politics is about that, but they should not be given those powers by this House if it can prevent it.  We are here to protect people from being put in a position of deriving advantage from that type of abuse.</P>
    <P>Opportunities for availing of this type of abuse are set out in many sections of this Bill.  The three most blatant examples are admissions, political appointees and the fact that the Minister can create a university and thereby decide what is or is not a university.  A little bit of rhubarb may cloud the decision but there is no preventative of any sort.  Neither do I see why any Government should decide the objects of a university as defined in this Bill.  They happen to be an ideology which nearly everybody in this House accepts and agrees with at the moment.  We are, however, blatantly setting political ideas and ideology into legislation and that is not necessary.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why universities cannot define their objects within the law because academics know more about academia than politicians. People who work in universities know more about what a university should be and what they want it to be, than politicians.  There is often a direct conflict between politicians and those who work in universities.  That should be resolved in favour of the universities, not the party politicians but this Bill appears to resolve that particular problem in favour of politicians.</P>
    <P>I salute the Opposition for opposing this Bill because it will inherit the Bill one day &mdash; maybe not this week or the week after, but sooner rather than later.  I look forward to the day they amend it to take on the serious objections they have raised.  I will, hopefully, be here to remind them of that when it comes to pass.</P>
    <P>This exercise of ministerial power is unworthy of any Government.  The governance of a university should not be included in the Bill.  Nobody has answered the question why can universities not decide on their own governance structure. What have they done that is so wrong as to warrant this meddling which appears throughout the Bill?  As far as I know, universities have behaved impeccably as regards their own self governance in the past.  It is amazing that those who, with such enthusiasm and alacrity, champion semi-State bodies which have singularly failed to run themselves properly, now want to increase the power of Government to take over universities &mdash; which have done nothing improper or which is <Col N="1240" /> the cause of serious complaint &mdash; and treat them like semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>The Government ought to examine the semi-State bodies because there is hardly one in the country which is being run properly.  Until recently they were just some sort of a job subsidy or blotting paper.  Yet, now we apparently want universities, which have not had any scandals or controversies attached to them, treated in that way.  Why?  Because when politicians become too doctrinaire they think they know better than the people in the universities.</P>
    <P>Trinity College, Dublin, has been there for over 400 years but the Labour Party knows more. It knows how to run it.  It wants to send in a Labour Party police force of political appointees as well as having county councillors on the board. County councillors on the board of universities? County councillors have wonderful and magnificent talents, but to put them on the board of a university is the most absurd suggestion I ever came across.</P>

      <P>However, here we have visitors of the most extraordinary sort being appointed to the board by the Minister.  Why should the Minister appoint visitors to the board of a university? On top to this, we have a specific provision that it may be a High Court judge, apparently after consultation with a Supreme Court judge.  Is there something so sacred about High Court judges that they should be visitors to universities?  I would remind Senator Manning that High Court judges are politically appointed.  High Court judges are not in any way impeccable people; they have stood for the Dáil and the Seanad. They are worthy people, of course, but they are no better or worse than anybody else, although they are good High Court judges.  They are appointed by politicians &mdash; by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour.  They do not have any great insight into how universities work but sometimes they know a lot about politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" /> Let us not window dress.  Let the universities look after themselves.  Let us trust them.  Let us not use a veneer of respectability to cloak some of the political interference suggested in this Bill. That is not acceptable and it will not deceive anyone.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister made 104 amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  That shows how completely out of touch this Government is with the universities.  This Bill is not perfect because it still contains an ideology which is not that of Fine Gael, regardless of whether its members march through the voting lobbies.  It is not my ideology either.  This Bill is unacceptable to those who believe in pushing the State out of academic life and people's lives, out of State bodies, industry and every conceivable place where it should not have its nose.</P>
    <P>Members of Fine Gael, who believe in its philosophy, will not find it easy to accept this Bill. There is no point in being a member of Fine Gael and pretending it will be easy to accept.  This Bill would not have been introduced if there were not a Labour Minister for Education.  That is what is meant by political power.  I have no personal or political problems with the Minister <i>per se,</i> but I have problems with the Bill and the thinking behind it and so will many members of the Fine Gael Party when they read and understand it. There is no point in pretending I do not.</P>
    <P>Academic bodies should not be interfered with in this way.  They have something special to offer but it is extremely dangerous to shove the jackboot of the State down their throats.  I do not understand why the academic council is mentioned in this Bill or why the Government must decide its composition.  Section 26(3) states that the &ldquo;chief officer shall be, <i>ex officio,</i> a member of the academic council&rdquo; and that he will also be the chairman of the board.  The Minister will know that the code of conduct in public companies strongly disapproves of making the same person a chief executive and a chairman because it puts too much power in one person's hands.  If a person has a loyalty to a political party, not only is he or she chairman and chief executive but that person is also, <i>ex officio,</i> a member of the academic council.  Why?</P>
    <P>The board and the academic council have different functions.  A chief executive of a university could be someone with no academic qualifications and an officer could be an executive who has been appointed because of particular qualities. However, they should not be chairing the academic council because they know nothing about academics.  They could be appointed because the university is in financial trouble or to get students in from a certain area.  According to this Bill, they must chair the board and they must be on the academic council, <i>ex officio,</i></P>
    <P>This Bill states the proportion of people who should be on the board but it allows the academic council to decide its own procedure.  Its composition is defined by the Bill.  That is ludicrous.  The Government seems to know more about the composition <Col N="1242" /> of the academic council than the academic council.  This is not snobbery but common sense.  One cannot have people who do not know much about it interfering as if they know better than those who do; they do not.  Academic councils should be allowed to run their own affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the thinking behind the provision that if the chairperson of the board is not the chief officer somebody else must be elected by a two thirds majority.  If they do not want the chief officer as chairperson of board, why not make a decision about someone else? Does the Government not trust the boards of universities to make majority decisions?  Why does it have to be a two thirds majority?  Is that because someone might be acceptable to a minority one third on whom the Government can exert pressure? It is an extraordinary requirement that these people cannot run their own affairs by a majority verdict.  That is like saying the Leader of the Labour Party should be elected by two thirds of the members of the Labour Party at an annual conference. I do not know who needs protection but there is no reason for this.</P>
    <P>I will find it difficult to vote for this Bill because of its real thrust which is manifest in its detail.  If there is scope for amendments along the lines I have outlined, I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in her reply.  If there is no scope for such amendments, I will vote against the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now almost 16 months since the Seanad debated a Progressive Democrats motion in which we asked the House to reject any attempt by the Government and the Minister for Education to interfere with the governance and charter of Trinity College Dublin or to weaken the autonomy of the colleges of the National University of Ireland.  Many Senators contributed to the vigorous debate on that occasion.  However, the motion was defeated by 27 votes to 22.  It represented an effort by the Progressive Democrats to persuade the Minister to reconsider what we regarded as bad proposals in her position paper and an attempt to get her to radically change this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In her speech last week the Minister conceded that the debate had a considerable influence on the content of the Bill and that it was a far cry from the position paper.  She also asserted that it was broadly acceptable to the university community and the wider society.  I challenge that assertion and I repeat what I said here on 30 November 1995.  Under a camouflage of liberal words the Minister proposes an unwarranted intrusion into an area in which the State has no business. We have an already over-centralised State and now we want to spread its tentacles even farther. There is control where there should be freedom, statism where there should be autonomy and we want a university to be treated as a semi-State company.  So much for the liberalism and pluralism <Col N="1243" /> that are central to university life which I espouse and which I hope the Minister does also.</P>
    <P>The Minister has constructed a bewitching framework of reasonableness and reassuring words with which no one could disagree &mdash; I do not.  She said &ldquo;legislating for the university sector calls for a particularly sensitive approach&rdquo;.  Who could disagree with that?  She said &ldquo;an independent university sector is a guarantor of freedom in our democratic society&rdquo;.  Who could disagree with that?  I do not.  She said &ldquo;Universities in this State have rightly guarded their academic freedom and independence since their foundation.&rdquo; Amen, Amen to each of those statements but how can those statements be reconciled with the Bill before us?  I do not see how.  I do not understand how the Minister can claim the Bill will underpin vital academic and institutional freedoms because it does not represent, as she claims, &ldquo;a measured and proportionate involvement of the State and its agencies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What was it that led Dr. Garret FitzGerald, former Taoiseach, leading member of Fine Gael, distinguished academic and prominent citizen to claim that he thought this was quangoism and Thatcherite?  This Bill is very different in content from that which was originally put before us but it is not different in substance &mdash; the control of a sector by the State which does not need it to the extent proposed in the Bill.  University College Galway's statement on the Bill summarises very succinctly what the Bill should achieve.  It stated:</P>
    <P>There should be a balance between providing on the one hand an appropriate legislative embodiment of the need for accountability to the public in respect of the use of public funds and, on the other, an affirmation of the freedoms which are absolutely necessary if the university is to discharge its unique role in society.</P>
    <P>It is also worth recalling that UCG does not believe the Bill strikes this balance and I agree with its analysis.  UCG also said that the Bill is virtually exclusively concerned with elaborating a regulatory regime for universities which would utterly paralyse them from acting as creative, innovative or efficient institutions in respect of research, scholarship or teaching.  That is a forceful criticism.</P>
    <P>A letter sent recently to Senators by a group of people in the University of Limerick points to the failure of the Bill to provide adequately for academic freedom and to confer rights in regard to academic freedom on university employees and it asks that amendments would be made in respect of those matters, which we will attempt to do on Committee Stage.  The Irish Federation of University Teachers noted that the Bill had defects and that they may be classified broadly into those which threaten the autonomy of universities and those which curtail drastically the academic freedom of university staff.  Despite all the reassurances, fine words and changes, we are still left with a bad Bill.  In spite of virtually <Col N="1244" /> redrafting the Bill, with 142 amendments on Report Stage in the Dáil, this Bill should not be before us because the central point of the debate is that political interference is anathema to the very idea of a university and academic freedom.</P>
    <P>The Government would have us believe that having withdrawn from its original position and made such changes the Bill is acceptable.  The Minister suggested this to us when she said it was acceptable to a large proportion of the university sector and to society as a whole.  It would have been better and more acceptable to withdraw it and reintroduce it.  The nature of this debate goes to the very heart of what we believe a democracy to be&mdash;the concept and a belief that within it, universities must be ever free to debate and bring forward ideas that challenge, provoke us and are even at times distasteful to us and challenge the established order.  That is one of the central and key roles of universities and is one of the reasons for advancement in society.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions when this was debated in November 1995 that universities had to change and, because of that, legislation was required.  Of course universities have to change and in many respects the changes which originated within universities went through society.  That is why, in some quarters, universities would be regarded as dangerous but it is central to intellectual and academic life and society that those freedoms be protected, preserved and enhanced.  I have no illusions about dreaming spires and people living in ivory towers.  That is not what universities are about, although it is legitimate for some people to do so.  Nevertheless, a university in the heart of society does not have to be regulated by the State.</P>
    <P>I was privileged to have come from a rural background in the 1960s and to have been given the benefit of university education when it was rare for somebody of my background.  I was exposed to all aspects of university life&mdash;the unrest in France and throughout university society which pushed many people into Labour Party politics.  I assure the Minister that the establishment of the day regarded us as extremely dangerous, subversive and probably even to be tinkering with the foundations of the State. Nevertheless, we had an improved society and I benefited from it.  It exposed me to a world that I otherwise would never have been privileged to experience and opened up intellectual horizons to which I never would have been exposed.</P>
    <P>We have to realise what is at stake and what it is possible to achieve through the university sector. I agree with the Minister there should be financial accountability of universities but this Bill is not required for that.  It is already possible to do that through the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Office and the Higher Education Authority. Autonomous bodies can be accountable and transparent.  It does not require rigid control to exercise accountability and transparency.</P>
    <P>Parts of this Bill are desirable and unnecessary and many parts are both unnecessary and <Col N="1245" /> undesirable.  The one necessary and desirable part is the constitution of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, as a constituent university within the National University of Ireland and the formalisation of the status of the University of Limerick and Dublin City University.  I welcome that, but it could have been done by way of a short Bill without any of the further ramifications in this Bill for the entire university sector.</P>
    <P>The question which then arises is why it was not possible to include the Dublin Institute of Technology as a university in the Bill.  Deputy Keogh tabled an amendment in the other House which proposed that within three years of the commencement of the Bill the Minister would make an order providing that the Dublin Institute of Technology would be a university for the purposes of the Act.</P>
    <P>I wonder what makes that impossible when one looks at the record of the colleges which make up the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Many of our most distinguished architects were educated in Bolton Street which could legitimately claim to be the leading architecture school in the country. Many graduates of Cathal Brugha Street are at the top of their profession and it also has a reputation for excellence.  Surely, that is part of what a university is about.</P>
    <P>In today's <i>Irish Independent</i> the education editor, John Walshe, said in respect of the Dublin Institute of Technology that &ldquo;the Government's view seems to be that there is a bit of opportunism involved and that the Dublin Institute of Technology, which is in the throes of being reorganised on a faculty basis, is not yet ready for university status&rdquo;.  It is an affront to say there is opportunism involved.  The claims are quite legitimate and it is legitimate to seek to have the Bill amended in either House to give the Dublin Institute of Technology full university status.</P>
    <P>Conferring degrees does not give a body the status of a university &mdash; the two matters should not be confused.  There are colleges in England which confer degrees but are a long way from being universities.  That must be attended to.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Dublin Institute of Technology that it underwent an international review in 1996.  The international review team suggested &ldquo;The relevant authorities should consider whether the key features of the proposed legislation should be extended to the Dublin Institute of Technology and its legislation amended in the light of such analysis&rdquo;.  If we have done that, why do we have to go through the whole rigmarole again just to put off the day?  If it is not such a problem, I do not see why it cannot be put in the Bill.  If it is going to happen eventually, I do not see why it cannot be done now and why the Dublin Institute of Technology cannot be afforded university status.</P>
    <P>In regard to the National University of Ireland, I welcome the creation of the individual universities in Cork, Galway, Dublin and St. Patrick's in Maynooth.  However, I do not understand why it is necessary to retain the NUI as a layer above <Col N="1246" /> that.  I do not see why the functions which are conferred on the NUI under the Bill could not be conferred on the individual universities.  They are either universities or they are not; they are either universities with constituent colleges or independent universities.  In those circumstances, I fail to see why it is necessary to retain the NUI as a sort of holding company for a group of universities. Each university can be responsible for its own academic affairs and they do not require the guiding hand of this other layer, particularly now that they are no longer colleges.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why it is necessary to construct this bureaucratic and intrusive edifice around the few necessary and desirable provisions in the Bill.  Regional boards are being set up under the Education Bill and I think a similar philosophy applies to this Bill.  Layer upon layer is being introduced which makes one wonder who is accountable within those layers and how the chain of command is exercised.  There are measures in the Bill which I consider desirable, but they could have been dealt with in a much briefer Bill which would have been much less contentious and would not have introduced an extra dimension of intrusion into the affairs of the universities.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Ross in regard to country councillors' positions on the governing body of University College, Dublin.  County councillors are as legitimate a cross-section of society as any other group.  If it is regarded as desirable to have external influences within the university structure, I do not see why county councillors are not as good a group of people as any other.</P>
    <P>Over the course of the debate many references have been made to the excellence of our education system.  We all agree it is an excellent system, that we produce third level graduates of the highest calibre who can hold their own internationally and are responsible for bringing investment into the country, and that there is a scarcity of graduates in some sectors.  That begs the question that if the system is so excellent, why is it necessary to change it?  I cannot find a satisfactory answer to that question.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee stated during the previous debate:</P>
    <P>If our goods were nearly as competitive as our graduates in international markets we would not have had many of the economic problems we have had, and still have, in the indigenous sector.  That is not to say we cannot improve.</P>
    <P>If the excellence is proven, why it is necessary to change it, other than in a short Bill which would confer university status on St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, and the other institutions of learning? The central question which keeps cropping up in the debate has not been answered at any stage &mdash; what is it that needs to be fixed?  As the adage which has been used over and over during the debate says, &ldquo;If it ain't broke, why fix it?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons we have such excellence is because the universities, especially Trinity College, <Col N="1247" /> Dublin, operate independently.  The ultimate accountability is that people vote with their pockets and feet.  If a university does not provide the type of education which is competitive and which allows its graduates to stand up internationally, people will go to other institutions and the institution will decline.  Over the course of history educational institutions have closed or flourished because of the leadership provided, the ethos or, in the case of some very prominent secondary schools, who the headmaster was.</P>
    <P>I do not want to reopen the debate on the interference in Trinity College, Dublin.  However, sections of the Bill will only apply when the Minister makes an order.  The explanatory memorandum states in relation to section 4:</P>
    <P>... particular sections will not apply in relation to Trinity College, unless the Minister makes an Order applying them.  The Minister shall not make an Order if a Private Act is enacted within three years of the commencement of Part III, which amends the Charter of the College in a manner consistent with this Act.</P>
    <P>Why should the onus be placed on Trinity College, Dublin, to bring a private Bill into the Houses of the Oireachtas, other than to overcome some constitutional imperative about which we are worried?  I do not see why it should be up to TCD, or anybody else, to introduce a private Bill to counter something put in an Act by the Oireachtas.  That strikes me as totally undemocratic and must be resisted.</P>
    <P>What about the assets of Trinity College, Dublin? There are provisions in the Bill about what happens to assets in certain circumstances.  Does the State have its beady eyes fixed on this very valuable piece of real estate in College Green, and probably the even more valuable book in the college?  Is that part of what we are talking about here?  I would like it explicitly stated that it is not.</P>
    <P>Trinity College is over 400 years old and has successfully survived rebellion, war, monarchies, changes of Government and the creation of the State.  It is recognised internationally by authoritative independent assessment, yet the Government does not believe it can conduct its own affairs.  I do not understand that.  Its intrusion is incompatible with the attainment of academic excellence and standards.  Is it suggested that there be academic cloning and a common standard across all institutions, with the State producing a standardised product?  That would not survive in today's world.</P>
    <P>These institutions should be allowed manage their own affairs and set their own academic standards. They are subject to verification by their peers and external examining systems where applicable.  That should be adequate.  No Government should be able to stamp its imprint on an educational institution.  If we want academic cloning we should establish a State university, a Labour Party university or any other party's university.</P>
    <P>Section 12 sets out the objects of a university <Col N="1248" /> while section 13 provides for their implementation. What do the objects of a university have to do with legislation?  The objects of UCD, UCG or Trinity College are obvious and do not need to be included in legislation.  To do so defies the 400 year history of Trinity College and the history of the National University.</P>
    <P>We spent a long time trying to insert a clause in the Employment Equality Bill to protect the ethos of schools and hospitals while at the same time protecting the rights of employees, and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform introduced amendments.  In the case of one Bill, therefore, we struggle to preserve ethos while this Bill prescribes what it is.  That defies logic; we must have consistency.</P>
    <P>Under section 19 the Minister may appoint a visitor to a university.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Where there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that there has been a breach by a university of the laws, ordinances or statutes governing it, the Minister, after giving a university an opportunity to make its case and with the agreement of the Government, may request that the Visitor to the university enquire into aspects of the operation of the university.</P>
    <P>On section 20 it states:</P>
    <P>Where ... the Minister, having considered the views of the university, is of the opinion that a governing authority is performing its functions in a manner which breaches the laws, statutes, or ordinances governing it and that the governing authority should be suspended, and the Visitor concurs, the Minister may recommend to the Government the suspension of the governing authority.</P>
    <P>That gives undue latitude to act.  If a Minister wished to be vindictive it would be easy to find circumstances to get rid of the governing authority. That goes too far.  It has nothing to do with the State and should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Will the 48 hour week, which is the subject of other legislation, be imposed on the universities? If so, many academics would be out of business because some of them appear to work morning, noon and night.  It is this degree of commitment to their calling that produces excellence.</P>
    <P>I am informed that we are at the bottom of the league in terms of State investment as a percentage of GDP in our universities.  We need to focus on this area, yet we will rapidly get to the top of league in terms of State meddling if this Bill becomes law.  The chief officer or whoever is in charge of the university will be tied up with administrative accounting and management procedures. This should not be the primary focus, rather it should be on the excellence of the institution and on ensuring that it competes at that level, both domestically and internationally.</P>
    <P>I understand that the grant to Trinity College in 1995 was £31.6 million.  VAT and other deductions produced a net figure of £13.6 million <Col N="1249" /> for 12,000 students.  Since 1991 the State provided £14 million by way of capital funding and £8 million for the dental hospital.  However, significantly, £20.4 million was invested by private finance and through fund raising.  This exceeds what the State invested and it is certain that it would not have been forthcoming if the quality of the institution was not at its present high level.</P>
    <P>Would the Bill have been changed were it not for the mathematical complexion of this House and the fact that the Government is in a minority? The Seanad can defeat or significantly alter the Bill.  The university Senators have a primary role in this.  Will the House return the Bill to the Government for further consideration?  It would be no harm if there was a rethink.</P>
    <P>While I accept the urgent need to have Maynooth and the other centres of learning constituted under the Bill, there would be no difficulty in doing this were it not for the other matters included in it.  In view of this, any delay to the passage of the Bill would not be due to resistance on this side of the House; it would not have been there had the legislation been simpler and more straightforward.</P>
    <P>The Bill is fundamentally wrong and must be opposed.  How will it improve the quality and delivery of third level education?  It will achieve neither of those objectives.  The State should be rolled back.  We got rid of the sugar and shipping industries and they are flourishing.  Why is it necessary to impose these regulations on the universities when they are already flourishing?  The connection between the State and the universities should be minimal.  The only area where it is required is in the regulation of the disbursement of moneys to ensure that they are properly used. This can be done by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the HEA.  Autonomy and academic freedom must be protected.  The question of subsidiarity and the necessity to devolve decision making downwards is regularly debated in these Houses, yet this Bill now provides that the universities should not make their own decisions.</P>
    <P>I am a liberal and because of this I cannot accept the Bill.  My liberalism believes that there should be pluralism within our society, that people should be allowed make their own decisions, that the State should not intrude into areas that do not belong to it and that autonomous bodies can be accountable and transparent.  The Latin phrase <i>e pluribus unum</i> means &ldquo;one out of many&rdquo; and that is how a state and a democracy develops. We gain our strength from diversity, which must be maintained.  It is totally inappropriate to impose a universal system on a sector which should be diverse.</P>

      <P>It is easy to understand the Senator's philosophy.</P>
      <P>Any legislation is bound to attract division and different opinions.  I do not have the advantage of a university education but I value the opinions of people I met over the years and with whom I discussed various issues.  I intend to quote the views of such a person later.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing this necessary legislation.  Times are changing and legislation must be introduced to keep up to date. I received many submissions on the Bill and I wish to quote a person who has been a great friend of mine over the years.  I worked with him on several committees and I value his opinion highly.  I intend to quote extracts from his submission because it is important.  His name is Mr. Donal Nunan, a former College lecturer in economics at University College Cork from 1962 to 1994.  He said:</P>
      <P>My philosophy is that universities derive their distinctive ethos from the principle of academic freedom, which should permeate every aspect of their structures.  It makes for a decentralised system, the driving force of which is the individual academic rather than the departmental head or the chief officer.  Under this model, the administrative structures exist to support, rather than direct, the academic function in so far as resources of the university allow.  This is the collegiate model of a university as distinct from the bureaucratic model which appears to have had a strong influence on the thinking behind the Universities Bill in its present formulation.  This may not be too surprising, as I understand that the heads of the universities had a significant input into the consultation process.</P>
      <P>Universities should also be regarded as international institutions, devoted to research and learning; when used to achieve narrow local (e.g. national) objectives prescribed for them, they are diminished as universities.  For example, promoting the use of the Irish language would come into this category, whereas universities should only be involved in Irish as a subject for scholarship and learning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inherited models of our older universities are unfortunately elitist, which is inappropriate under our democratic egalitarian Constitution of today.  In the 1970s, attempts were made (at UCC, at least, under the presidency of Donal McCarthy) to diminish their elitist character.  Unfortunately, in recent years, probably arising from the time that resources available to the universities were curtailed (e.g. in <Col N="1251" /> the 1980s), their elitist character has been strengthened, as increasing power gravitated towards the administrative function.</P>
    <P>I would see the proposed university legislation as an opportunity for this elitism to be confronted and eliminated once and for all, despite the existing strong academic interests vested in same.  As a bold step, there was an opportunity for the Bill to impose the principle of equal status on all permanent academic staff, so as to sanitise our universities from their colonial past, as they face into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to take issue with the now common practice of referring to the work of academic staff in relation to students as &lsquo;teaching&rsquo;, and to university lecturers as &lsquo;teachers&rsquo;.  This is misleading; universities are learning institutions; the lecturers/professors do not &lsquo;teach&rsquo; the students; the latter teach themselves.  Academics can vary a lot in their &lsquo;teaching&rsquo; abilities.  Universities tend to appoint staff on their scholarly record and promise, rather than on their &lsquo;teaching&rsquo; abilities.  Admittedly, the term &lsquo;university teacher&rsquo; is frequently used, even by academics themselves.  It is also mentioned in the Charters of the NUI and of its constituent colleges.  My own theory is that this (misleading) terminology came to be used as a common denominator between the terms &lsquo;lecturer&rsquo; and &lsquo;professor&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>I considered it worthwhile to quote that submission. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister's initiative in introducing the legislation.</P>

      <P>Ní bheidh mé i bhfad leis an méid atá le rá agam.  I am not sure whether I am fit to address the House because I was only a county councillor before I progressed.  I only received a national school education but I do not blame my family or anybody else for that.  Our circumstances at the time meant I did not have the opportunity to progress.  I oppose the Bill but I also oppose the views of Senator Ross.  He should apologise to me and other councillors for calling us political hacks.  I was one of eight people elected to the governing body of UCD in 1985 by the General Council of County Councils and I was nominated again by successive Ministers for Education.  When the current Minister appointed me to the governing body, I wrote to her and thanked her.  I again thank her, although we disagree about this Bill.</P>
      <P>The disgraceful remarks of Senator Ross should be struck from the record of the House.  I am a fair person and I am not biased in favour of anybody or their political affiliations.  However, according to Senator Ross, Members of this House are not fit to be in his company because he is far above us.  I reject that view because it reflects attitudes in other parts of this country.  If Senator Ross is voicing such attitudes, it will be difficult to live here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was honoured to travel with the Leas-Chathaoirleach to Poland and Lithuania last year <Col N="1252" /> on an important mission for Ireland.  That was the first Irish delegation ever to visit Lithuania.  We had an important mission as the Government had ratified Lithuania's accession to the EU.  We went to the University of Vilnius and I was sorry at the time we did not have a message from the Irish universities or the Minister for Education. Through the years, the Lithuanians were persecuted because of their education.  Many educated people disappeared.  Because I was on the governing body of UCD, the Leas-Chathaoirleach asked me to address the Director of the university. I felt proud of that, as a common county councillor with no education from Dingle who is not fit for the governing body of UCD.  Senator Manning and I have sat on that governing body for many years and I admire it.  I have contributed to its discussions and represented the people of rural Ireland who are looking for education. Their problems need to be heard by the governing body, who listened to them and in 1985 and 1986 I was instrumental in getting dormitories built in UCD.  Senator Manning headed the committee which dealt with that.  Anyone would think I am speaking in favour of the Minister's Bill but I wish to put the record straight as far as Senator Ross's contribution is concerned.  It hurt me deeply.</P>
    <P>I will not go deal with the Bill section by section now.  We will do so later if the Bill passes Second Stage this evening.  However, some sections deserve comment and I return to the matter of county councillors.  I will oppose that aspect of the Bill.  I was one of eight councillors elected by the general council of county councils to the governing body of UCD.  According to the Bill, there will be a reduction from eight members to not fewer than two or more than five.  If an amendment to ensure eight members of a local authority stay on the governing body is proposed to that section, it will be very hard for all sides of the House to oppose it.  The Minister should change this.  With the exceptions of the Taoiseach's nominees and the university Senators, all Members here are elected by county councillors. The Minister would be asking Senators, including those on the Government side, to cut their own throats by agreeing to such a section and an amendment will be tabled on this section if the Minister is successful tonight.  I am not putting a gun to her head but someone will do so.</P>
    <P>I am more interested in the quality of our educational system than in the everyday running of colleges.  From my years on the governing body, UCD appears to have been run properly.  I have served under three great presidents of that university: Tom Murphy, Paddy Masterson and Art Cosgrove.  Each worked diligently, as did all members of the governing body and I never saw anything wrong there.  Disagreements between members rarely went to a vote as consensus was usually reached.</P>
    <P>Why is there a need for this Bill?  If the system works, it should continue.  There may be other universities the Minister may want to legislate for, <Col N="1253" /> but that could be achieved under a smaller Bill. This Bill has caused much controversy.  I would prefer to see no interference from the Minister for Education, and I am not referring to the present Minister specifically.  I have seen the system work in UCD and am satisfied it will continue to work.  This Bill implies that the universities are not competent to manage their business. How could they go wrong?  There are 35 people on the governing body of UCD and the Higher Education Authority guides it.  Its finances are audited once a year by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>We are almost in the position that obtained in the University of Vilnius, which was dictated to by a foreign power, communist Russia.  The Russians imposed their culture on Lithuanian, not the native culture.  The Minister is probably genuine in her wish to make changes but she has a lot of opposition in the Seanad.  There was opposition also in the Dáil and there may be opposition on the Government side, minus Senator Ross.  They may have worries about the Bill.  If the Bill passes Second Stage, the Minister should listen to what Senators have said, especially on the matter of county councillors.  The Minister would probably lose a vote on that section.  I wish the Minister luck.  The Bill may be passed but I hope it is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Universities Bill is different from the one that started its journey through the legislative system some months ago.  The Minister listened carefully and has been very responsive to many of the objections to the original proposal.  I do not doubt that other objections will be met during the Bill's passage through the Seanad in the coming weeks.  However, it remains to be seen whether a balance can be struck that is broadly acceptable to the various voices that have been raised.  I applaud the Minister for the great flexibility she has shown, but I am not convinced that the benefits of the measures outweigh the costs and the risks.  My doubts have increased because the beneficial aspects are separate from the dubious ones and they are not contingent on each other.  For example, the status of the NUI colleges and the new universities could be approved without our becoming involved with the concerns expressed about academic freedom and autonomy.</P>
      <P>Does this legislation answer the most urgent needs of the universities?  While the Minister fights her corner and everyone attempts to fend her off, it is easy to forget that basic question. The real issue confronting the third level sector involves the practical matter of resources which is not really dealt with under the Bill.  We have systematically starved third level institutions of the resources they require if they are to become the world class centres of learning that will serve the nation's needs in the 21st century.  To be brutally frank, this legislation is like planning a home extension when one's house is burning down. Nothing in the Bill will improve that basic issue one whit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> From the point of view of resources, the Bill is a gigantic red herring.  It has focused an enormous amount of energy in the Department of Education and throughout the third level sector on precisely the wrong issues.  International comparisons show that Irish people obtain their university education on the cheap.  That we do so is a tribute to the people and the institutions at third level. However, we cannot expect to continue in this manner for much longer.  Any sector which is systematically starved of adequate resources to carry out its job will eventually decline.  Quality assurance and accountability are issues of concern where public funds are involved.  However, no matter how efficient one is, one cannot obtain much more than one pays for.</P>
    <P>The only yardstick in which the Department of Education appears interested is the number of undergraduates that can be churned out under the current system.  In that context, research, which is the lifeblood of any university and which we neglect at our peril, is a crucial element. However, its role does not seem to be properly understood at administrative level.  To state, as the Minister did, that we are interested in quality assurance while seeming to throttle the capability to carry out research is a contradiction in terms.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper which began this process in 1992 was entitled &ldquo;Educating for a Changing World&rdquo;.  Do we realise how much the world is changing?  Indeed, it has already changed during the five years since the publication of that document. In the world into which we are moving, knowledge will be a fundamental asset and I was glad the Minister referred to this when introducing the Bill.  Ireland is perfectly geared to develop that asset and, for the first time in our history, we have the capability to be leaders rather than followers.  What do we do?  We decide it is time to squeeze the third level sector until the pips squeak, instead of recognising that this sector can be the country's most important engine of growth in the information age.</P>
    <P>While the Department of Education has a view of the future the narrowness of which often shocks me, the universities are also far from blameless but perhaps they have been cowed by the constant squeeze on their resources.  For example, neither the universities nor the Department have faced up to the potential of lifelong education. There is almost an unholy alliance to sweep that issue under the carpet.  The Department does not want to tackle it because of the implications regarding resources and the universities are not interested because the model of lifelong education is too far from that with which they have comfortably dealt in the past.  However, the future will not be denied and we must face reality. In a world of constant and accelerating change, people will require continuing education in a way never before witnessed in human history.  If that education is not available to them they will become casualties at increasingly younger ages.</P>
    <P>The general starvation of resources, recent downgrading of research functions of universities <Col N="1255" /> and reluctance to come to grips with lifelong education are the real challenges with which the third level sector is faced.  To what extent are they addressed in the Bill?  The answer to that should frighten everyone.  I do not believe we have adequately considered the future.  I am aware that the Minister intended to do so but is this the type of legislation required for the 21st century?  It is clear that the world is in a state of accelerated change and I do not believe that we have discovered, learned about and grown with this fact. As I stated earlier, there seems to be an unholy alliance against doing so.</P>
    <P>One of my heroes, Jean Monnet, the founder of modern Europe who made change his ally, once recounted a story about the years between the two world wars.  He regarded the British as a people who did not see change as an ally and did not welcome it.  I cannot remember the exact details but he referred to the British delegate to the League of Nations who had a tendency to doze off until a vote was called when he promptly jumped to his feet and stated &ldquo;His Majesty's Government is opposed to that, whatever it is.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that we have failed to recognise the impact of, need for and ability to change. The Minister set out to make the universities capable of meeting the challenges of this changing world independently.  I understand and welcome her efforts to encourage accountability.  To the best of my knowledge the universities are satisfied with the recognition that they must account for all funding they receive, the amount of which is fundamentally greater than in the past.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House better addresses the issue of autonomy than it did when first published. Many people who expressed concern in this regard are now of the view that the autonomy advocated in the Bill will not only be healthy but will also act as a spur to universities to have responsibility for their actions.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago I attended a conference where a guest speaker asked delegates to describe the term &ldquo;management&rdquo; in five words or less. Everyone attempted to give different terms such as &ldquo;leadership&rdquo;, &ldquo;delegation&rdquo; and &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;. The speaker went further and asked us to define the word to someone who had never heard it before.  In that context, we eventually hammered out the term &ldquo;getting results through other people&rdquo;.  With the changes that occurred in recent months and taking account of the concept of the Bill, the Minister has given the universities the autonomy they require.  I no longer have a problem in this regard because the Minister has informed the universities that they have responsibility for their actions and they must account for the funding they receive.  Therefore, I no longer harbour the same concern as others who expressed criticism about the provisions concerning autonomy.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about resources, an issue which is not dealt with in the Bill.  We will have to rely not just on this Minister but on other Ministers if <Col N="1256" /> we are to have the resources.  We must invest far more money to provide the wherewithal needed by third level education.  The universities will have to change dramatically in the next few years. The other night I had dinner in London with Baroness Blackstone, who is likely to be the British Secretary of State for Education if Labour wins the election.  We touched on that subject during an interesting discussion and she mentioned her concepts for the future, which include those I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The universities have not understood the changes they will face and have not geared themselves towards them.  Is it wise for the universities, in which we have invested so much, to be limited to so few weeks per year?  In 20 years, if not earlier, they will ask themselves why they should not have a 52 week year.  I do not suggest that professors will have to give more lectures or do more research but I do not understand the logic of not fully using our assets.  We will have to examine these questions if we are going to cater for life long education or, as Senator Sherlock put it, life long learning.</P>
    <P>We do not discuss the detail of the Bill on Second Stage but I am delighted that in the list of functions of a university in section 12 the first objects of a university are &ldquo;scholarly research and scientific investigation&rdquo;.  There was a danger that these might not be regarded as the foremost functions but thankfully they have been.  We must recognise the importance of research in the universities because it is the life blood of the future and we must concentrate heavily on it.  It is mentioned in the Bill but it will be dependent on resources.  Whether those resources will be available is not a matter for tonight but if we do not stitch that into the record we will have no chance or achieving the sort of universities, education and third level success which we need.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that we have addressed all the concerns regarding the governing authorities? Will what is provided in the Bill be the best practice for running these organisations? Some speakers have criticised its workings.  We can make it work, but the Minister must listen carefully on Committee Stage and decide whether the Bill takes the correct steps.  For instance, would a standing or permanent visitor be best practice in any organisation?  Why have we arrived at this formula?  I look forward to answers and explanations to these points.  This provision has changed since the Bill was initiated and I hope the matter has been given serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is dotted in many locations around the city and I have visited and spoken in many of them.  The institute has designs on a building which would be a suitable centre if it becomes a university.  Having listened to the Minister's words on the future of the Dublin Institute of Technology at the beginning of Second Stage, I am not content that we have taken the right steps.  I look forward to her reply because we face a challenge in deciding whether <Col N="1257" /> Dublin Institute of Technology should become a university and how we determine university status in general.  That is dealt with in section 9.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Bill is quality assurance, a phrase used by the Minister almost every time she has spoken about it.  This House has also set this objective in making sure the Bill provides our students &mdash; not just the young but those who engage in life long learning in years ahead &mdash; with the third level education they want.  I will support Second Stage on the grounds that the Minister has listened carefully in the last few months at other Stages.  I have confidence that she will continue to listen as the Bill passes through the House.  If she does, she will achieve a great deal of what she and the nation wants and we will provide the third level education we want and require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever one feels about the detail of the Bill, this Minister has, ever since its publication, listened to the points of view and attempted to meet needs.  I have many problems with the Bill, which I will mention, but it is grossly unfair to criticise Ministers on the one hand for being inflexible and on the other for listening and taking on board various viewpoints.  There are issues of major concern and I have not fully made my mind up on some of them.  Part of me wishes to take a dog in the manger attitude &mdash; I spent the whole day studying aspects of resources in primary education and I wonder why third level should have a better model.  I am bigger than that, but I still get petty when it comes to walking through the lobbies.</P>
      <P>I was trying to concentrate on first level education but, unfortunately, my attention was drawn by Senator Ross.  I was not sure whether I was being informed, educated or distracted by what he was saying, but I certainly did not learn much from him &mdash; I am sorry he is not here.  I could not find a copy of <i>The Idea of a University</i> by Cardinal Newman but I found an extract on the Internet and I wondered whether it related to Senator Ross's remarks.  Newman wrote that a university&mdash;</P>
      <P>is a place where a thousand schools make contributions, in which the intellect may safely range and speculate, sure to find its equal in some antagonist activity, and its judge in the tribunal of truth.</P>
      <P>The Senator found his &ldquo;judge in the tribunal of truth&rdquo; when Senator Fitzgerald responded in the most elegant and informed of terms.  I was proud to be a fellow Dingle person when he properly and correctly put Senator Ross in his place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I looked at the wrong essay by Newman &mdash; I should have looked at <i>The Idea of an Educated</i><i>Man</i> whose first quality, according to Newman, is tolerance.  I respectfully &mdash; or disrespectfully &mdash; commend that to Senator Ross.  No doubt he would say that Newman had changed sides by the time he wrote that essay &mdash; he can make of that what he will.  Tolerance is one of the great qualities <Col N="1258" /> of education.  I am no paragon of tolerance and am regularly described as the personification of intolerance and irritability.  However, the idea that all education emanates from third level would not be shared by any academic for whom I have respect, nor would it be accepted by any teacher I know.  I did not hear all Senator Sherlock's remarks about teachers and lecturers, but I have a great respect for those in third level who see their role as that of teachers.  It is interesting that great communicators who work in third level, such as Senator Norris, always describe themselves as teachers because they see that as their role.</P>
    <P>The idea that somebody must come through a college and accumulate letters after his or her name in order to be described as intelligent, successful or intellectual, which is what Senator Ross seemed to imply, is extraordinary.  Perhaps Senator Fitzgerald found it equally ironic that on the one hand Senator Ross said he found it extraordinary that a Minister could decide who or what a university might be, yet on the other hand say that a virgin queen 300 years ago could have given the theory and model for universities for 21st century Ireland.  I found that extraordinary and incomprehensible.  Ministers do not decide what universities might be; universities evolve.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross's comments about county councillors were objectionable.  I found myself squirming with embarrassment.  I found it embarrassing to be a graduate.  I am sure my fellow university Senators would agree that we never heard such views advanced from the 100,000 or so NUI graduates on our electoral list.  I would have no time or tolerance for such exclusivity.  At a time when we are pushing for a pluralist, inclusive society, such views are extraordinary.</P>
    <P>It is reassuring to hear that county councillors will retain representation in the future.  I will support Senator Fitzgerald's amendment to retain the existing level of representation for county councillors.  I am sure academics would agree that a balance of representation is important.  The tension of different views is one from which progress can be made.  It is crucial that we do not see ourselves as above and beyond ordinary people.  It is important that universities are not academe behind high walls and out of touch with the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>I do not care whether or not the county councillors involved have graduate qualifications.  That is not important because they will have developed in other ways.  Senator Fitzgerald rightly pointed out that he and I grew up in the same town.  Some of us had opportunities to go to third level education while others did not.  We were reared in a town where if that distinction were allowed to divide us in any way, none of us would be talking to each other today.  We were reared differently and I hope our children are also reared differently. It is not the attitude of an educated person to look down on a person who may or may not have had a third level education.  It goes against the ideas of a university or other education, and <Col N="1259" /> if anyone ever manages to arrive at a definition of education I am sure it would encompass that point.</P>
    <P>Over the last few months the Minister has dealt with some of the issues that would have been of concern to me.  However, they have not all been dealt with.  In coming to a decision on how to vote on a Bill such as this there are always reasons for and against.  I am certain, however, that I will support amendments to the Bill.  I agree with Senator Quinn that the Minister should listen and be prepared to make changes on the basis of the arguments made on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will examine closely the Minister's comments on an issue that is closely related to what I have said about Senator Ross and tolerance and which relates to section 44.  This section refers to the Irish Universities Act, 1908, from which it proposes to delete section 3(2) which states:</P>
    <P>Every professor upon entering into office shall sign a declaration in a form approved by the Commissioners jointly under this Act, securing the respectful treatment of the religious opinions of any of his class.</P>
    <P>I would need to be convinced of the need to delete this provision on the basis of arguments other than administrative concerns.  There would have to be fundamental issues involved.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to delete section 3(3) which states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall apply to any professor of or lecturer in theology or divinity; provided that no test of religious belief shall be imposed by the governing body of either of the two new universities or any constituent college on such professor or lecturer as a condition of his appointment or recognition by the governing body as such professor or lecturer.</P>
    <P>Another change is proposed to section 4(7).  This provision prevented the universities from funding religious institutions.  Although they are not the precise terms in which that subsection is framed, they are close to the provision in the Constitution which does not allow the State to endow religious institutions as such.  I wonder about the implications of deleting section 4(7) of the 1908 Act and I would like a detailed response on this point from the Minister.</P>
    <P>In attempting to deal with the Bill I tried to write a definitive speech on it but I do not think that would do it justice.  The Bill has changed many times and I think it will change again, because the real debate will take place on Committee Stage.  I will support the Bill tonight because I think the Minister has made a great effort to meet various concerns expressed.  She will be put under further pressure by myself and others to meet our concerns about the Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been a huge lobby on this issue from many third level interests.  The people involved are to be commended for their commitment.  Representing university graduates, I sometimes feel <Col N="1260" /> isolated or at a remove because it seems like an exclusive group to represent.  It was heartening to me to receive many views from the universities. They all had one thing in common &mdash; a great care for and a commitment to their institutions.  I did not agree with all the views expressed, but there was a clear articulation of commitment to the institutions and seeking the best for them.  Some institutions have slightly different perspectives because there may be different regimes in those institutions.  It can be difficult to take that on board.  One of the issues raised by Senator Ross was the chairperson and chief executive issue and I would not disagree completely with him on that point.  However, knowing the reasons for the provision, we should show some tolerance.</P>
    <P>I sought advice from various groups.  I spoke to my colleagues in the Irish Federation of University Teachers, who outlined their reservations about the Bill, which they have also expressed to the Minister.  I will be raising the issues of tenure, security of tenure and commitment to the protection of status and entitlements.  IFUT's overall view was that it was supportive of the Bill subject to changes being made on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A series of issues was raised strongly by staff from Limerick University, and a number of Senators have referred to those concerns.  They are significant issues.  The staff have suggested various amendments which should be examined on Committee Stage.  The Minister should consider the amendments because they will not change the overall aims of the Bill but will help those people to accommodate themselves to her ideas.  Senator Quinn's point about implementing change is important.</P>
    <P>In education values are passed on from one generation to another.  Although those of us involved in education like to think we are transformers of society we are barely such.  We are lucky if we can open people to change never mind impose change.  Anytime a teacher at any level, but particularly at first level, attempts to go outside the umbrella of consensus of the community they are rapped firmly and quickly on the knuckles.  We are programmed to be careful about how we mould new generations.  It is difficult, therefore, to introduce change.  Opposition is the first reaction to any proposed change in education because it is safe, simple and understood by all parties.  The initial responses to this legislation came from those who found difficulties with it.</P>
    <P>I asked every lobby group I met to say what they felt was positive in the Bill as well as what they found wrong with it.  I impose this approach in my own organisation.  It forces people to balance their arguments.  The people I met were willing to do this and I ask that this be taken on board when I raise issues on Report Stage as a result of having met different groups, particularly the group from Limerick.  The academic staff and students in Limerick want those who elect them to represent them.  They are recommending a minor change which is unnecessary but there are <Col N="1261" /> times when even unnecessary changes should be made.  One of the ways of making change is through accommodating people within the security of the <i>status quo</i> and then moving beyond that point.</P>
    <P>The Senate of the NUI has made it clear that it supports the general thrust of this legislation in that it gives discretion, authority and autonomy to the constituent colleges.  I also welcome that positive evolution.</P>
    <P>There will be significant debate on the structure of the governing bodies.  Many different views will be aired.  The Minister can take it that some changes will be made.  We should discuss what changes are acceptable.  It may be necessary to see how the different needs can be further accommodated.  I will be supporting the retention of the representation of the county councillors on the governing bodies.  I am one of the few Senators not dependent on the votes of county councillors for elections so I am independent on this issue.  County councillors should be retained on the governing bodies.  We spill blood if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The idea of quality assurance is important in every level of education.  The Minister is aware of the importance I attach to this at first, second and third level.  I am delighted with her initiative on a teaching council.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn's comments on the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I have examined the legislation and appreciate there are difficulties including it in the Bill but I will be supporting its stance.  It made a superb case and it is important that it be recognised.  It should be brought within the scope of this Bill or a commitment should be given to introduce alternative legislation.  I would like to see an addition being made to the Bill.  We are constantly extending the parameters of third level education and I support the case made by the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I have many differences but she has done as much to meet the needs of people as possible on this occasion.  I am not happy with the final results but if we are to meet the needs of everybody, no one group is going to be totally satisfied.  I will support the Bill on Second Stage but will be supporting amendment on Committee Stage and the Minister should be open to accepting them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has gone on for over a year.  We heard a great deal about the history of this Bill, especially from Senator Ross.  My revisionist view of its history is different from that of Senator Ross.  The Bill has been in preparation for a long time and it has been changed. However, that change has been due to an unprecedented degree of consultation.  No legislation during my 15 years as a Member of the <Col N="1262" /> Oireachtas has involved such a wide degree of open-ended consultation where every person or group who had a point of view was given many opportunities to express it.  The Bill in its present form, and it may not be its final form, reflects that degree of consultation.  This is very much to the credit of the Minister and the Bill.</P>
      <P>It has been said that the Bill has been much amended on Committee Stage.  What is the purpose of Parliament if it cannot amend legislation, if the Minister does not consider amendments or introduce the fruits of discussions she has had with those outside?  It is difficult to understand the logic of people who speak of Parliament as a talking shop where nothing every happens, where legislation is never changed, where Ministers come to have their proposals rubber stamped while at the same time denigrate a Bill which has shown the benefit of widespread consultation and change.  I am sure further changes will be accepted by the Minister in the same spirit of openness.</P>
      <P>The main critic of the Bill has been Senator Ross.  I found it difficult to find the central point of his objection in his speech which was full of sound and fury.  He seemed to say that the State has no right to impose legislation on the universities.  The impression was created of a Minister, blinded by ideology, who was riding rough shod over poor, defenceless creatures who had not been consulted about the shape they wanted for their universities. Senator Ross's description, which I have mercifully abbreviated, overlooks one central point.  This legislation, as it now stands, has been discussed in every university forum over the past year.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record where this Bill stands in the league table of university approval.  It has won the approval of the academic councils and the governing bodies of University Colleges Cork and Dublin, Trinity College, the University of Limerick, Dublin City University and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  The heads of these institutions who are members of the Conference of the Heads of Irish Universities publicly affirmed their support for the Bill.  They were involved in widespread consultations with the Minister at all stages of this process and have come out strongly in favour of the Bill which they see as necessary, timely and providing a framework within which their universities can grow and serve the needs of this country over the coming years.  They see it as a framework which provides more freedom for Irish universities than is available in most European countries.</P>
      <P>The Irish Federation of University Teachers and the Union of Students in Ireland have endorsed the Bill's proposals.  It is also on record that the Bill agrees in full with the original request of the Senate of the NUI for the restructuring of universities.  The amendments which have been passed by the Dáil have met with the general endorsement of people who have taken a keen interest in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator Ross refers to the Minister as <Col N="1263" /> jackbooting&mdash;one of the many offensive terms he used &mdash; this legislation through over the bodies of the universities, he is talking arrant and utter nonsense.  At this stage, the Bill has the approval of virtually every significant group involved in Irish university education.  These people want the legislation and they want it soon because it will liberate them and will provide a framework within which the universities can develop.  The notion of an arrogant and ideologically driven Minister keen to impose her personal blueprint on university education is nonsense and does not fit with the facts.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross talked a great deal about statism and about the State moving in on education. Where did Trinity College get its charter but from the State?  The charter of the National University of Ireland is based on an Act of Parliament where the State of the day decided on the best structure for Irish education.  There was far less consultation in 1908 than there has been in relation to this Bill.  It is Senator Ross, not the Minister, who is driven by ideology.  It is Senator Ross who is blinded by free market ideology gone mad and unrestrained capitalism when he talks as he did here this evening.  There is not a scintilla of evidence to support the points he made.  The stakeholders, the people who will be affected by this legislation, have voted and are in favour of the proposals.</P>
    <P>I am not going to indulge in a discussion of the details of the Bill as to who should or should not be represented on the governing bodies.  I am certain the Minister will listen carefully to the points made by Senators Fitzgerald, O'Toole and others as to the composition of those.  The Minister has shown great open-mindedness in her approach to this debate to date.  I am certain that will not desert her when we move onto Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I addressed this House on my proposals for university legislation some 16 months ago.  I have now returned with a Bill which has been the subject of detailed consideration in Dáil Éireann and in this House and which Senators have recognised in their generous contributions tonight.  I welcome the opportunity to debate the Bill in this House and I welcome the vigorous and open debate which has taken place so far.</P>
      <P>In particular, I welcome the recognition of the need for legislation which will reflect the central role of the university in modern society and which has been evident in a large number of contributions here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the Bill had a considerable influence on its content and the manner in which I considered that debate meant responding constructively to concerns and proposals.  I give a commitment here that will continue to be my position on the Bill.  Where amendments are tabled which improve the Bill either in technical <Col N="1264" /> drafting or in achieving its objectives, I will not be found wanting in supporting them.</P>
    <P>A central theme running through most of the contributions in the Second Stage debate has been the need to guarantee the academic freedom and institutional autonomy of universities.  I, too, consider that such freedom and autonomy lies at the heart of the concept of a university.  In these concluding remarks I would like to concentrate centrally on the matters outlined in this House regarding academic freedom.  I want to guarantee that the university, as an autonomous body dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge in an environment which values and protects academic freedom, is properly accountable for its actions.</P>
    <P>The structure of this Bill is one in which academic freedom and respect for ethos and traditions is given a central place.  Section 13 is of crucial importance to the Bill as a whole as it is this section which gives statutory backing to the exercise by governing authorities of their functions. Central to section 13 is subsection (3) which is a clear expression of the rights, entitlements, requirements &mdash; call it what you will &mdash; of a university to regulate its affairs in accordance with its independent ethos and traditions and the traditional principles of academic freedom.  The subsection goes further to safeguard this by providing that where there is a doubt about the interpretation of a provision then an interpretation which will promote academic freedom and the ethos of a university is to be preferred to one which would not do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill could not contain a stronger or more assertive statement.  I am prepared to consider how this statement of principle could be complemented by references in other parts of the Bill. It has been suggested that it should be an object of a university to support and sustain the principles of academic freedom.  Although I believe that the Bill, as drafted, leads inevitably to this conclusion, it is reasonable that proposal, if there remains any doubt about it, could be taken on board on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Related to this is the issue of the extent to which a university should be an agent for promoting academic freedom within its staff and student body.  The Bill makes no specific reference to this because, in my view, it is comprehended within the general provisions relating to the academic freedom which are central to this Bill.  I have been wary of legislating in too prescriptive a manner for matters which are primarily a concern for internal governance and institutional autonomy because the hand of the State seems to be seen where it was never intended to be.  But if there is a genuine concern from people who know the university system intimately that such a protection is necessary, I am prepared to consider proposals to address that concern.</P>
    <P>The issue of freedom of individual staff members raised a concern expressed by Senators O'Sullivan, Kelly and Henry that people who had been elected to a governing body by a particular group of people should be able to express the views of their electorate. <Col N="1265" /> The implication is that because the Third Schedule provides that members of governing authorities shall not act as representative of any special interest, then members are to be silenced from expressing dissenting views.  That was never the intention of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The central rationale to the broadening and democratising of governing authorities is that there would be available to a university a group of people drawn from a variety of experiences and backgrounds relevant to the work and mission of the university.  I take on board the comments of Senator Fitzgerald as he responded to criticism.  The breath of vision and wealth of experience of the different people who have been nominated make the governing bodies reflect the life of Ireland today.  That is important to me and I could not put it better than Senator Fitzgerald did in his contribution.  The value of this is that they can and should articulate the views from their particular perspective.  What should not occur and what the Bill seeks to avoid is that any member, having so expressed his or her views, would then act on behalf of a special interest at the expense of the best interests of the university. This is a matter on which would benefit from further discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A much repeated theme running through the debate on accountability structures is that by legislating on this matter there is somehow an implication that something is seriously wrong in the universities.  With respect to those who hold that view, I consider it to be a very short-sighted one which has never emanated from the institutions involved.  Many of the accountability procedures in our university institutions are non-statutory <i>ad</i><i>hoc</i> arrangements, which have nevertheless served the universities and the country well but times change and the needs of universities and society change.  There is broad agreement in this House, as there was in the Dáil and, indeed, as there is in the universities, on the need for appropriate accountability structures.  There is even broad agreement on the need to update and put on a legislative basis the accountability structures which already exist in the universities.  There are few who would insist that the Oireachtas should wait for a breakdown in the system before addressing this important matter.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that any person who is concerned with the academic freedom and autonomy of universities would approach any provisions on accountability with caution.  I, too, have been concerned to ensure that the provisions for accountability should be proportionate and mindful of the needs of academic freedom and institutional autonomy.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline the accountability structure as provided in the Bill and how it interacts with the central principles of academic freedom and institutional autonomy.  Each university will in each year agree its budget with the Higher Education Authority.  This is already the practice in all the university institutions and it is proposed <Col N="1266" /> to now give it a specific statutory standing.  Once that budget is agreed its disposition within the university will be a matter solely for the governing authority.  Senator Quinn picked up in his reading of the Bill this is the first time that the universities will enjoy such freedom as a matter of statute law.</P>
    <P>Universities will enjoy complete discretion as regards the people it employs.  The Bill requires only that the universities ensure that their selection procedures attract the best possible candidates and that they are open and transparent through the publication of statutes and regulations. Indeed, there will now be increased autonomy for the constituent universities, as no longer will the appointment of senior academic staff in the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland need to be matters in which the Houses of the Oireachtas will have the opportunity to intervene.</P>
    <P>In the case of the remuneration of staff, the Bill provides that in general the Ministers for Education and Finance will approve pay, allowances and pensions.  This is a prudent and reasonable measure to ensure control of public finances, but there is scope in the Bill to address the concern that universities should have freedom to develop pay and conditions packages to attract particular staff.  Sections 24(4) and 24(5) provide that a university and the Higher Education Authority will develop a framework to take account of that need.  The development of this framework will ensure that universities will have the flexibility that is sought.  The purpose of the framework will be to avoid the kind of delays which advance approval for action can create and which may have been created in the past.  Once the framework is in place &mdash; and I have every confidence that one will be agreed &mdash; then the universities will have full autonomy to act within it.</P>
    <P>Balancing this substantial autonomy of universities are a number of provisions aimed at ensuring accountability and transparency.  These include the keeping of accounts, making reports, drawing up plans and developing policies and structures for equality and quality issues.  Some Senators expressed unease at some aspects of these provisions and this can be teased out further on Committee Stage.  I know Senator Fitzgerald wished me good luck.  We might proceed to Committee Stage without his vote, but I am confident that we will have the wisdom of his contribution on Committee Stage.  I am satisfied that a reasonable balance has been struck between the requirements of public accountability and transparency and those of institutional autonomy.</P>
    <P>As I outlined in my opening speech, the principle underlying the provisions relating to governing authorities is that the major stakeholders in a university should be represented on its governing authority by statutory right.  In this way the university can benefit from a range of experiences and perspectives while stakeholders can be confident that the actions and decisions of the governing <Col N="1267" /> authority are taken in the knowledge of their needs and concerns.</P>
    <P>I consider it to be a fundamental objective of the Bill that the stakeholders should have a place as a statutory right on governing authorities.  In general these provisions build on what is already in place in the universities and give to stakeholders, who are at present not included, a statutory right to be present in the highest policy and decision making body of each university.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee raised concerns regarding gender balance on governing authorities.  I consider that section 15(10) will provide the necessary flexibility in regard to gender balance, given that in the section the Minister has the power to determine or approve a gender balance.  The present Government policy is that there should be a minimum of 40 per cent representation from each sex on a governing authority.  The provision will allow a Minister to approve a different gender balance than this so as to provide flexibility which people expect of a Minister where a university has difficulties now in reaching a 40 per cent balance.  If there is a proposal which would result in a more effective and practical manner in attaining gender balance on governing authorities, an aim which we all share, I would certainly be willing to look at this in further discussion.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee also sees the potential for a link between the composition of a governing authority and the composition of academic councils.  In particular, concern was expressed that it would be possible for an academic council to be &ldquo;packed&rdquo; in a manner which would be conducive to the interests of a particular president.  In bringing forward proposals on this matter I have looked at the diversity of practices in the composition of academic councils in operation at present.  I thought that the most important elements that would be included in the Bill would be that the membership of the academic council would have a majority of academics and that the governing authority would decide on the appropriate range of academic discipline and levels to be represented. Students will also have an appropriate representation.</P>
    <P>I would expect that there would be a substantial number of senior academic staff on each council, but I consider that this matter is best left to the individual academic councils and governing authorities to decide.  I consider that I have struck a fine balance but I am open to teasing out the <Col N="1268" /> details of concern on this issue in further discussion as soon as possible on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised an issue that Trinity College may wish to be funded other than by the State at some time in the future and that the Bill should provide for this possibility.  I am aware that the college has relatively recently, in terms of its long history, begun to receive State funding. I must point out that the period during which the college has been in receipt of such funding has been a period of massive growth and expansion for the college and in many ways the college is very different now than when it was entirely privately funded.  If any university was to decide to seek to be funded otherwise than through public funds this would raise a large number of issues, not least the protection of the interests of students and the public interest generally.</P>
    <P>There are no simple solutions to these issues and, indeed, they are issues which may not need to be addressed at all.  However, it may, as the Senator has indicated, be necessary to put a signal in the Bill for reasons of maintaining the autonomy of the institution.  The Long Title already does this and a similar indication in the substance of the Bill is an issue which we could consider with further debate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have noted the contribution of Senator Ross and I also heard the points that Senator Sherlock made.  I thank Senator Quinn, who answered Senator Dardis's question about the need to plan for the future of a changing world better than I might have done when he pointed out that the future will not be denied. This Bill seeks to provide a framework to enable universities to continue to grow and develop into the next millennium having regard to the traditional freedoms of the university.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said he might not always be known for his tolerance, but I would say he might be slightly impatient.  He wishes to realise a vision about primary education which I share.  Next week will give him plenty of opportunity to clap me on the back as I will be meeting him during the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning, the Leader of the House, summed it up very well and put on record the support of the institutions and partners involved in the university sector for this Bill.  He talked about the fruits of change and, if I may say so, on the way to the fruits we have met some thorns and brambles.  Before we pick the harvest there may be some more, but I look forward to that.</P>

      <P>I want to discuss the present overcrowding in Tallaght regional technical college. The Minister has done a lot to develop the regional technical college model over the past five years, so I know she is concerned about this issue.</P>
      <P>Over 1,500 people are involved in second chance education in Tallaght regional technical college since it was established.  It is a major centre of learning for the entire south county region. However, the college is facing a crisis in terms of space.  There are currently 1,650 students in the college but there is only space for 900.  The extension of Tallaght regional technical college has been on the agenda for some time.  I and the students and staff at the regional technical college are confident that a new extension would help to alleviate this problem of overcrowding.</P>
      <P>A huge number of young people are under the age of 18 and they will avail of third level education over the next 20 years.  Tallaght is the third largest conurbation in the country and we want to develop the excellent educational facility there to link in with the many new technology based industries which have located in the south-west region of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister coming to the House to take this issue and look forward to her reply.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Senator for raising the question and I am glad of the opportunity to advise the House on the matter.  The first phase of Tallaght regional technical college was completed in 1992 and was designed to cater for a stock of 1,000 full-time third level students.  An application in respect of the funding for an extension to the college was received by the Department of Education from the college authorities.  The proposed extension comprises lectures theatres, laboratories and staff accommodation.  It is estimated to cost £14.5 million, inclusive of building, fees, fittings, furniture and equipment.  As indicated in the Department's press release of 13 January 1994, a sum of £3.5 million was allocated under the 1994-9 third level European Regional Development Fund programme for capital developments at the college.  I am pleased to confirm that this sum remains available to the college and will allow construction work to commence on the first phase of the extension during 1997.</P>
      <P>My Department is giving consideration at present to the remaining phases of the extension to the college.  A decision in respect of the provision of further capital funding for the project will be taken in the context of other priorities and overall resources available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this matter.  Contract documents for the Fermoy water supply scheme were lodged by Fermoy Urban District Council in the Department of the Environment in September 1996 for ministerial approval with a request that the council be allowed advertise the scheme for public tender. In 1991 I spoke to the then Minister for the Environment who continually refused to allow for the drawing up of contract documents for that scheme.  Had it been allowed, the scheme would have been completed by now.</P>
      <P>The scope of the scheme requires extensions to the existing delivery and distribution network; construction of storage reservoir, water tower and ancillary equipment; metering waste detection and pressure controls and replacement and refurbishment of defective service connections.  Part of the extension works to the existing distribution systems and of the refurbishment of service connections have already been carried out under minor works contracts in the period 1985 to 1990, which were funded by the Department.  The construction cost of the overall works described above is estimated at approximately £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed works for stage 3 of the Fermoy water supply scheme need to be implemented as <Col N="1271" /> a matter of urgency as the existing system can no longer meet the increasing demand arising from proposed developments, particularly in the higher level environs of the town.  Accordingly, it has been found necessary to restrict and refuse development in certain areas which would otherwise have been developed.  The deficiencies in the existing system mean that the town is particularly susceptible to disruption in supply in the event of even minor breakdowns, in the pumping plant at source, rising main, or delivery main to the town. It is not possible to properly control waste without the provision of monitoring and waste detection measures.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the proposed scheme would improve the existing supply to the town by upgrading, extending and renewing parts of the distribution network and by providing adequate storage close to the town.  The scheme provides for dividing the pipe network into separate pressure zones thereby eliminating extremes of pressure and also provides for flow monitoring and waste detection.  There would be less likelihood of interruption to the supply following the implementation of the proposed works and areas currently approved for development but which are prohibited from being developed due to inadequate supply, would be serviced by the proposed scheme.</P>
    <P>Fermoy is a self-help community.  Proof of this lies in the provision of a substantial local contribution to assist State funding in the refurbishment of Fermoy swimming pool in 1994-5. Four substantial industrial/commercial multinational companies have been attracted to the town in recent years through vibrant local co-operation with the IDA: SCI Ireland, Metropolitan Life, BUPA and Berg Electronics.  The latter company will commence its operation on 2 April 1997 in an advance factory constructed entirely by local contributions.</P>
    <P>Future development in all its facets is being impeded because of the urban council's inability to store and distribute public water supplies in the area due to the lack of a modern supply network. It would be an investment that would bring a big return.  I appeal for a commitment from the Minister.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, regrets that he is unable to be present in the Seanad to reply to this matter and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Contract documents for stage 3 of the Fermoy water supply scheme have been submitted to the Department of the Environment by Fermoy Urban District Council.  The scheme, which is estimated to cost £3.5 million, is designed to remedy the existing situation where supply is interrupted from time to time.  The scheme is also designed to assist in encouraging new development in the town in the longer term.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides for expenditure in excess of £600 million for the period 1994-9 on environmental services.  This expenditure is financed through the Exchequer with assistance from the European Cohesion and Structural Funds.  Significant levels of investment have been maintained in recent years.  This has enabled considerable progress to be made in providing much needed water and sewerage infrastructural facilities throughout the country, including County Cork, which shares prominently in this investment.</P>
      <P>Local communities are anxious to pursue the development of their areas.  Fermoy is no exception and the community's public representatives, including Senator Sherlock, have been very active on their behalf.  In 1996 approval was given to the urban district council to carry out site investigation work.  This enabled the council to finalise the design of the project and to submit the detailed contract documents to my Department.</P>
      <P>Senators will appreciate there is little point issuing approvals to tender stage unless it is possible to provide funding for the construction of the scheme within a reasonable timeframe.  Senators will also appreciate there is a huge level of demand on the funds which are available and that existing commitments are at a high level. While progress has been made with the Fermoy scheme, regrettably it has not been possible to include the scheme in the water services work programme for 1997.  The possibility of authorising the council to advance it will be kept under review.</P>
