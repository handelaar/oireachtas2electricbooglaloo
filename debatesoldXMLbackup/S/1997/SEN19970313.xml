      <P>I have notice from Senator Maloney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to explain why transit vans which have been imported legally into Donegal should be seized by the Garda.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to convene urgently a national taskforce to ensure that Irish business and public services are aware of and prepared for the &ldquo;Millennium Bomb&rdquo; which will affect computers and computerised equipment.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to honour the existing agreement in which school transport is provided for post-primary pupils from Dysart, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement on the proposed extension of the Tallaght regional technical college, given the serious problems of overcrowding in the college.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Naughten of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide adequate supervision of butchers outlets.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Maloney's and Senator Quinn's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take items 1 and 2.  Item 1 will be taken at the end of the Order of Business until 1 p.m.  Item 2 will commence at 2 p.m. and I suggest 20 minutes per speaker.  There is only one section to the Bill and I hope we could take all Stages today.  However, I understand that Senator Finneran proposes to move amendments. If so, I suggest a sos between the end of Second Stage and the start of Committee Stage, if that is considered necessary.  I suggest this be left to the Whips to decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in agreement with the Order of Business.  Senator Finneran's amendments can be facilitated without unduly delaying the House if there is a break after Second Stage. The Leader is generous and has never stymied debate in the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill on the River Shannon, sponsored by Senator Daly and Senator O'Kennedy, should be facilitated in Government time as soon as possible &mdash; next week or before Easter.  It is a very good Bill and will have support from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>There is a need to debate the issue of television deflectors and the MMDS.  The problem does not arise in County Kerry, but I sympathise with those who have problems in Counties Donegal, Mayo, Galway and elsewhere.  I understand that their television signals have been cut off.  Whoever is at fault, whether it be those providing deflectors wishing to make more money and expand their services, or those involved in illegal activities, the matter needs to be resolved.</P>
      <P>I support the call by several Senators for a debate on the funding of local authorities and roads, especially national primary and national secondary roads.  Travelling from Dingle to Dublin over the last 35 to 40 years I have noticed little change in the road from Dingle to Portlaoise.</P>

      <P>I will be lucky if I live for another 40 years and I may not have that time to wait for a good road to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Buckley report is slipping away from us; we have quietly accepted what appears to have been a terrible report from our point of view.  The Leader intends to bring it before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges before having it debated in the House.  However, given the derisory award suggested for Senators, I appeal for a debate on the issue before Easter.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  I echo Senator Fitzgerald's comments on the Bill to be taken this afternoon.  It is important and I do not wish to delay it, but I may also have amendments to propose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business but I would like to be assured that time will be given for the consideration of amendments to the Bill.  I welcome the proposal for a sos between the Second and Committee Stages.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to ensure that the Blood Transfusion Service Board admits full liability to all who have contracted hepatitis C via the anti-D product as a result of its negligence?  Will he also ask the Minister for Health if he proposes to bring forward changes to the compensation tribunal so that those taking cases to the tribunal would be entitled to exemplary or aggravated damages?  Does the Minister foresee prosecutions following the publication of the tribunal of inquiry's report?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader get an assurance from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with regard to the regulations for the special areas of conservation currently before the other House? A problem has arisen for Offaly County Council in relation to Croghan Hill, which is an area of special historic and religious interest.  Esat Digifone has commenced a development there which it claims is an exempted development.  The council has had to take an injunction and to refer the case to An Bord Pleanála.  I am sure there are other areas of architectural, geological and historic interest which need to be protected.  This matter should be addressed while the SAC regulations are being dealt with.  I am sure Senators share my concern.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the report of the inspector of mental hospitals?  When can we expect the publication of legislation on mental health &mdash; an issue that has been raised frequently by a number of Senators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald's call for a discussion on the problems relating to MMDS and deflector systems.  The deflector system was in operation for a long time in my area and provided a good service, although it was technically illegal.  We must sort out the matter once and for all.  The local service provider's equipment was wrecked, it was off the air and was involved in expensive legal actions.  This has taken its toll on the provision of the service.  The local radio station started as an illegal operation but it eventually became legal under the new regulations and is now successful.  The same course should be followed with the television systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate on the funding of local authorities? I have asked for such a debate on a number of occasions.  Many Senators are members of local authorities and the role of local authorities and their members is diminishing, despite what we are told about restructuring proposals.  This House has not had an input to that restructuring process and we are entitled to make a contribution. We have a direct responsibility to local authority members, having been elected by them. <Col N="828" /> The Leader would do a service to the House and to local authorities by arranging a debate to allow us to make our proposals and be informed on the issues.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader approach the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with a view to having a question time in the Seanad?  Each Senator has one or two issues to raise on the Order of Business and a question time arrangement would allow us to get answers.  We do not seem to be successful in getting Ministers to come to the House.  The Leader of the House is a very busy messenger if he has to relay every concern raised. Will the Leader consider arranging a time for questions to allow Senators to raise issues of urgent concern?  It would be of interest to Members on all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, of grant aid for the rendering industry to the tune of £4.76 million.  This will allow the industry to meet all the requirements of the latest EU Directives.  Will the Leader find out if the Department made a decision on the arrangements for the disposal of high risk offal, which is made into meat and bone meal and is being stored at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Honan's request to the Leader for a debate on the report of the inspector of mental hospitals.  The report contained severe criticisms of the system, in particular the implementation of the community care policy, which it found lacking.  I do not wish to attribute the deaths in the unsupervised hostel in Grangegorman to the lack of community care facilities but I would point out that the psychiatric nurses association commented that it found the services provided inadequate.  A debate on the inspector's report would allow us to comment on the community care policy and to propose solutions to the problems with it.  It is not working because it is not properly resourced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting that the State's first Minister for the Marine, Senator Daly, should sponsor a Bill on the Shannon.  Without debating the merits of the Bill, I consider it timely and I urge the Leader to facilitate discussion on it.  A disgraceful situation pertains whereby many of the local authorities along the Shannon have reneged on their responsibilities and they pay lip service to combating pollution while hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent on pumping stations which they refuse to operate.  Some of the stations have been locked shut since their installation &mdash; at Killaloe and Portumna, for example. The local authorities, with the exception of Leitrim <Col N="829" /> County Council, have reneged on their responsibilities.  Ironically, it is the authority with the least funds available to it which is foremost in pumping operations.  I would welcome a debate to highlight the responsibility of the Office of Public Works and the local authorities in this environmental matter.  I look forward to a debate to address pollution in one of the finest waterways in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked before about grants for alternative farming but, as I got no reply, I will have to keep asking the question.  The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Food telephoned Teagasc offices all over Ireland at 3 p.m. one day to say that any applications not in its office by 5 p.m. that evening could not be considered. All applicants had to make their applications through Teagasc, which then sent them to the Department.  There was no way that any county office could have its applications in the Department within two hours.  I believe those applicants have a legal case against Teagasc, and that Teagasc has a case against the Department. It was very short-sighted and high-handed to limit the application deadline to two hours.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister to explain to the House why his Department reduced the time limit within which applications could be received to two hours between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. that day?  It was unfair.  Many people went to a great deal of expense to prepare applications because they had been encouraged to get into alternative farming and now cannot get their grants.  We should debate this issue, which is not just a problem for Sligo but for the whole country. The Minister should tell us why the Department acted in such a high-handed manner.  It never did this before &mdash; it always gave Teagasc seven days to send in the applications.  It was ridiculous to give them only two hours.</P>

      <P>How could anyone get to Dublin in two hours unless they had a State helicopter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Magner for his support for the Shannon Bill.  He has a very deep knowledge and understanding of the inland waterways and has done great work in the Dublin area in his chairmanship of the committee dealing with canals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader give consideration to the issue raised by Senator Finneran in relation to the community care budget?  Apart from the tragic cases mentioned by Senator Finneran, elderly people have serious problems in getting minor repair works carried out to their homes and facilities, such as wheelchairs.  This year the community care budget for the Mid-West Health Board area <Col N="830" /> was cut by 10 per cent.  This is a further hit to an area which is already very short of finance.  Will the Leader raise the issue of the funding of community care budgets with the Minister, especially in relation to care of the elderly, handicapped and disabled, many of whom have been waiting for between two and four years for minor remedial works to be carried out to their homes which would make their lives more comfortable?</P>
    <P>I also support Senator Honan's call for a debate on the national heritage areas and the special areas of conservation.  These matters have been dealt with by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  There is a desire for a discussion on this before the start of the tourist season because some of the requirements have implications for visitors to areas of scenic attraction, of which we have many in County Clare.  When are we likely to have a debate on the NHAs and special areas of conservation so that we can get some indication of the policy on these areas in advance of the tourist season?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asking for a debate on the National Roads Authority for many months, which I have been promised.  I have mentioned on numerous occasions that when travelling from Kilkenny to Waterford one cannot get across Waterford bridge but nothing has been done about it.  The access from Kilkenny to Waterford across only one bridge is atrocious and will lead to a national tragedy.  Everybody will then say that the National Roads Authority did not give us the money because it was invested in Dublin and elsewhere.  I do not care where the money goes but a catastrophe is waiting to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking again for a debate on the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>I would also like a debate on our job creation policy.  The economy is supposed to be booming but there are areas where jobs are not being created.  I would like a debate on the relationship between Forbairt, IDA Ireland and the bridging company, Forfás.  It appears that one would need a consultant to find out where to go, whom to see and what to do.  Industrialists, entrepreneurs and indigenous business people who want to invest here should know immediately where they should go rather than having to jump from Billy to Jack or being told that it is a problem for another organisation.  We need an urgent debate on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also need an urgent debate on the export of cattle.  The Minister is saying one thing, Pandoro is saying another thing and the livestock exporters are saying something else.  Pandoro, which is the only company which can export cattle at present, will not take certain types of animal. I ask the Minister to set up a national shipping company &mdash; it does not have to be a huge <Col N="831" /> company, just a few boats &mdash; which will take our live exports to Europe.  I am not talking about cattle going to the Far East or Middle East but the huge number of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not debating that matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have a debate on that matter?  Will the Minister tell us the situation with regard to Pandoro because there are different views coming from Pandoro, the Minister and the exporters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Lanigan's call for the Minister to come to the House to support live cattle exporters.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to examine the question of live exports to the Middle East, the ceasing of which over the last few months has caused factories to depress the price of beef.  Cattle farmers are suffering a great deal at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Fitzgerald, I will make time available for what he referred to as the &ldquo;Daly-O'Kennedy&rdquo; Bill the week after next.  I guarantee him that its Second Stage will commence during this session.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a debate on the issue of TV deflectors and MMDS.  I will see if time can be found for that debate.</P>
      <P>Senators Lanigan and McGowan have been raising the issue of roads for some time.  There is already a motion on the funding of local authorities on the Order Paper, which we have debated for a couple of hours.  There is a case for a debate on the National Roads Authority for which I will try to find a framework.</P>
      <P>The Buckley report, which Senator Fitzgerald raised, is to be examined by Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Perhaps we, on Committee on Procedure and Privileges, could expedite that matter which I would then be very happy to have discussed in the House.  I thank Senators Henry and Fitzgerald for agreeing to the format of this afternoon's debate on health.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan raised a number of issues.  I said yesterday there will be a full debate on the report of the hepatitis C tribunal before the end of the session.  All the questions raised by Senator Honan and some of the assertions she made on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; yesterday can be examined in detail during that debate.  The Minister will then have an opportunity to reply to some of the outrageous statements made yesterday.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan also asked about the heritage area, which I will discuss with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I approve of the suggestion of a debate on the report of the inspector of mental hospitals and I will see if that can be done in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised the issue of local authorities.  He also raised the issue of Question <Col N="832" /> Time.  However, he is aware the reason there is Question Time in the other House is that, constitutionally, the Government is directly accountable to the Dáil and not to this House.  Constitutionally, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges cannot institute a system for questions in the Seanad.  However, the Senator's point is fair and we could consider other devices.  For example, the Lower House now has four matters on its Adjournment and perhaps the Seanad could consider increasing the number of matters taken in this House.  Senator Finneran last week revived the system whereby Members can raise important matters under Standing Order 30.  I forwarded Senator Finneran's points to the relevant Ministers.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges can examine Senator McGowan's legitimate point.</P>
    <P>I note Senator Naughten's remarks on the initiative in the rendering industry but I do not have an answer to his question about high risk offal.  The matter raised by Senator Farrell could best be raised on the Adjournment.  Regarding Senator Daly's point, I and my colleagues are not aware of any cuts in the community care budget so his further points do not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>My two colleagues on the health board in the Senator's area assure me his point is not accurate.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan opened a Pandora's box of issues, including the export of cattle.  I suggest he raises that matter on the Adjournment.  The request for a debate on the Fianna Fáil policy on job creation is properly a matter for Fianna Fáil Private Members' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the issue.  Section 22 <Col N="833" /> is a technical provision to allow the Minister for Finance to introduce regulations for the purpose of regulating cross-Border credit transfers.  A directive of the Council and the European Parliament in relation to cross-Border credit transfers was adopted on 19 December 1996.  I was part of the conciliation process which achieved final agreement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The directive provides for customer information, both before and after execution of transfers, time limits on the execution of a transfer, failing which compensation must be paid, an obligation to execute the transfer in accordance with instructions, and refunds in the event of non-execution of transfers.  It is a customer service provision regarding the transfer of quantities of money across borders within Europe to ensure there are certain guarantees for customers in the system.  In so far as the provisions of the directive are covering new areas, that is, provisions for refunds as well as transparency and performance, section 22 has been included in the Bill to ensure there will be an appropriate legal basis for regulations to implement the directive.  The Bill will ensure there is a proper legal basis for the directive which was agreed in Europe.</P>

      <P>It will make it far more difficult and it will put the regulation on a specific footing. With regard to section 77, the Investment Intermediaries Act of 1995 conferred on the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and <Col N="835" /> Employment strong powers of inspection of investment business firms.  This measure was designed as a reaction to the growing number of firms engaging in non-legitimate investment business. The banking sector does not have comparable regulation of potentially illegal deposit takers and there is a genuine concern that some firms, particularly those who heretofore operated investment businesses, may turn their attention to the banking area where they may perceive a legitimate weakness.  This section confers on the bank the same powers of inspection as provided for in the Investment Intermediaries Act.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.  Section 78 also deals with the issue raised by the Senator and would also apply to a Taylor-type situation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate on this Bill.  Despite the fact that the majority of the Bill's provisions are technical, serious policy issues are being addressed such as the future supervision of investment intermediaries, which some Senators had concerns about.  It also addresses the issues of payment systems and, to the extent that they do not form a part of an already supervised entity, <i>bureaux de changes.</i>  These are extremely important provisions which will serve to assist the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial markets in Ireland as well as assisting our role in the international drive against money laundering. The Bill also has the effect of updating the law relating to the Central Bank in advance of the introduction of new legislation to cater for the move to the third stage of European Monetary Union in 1999.  Proposals for that legislation are being examined at present and I look forward to the wide ranging debate that will generate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The passing of the provisions which this current Bill contains means we can now look forward to a debate on the European Monetary Union legislation, which will not be obstructed by the issues we have discussed here today, important as they are.  In a sense this is a clearing of the decks in preparation for the next piece of legislation.  I believe this is a good thing; European Monetary Union is too serious an issue to clog its effecting legislation with unrelated matters.  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the officials from my own Department who have assisted me <Col N="836" /> together with those from the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and the Environment. I also thank the officials from the offices of the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsmen.  I thank Senators on both sides of the House for their co-operation in the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Roche, teased out the issues very ably and well with the Minister on a previous occasion so there is no point in going over the same ground again today. I welcome the Bill and I think we all should.</P>
      <P>Money laundering has become a very serious problem and it is something which must be stopped.  I wonder sometimes whether we are putting sufficient controls in place in the area of money.  Money has caused many problems for many people, some of whom have lost their savings. Today we see the institutions which handle money seemingly throwing it about like confetti at a wedding or snuff at a wake.  I wonder if there is a need for some kind of body to be set up that would see whether the people who are borrowing this money are getting value for it, particularly in the area of house building.  People are borrowing up to four times their yearly income in this area. If a market slump occurs, as happened in England recently, we will have that terrible bugbear here called &ldquo;negative equity&rdquo;, where people's property will be worth less than what they owe on it.  In England I have seen streets of houses for sale by one building society.  They could not give these houses away.  There is a danger, with the level of money being loaned here, that that will be a problem in coming years.  There should be some mechanism in place to ensure that no property price rises above its value.  Young people are afraid that this trend will continue and that their savings will not be sufficient to pay a deposit in another year.  As a result, they are borrowing out of their depth.  This is a dangerous situation.  Money problems have caused all of us headaches from time to time.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I hope it puts an end to money laundering, which has been one of the big problems with regard to the drug business.  If the drug barons were unable to get the money out of the country, it would be much easier to deal with them.  I thank the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important piece of legislation.  We all want to see controls put on the laundering of money, which this Bill does. Nobody wants to see another collapse like Taylor Investments in this country.  The Bill also addresses this issue.  I congratulate the Minister and thank her for the efficient way in which she has steered this Bill through the House.</P>

    <Title>Health (Provision of Information) Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am pleased to introduce the Health (Provision of Information) Bill, 1997, to Seanad Éireann.  It is a critical part of the action plan on the implementation of the national cancer strategy which I announced last week.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is twofold.  It is designed to ensure that we can proceed with the establishment of national programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer and that the National Cancer Registry Board can continue to collect important data on cancer in Ireland.  In both cases, my concern is to ensure that we comply with all legal requirements relating to data protection.</P>
      <P>On 4 March 1997, I announced a major action plan containing full details of how the national cancer strategy would be implemented.  I published the strategy last November.  Last week's action plan gave details by region of how the many initiatives in the strategy would be funded and put into practice.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the national cancer strategy involve reorganising cancer treatment services to promote a strong patient focus and ensure equity of access throughout the country, devoting resources to screening and early detection programmes of proven value, using health promotion activities to emphasise further the importance of healthy lifestyles, developing specialist palliative care services on a phased basis and facilitating greater co-ordination of cancer research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action plan which I announced on 4 March describes how the strategy will be implemented. The main elements include plans costing an extra £6 million this year for the development of cancer services in each region.  The plans include additional consultant appointments for treatment services, development of palliative care and funding for research, the appointment of regional directors to co-ordinate services and develop a <Col N="838" /> cancer plan for their region &mdash; further funds will be allocated in 1998 and 1999 to implement all of the provisions of the strategy; the appointment of a National Cancer Forum as promised in the national cancer strategy; the establishment of expert bodies to steer the implementation of national programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer and the introduction of legislation to ensure that the breast and cervical screening programmes comply with data protection requirements.  Senators will see that the Bill before the House today is an integral part of the initiatives to address the problem of cancer and to implement the national cancer strategy.</P>
    <P>Cancer is one of the biggest causes of death in Ireland.  It accounts for 7,500 deaths every year, or one quarter of all deaths.  In the under-65 age group the proportion is even higher again, at one third of all deaths in this group.  We describe deaths among those under 65 years as premature mortality.  Many of them can be prevented.  With this in mind the national cancer strategy focuses on steps to reduce premature mortality from cancer. The cancer strategy reiterates a key target set in the national health strategy, published in 1994, namely, to reduce the deaths in those aged under 65 years by 15 per cent in the ten year period to 2004.</P>
    <P>Of all deaths from cancer in those aged under 65 years, breast cancer accounts for nearly 10 per cent.  About 660 women die each year from breast cancer.  Cervical cancer accounts for a further 60 to 70 deaths each year.  Expert advice is that between 20 and 30 per cent of deaths from breast cancer among women aged over 50 years could be prevented if a quality mass screening programme were established.  International studies indicate that programmes should be aimed at women aged between 50 and 64 years.  To date, there is little evidence to support breast screening among women under 50 years of age.</P>
    <P>In the case of cervical cancer, there is evidence that, where a pre-malignant condition known as CIN is identified, it can be treated with almost 100 per cent success.  CIN usually precedes cervical cancer so identifying it before it develops further is very important.</P>
    <P>The potential value of screening programmes for breast cancer and cervical cancer lies in their ability to reduce significantly the number of deaths from the disease.  Any programmes that we develop must be very carefully organised and based upon the highest quality practices so as to ensure that we get the best results.  We are fortunate to have had a very valuable pilot programme of screening for breast cancer, known as the Eccles breast screening programme, since 1989. My Department funded the programme which was organised by the Mater Foundation.  The experience of the pilot programme will be very valuable now that we are moving to establish a national programme.  The Eccles breast screening programme underlined the importance of organising screening carefully on a phased basis so that <Col N="839" /> the lessons of each stage can be taken into account before the next phase proceeds.</P>
    <P>In the area of screening for cervical cancer, we have the benefit of an expert group whose report I published with the national cancer strategy last November.  The report of the working party on cervical screening recommended that a national programme of cervical screening should be established for women in the 25 to 60 age group.  I accepted this recommendation and have now established the advisory committee recommended by the expert working party to oversee the implementation and monitoring of a national programme.  Again it will be important to run a pilot programme in the first instance to ensure that the national programme operates in the most effective manner.</P>
    <P>We are now ready to move to the next stage of preparing national programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer.  However, there is one critical element that must be put in place before we can proceed.  We must ensure that the proposed programmes comply with all legislation relating to data protection.  That is the principal purpose of the Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>Expert advice is that both programmes must have a population register which can be established and regularly updated.  The purpose of the population register is to have the names and addresses of women in the target age group so that they can be invited for screening.  The registers will need to be updated constantly so that women can be invited to attend as soon as they reach the appropriate age.  The women's details can then be retained on the registers until they move outside the target age group but the first concern is to ensure that we can identify all women who should be offered screening for the first time.</P>
    <P>There is no such population register available to us at present.  Therefore it will be necessary to draw upon data from a number of existing sources such as the GMS Payments Board, the Department of Social Welfare and health insurance companies.  The names and addresses of women must be obtained from these sources and used to create a national population register for the age groups concerned.  However, under current data protection legislation it does not appear to be possible for these sources to pass personal details to a third party such as a screening programme.  An important principle of data protection is that personal information, such the names and addresses of individuals, should be used only for the purpose for which it was originally collected.  There can be little argument that in this case the information is required for a very important purpose, but the legal advice available indicates that we require specific legislative authority to proceed.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Health (Provision of Information) Bill sets out to confer this legislative authority.  It provides that a body participating in any national programme of breast or cervical <Col N="840" /> screening authorised by the Minister for Health may request information from any person regarding names, addresses and dates of birth so that, for public health reasons, women may be invited to participate in that programme.  The section enables any person requested to provide information for this purpose to do so.  The important elements to note are that the screening programme must be authorised by the Minister for Health, the information must be requested for the purposes of compiling and maintaining a record of women who may be invited to attend for screening and the purpose of the screening is for reasons of public health.</P>
    <P>Senators will notice that the section is enabling rather than mandatory.  It does not require any person or agency to provide the information requested but it is expected that all agencies such as the General Medical Services Payments Board and the Department of Social Welfare will be anxious to co-operate fully in such important programmes as screening for cancer.  Senators may also note that the cancer screening programmes &mdash; and the National Cancer Registry Board with which I will deal in a moment &mdash; will be governed by the Data Protection Act in how the information made accessible to them is stored and used.</P>
    <P>I understand the issue of prostate cancer screening is of concern to a number of Senators.  This issue was considered by the cancer strategy group which advised me on the drafting of the national cancer strategy.  The group's view was that current evidence does not support an organised screening programme for prostate cancer.  There is medical consensus on the need for large population studies to assess the benefits of screening programmes and a large population study on prostate cancer screening is in progress in the European Union.  The results are expected in 1998.  The national health screening committee in the United Kingdom has recently concluded there is no evidence available at this time for the introduction of a prostate screening programme.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty, in principle, with the concept of an amendment such as that proposed by Senator Finneran but I emphasise I can give no commitment to a screening programme for prostate cancer unless and until there is adequate medical evidence to support its effectiveness.  The wording of any amendment must be carefully drafted and it would be unwise to insert something today without consultation with the Attorney General's Office or the parliamentary draftsman.  If it is acceptable to the Seanad, I can have an appropriate amendment prepared in time for the Dáil's consideration of the Bill on 25 March.  The amendment would then be resubmitted to the Seanad on 26 March.</P>
    <P>The second major element of the Health (Provision of Information) Bill is to enable the National Cancer Registry Board to continue collecting important data on cases of all forms of cancer.  The board is a statutory body established in 1991 under the Health (Corporate Bodies) <Col N="841" /> Act, 1961.  Its functions include the collection and analysis of information on each newly diagnosed case of cancer.  Its main task is to gather and analyse information on the incidence and relevance of all types of cancer in Ireland.  The data it collects are very important for epidemiological and research purposes.  The board's work forms a critical part of the initiatives announced in the recently published national cancer strategy. Senators will be interested to note that the board's first national report on cancer is being finalised and will be published soon.</P>
    <P>To allow the board to have a complete and detailed picture of cancer in Ireland, the information supplied to it by hospitals must include the name and address of each patient diagnosed. There are a number of reasons for this requirement. First, it is vital for the National Cancer Registry Board to be able to trace patients across episodes of treatment in different hospitals.  Its data must be consistent and accurate in this regard.  The board's experience and that of cancer registries internationally is that access to the names and addresses of patients is the only reliable method for achieving this cross-matching.</P>
    <P>Second, the National Cancer Registry Board also collects data on deaths from cancer.  As part of this task, it must update its records on patients diagnosed with cancer who subsequently die.  The registry uses information from death certificates for this purpose.  Again, both international experience and that of the National Cancer Registry Board is that it is not possible to link cases currently registered with those who die from cancer unless the name and address of the patient is available.</P>
    <P>Questions have been asked about whether it is permissible under current data protection legislation for hospitals to supply data of this kind to the board.  I am anxious to resolve any questions about this matter so that the National Cancer Registry Board can continue its important work. Failure to resolve the situation now could deprive the board of vital sources of data, its ability to collect accurate information would be greatly hampered and its role in helping analyse the incidence and prevalence of cancer would be severely curtailed.  Its contribution to cancer research would also be reduced.</P>
    <P>To avoid any possible doubt about the legal basis for the National Cancer Registry Board's current arrangements for obtaining named patient data from hospitals, the Health (Provision of Information) Bill provides that the board may request this data for the purposes of any of its functions.  It also provides that the persons requested to supply the data &mdash; hospitals &mdash; may do so.  It is important to note that this provision merely safeguards the present position and does not confer any additional powers on the National Cancer Registry Board.  It should also be noted that the Bill enables the board to request and obtain this information specifically for the purposes of any of its functions.  These are set out in the National Cancer Registry Board <Col N="842" /> (Establishment) Order, 1991, and the board would not be permitted to obtain named patient data for any other purpose.</P>
    <P>There are no direct implications for staffing or costs as a result of this Bill.  The full costs of the programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer are included in the action plan I announced last week and in the proposals I brought to Government before I published the national cancer strategy last November.  As I mentioned earlier, I have allocated an additional £6 million for the development of cancer services in 1997.  This includes preparations for establishing the national programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer.  I have also announced that the implementation of the complete set of initiatives on cancer will continue in 1998 and 1999 and that the full package of developments, including the screening programmes, will cost an extra £25 million when all the initiatives are in place.  There are no cost implications for the National Cancer Registry Board as a result of the proposal to safeguard its position in relation to collection of data from hospitals.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a very important element of the action plan on cancer which I announced on 4 March.  It is legislation vital in allowing the programmes of breast screening and cervical screening to proceed.  Without it, the programmes cannot go ahead.  It is also very important in the context of the National Cancer Registry Board's work.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>My party welcomes the legislation. Its purpose is to enable the Minister for Health to proceed with the establishment of a population register for the national breast and cervical cancer screening programmes.  It also enables the National Cancer Registry Board to continue collecting important data on all forms of cancer.  The legislation is necessary to comply with the Data Protection Act.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed this Bill is so restrictive and narrow as to not account of forms of cancer other than breast and cervical cancer.  It also seems to concern itself solely with women.  I contend the Bill is too restrictive and narrow and has not taken a broad look at the incidence of cancer or at the opportunity now presented to the Minister and the Department to put in place proper screening programmes.  This legislation was drafted to meet with the requirements of the Data Protection Act but not enough thought has been put into it.  It deals with breast cancer for women but no mention is made of the fact that breast cancer also happens to men.  It is neither mentioned nor catered for in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prostate cancer is a matter of great national and international debate.  As the Minister said, a major European Union study is taking place on it and many studies are being undertaken in the United States on this form of cancer.  I cannot see why the Minister and the Department did not provide for the gathering of information on such <Col N="843" /> a distressful, dangerous and sometimes fatal cancer. The Minister should reconsider his position on this matter.  He should include screening for and information on prostate cancer and other forms of cancer in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill is being initiated in the Seanad, but more thought and a broader outlook should have accompanied it. There is much debate on breast and cervical cancer. It is important that the Oireachtas reflect that debate and implement legislation to help reduce the incidence of those diseases so as to protect Irishwomen.  Apart from the physical aspect, women face psychological pressure when suffering cancer and any legislation that enables the Department of Health or the National Cancer Registry Board to alleviate any distress, reduce the incidence or help the treatment of cancer is to be welcomed.  The Minister has my full support in that area, but I am unhappy with his approach regarding this legislation because it excludes 50 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>Why did his advisers and draftspeople not consider other cancers, particularly prostate cancer, which is very distressful?  I do not have the figures &mdash; the Department would be in a better position to supply those &mdash; but more and more cases of prostate cancer are coming to light.  It has been suggested to me that there is often evidence of prostate cancer in post mortems on elderly males. It is important to allow the Minister, a successor or an appropriate agency to implement a screening programme on prostate cancer, if they wish, with the help of provisions in this legislation. Such provisions are not in the legislation as it is currently framed and that is a major defect.  Other Senators may identify different cancers or diseases that might be included, but legislation that reflects the needs of 50 per cent of the population has to be defective.  This legislation was not fully considered while it was being prepared.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision and statements on the Cancer Action Plan, especially its regional application.  There is to be a regional director in, presumably, each health board area. An announcement was made about a regional director of cancer services in the Western Health Board area, as well as an additional haematologist and additional medical oncologist.  That is welcome, but can the Minister say whether any of the money earmarked for this Cancer Action Plan has been clawed back to implement the nurses' pay deal?  Recently all sections of the Department have had to cut existing plans and budgets to implement that pay deal.  The Minister should be able to inform us that there are no cuts to the Cancer Action Plan.</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment on Committee Stage on this matter because the legislation is incomplete in that it is too restrictive and excludes both people and other forms of cancer. I welcome the Minister's intention to have the Attorney General give his views on this.  A statement in this House to the effect that something <Col N="844" /> will happen in the other House is not an appropriate way to debate legislation.  This House has the right to debate, amend and pass legislation in its own right.  If we did not work on that basis we would not be carrying out our duties as elected Members of the Oireachtas.  If the Attorney General or draftspeople wish to examine my amendment, that should be done; but it should not be done after we have passed legislation with a <i>caveat.</i>  That indicates something may or may not happen in the Dáil and would be dismissive of this House's commitment to legislation, especially as the legislation has been initiated here.  It would be saying that a change in this legislation may be needed but it cannot be done in the Seanad and that it will be done in the Dáil.  When the Constitution set up two Houses of the Oireachtas, that was not the way business was supposed to be carried out and it is unacceptable to me.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will address the fears I have regarding this legislation and look forward to his response at the end of Second Stage.</P>

      <P>The Health (Provision of Information) Bill, 1997, is one of the shortest Bills to come before the Oireachtas in my 15 years here but it is one of the most important.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Minister for Health to proceed with the establishment of population registers for national programmes of screening for breast cancer and for cervical cancer. The Bill also enables the National Cancer Registry Board to continue collecting important data in relation to cases of all forms of cancer.</P>
      <P>Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in Europe and accounts for about one quarter of all the deaths.  In the EU alone there are approximately 1.3 million new cases of cancer every year and more than 840,000 deaths from the disease. The number of new cases occurring each year is rising and it is anticipated that overall mortality in the EU will increase over the next 15 years in the absence of effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of cancer.</P>
      <P>Ireland's mortality from cancer compares unfavourably with that of the EU average.  While our death rate from cancer has declined by almost 10 per cent in the under 65 age group since 1970, it is still above the EU average.  The mortality rate for the overall population has risen slightly since the 1970s.  The overall rise in cancer mortality is due in part to the fact that our population is ageing.  Any increase in deaths from cancer should be addressed by all the measures available to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objectives of cancer strategy outlined in <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> were based on the principles of preventing cancers for which a cause is known or suspected, providing information to increase awareness and improve knowledge of the cause of cancers, early detection in providing screening services of proven value in prevention and early detection of cancer, ensuring all patients have access to an equitable and effective service and ensuring treatments are provided <Col N="845" /> appropriately and administered safely in accordance with established best practices.</P>
    <P>On 4 March 1997, the Minister for Health announced a major action plan to initiate the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy and outlined the major elements of the action plan.  One of the major elements of the plan is the establishment of national screening programmes for breast and cervical cancers.  I note from the document, <i>A Cancer Service in Ireland &mdash; A National Strategy,</i> that the incidence of breast cancer in Ireland is among the highest in Europe with over 1,200 cases diagnosed each year.</P>
    <P>As the causes of breast cancer remain to be established, it is not known how it can be prevented.  Therefore, it is important that emphasis is placed on detection at the earliest possible stage.  I am pleased to note that in the Eastern Health Board area, the Minister has appointed two regional directors and the introduction of a programme for breast screening will form part of the national programme for women aged between 50 and 65 years.  This will also involve expanding the Eccles breast screening programme at a cost of £1.5 million per year.  In addition, consultant radiologists will be appointed to the Mater Hospital breast screening programme and the premises at Eccles Street will be refurbished at a cost of £300,000 to provide the headquarters of the national programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also announced his intention of establishing a national programme for the screening of cervical cancer which accounted for 61 deaths and more than 1 per cent of all cancer deaths in 1994.  Although, it is more common in older women, approximately 60 per cent of deaths from cervical cancer in 1994 occurred in women under 65 years.  The exact cause of cervical cancer is unknown, nevertheless, early screening of the disease and treatment can help to eradicate the problem.  I am pleased the Minister is providing £1 million to enhance cervical screening services in six major hospitals in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Registry Board is a statutory body established to gather and analyse information on the incidence and prevalence of cancer in Ireland.  It is vital that the registry can trace patients across episodes of treatment in different hospitals and that the data are consistent and accurate.  Names and addresses of patients will be required for this purpose.  It has been argued that the gathering of such information would be in conflict with the Data Protection Act, 1988.  For that reason, the Bill provides that the gathering of such information be exempted from the Act.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister's commitment since taking office to set up effective cancer treatment services, nevertheless, I, as a male Member of the House, share some of the anxiety expressed by Senator Finneran.  Quite a number of men die from prostate cancer and some attention should be given to the problem.  The Minister said a medical consensus would require large population studies before the benefits of screening <Col N="846" /> could be evaluated.  These are being conducted in the EU and will be available in 1998.  There are also some screening tests being conducted in the UK at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he has no difficulty in principle in accepting an amendment which would provide for the screening of prostatic cancers. The main priority in dealing with cancer is to detect it as soon as possible.  Screening is valuable in this area.  If screening had been used in many cases, lives could have been saved.  I ask Senator Finneran to bear in mind that the Minister said he has no difficulty in principle in accepting his proposed amendment.  Nevertheless, he will not give a commitment to a screening programme unless there is adequate medical evidence to support its effectiveness, which is fair.  We are lay people and we must rely on the medical evidence available.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the wording of the amendment would have to be exact.  He has asked that the Attorney General's Office and the parliamentary draftsman see the amendment prior to it going before the Dáil and it would then come back to the Seanad.  He is not ruling out another contribution from this House.  This Chamber is not being overlooked.  It is acknowledged that the matter was initially raised here.  Many amendments proposed here may not be accepted but the Minister picks them up in his speech to the House.  He often attends to these matters when a Bill goes before the Dáil and <i>vice versa.</i>  We should accept the offer the Minister made today.</P>
    <P>We all fear cancer.  When we get a sore throat or a pain, cancer may be our first thought.  Every household in Ireland has some family member who has died from cancer.  My father died in his forties, when I was six years old and I dread the problem.  I congratulate the Minister for emphasising the establishment of effective treatment for cancer.  The service he is providing will help prevent the spread of cancer.  He has also provided the action plan, at a cost of over £6 million, for the development of cancer services in each region of the State.  The Minister should be complimented on this.  He has the support of the vast majority of the people in what he is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a proprietorial interest in this Bill.  When I entered the House, the first Adjournment matter I raised was on whether a population register could be set up for the screening of breast and cervical cancers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Finneran and Senator Doyle, I am disappointed that the legal advice is that the matter has to be this specific.  So many cancers can be screened for, not just prostatic cancer. There are other health areas where screening at the same time would be useful.  For example, breast cancer is the most common cause of premature death of women in this country.  However, coronary artery disease is almost as common.  It would be tremendous if we were in a position to screen women for high blood pressure and diabetes <Col N="847" /> at the same time as breast cancer.  Late onset diabetes has become much more common.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister's legal advisers will let him include these possibilities under related matters, but it would be helpful if as much as possible could be done at the time of screening. It is a great opportunity to have patients come forward to be screened.  They could also be offered the possibility of having their blood pressure taken and their urine tested.  Such simple tests could show if they had anaemia or related blood problems.  If this could be done under related matters it would be clinically significant for women's health.  That is the disappointing aspect of the Bill.  We had hoped that one would be able to set up a register which did not have to be so tight.  However, if the Minister has been given that legal advice, I can do nothing about it.  I am not a lawyer and cannot advise on that area.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the national cancer register has been set up.  Will the Minister reassure me that it is linked with the register in Northern Ireland? This is incredibly important.  The Institute of Public Health has been set up, for which I congratulate the Minister and his predecessor.  I compliment my colleagues in the Royal College of Physicians, who were instrumental in pushing this project, the Irish Department of Health and the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Any epidemiological work carried out on a base of five million people will be more accurate and effective than two pieces of such work based on 1.5 million and 3.5 million people.  The more epidemiological surveys we can tie in with Northern Ireland, the better.  However separate people in Northern Ireland might consider themselves to be, they might learn to their dismay that genetically we are the same.  We have the same blood lines and genetic basis because the people of Ireland were pushed towards the edge of Europe, as were people in Scotland, Iceland and Scandinavia. It is important, from an epidemiological point of view, that we try to get as much information as possible in this area.</P>
    <P>To date, screening in this country has largely taken place on an opportunistic basis.  While it is useful for the individual, it is of little value in lowering the premature mortality which screening is attempting to address.  It has long been sought and its introduction is most welcome.  I understand the concerns of male Members of the House &mdash; Senator Honan and I care for men's health as much as for women's health &mdash; regarding prostate screening.  This is a difficult matter because the jury is still out with regard to whether it is better to carry out prostate specific antigen testing or transrectal ultrasound to get a better idea of whether a man has early cancer of the prostate.</P>
    <P>When looking at instances of cancer of the prostate it is important to remember that a large number of them are discovered at <i>post mortem</i> when the person has died from another cause. However, there is a worry that there might be an <Col N="848" /> increased incidence in early cancer of the prostate and the natural history of this disease is not well understood.  I understand the concern of male Senators but the delay is probably right.  There is no use screening unless it is decided from the start how the screening will be carried out.  As it has not been developed sufficiently yet, that is important.</P>
    <P>I caution the Minister against constantly referring to the United Kingdom.  I have nothing against my colleagues in the United Kingdom; they do fine research work.  However, I am sometimes less that enthusiastic about the Minister for Health in London.  Health economics can have a great deal of influence on some of the projects carried out.  I remind the Minister of our unpleasant experience in 1991 when the Department of Health decided to delay screening for hepatitis C because the UK was delaying such screening.  I will remember to my dying day the shock I received at the hepatitis C tribunal when the letter to the chief medical officer of the Department of Health was read to the tribunal. In that letter a senior medical officer of the Department of Health in England said the English Department was delaying introducing screening for hepatitis C because of the Gulf War.  Our Department delayed the screening as well.  We can only be grateful that Saddam Hussein did not last any longer.</P>
    <P>We should be extraordinarily careful about thinking we are a type of offshoot of the United Kingdom.  I have seen it happen too often and I am most anxious about it.  We should keep an eye on what is happening in Scandinavian countries and in other small countries like Ireland which go to such trouble to introduce screening programmes. Screening programmes will probably be introduced late in the United States because it would be a major undertaking.  It will probably be introduced by private healthcare institutions as they are keen on managed healthcare.</P>
    <P>I was delighted with the launch last year of the national strategy for cancer services.  The last paragraph of <i>Cancer Services in Ireland: A National Strategy</i> states:</P>
    <P>The Minister will support an initiative to co-ordinate and develop clinical research through the establishment of a Cancer Clinical Research Unit within the Health Research Board.  Its purpose will be to provide a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional approach to clinical research in a way that benefits patients to best effect.</P>
    <P>That is good, but what efforts have been made to support research at a molecular level?  It has been known in medicine for many years that we inherit our chromosomes or DNA almost equally from both parents.  If these chromosomes or DNA are deficient in some way, it may lead to diseases of a genetic nature which may in many cases be familiar or common to many members of the same family.  A good example of this type of disease is haemophilia.  However, there are other diseases which can be traced in a family where the genetic <Col N="849" /> defect may be pinpointed.  These are referred to as inherited disorders.</P>
    <P>It is now agreed that the vast majority, if not all, forms of cancer are acquired genetic diseases. Individuals are born with normal genes, chromosomes and DNA; but some event, probably environmental in origin, changes the genetic structure of some of the cells.  The result is that cell multiplication and function become abnormal leading to a state we call &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; and ultimately in many cases to the patient's death.  The reason we know this stems primarily from research in the area of blood diseases, blood cancers and leukaemias. We have known for many years that some leukaemias were always associated with specific abnormalities of chromosomes.  It is only with more sophisticated diagnostic techniques that we now know all leukaemias are associated with specific abnormal chromosomes.</P>
    <P>As a result of the relative ease in obtaining specimens of leukaemia cells, these observations have preceded those made by specialists in the treatment and diagnosis of other forms of cancer. However, it is now clear that in the majority of other cancers that have been studied, there are also acquired genetic defects.  This is important. First, it gives us an understanding of the mechanism whereby cancer cells grow abnormally, and this is leading to a radical rethink in the type of treatment we might offer patients with cancer in an effort to cure their disease.  Second, the fact that there are specific genetic defects in different types of cancer allows us to make an accurate diagnosis.  These genetic markers also serve a useful purpose when we try to examine patients to see if their tumours are truly cured.</P>
    <P>At a recent conference in Edinburgh, experts from Europe and North America clearly stated that the only test which offers any prognostic significance in leukaemia, both in children and adults, is the definition of the type of genetic abnormality.  All other tests are of much less significance in terms of the patient's outcome.  It has also been agreed by those experts that the type of treatment given in children and adults with leukaemia and related diseases should be, and currently is, stratified and based on the type of genetic abnormality uncovered at the time of diagnosis.  It is, therefore, mandatory that these types of investigations should be available in Ireland so that Irish patients can avail of the type of treatment availed of by their European counterparts and that we also can be involved in the development of new types of treatment for these malignant diseases.</P>
    <P>Solid tumours such as breast and colon cancer are also extremely important in the area of cancer genetics.  Not only is the diagnosis of cancer made more accurate by the presence of the genetic abnormality, but it is now clear that certain congenital abnormalities of genes may predispose people to a high incidence of cancer, particularly cancer of the breast, ovary and colon, which we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>Many studies in other countries have underpinned this.  A recent study of Ashkenazi Jews <Col N="850" /> has pinpointed quite accurately the type of defects and how they can be diagnosed.  I know the Minister is always grateful to me for my reading of medical literature.  The paper I am referring to on Ashkenazi Jews is from <i>Nature Medicine,</i> volume 2, No. 11, November 1996.  While it is not a central part of the paper, there is an interesting part where it points to an excess of pancreatic cancer in families with a certain mutation in their DNA in Canada and Ireland. We have quite an incidence of pancreatic cancer and one wonders if genetically there is pressure along isolated seaboards of Canada and elsewhere with low immigration figures over a long period.  It may be important to look at such areas. If the Minister's officials are interested I will naturally give them a copy of this paper.</P>
    <P>It is essential that Irish patients should have access to the types of diagnosis which will become more prevalent and common in future years.  The above types of diagnostic tests require both that we should refer to a classical cario-typing &mdash; in other words, we have to get to know everyone's DNA &mdash; and also to more recently developed molecular genetic tests.  Coupled with the knowledge that in the majority of cases cancer is an acquired genetic defect, is the requirement that careful counselling be given to patients by a consultant qualified in the area of medical genetics. Appropriate laboratory and counselling staff should be available so that tests can be interpreted and explained to the population who have the illnesses in question.</P>
    <P>In summary, though inherited genetic disorders have traditionally been extremely important in terms of diagnosis and treatment, it is now obvious that malignant disease, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our community, is commonly an acquired genetic disorder. It may also represent a congenital susceptibility to cancer.  In some individuals current methods of diagnosis and treatment depend upon the provision of laboratory and clinical services to support the above strategy.</P>
    <P>We must now surely begin to properly address the genetic screening of cancer.  The Department of Health should at least have it on the agenda.  I realise that the centre in Crumlin has restarted but what I am looking for is really not part of that centre's brief.  I do not want to be chauvinistic about it but naturally in view of the great strides that have been made in the Department of Genetics in Trinity College, which I know the Minister is well aware of, I hope the Minister will see such a centre being associated with the Trinity department.  I do not have to tell the Minister that the work they have done there is world class.  One constantly sees the department's work quoted in medical literature.</P>
    <P>Screening people with an inherited disposition to any disease, but particularly to something like cancer, is very emotive.  Such are the increasing possibilities of a cure by looking at the genetic lesion in the cell and dealing with it, it is necessary <Col N="851" /> to incorporate genetic treatment into the cancer cell on a service basis.</P>
    <P>One of the most incredible developments in medicine that I have seen in the last few years is that we are now getting to the stage of treating diseases on a molecular basis.  We have the talent to do work on this and we have a community to look at.  We have serious mortality and morbidity from cancer so I hope the Minister will put this aspect of cancer screening on his Department's agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this short Bill is being taken in the Seanad.  One must welcome the establishment of the population register for national screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer.  It enables the National Cancer Registry Board to continue collecting important data relating to cases involving all forms of cancer. Cancer is one of the major causes of death in this country and it is a worrying factor in any home where the illness recurs, because it is hereditary. Years ago cancer was something that just applied to elderly people but that has changed over the years and one now sees younger people stricken by the illness.  In my own town last week we buried a young lad of 12 who developed cancer two years ago.  The family wonders why it happened to them.</P>
      <P>In certain areas of the country and in certain parts of the world the incidence of cancer is much higher than in others.  I recently heard a consultant speaking about the incidence of bowel cancer in a foreign country he had visited.  The incidence of bowl cancer was almost nil in that country because the staple diet was a strain of wheat. Here, however, the incidence of bowel cancer can be quite high.</P>
      <P>The strategy the Minister announced last week is most welcome as a way of dealing with all matters relating to cancer treatment.  The access to information relating to cancer treatment is important.  It is not always easy for people to travel from Donegal to St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin or elsewhere for such treatment.  I know it is not possible to find the necessary money for all forms of treatment required in every county but I welcome the developments that have taken place and the extra money the Minister has put in to develop these services.</P>
      <P>We must look seriously at the promotional side of the issue.  The Minister should ensure that as much money as possible is put in to promoting healthy life styles.  Young people should be advised and educated how they can enjoy themselves without getting into dangerous areas like smoking.  Many people still smoke even though it causes cancer and we do not seem to be able to get the message through to them.</P>
      <P>Cancer research costs a small fortune.  It is a world wide problem and every country is trying to do its best.  Cancer prevention treatment has developed, which is most welcome, but we must keep our fingers on the button at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> I am worried about the number of deaths from cancer in this country.  The Minister mentioned a figure of 7,500, which accounts for a quarter of all deaths here, and one third of those are under the age of 65.  That is a worrying factor.  A figure of 660 deaths from breast cancer in people aged under 65 was mentioned.  When one looks at the situation in relation to cervical cancer one finds a form of identification that shows that in 20 to 30 per cent of cases it can be avoided if proper screening is carried out.  What we are discussing mostly concerns women but we have to get everyone to react to the problem.  We must have organised screening programmes but it is not always easy to get the message through.  People are wary of being screened, women more so.  When women go for blood transfusions the fear of being rejected is a horrible thought.  Once they get the first transfusion over they feel quite content, but if they reject it they feel they are not a whole person.</P>
    <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to comply with all legislation relating to data protection.  It is important to have a population register which is regularly updated. As Senator Henry mentioned, it is also important to have an association with the Northern Ireland because there is much coming and going between both jurisdictions.  We must get the message across that it is important for people to go for screening, even at an early age. People probably think they are healthy but lifestyles have changed, whether it concerns smoking, drinking or having sex, and it is important to have proper monitoring.  A proper information package must be developed inviting people for screening.  The Minister indicated that 75 per cent of women in the age group most at risk need to come forward for a proper programme to be developed.  The correct approach is important. We have to reassure women that they have nothing to worry about.</P>
    <P>Data protection was mentioned in relation to social welfare, the GMS payments board and health insurance boards.  We must ensure people understand that their names will be protected and that information which should not be, will not be passed on.  People will worry about this and we have to reassure them that it will be covered under the data protection legislation.  This type of information cannot be passed on at present.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for bringing forward the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and its objective of enabling the Minister to proceed with the establishment of population registers for national programmes of screening for breast and cervical cancers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the thrust of Senator Finneran's amendment.  I accept the Minister's sincerity and that he has no difficulty in principle with the amendment and that he cannot give a commitment to a screening programme because the jury in still out on whether it should be introduced, <Col N="853" /> but that he will introduce an amendment in the Lower House.</P>
    <P>There has been major concern over the quality and level of cancer treatment facilities available throughout the country.  I commend the Minister for his work in producing the major initiatives on cancer announced last November and the action plan for the delivery of these services announced on 4 March.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a legislative amendment to ensure that screening programmes comply with data protection requirements.  As such, it is an administrative proposal.  I welcome discussion about female deaths from cervical and breast cancer. Cancer accounts for approximately 20 per cent of female deaths.  Breast cancer is the most common cause of mortality from malignancy, accounting for approximately 650 deaths each year.  This is a frightening number.  Studies have shown that between 20 and 30 per cent of deaths from breast cancer in women over 50 could be prevented if a mass screening programme was established.  This is of vital importance and urgency.  I welcome the putting in place of measures to bring it about.</P>
    <P>Recommendations for a national programme of breast screening were made in 1992 by the Second Commission on the Status of Women of which I was a member.  In 1995 a women's health policy document was published and we had consultation throughout the country on it.  We are now coming forward with proposals but I cannot help noting that it takes a long time from the raising of concerns to the implementation of national programmes.  I know pilot programmes have to be set up, but this delay is frightening when one remembers the number of women dying from breast cancer.  The possibility of saving the lives of these women must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>When I was elected to the Seanad after being a member of the commission, I thought this would happen during the lifetime of this Dáil and Seanad.  However, it has not and we are now facing into another Dáil and Seanad.  How long more will it take before a national screening programme is in place?  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister and his commitment to this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that cancer of the cervix accounts for 60 to 70 deaths each year.  Cervical screening is a simple, quick and relatively inexpensive procedure.  Not all women at risk respond to requests to attend for screening and I am particularly concerned with women who are GMS patients.  Will the Minister clarify if women who are GMS patients can only have cervical free smears as a diagnostic rather then a screening tool?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that &ldquo;It will be important to run a pilot programme in the first instance to ensure that the national programme operates in the most effective manner&rdquo;.  The Eccles Street pilot project on breast screening was set up in 1989.  That was eight years ago and we still have no national screening programme for breast cancer. The Minister spoke about 60 to 70 women <Col N="854" /> dying each year and that &ldquo;In the case of cervical cancer, there is evidence that, where a pre-malignant condition known as CIN is identified, it can be treated with almost 100 per cent success.  CIN usually precedes cervical cancer, so identifying it before it develops further is very important.&rdquo;  We are talking about saving the lives of almost all of the 60 to 70 women dying each year from cervical cancer and if we have to wait for seven or eight years for a pilot programme we are talking about the lives or deaths of over 500 women.</P>
    <P>Considering what has happened in women's health, particularly in relation to the hepatitis C scandal, it is time we came out strongly and told women that we are concerned about their health and that we will put in place immediately measures to prevent the deaths of women.  I do not want to be critical of the Minister but it is a very important issue.  I ask him to finalise this as quickly and as urgently as possible.  I appreciate his commitment to the treatment and prevention of cancer, particularly in women.</P>
    <P>I welcome the major initiatives on cancer announced by the Minister in November and the main elements of the national cancer strategy, namely, the provision of cancer treatment services and their reorganisation throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of hospital treatment services being structured around the regional service involving the regional hospitals and the satellite hospitals in each of the eight health board areas. I understand an announcement has been made that there would be a lead centre in each health board area and that Tullamore would be the lead centre in the Midland Health Board region.  The SCHARR report concerning the region looked at the three general hospitals in Portlaoise, Tullamore and Mullingar and felt that they should be treated as one hospital unit, developing special services in each area.</P>
    <P>We have an oncology unit in Portlaoise which was opened by President Mary Robinson.  There are two oncology nurses there and a visiting oncologist, Professor Donal Holywood.  We also have a hospice in Portlaoise for the past eight years.  Both the hospice and the breast cancer clinic and centre in Portlaoise were the first of their kind to be developed outside Dublin.  They have the support and endorsement of Mr. Denis Doherty, director of the national development office which is being established to examine the country's health services.</P>
    <P>However, there is concern that there will be further delay with regard to the provision of an oncology service and breast cancer centre in the Midland Health Board region if they are not allocated to Portlaoise.  Much has been done there over the past eight years, especially the work led by consultant surgeon Peter Naughten, who only last year travelled to England, Wales and Italy to bring himself up to date with the latest treatments of breast cancer.</P>
    <P>The people of County Laois, including those working in the hospital, have displayed extraordinary commitment to support, on a voluntary <Col N="855" /> basis, funding for facilities for these units.  If we are committed to delivering these services to women as a matter of urgency, we must look at what we have, leave it in place and build on it, rather than developing a new unit elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make a commitment to develop specialist services in each of the hospitals as recommended to the Midland Health Board by the SCHARR report.  This would entail each area looking after specific health aspects, with the breast cancer and oncology centres for the region based in Portlaoise.  It would do much to provide immediate treatment and services for those requiring oncology treatment, especially women.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the position regarding medical card patients and cervical screening? Are patients entitled to smears free of charge? How long does he expect the pilot project on cervical screening to sit before there is a national programme?  This may be difficult but it is a matter of urgency and while it may not be relevant to this debate I would appreciate the Minister's views, given that we are considering screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for this action plan, for the major initiatives on cancer he has announced and for the Bill he has introduced.  He has an opportunity to deliver to women in the health area and I ask him to do so speedily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been in office just over two years.  Shortly after taking office he announced that a major priority would be the establishment of proper services to detect, treat and support those with cancer.  As a woman, let me say that this is very important because for a long number of years many women, especially in rural Ireland, had little access to these services. Indeed, in many instances by the time they were assessed it was too late.  We are all familiar with stories in rural constituencies of people being sent too late for treatment to St. Luke's Hospital or Hume Street Hospital, resulting in death from the lack of proper services.  The Minister recognised this and is to be commended on the speed of his response.  He has produced an action plan and a national strategy for the provision of cancer services. He is also to be commended on the work he has done in a short time and for the focus he has given to this area.  As a women I can say it is most welcome.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister launched an implementation of the plan in the various health boards.  There has been extensive consultations in each health board area and the proposals represent a dramatic advance on the service provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must appreciate the extraordinary work done by the Minister with regard to the Mid-Western Health Board.  He has proposed the appointment of a regional director for cancer services. This is important because the appointee will be responsible for organising and putting in place the national breast and cervical cancer screening programme.  The preparatory work will be <Col N="856" /> exhaustive and will involve much research and preparation.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a medical oncologist to the region will make it much easier to provide the necessary services to those who require chemotherapy and other cancer treatments.  For too long people who were sick had to travel to Dublin. The provision of such services at local level will be of huge benefit.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposed appointment of a haematologist to the Mid-Western Health Board. I appreciate that a specialist of that nature would have to be appointed to the Regional Hospital in Limerick, the central hospital within the region. The improvement work under way there is a big advantage to the region.  This is also helped by the improvements and the commitments given by the Minister to the hospitals within the region, especially Ennis General Hospital.  The people from the area appreciate his commitment because it means that general hospitals within their counties are now on a sound footing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that he is to appoint a palliative care consultant to the mid-west region.  A service of that kind is very important, especially for patients at an advanced stage of cancer.  It will make life much easier and provide the kind of assistance people need at a traumatic time.</P>
    <P>I also commend the Minister on his decision to establish a pilot programme in the mid-west region in respect of the national cervical screening programme.  I look forward to the implementation of the pilot programme in the region and I hope the information which emerges will be of use in putting in place the national screening programme. The Minister has also decided to give £2.5 million over two years for Milford hospice, which has provided a fine service to people with cancer at an advanced stage.  It has made life easier for them through the provision of a skilled professional service and it deserves every support.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with one particular aspect, having found during the course of the preparatory work that there is a difficulty in giving details of certain illnesses and patients.  This Bill is important because unless the consultants have the relevant detailed background information they will not be in a position to make assessments and derive conclusions.  The Bill is a positive measure for women's health.  Since taking office the Minister has shown a great interest in women's health and his actions are proof of this. He has dealt with specific issues in a responsible and caring manner.  Unlike previous Ministers for Health, he has dealt with the issues directly and, when necessary, provided financial and other supports to women.  Despite claims to the contrary, this is evident from a cold assessment of the provision of real support, financial compensation in some instances and the positive action he is taking with this Bill.  We have heard a lot of huff and puff from a variety of past Ministers but this Minister has acted in a positive and responsible fashion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> Once the screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer are in place women should be contacted for screening to get them into the system. The special committees that have been appointed will have to examine closely the issues surrounding access to screening for women in isolated rural areas.  It is often the case that it is too late when they go to the doctor.  A strong publicity campaign in the national and local media will be essential to the success of the programmes, as will the compilation of a register of the persons concerned. I hope the special committees will be in a position to address these matters.</P>
    <P>This legislation will be to the advantage of women.  The Minister and his Department should be commended for their trojan work over the last two and a half years in putting together this national strategy, the implementation plan and bringing forward this Bill to enable the programme to be put in place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank Senators for their contributions. Without this Bill we would be unable to proceed with the screening programmes we have planned and the breast screening programme we intend to commence in early June.  The Bill focuses on screening for breast and cervical cancer, which has been successful.  Men can get breast cancer but it is extremely rare and there is no screening process available for male breast cancer.  The jury is still out, so to speak, on prostate cancer.  Screening for prostate cancer can be introduced if found to medically effective in the future. However, there is no medical evidence yet that screening initiatives would be effective in respect of prostate cancer.</P>
      <P>There is a range of cancers from which people can become very ill and die.  Simply because we mention breast and cervical cancer does not mean that strategies are not in place for the treatment of other cancers.  In the cancer strategy document and the action plan which I produced, the treatment of other cancers in the regional centres around the country will be vastly improved in the course of this year and over the next three years as the action plan is implemented.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals more with data protection than health &mdash; it is an amendment to data protection legislation.  It applies only to screening.  The reason breast and cervical cancer are the only two cancers mentioned is that the action plan has two commitments to screening programmes, one for breast cancer and one for cervical cancer.  The Bill is not imbalanced in gender terms nor is it an attempt to ignore prostate cancer or a range of other cancers, all of which are equally important. However, this amendment to data protection legislation is required to enable the screening programmes to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand Senator Finneran's point that at some time in the future, perhaps as a result of an EU wide survey on screening initiatives in respect of prostate cancer, the medical evidence on the effectiveness of such screening will be conclusive. If that is the case a future Minister for Health <Col N="858" /> may announce a screening programme for prostate cancer.  I agree with Senator Finneran that while this Bill is before the Oireachtas we may as well make provision in data protection terms for that eventuality.  I have given a commitment to do so.  I will introduce an amendment along the lines the Senator has suggested.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the text of the amendment which the Senator intends to propose because I cannot have it scrutinised by the Attorney General's Office or the parliamentary draftsman.  It is not irregular, nor is it intended to be disrespectful to the House, that I should introduce the amendment in the other House.  It will have to come back to the Seanad in any event and the Senator will have a chance to comment at that point.  The section refers to &ldquo;the Minister for Health or a health board, hospital or other body or agency participating in any national breast or cervical screening programme...&rdquo;.  It may be sufficient to alter that to &ldquo;...any breast, cervical or prostate screening programme...&rdquo; in which case we would not need the full text of the Senator's proposed amendment.  However, I will need to get advice on the matter from the Attorney General or the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>I have no plan to introduce a screening programme for prostate cancer at present because there is no conclusive medical advice on its effectiveness. However, I am prepared to take it on board and make provision for the eventuality of a future Minister being inhibited in introducing such a screening programme, as I have been inhibited in introducing a breast and cervical screening programme, by the rigours of the data protection legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry informs us all very much on these matters and I thank her for her contribution. If we included items such as diabetes and coronary heart disease it would make the Bill very wide.  The advice is that people have a constitutional right to privacy which is protected in statute law, principally in data protection legislation. If we make exceptions which, in effect, breach the right to privacy because of other rights, such as public health and personal health, we will have to be very specific.  A Bill which was too broadly cast would not pass muster.  As soon as we introduce other conditions, more and more of the population will be covered and we could have a situation where we were making exceptions in respect of the totality of the population under which a health board, hospital or Minister could pass on personal details to form a registry, and this would have certain implications.</P>
    <P>There is merit in what the Senator said about people being screened for breast cancer receiving other checks at the same time.  There is nothing in the Bill which prevents that.  The enabling legislation is to allow the Minister, health board or hospital to acquire data and to allow the institution or individual to provide the data.  The purpose is to establish a population register; people in the appropriate age group will then be notified and invited to participate, for example, in a breast screening programme.  What happens when they <Col N="859" /> arrive for screening is a matter between the individual and the doctor.  The intent is to have a screening programme but there is nothing in this legislation which rules out any other medical advice being given simultaneously.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Registry Board has links with Northern Ireland.  They are not very formal links but there is a good working relationship and they contact each other on a regular basis.  The two registries were launched at the one ceremony as part of the North-South health initiative by the two Ministers for Health.</P>
    <P>In regard to molecular research, the Health Research Board accepts applications for research into all forms of cancer &mdash; molecular, genetic, clinical, epidemiological and health service research.  The £80,000 per year is extra funding to allow the co-ordination of the research.  One can tender for the money which is already provided across the range of research.  The £80,000 which I announced is an extra initiative to co-ordinate the research so that we will get the best possible results from it.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who contributed for the support they have given the cancer initiatives I announced.  I hope they will be very effective.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran asked if the money which is being taken from every Estimate to pay the nurses will impact on any of the development money for cancer.  It will not.  The moneys provided for cancer in 1997 will be available in full and any adjustment to the Estimates arising from the settlement of the nurses' dispute will not reduce that money by any amount.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the main issues.  I thank Senators for their general support.  I ask Senator Finneran not to divide the House and to accept the commitment I have given to get an appropriate amendment to meet his requirements, to introduce it in the Dáil and to return to the Seanad the following day, if that is possible.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 contains the meat of these amendments.  It is a simple amendment.  The Minister attempted to say I was somehow committing him to a screening programme for prostate cancer.  That is not the intention of my amendment or my claim on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> I am asking for this enabling legislation to contain this amendment which would allow a future Minister for Health to do what this Minister said he or she might want to do.  If sometime in the future &mdash; I hope in the near future &mdash; it is decided that a screening programme is appropriate for prostate cancer, we will have included in this legislation the facility to allow health boards, the Department or any other agency to implement such a programme.  I do not think that is too much to ask.  It would be very appropriate to do so, given that there is a major debate in Europe at the moment on prostate cancer screening.  I predict that such a screening programme will become part and parcel of our future health policy.  Why not include in the enabling legislation a measure which will facilitate the provision of such a screening programme in the future?  If we are to look forward in this debate and say we are treating cancer seriously, we must do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted to some extent that the action plan for cancer is defective &mdash; although I welcome it &mdash; because it excludes many cancers. It includes breast cancer and cervical cancer but excludes many others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that provision is made in the action plan to accommodate the screening of breast and cervical cancer, which must be costed.  There is no costing in the action plan for the screening of prostate cancer.  Therefore, it does not include the opportunity for screening for prostate cancer, irrespective of what the Minister says.  I accept that, but I am asking him to include it in the legislation so that in the event of a future decision to have such a screening programme the Minister will not have to amend this legislation.  The Minister should take this matter on board now and include it in the legislation for the future.  Effective screening for prostate cancer is now possible.  It may not be 100 per cent accurate but it is possible through blood tests, ultrasounds or X-rays.  While the procedures are not conclusive, the evidence is that these tests are, to a large extent, successful.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept the amendments.  I do not understand why the Attorney General or the parliamentary draftsman would have a problem with them because I was careful to use the wording of the subsection in amendment No. 2 regarding a prostate cancer screening programme. It should not be necessary for the Attorney General or the parliamentary draftsman to consider the amendments in depth.  Only a quick glance is necessary because the words in section 1(1)(b) are used in the amendment.  It contains nothing other than a statement that an opportunity will be provided in the future for a prostate cancer screening programme.  This should be included in the Bill to facilitate such a programme authorised by the current Minister or a future Minister in this or later years.</P>

      <P>I do not understand Senator Finneran's difficulty because the Minister is being reasonable and accommodating.  When Senator Finneran told me this morning that he wanted to table amendments I immediately spoke to the Minister's office.  The Minister examined the matter and accepted the principle of the amendments, which is what matters.  He indicated that he wants legal certainty that the words included are foolproof and he has undertaken to introduce an amendment in the other House to incorporate Senator Finneran's concerns.  I have undertaken to ensure time is available on the next sitting day of the Seanad to deal with the amended Bill.  I guarantee that the Bill will not be delayed.  If necessary and possible, it could be taken on the same day as the Bill concludes in the other House.  However, if that is not possible, it will be taken on the next available day.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran is getting what he wants in a generous and ungrudging manner.  He is being asked to allow the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General to consider the wording to ensure it is legally correct.  The amended Bill will be dealt with in the Seanad within 24 or 48 hours of it being discussed in the Dáil.

The Minister has not given a commitment in relation to such programmes but he has been generous in giving a commitment that he will introduce an amendment in the other House once the matter has been clarified by the Attorney General.  The Minister said it may be possible to include &ldquo;prostate screening&rdquo; in line 19 after &ldquo;cervical screening&rdquo;.  It will then be necessary to include &ldquo;women and men&rdquo; in line 22 because women do not have prostate glands.  I accept the Minister's statement.  He is being generous in giving Senator Finneran what he wants. I also accept that the amended Bill will be brought back to the House very quickly.

      <P>The Minister has gone a long way towards solving the problem raised by Senator Finneran.  Most people agree with the Senator's points and sympathise with them. However, the Bill relates to screening for diseases which affect women; this is most important. There is not the same demand for screening for prostate cancer and the evidence does not support the points made by Senator Finneran.  How high is the incidence of prostate cancer?  Most <Col N="862" /> people who work in the health area say it is not as high as cervical and breast cancers.  In addition, there is no indication of the cost, if any, of including prostate cancer screening in the Bill.  The need for such screening is not as great as for cervical and breast cancer screening.  The House should deal with the Bill as quickly as possible and the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the Senator's demands.</P>

      <P>I support the principle of the amendments but the Minister stated that he cannot include prostate cancer screening without adequate medical evidence to support its effectiveness. This is the crucial issue facing the Minister. EU studies in this area will not be concluded until 1998 but a study completed in the UK showed there is no evidence at this time to support the introduction of a prostate cancer screening programme.  The Minister must be guided by these aspects in accepting the principle of the amendments.  He cannot go any further.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I explained my position in relation to the amendments but having listened to the Senator's views and those of Senator Henry, I wish to suggest another formulation to the legal advisers.  Other screening programmes for cancer may prove effective before a decision is made in relation to prostate cancer. For example, the medical advice in 12 months may be that screening for bowel cancer could be very effective.  Rather than confining it to prostate cancer, I wish to consider another formulation along the lines of &ldquo;any cancer screening programmes authorised by the Minister&rdquo;.  I want to have this legally examined rather than confining the provision.  There is much merit in the advice I have received in the House, particularly from Senator Henry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for taking my motion on the adjournment today.  My question relates to four transit vans which have been seized by the Garda in Letterkenny.  These vans are valued in excess of £250,000 and they have been seized by gardaí in Donegal as part of their investigations into van theft.  Not all of the vans which have been seized have been stolen; some very reputable owners and dealers have bought the vans with a clear tax book.</P>
      <P>The situation I am concerned about relates to vans which may well have been stolen in some parts of Great Britain.  The owner applies to his insurance company who pay up on the stolen van. The van may well be found some time later and it may be discovered that some of its parts have been removed.  Insurance companies then take possession of the vehicles and sell them off again. Some garage owners or dealers then put the missing parts back into the vans and put them up for sale again.  Most of the vans are Q registered vans which have had full checks for roadworthiness and have been given a clean bill of health by the British authorities in Swansea and by the authorities in Northern Ireland at Coleraine.  The paperwork is perfectly in order on these vehicles. Many of the vans make their way back into places like Donegal and are given full customs clearance by the customs authorities in Donegal and full import duty is paid on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a number of these vans have been seized by the Garda, who are alleging they are stolen.  To date, the Garda have stated that 23 vans with bogus registration plates have been uncovered in the county.  The majority of these vans may well be worth over £10,000 each and the Garda maintain that the purchasers are not <Col N="864" /> aware they are stolen by a large network of people who have a way of disposing of the vehicles.  A number of people have been interviewed by gardaí.  In a number of cases, a number of dealers have themselves informed the gardaí they have bought vans.  The same people who have paid between £8,000 and £10,000 for the vans have had them checked through Coleraine in Northern Ireland and through Swansea in Wales and have gone through customs clearance. They have been found to be in order.  Then the Garda come along and seize the vehicles.  I think it is unfair that people who have purchased the vans in good faith and have all the paperwork properly in order should suffer the embarrassment of having the vans seized.  Can the Minister tell me why the vans have been seized when they have been given full customs clearance?</P>

It is not the practice of the Minister for Justice to make statements to the House concerning the progress of individual Garda investigations except in singular instances where the circumstances of an investigation are so exceptional that such a course of action is deemed to be appropriate.  With regard to this case, I can only say that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that 23 motor vehicles and one JCB digger have been seized by gardaí.  I have further been informed that 18 of these vehicles have been identified as having been stolen and that inquiries are ongoing into this matter.  I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful to the Senator at this point in time.  I am sure he will appreciate that the subject of the Garda inquiry is confidential.</P>

I put down this motion because so far we have seen no evidence of action by the Government to cope with this millennium bomb.  We have seen almost nothing at all in the Irish media about this matter.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people are looking forward to the year 2000 as a time for celebration.  People see it as the dawning of an exciting new era.  I hope it will be both of those things.  Unfortunately, for purely fortuitous and technical reasons, the turn of the century has within it the seeds of potential destruction for a society such as our own that depends on computers and microprocessors.  The problem I am highlighting here today arises for <Col N="865" /> two reasons.  An overwhelming number of computers and microprocessors use only two numbers to record the date of the year.  From the point of view of most computers, this is not the year 1997, it is the year 97.  In 1999 we will be in the year 99 and so on.  The problem lies with the &ldquo;so on&rdquo; because we run into a brick wall when we come to the year 2000.  As far as a computer is concerned, that year is not 99 plus 1, it is 00.  Computers will view this as turning the clock back to 1900 instead of onwards to the year 2000.  My attention was drawn to this when some supermarkets in Europe discovered that products, with long shelf lives were being rejected at checkouts because the best before date was recorded as 1900 or 1901.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  Many computers are quite unable to cope with that situation.  That is the first cause of the problem.  The second reason this situation is potentially disastrous lies in its widespread nature.  Every computer and every device which has a microprocessor inside it has a clock.  This clock records the time and the date and is critical to everything the microprocessor or computer does.  We are talking here about lifts, traffic lights, cash registers; but crucially we are talking about hospital equipment such as drips and other life support devices.  This applies to virtually every device we use nowadays.  This is a real time bomb.  If there is one of these microprocessors inside each drip, over each hospital bed, it will be a huge job to get them corrected.  This is a very important issue because many of these devices will stop working altogether when confronted with year 2000 information or they will start to perform unpredictably. Either way, chaos could result.</P>
      <P>Let me give an example.  I will be 63 years old in the year 2000 but a computer recording my age may well read that I am minus 37.  This could have a major impact on pay roll, life assurance, retirement and social security programmes.  Unless computers are properly programmed, they will either freeze up altogether or they will start spewing out garbage.  &ldquo;Chaos&rdquo; is the right word to use. I am not trying to create a scare here but there is a very real threat.  My concern is that time is fast running out for us to cope with this problem properly.  There are 1,023 days left until the year 2000, tomorrow there will be 1,022 and sometime next month we will have reached 999.</P>
      <P>We have not awakened to this threat.  The more we learn about this problem, the worse it become.  When it first came to light, people thought it applied only to large mainframe computers manufactured in the 1960s and 1970s when computer memory was so expensive that programmers had to use two rather than four digits to record dates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As time goes on it transpires the problem is more pervasive and extends to more recent computers, <Col N="866" /> even to popular personal computers.  Most significantly, it extends to tiny microprocessors embedded in almost everything as control mechanisms. That is why the country could grind to a halt before the New Year bells stop ringing on 1 January 2000.  Lives, as I described, could be at stake if we do not take the right action in time.</P>
    <P>I am not too worried about big business because such companies have computer experts who, I hope, are looking at the implications.  In fact, it was the head of information technology in my company, Eric Hayes, who alerted me to the threat and we have been carefully planning our response since.  It is expensive, but it must be done.  There have been calls in recent weeks at European level for something to be done.</P>
    <P>I am profoundly worried about the implications for small businesses, which do not have these resources.  I am equally worried about the implications for public services, which are constrained by tight budgets.  In the public services many of those who work with microprocessors have no technical knowledge of what makes them work. If a small shopkeeper opens up for business on 1 January 2000 and to his astonishment finds he cannot open the till &mdash; because every till has a date and a time stamp in it and is usually connected to certain security &mdash; he will have to summon help.  However, he will not be able to get help because every other shopkeeper will be fighting for the attention of a handful of service engineers.</P>
    <P>Years of work are required to put this right. We will not be able to handle this when it happens. Our only hope of avoiding chaos and financial loss is to begin to deal with it now.  It affects not only shops but traffic lights, lifts, life support machines, etc.  I will not mention video recorders because nobody knows how to use them.  I am worried about what will happen in a busy hospital when its infrastructure suddenly shuts down or starts to behave unpredictably.  A wide range of public services on which citizens depend and which in some cases can affect life and death are potentially at risk.</P>
    <P>We cannot stop the millennium or move the deadline, which is irrevocably fixed.  We cannot solve the problem when it happens because it will be too late.  We must start to take action now. March 1997 is infinitely better than December 1999 or even April 1997.  The sooner we become aware, the better chance we have of minimising the potential economic and social change.  We need a national wake up call not next week, next month or after a general election, but now.</P>
    <P>I am sure this issue is on somebody's list, and I hope the Minister of State will confirm that.  It is clearly not on the top of a list because until now we have heard virtually nothing about the problem from Government or the media.  We must not forget that with a general election looming, we could lose a further six or seven months until the dust settles.  That is why a national task force should be put in place before the end of the month.  The task force could carry out a national awareness campaign and mastermind whatever measures are necessary to ensure we deal with <Col N="867" /> the problem and minimise the damage, especially that to small businesses and public services.  To coin a phrase &mdash; tomorrow is too late.  We need effective action now if the millennium is to be an occasion of celebration rather than disaster.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for raising this issue and for publicising it.  If people realise the problem exists, they are more likely to address it in the way the Senator has done in his company.  This problem arises from using double digits for dates.  When we reach the year 2000, our time chips may think we are in the year 1900.  There are significant implications for computer systems and a computer could mistakenly consider that someone born in 1925 is 25 years old or minus 25 years and not 75.  That would put pay to one's pension.  Applications could sort incorrectly also.  Banks calculating interest levels could find that programs yield seriously incorrect values.  Telecom operators could have problems with their switching hardware and customer charging problems.  Anybody dealing in real time will have a problem.</P>
      <P>We no longer need two digits because a computer's memory is greater.  When our computer crashes at home and we consider replacing it, we find the memory of computers has increased six or 12 times.  The two digit system exists and it is often in the clock chips which operate independently of power supply and so on.</P>
      <P>The problem which arose due to cost and technology considerations was compounded by habit and convention and went on for some time. People thought the old programs in the mainframes would be obsolete by the year 2000 but they are still going strong.  Reinvestment in new programmes will have to be bunched.  The problem may arise sooner than expected as many computer programs use the values 0 and 99 to signify invalid values, so we may hit it for applications in 1999 rather than in the year 2000.  It is a global problem that not only affects Irish companies but those in Europe and America. Throughout the world people have been putting together programs and projects to alert people to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>It is both a hardware and a software issue.  It is not only large companies with mainframes which will potentially be affected but SMEs with PC systems. These time chips have been embedded into products such as lifts, fax machines, telephone switches, environmental control systems, time locks on safes and, as the Senator said, medical applications, which are very important.  Companies producing products with a long shelf life will start to have problems soon.  For example, a computer may think a credit card due to expire in the year 2001 should have expired in 1901.  Such problems could arise fairly soon, and some credit card companies are already having problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for each business, and the Department for Enterprise and Employment cannot be a <Col N="868" /> computer consultant to every business.  However, we must alert people to this issue, which is why this Adjournment Matter is so important.  There has been considerable coverage in the media to date, some of which may appear to be in realm of science fiction.  However, this is a serious issue requiring considerable investment and reinvestment.  Each company should look at its equipment to see what needs to be done.  It is not for Government to prescribe the answer for individual users but it can be of use in raising awareness and in getting people involved in planning.</P>
    <P>I will discuss the Senator's helpful suggestion of a national task force.  We have asked Forfás to examine the issue and meetings have taken place between officers of the Department, the industrial development agencies and industry representative bodies to explore how best to proceed with an information awareness campaign focused on business.  That is often a good way to relay the message.  In addition, the Director of Consumer Affairs intends to consult with industry generally and will then determine what actions might be appropriate to advise consumers on this matter. We have an <i>ad hoc</i> task force in place but perhaps we should formalise it in the way the Senator suggests.</P>
    <P>Government must also look to its own systems. The Senator is interested in customer services in Departments and agencies.  I understand the Department of Finance is currently finalising a circular with instructions for issue to Departments and offices on information technology systems in the year 2000 and will ask Departments to look at the year 2000 compliance status of their IT infrastructures and systems.  My Department has already embarked on this planning exercise and the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, which deal in big bucks and have large mainframe systems, have completed that work.  Departments have also been asked to ensure the problem is not introduced to already compliant systems by procuring only year 2000 compliant products and services.  Old stock remains in circulation and it is important to agree a standard accreditation for the year 2000.  People may have difficulties if they are not upgrading their systems or limping along on Stone Age word processors.  People sometimes upgrade their systems by buying an off the shelf package, such as Windows 95 instead of Windows 3.1.  However, those using purpose built systems also need to look at how they might upgrade.  The Senator raised an important point about microchips in health care systems and I will raise this with the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>A special interest group on the implications of the year 2000 for the public service was set up last year.  The group is chaired by the Department of Finance and meets on a monthly basis.  The Senator's point is very timely and some work is taking place.  However, we need to redouble our efforts.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 March 1997.</P>
