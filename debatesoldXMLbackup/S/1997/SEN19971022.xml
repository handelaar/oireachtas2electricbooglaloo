      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline his plans for fortifying flour with folates, in view of the high incidence of neural tube defects in children born in Ireland and the recent advances which show that increased intake of folic acid by potential parents lowers the chances of such an occurrence.</P>
      <P>I have also notice from Senator Ridge of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to issue a general directive to CIE to ensure that the voice over facility on the DART, which is not being operated, is immediately restored as it is causing great distress to the visually impaired who cannot be aware of their destination without this facility.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Henry as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Ridge on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>Items 1, 2 and 6, motion 4.  Item 1 deals with the referral of the Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997, to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills to be taken without debate.  As regards item 2 &mdash; Merchant Shipping Commissioners of Irish Lights Bill, 1997: Committee Stage &mdash; if the House is agreeable and the time is available Report and Final Stages will also be taken.  Item 6, motion 4, implementation of the Refugee Bill &mdash; to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.; I propose that ten minutes be allocated to speakers.</P>

      <P>Before I call Senator Manning, I point out that I have been and will continue to be lenient in the amount of time I will give each of the Leaders who wish to raise matters on behalf of their parties or groups. However, in the case of other Senators who wish to raise matters on the Order of Business, I insist that they confine themselves to questions to the Leader which relate directly to the business of the House.  Lengthy contributions are not in order. While a Senator may seek to have a debate on a particular matter or to have an item included on the Order of Business, it is not in order to discuss the merit or content of that matter or item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. In view of the fact that Senator Ridge's matter on the Adjournment has been ruled out of order for proper reasons, will the Leader make time available for an omnibus debate on disability?  Senator Ridge has raised an issue which is one aspect of mindless bureaucracy making life more difficult for people who already have a physical disability. There were some important debates on this topic in the last Seanad and I ask the Leader to make Government time available to discuss this topic in the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>The Leader indicated the legislation he hoped we would be dealing with in this session two weeks ago.  There are now six weeks at most left in this session; can the Leader be more specific about the legislation we can expect to be introduced in the House in that period?  From my experience on both sides of the House, there will almost certainly be a dearth of legislation during November.  At the beginning of December Departments will suddenly discover Bills that are of the utmost importance, all Stages of which need to be taken in 25 minutes.  There will be Ministers rushing in to ask if Bills can be taken. There is no way this side of the House will agree to Bills being rushed through before Christmas, as happened when, as Leader, I asked the same. This is particularly true if it follows a drought of legislation in the preceding weeks.  The Leader will have the support of all sides of the House when insisting that Departments follow proper procedures.</P>
      <P>I have already raised the problem of accommodation but, regrettably, it has not been resolved. It is now critical for my group and I believe the Fianna Fáil group is also having problems with the lack of accommodation.  It is a scandal that this House does not have control of its own affairs and is not in a position to regulate the distribution of office space among parties.  We must wait until a civil servant decides what we will be allowed.  I ask the Leader, who is very forceful in these matters, to make this a priority and to resolve the issue.  There is also the ongoing problem of the ratio of secretarial staff to Senators; it is worse than it was in the last Seanad.  This will also have to be resolved urgently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of legislation to be taken during this session, the Leader gave a commitment on the first sitting day that we would be given plenty of notice of forthcoming legislation. It is clear from the list published by the Department of the Taoiseach, which was given to us by the Leader, that drafting of legislation is complete.  I too ask the Leader to outline the legislation that will be dealt with in this session. The Leader should indicate to Departments that Bills should be initiated in the Seanad.  While the Dáil is arguing about other matters, legislation which should and could be initiated here is mounting up.</P>
      <P>It would also be appropriate for people planning for the medium term if Senators knew the sitting arrangements over the next few weeks.  We will certainly find ourselves with difficulties coming up to Christmas; all the indications of that are there now.  Certain legislation must be taken before the end of the year.  If the Appropriation Bill, which must be dealt with, is added that effectively takes up the final week.  We are running out of time.  The sitting arrangements must be closely examined.</P>
      <P>There are a number of non-legislative issues which need to be discussed at length.  The taxi service for Dublin city is causing huge problems. I would appreciate a debate on this.  There does not need to be a confrontation.  It is difficult to raise this as an Adjournment matter because this is an area for which there is no direct ministerial responsibility; it has been handed over to the local authorities.  However, we could take an overview of it in this House.  Parents are worried about their children coming home at night.  Some people will not come to the city because they cannot get transport home, and there are people taking risks with the driving laws.</P>
      <P>The second issue I wish to discuss was raised by the main Government party when on this side of the House, that is, the Bill concerning the Shannon.  The Government has stated that it was considering establishing an inland water authority. There has never been a national debate on that issue.  We need a clear understanding of governmental direction on this.  We do not need a Green Paper or White Paper but we do need to know the views of the Government.  These issues could be considered for debate on a Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the widespread anger and incomprehension in this House and among the public, the female population in particular, that, under current legislation, the DPP is unable to initiate prosecutions in what Judge Finlay outlined in the hepatitis C tribunal as cases of culpable negligence, will the Leader indicate if the Government will undertake as a matter of urgency to introduce the necessary reforms to allow cases of criminal or culpable negligence to be prosecuted in our courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I too wanted to raise that matter. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice, <Col N="384" /> Equality and Law Reform to come to the House and explain what steps the Government proposes to take to resolve the legal difficulties the DPP claims to have encountered in relation to the hepatitis C scandal?  It is not acceptable in terms of natural justice that prosecutions would not follow.  There is a huge onus on the Government to resolve the difficulties if current legislation does not enable the DPP to proceed.  If it is not sufficient we must put new legislation in place.  This is a fit subject for debate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise another matter which may not be comparable to other matters already raised, that is, facilities in this House.  It is astonishing that we are still so restricted in our access to the House.  I raised this issue before but I was misunderstood.  I meant that it is astonishing that the electricians, the broadcasting people and the cleaning people are allowed into the House at weekends but we are not allowed in after 9 o'clock on a Friday evening.  I do not see why.  Sometimes it is much easier to work at the weekend when you can clear your desk.  Will the Leader of the House raise this urgently as a matter of interest to Members?  In practical terms you may be asked suddenly to go abroad, perhaps on the business of this House &mdash; and a document or passport can be in the office and it is virtually impossible to get it.  We are grown up people and should be entrusted with keys to our offices, particularly when others are allowed in.  I am not making a class distinction here but I do not understand why this is the case.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if I am right in assuming that Ireland is one of only two of the 38 countries in the Council of Europe that has not absorbed the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic legislation?  I find this astonishing as one of the architects of the convention was Seán MacBride, a person for whom I did not have a great deal of time, except in this instance.  It seems extraordinary that such a person should have his work ignored.  Perhaps we could have a debate on the matter and open up this avenue.  This might require a referendum but I understand there may be a referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty in the spring.  Perhaps both referenda could be held on the same day.  This House might open up the debate by way of an informed discussion on the matter but, in the meantime, I would be grateful if the Leader could seek the information I request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to address the House on urban renewal and designated areas?  A debate has begun as to the value of this scheme, particularly regarding designated seaside resorts.  I have no doubt that urban renewal has taken place as a result of what has happened in designated areas.  As the present scheme will not end for another year, now might <Col N="385" /> be a good time to initiate a discussion in the House to help the Minister in his review of urban renewal and the designated areas scheme.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation of local authorities is very much in people's minds at present.  A discussion should take place on this matter, particularly regarding funding because the authorities will have to adopt new methods and new committees will have to be set up.  This will not be possible given present local authority staffing levels.  There is an urgent need for an early discussion on the matter.</P>
      <P>A general debate on foreign affairs should take place as soon as possible.  In the meantime the Leader might ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ask the EU to address, as a matter of urgency, the horrific situation in Algeria during the past 12 to 15 months when more than 60,000 people were killed by Government forces in certain areas and by rebel forces in others.  There is a need for intervention by either the United Nations or the EU.  I believe the EU would have moved more quickly in this regard but for the attitude of France who seem to be vetoing any intervention by the EU.  I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to urgently request the Organisation of Islamic Countries to intervene in this conflict.  This is being seen as militant Islam fighting against the Government but what is happening in Algeria is totally against the precepts of the Islamic faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the promised legislation to give statutory effect to the western commission which replaces the western development partnership board.  Its headquarters is in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, and it has recruited its chief executive officer and staff.  However, it cannot proceed with its good work in developing the western region, which is the most disadvantaged in the country, until it is given statutory effect.  The previous Government promised to introduce a Bill on the matter.  The commission will use public funds and must also draw down funding from the private sector and the EU.  As that legislation would be non-contentious and would give rise to a very good debate, I ask the Leader to have the necessary legislation introduced in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the erection of pylons and masts?  The public is disturbed that some of these have been exempted from the planning process, while ordinary developers must follow very strict planning regulations.  It is important to debate this matter. The late Erskine Childers asked me a long time ago why we had let the ESB destroy Barnasmore Gap by erecting pylons there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on Northern Ireland before the Christmas recess?  Recent events here involving green books have alarmed a large section of the community in the Northern Ireland.  This House has no difficulty in having a very open and honest debate on the current situation <Col N="386" /> in the North, which would make a helpful contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader, with the consent of the House, enable the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Amendment) Bill, 1997, which is item 5 on the Order Paper, to be printed?  This is uncontroversial legislation which will enable local authorities to take into account the track record of cowboy developers when considering planning applications.  It is a problem throughout&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I interrupt Senator Ryan in order to clarify the matter for him.  The House can only decide on the introduction of the Bill if it has been already agreed that item 5 is to be included in the Order of Business.  If the Senator wants to pursue this matter now, he should move an amendment to the Order of Business to seek to have item 5 included.  Does the Senator wish to formally move an amendment to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>That item 5 be included in the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to look favourably on this item, given its uncontroversial nature.  There is a problem with housing estates which are left unfinished by some builders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on disability.  If the Leader agrees to such a debate, I hope it will be as wide ranging as possible, and cover mental and psychological disabilities as well as physical disability.</P>
      <P>I hope no one minds me mentioning that.  Considering I come from Ulster, I am a Catholic, a Nationalist and a member of a republican party, I hesitated to speak on the Order of Business.  I hope you will excuse me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the inquiry made by the Leader of the Opposition regarding secretarial and accommodation facilities.  The House was elected on 6 August and met for the first time on 17 September.  The Leader has made some effort, but has encountered difficulties.  Will he do all in his power to resolve the outstanding problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support the comments on opening the Houses on Saturdays.  The Leader indicated last July that he would make inquiries on this matter. It should be possible to arrange at least a limited opening to Members.  I recently needed to gain entry on a Saturday.  While some of the senior officials were helpful it was a laborious way to proceed. <Col N="387" /></P>
    <P> The Leader appeared to indicate that the normal time allocated to Private Members' business has been changed.  While it may suit some Members to extend the allocated time it would mean less time for other business.  Will the Leader clarify the position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to reconsider ending the car scrappage scheme, which was one of the best schemes introduced by any Government?  It resulted in the vast majority of the old cars being taken off the roads. Given that the MOT testing of cars over four years of age will commence in 1998 it is wrong to end it.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated he will establish a high powered committee to consider the carnage on our roads.  Consideration should be given to a motorist's code of conduct.  For example, overtaking on the inside lanes of motorways and slow driving close to the centre of roads should be banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader explore how best the House could express its abhorrence of the recent leaking of documents from the Department of Foreign Affairs?  No matter how importantly one may view the presidential election and the gains or losses arising from the leaks, it is reprehensible given the damage to the fragile peace negotiations in the medium and long term. The House should condemn it with one voice. Perhaps the Leader will also convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the view of the House that no stone should be left unturned to bring the perpetrators to justice.</P>
      <P>The implications of what has happened are serious.  I know from talking to people in the North that it has undermined their confidence in dealing with Departments and public officials, which is regrettable.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader discuss with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the possibility of extending the powers of local authorities to engage and employ traffic police, who would be separate from the Garda Síochána, as a means of addressing the carnage on the roads?  It is an issue of major concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, the urgent need for changes in the free fuel system which runs for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April. This is much too short a period, particularly for elderly people who must purchase fuel in cold weather.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to point out to the Minister that £5 is totally inadequate to purchase a bag of coal.  The cheapest bag of coal in County Louth costs £6.50 but this is poor quality fuel.  There is an urgent need to examine this matter because it is unfair to elderly people and other recipients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Gallagher and Senator Quill in requesting a debate on the fact that it appears one must be poor to be prosecuted or go to jail in Ireland.  Yet again people in powerful positions have been rewarded for their inadequacies and failures.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain to the House what he proposes to do in terms of legislation and administrative and Garda practices to ensure that in future people in responsible positions who fail to discharge their duties will be accountable to the law and not just their consciences.  It is a most inadequate response to a serious health crisis for a huge number of people in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring to the Leader's attention the announcement by Lionbridge Technology, a major IT and computer company, of its intention to locate in Ballina.  This is a major breakthrough for the Ballina area and much credit is due to many people and different organisations, including the Ballina Industrial Development Association, the IDA and the new task force set up by the Minister following the collapse of the Asahi industry.  I also acknowledge the contribution of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, regarding the location of the industry in Ballina.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to use her office to bring to a successful conclusion the negotiations, which have been ongoing for the past three years, with the consortium of industrialists and FÁS regarding a major auto training centre.  Unfortunately, this matter has reached crisis proportions and the consortium of industrialists is almost at the point of breaking off negotiations.  This will lead to the loss of the centre in Mayo.  I ask the Leader to urge the Minister to try to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the notice of the Minister for Agriculture and Food the problems regarding the legislation on dairy hygiene which is being implemented in Ireland by officials on behalf of the EU.  They are being much more stringent in terms of the implementation of the Act in Ireland than in any other European country.  This is causing serious hardship, financial and otherwise, to farmers and, as a result, many people are getting out of dairying. This is very sad and I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the House I express sympathy to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, following the death of his mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Norris and Cosgrave asked about facilities in the House.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges will meet at 4 p.m. today and, with the Cathaoirleach's permission, <Col N="389" /> I hope to discuss the matters highlighted which Senator Fitzgerald, the Government Whip, and I, have tried to bring to a conclusion.  Perhaps we could progress matters at the discussion today. It is not good enough and I support everything that has been said.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole asked for the list of legislation.  Senator Manning is speaking with much experience as he was the Leader of the previous Seanad during which legislation was introduced two or three weeks before the end of each sitting.  That is how the legislative process worked in the past and I do not foresee it operating any differently between now and Christmas.  The joint legislative committee, which meets each Thursday morning, is trying to address and streamline the process.  I hope to have the definitive list for Senators this day two weeks.  I have a fair idea of the legislation but I do not want to commit myself.  However, if Senators have a particular interest in any legislation, I will let them know the position.</P>
    <P>As the presidential election will be held next week, there will be no sittings.  We will sit again the following Wednesday and Thursday.  Senator Ryan called for a debate on taxis.  The Local Government Bill will be brought before the House in a couple of weeks and that may be an opportune time to discuss this matter.  However, if the Senator does not consider it to be such, we will address the matter in another way.  Senators Gallagher, Quill and Ryan were disappointed with the outcome of the DPP's findings.  I have no objection to the Minister for Justice coming to the House to discuss the matter but since he was recently bereaved, I will discuss it with him next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Norris, Lanigan and Walsh raised a number of points on foreign affairs.  I will allow a debate on that subject as soon as the Minister is available.  We are in an extremely difficult situation but I will ask the Minister to make himself available at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan called for a debate on the urban renewal scheme with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  Such a debate is timely as the urban renewal scheme ends on 31 July next year.  This is an opportune time to let the Minister know the success it has been in most of our towns and larger cities.  The scheme has changed the landscape and created employment.  It was a positive idea and I would be delighted to ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss the scheme.  The reorganisation of local authorities is a priority of this Seanad. We all represent local authority members and should give this matter priority.  With the permission of the House, I will make a lot of time available at the earliest opportunity to have full <Col N="390" /> discussion on this topic which is near and dear to our hearts.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd asked about the free fuel scheme.  He is fortunate that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is a constituency colleague in County Louth and I am sure he will take those matters into consideration when I bring them to his attention.  I will communicate with the Senator directly.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey asked about matters pertaining to Ballina and future factories there.  I will contact the office of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment this evening and communicate with the Senator before the close of business to inform him on this serious subject.  I sympathise with the Senator in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes asked for a debate on agriculture. I hope to have such a debate early in the next session.  If possible I will make time available this session but, if not, I will have it at the earliest opportunity in the next session.  As agriculture is one of our most important industries it should be debated at least once a year in this House and as long as I am Leader I will facilitate Members in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach referred to the number and urgency of matters raised on the Order of Business each Wednesday; I hope Senators will bear his comments in mind.  From time to time Ministers are kept waiting outside the Chamber. However, if I give them a specific time to be here they will not have to wait between half an hour and three quarters of an hour while we are deliberating the Order of Business.  I will try to accommodate them on Wednesdays and Thursdays and I hope to have agreement among our leaders on this favourable arrangement of our business.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 is consequential on amendment No. 1 and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;civilian navigational purpose&rsquo; means the purpose of providing maritime navigational assistance to civilian vessels and aircraft exercising the freedom of the high seas or the right of innocent passage on or over the territorial seas of the State:</P>
      <P>Provided that a system provided or operated for such a purpose shall not be deemed not to be a radio navigation system within the meaning of this Act by reason only of the fact that it may assist also the navigation of military vessels or aircraft, if the system or any part of it was not designed, constructed, adapted or operated solely or principally with a view to providing such assistance to military vessels or aircraft (other than the military vessels and aircraft of the State);&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister is present to discuss this legislation.  It is appropriate before discussing the amendment to put on record that the explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:</P>
      <P>The need to introduce this Bill arose out of a Supreme Court judgment of 18th July, 1996 which upheld a High Court decision of 4th October, 1995 to the effect that the Commissioners' powers under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 could not be interpreted to include the provision of radio-based aids to marine navigation which were unknown at the time of enactment.  The purpose of the Bill is to empower the Commissioners to continue to provide such modern technological aids in the interests of maritime safety and to make further provision in relation to the functions of the Commissioners.  The Bill gives retrospective effect to these powers, where appropriate.</P>
      <P>Many of the sections deal with such retrospective effect being given to the powers of the commissioners. We propose in this amendment to insert a new definition of civilian navigational purpose which:</P>
      <P>.. means the purpose of providing maritime navigational assistance to civilian vessels and aircraft exercising the freedom of the high seas or the right of innocent passage on or over the territorial seas of the State:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided that a system provided or operated for such a purpose shall not be deemed not to be a radio navigation system within the meaning <Col N="393" /> of this Act by reason only of the fact that it may assist also the navigation of military vessels or aircraft, if the system or any part of it was not designed, constructed, adapted or operated solely or principally with a view to providing such assistance to military vessels or aircraft (other than the military vessels and aircraft of the State);&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a relevant addition to the Bill.  The Fianna Fáil party in both the Dáil and the Seanad vehemently expressed concern at the possibility of this Bill providing for the joining of NATO or a military alliance.  It is our intention that this amendment would encapsulate how the Bill should work, that it only be used for civilian purposes. There may be occasions when a military ship or aircraft might request the use of the navigation aids referred to in the Bill and there is nothing wrong with that.  However, without this amendment we would be concerned that this Bill could be used in a military situation to allow decisions to be taken by the commissioners without reference to the Dáil.  There could also be reference to the financial aspects.  This is purely for civilian navigational purposes.  This amendment will strengthen the Bill and ensure that no loopholes exist which have to be dealt with at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this amendment.  Many of our amendments are intended to legally clarify that Ireland is non-aligned militarily.  Occasionally we co-operate in international military operations, particularly peacekeeping under the auspices of the UN.  However, the Dáil must consent to such operations because we are non-aligned and the Government cannot enter any arrangement with a foreign military power without the approval of the Dáil.  This amendment will ensure that the necessary powers which the commissioners are being given are not used in an unauthorised manner, such as providing facilities to foreign military powers without the expressed will of the people as expressed through the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that Senators have concerns about the interpretation which may be put on these definitions.  They are concerned that the navigation systems would be used solely for civilian purposes.  I wish to distinguish between the provision and use of radio navigation systems for civilian and military purposes.  These systems are used by both Irish and foreign military vessels and aircraft during search and rescue operations. There is ongoing co-operation between Ireland and the UK in air and sea rescue missions.  When the need arises, UK military vessels and aircraft carry out vital, lifesaving operations in our jurisdiction; we do likewise in the British jurisdiction. The records of the Irish Marine Emergency Service show that UK military vessels and aircraft assisted in our rescue operations on five occasions so far this year; UK assistance was provided in <Col N="394" /> 22 operations in 1996.  United Kingdom military assets have been called upon to provide valuable assistance to our search and rescue authorities on no fewer than 159 occasions since the beginning of 1990.  These figures clearly show the scale and importance of full co-operation from non-civilian, foreign services in protecting the safety of life at sea.</P>
      <P>Less than two years ago there was a tragic fishing accident off Howth in which an RAF helicopter with night flying capabilities provided valuable assistance.  That accident gave rise to a review of Irish helicopter capabilities on the east coast and my Department is currently evaluating tenders for a new medium lift helicopter to provide significantly important coverage in the Irish sea.  I envisage that this facility will be in place by the beginning of July 1998.  It will be a particularly important development in the Irish Sea where we co-operate on an ongoing basis with the UK authorities in rescue operations.</P>
      <P>The 1979 Search and Rescue Convention, to which Ireland is a party, imposes an international obligation on all state parties to co-operate with search and rescue operations undertaken by neighbouring states.  This convention stipulates that signatories to it shall enact legislation which will facilitate such co-operation to the greatest possible extent.  To insert the type of provisions under discussion here in our national law would run contrary to this international principle. Search and rescue knows no political, geographical, civilian or military boundaries.  The provision of navigation systems which are required to assist search and rescue operations should not, therefore, have boundaries imposed on them.  No legal provisions should be put in place which could in any way, or at any time, hinder any type of vessel or aircraft from providing the greatest possible assistance when called upon.</P>
      <P>The proposed inclusion of a definition concerning civilian navigation purpose arises from the proposed amendment to the definition of radio navigation system which would mean that such a system could only be provided for a civilian, instead of any, navigational purpose.  I would point out that the current definition of a radio navigation system seeks to capture the reality of what such a system is and does not differentiate between its potential use by civilians or otherwise. It is obvious that any radio navigation system can be used by anybody who wishes to do so regardless of for whom, or the purpose for which, the system is provided.  I should also point out that while the definition of radio navigation system takes account of the fact that certain such systems can be used by aircraft, the commissioners' powers to provide radio navigation systems under sections 2 and 3 specifically relate to maritime navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to stress that the Commissioners of Irish Lights do not intend nor would they have any reason to provide a radio navigation system solely or principally for the purpose of assisting military vessels.  However, certain radio navigation systems, <Col N="395" /> like other forms of technology, were originally developed by the military and have since become important for civilian use.  I am thinking of the Loran C, the global positioning system known as GPS and the DECCA navigator system.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware from my Second Stage speech on the Bill that the commissioners have provided an enhanced form of GPS know as differential GPS or DGPS.  This system involves the provision of a more accurate GPS signal through the use of radio beacons from which differential corrections are transmitted.  The DGPS which the commissioners have provided is an encrypted service and they plan to provide an unencrypted system in conjunction with General Lighthouse Authorities in Britain which will be available free of charge for the benefit of seafarers.  The development of an unencrypted system is an important one.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised that DGPS is a very useful navigational system but it is dependent upon GPS which was designed, and is currently operated, by the US military.  This is a classic example of what is effectively a military system being adapted and provided for civilian use by the commissioners. If I or the House accepted these amendments it would effectively mean that the commissioners could not provide this important navigational tool.  Senators will be aware of the firm commitments I have given on Loran C. I will deal with this in more detail in the context of my amendments to section 3.  For the reasons outlined, I do not propose to accept the amendments to section 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the tone and tenor of amendments Nos. 1 and 3 that we are trying to establish the core of this Bill &mdash; what is the purpose of the Bill and for what use it will be put in future.  The Minister has given a very selective reply.  He specifically dealt with the sensitive and human area of search and rescue and the relationship with the UK.  It is well known that the UK and Ireland co-operate in a very significant way in the North Atlantic for the purposes of search and rescue.  Both parties are to be commended for the tremendous work they have done in saving human life over the years. However, it must be remembered that this is done with the assistance of the GPS and DECCA systems upon which this success is based.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of co-operation with other states, but he only made specific reference to the UK.  What are the Minister's views on the amendment on co-operation with the French naval authorities, the French military and the French submarines in the North Atlantic?  Does he envisage the Bill empowering the Commissioner for Irish Lights to provide navigational aid to these submarines, many of which are operated by nuclear power?  We are anxious to have an answer to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> The substance of the Bill is not clear.  A very short Bill could have dealt with the decision of the High Court.  However, a fairly substantial Bill has been put before us.  I commend the Senators who have tabled this amendment because it seeks to get behind the purpose of the Bill but responding in a selective manner the Minister has failed to address the substantial issue.  It is clear from what Senators Ryan and Gallagher have said that the amendment is not intended to interfere with search and rescue services or co-operation between the UK and Ireland in this area. They are referring specifically to military operations in the pursuance of a military objective rather than co-operation between the military and civilian authorities in the pursuance of humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address the broader issue inherent in this amendment.  I hope he will respond to the specific issue regarding other EU member states and in particular co-operation with the French Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's response.  Everything he referred to in relation to search and rescue and safety is contained in section 1 which provides for maritime navigation systems to or from civilian vessels.  As the Minister stated, there is a universal agreement that any vessel available, aircraft or ship, will come to the assistance of civilians and personnel in difficulty.</P>
      <P>The original legislation was deemed to be unconstitutional.  The existing legislation is completely out of date.  There will be occasions when a submarine or aircraft will require use of the available navigation systems.  There is nothing wrong with this.  However, most of us remember that, some years ago, the Dáil was recalled to approve the use of Shannon Airport by aircraft on a United Nations mission.  It was important that the Dáil dealt with this issue and our neutrality must be protected in the context of section 1 of this Bill.  We should not give the commissioners the power to decide to provide navigational aid to submarines or aircraft of foreign countries which may be on their way to attack another country.  I do not believe the commissioners would want this power and it is an issue of concern to us.  The amendment deals with this issue.  It also covers in a specific manner the concerns of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Loran C can be discussed later, but the Minister has not given a sufficient reason this amendment should not be incorporated in the Bill, which would be strengthened by it.  In view of our neutrality the people do not want our coasts, ports and navigation systems used for the wrong reason.  The Minister has not made a sufficiently strong case to convince us that we should withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How can this amendment be enforced?  We should not provide navigation systems specifically for naval purposes.  However, <Col N="397" /> this desire cannot be enforced as radio signals can be picked up by anybody.  There is no point saying the signal is encrypted or that a decoder is necessary.  All these codes can be broken and if a foreign vessel comes within range of a radio transmitting communication it will pick it up and take full advantage of it.  Even if the Minister agreed that this navigational system would not be used for military purposes, how could he or his Department enforce this?  It would be impossible.  It is like trying to exclude some people in Clare from listening to Clare local radio.  It is impossible because all they have to do is buy a small radio or transistor.  Will the proposers of the amendment explain how this could be enforced if their amendment was accepted?  I am not speaking about satellite navigation which can be encoded in a different way because the system has not yet been devised where a radio signal transmitted through air the air cannot be decoded.  Unless I am interpreting the Senators' reasoning in the wrong way, I cannot understand how such an amendment could be enforced.  It is like saying that the North Pole should be blocked out in order to devalue a compass. A compass will point to the North Pole and a radio system will pick up signals.  How can this amendment be enforced and the transmission of a signal prevented?  We should not provide assistance specifically to naval forces or anyone who would endanger our neutrality.  This amendment cannot be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the amendment is commendable in certain aspects, as someone who is technologically illiterate, I concur with Senator Tom Fitzgerald that it is not the Minister or the Government's intention that we promote or favour any navigational aid which deliberately colludes with military authorities in the waging of international warfare.  This appears to be one of the main concerns of the other side of the House. I share that concern and I am confident from what I have heard from the Minister and Senator Tom Fitzgerald that they do also.</P>
      <P>A fundamental shortcoming of this amendment &mdash; and I bow to technological expertise with respect and deference if I am wrong &mdash; is that while we can be empathetic towards the avoidance of deliberate participation or collusion in international warfare, there is no proposal incorporated in the amendment for a technological mechanism which meets all concerns.  Senator Ryan proposes that a clear distinction be drawn between civil and military use; how do we then achieve the navigational purpose proposed by this Bill?  Perhaps I missed that point and I would be delighted if Senator Ryan could enlighten me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other circumstances I would be supportive of the concerns articulated by Senator Ryan and others.  Senator Taylor-Quinn spoke about other international examples.  However, I was unable to identify an alternative which would meet all needs comprehensively &mdash; if there is one we <Col N="398" /> should hear about it, even if there are technological shortcomings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from the midlands, I defer to the expertise of Senator Fitzgerald in all maritime matters.  His attempt at a practical demonstration led me to wonder why, if there are all these radio and telecommunication signals, MMDS companies who provide multi-channel television in many parts of the country go to such lengths to encode their systems and charge people high fees for decoding equipment.  If these signals are free to everyone, why is there so much talk about television deflector systems?  The argument of the operators is that the systems are there and they are just passing them on.</P>
      <P>Technologically, an answer can be found to almost anything.  We are setting out a principle and the technological means can be found for it. The principle is that any powers conferred on the commissioners should be primarily for the purpose of assisting civilian navigation.  It is a clear principle to which Members on both sides subscribe. All of us have been on alternate sides of the House at the various stages of consideration of this Bill.  Our job is to set out a principle and it is then up to the technologists to apply the appropriate technology to enable that principle to be put into practice.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Senator Tom Fitzgerald and Senator Liam Fitzgerald, I thought &ldquo;Innocence, never hath I offended thee.&rdquo; We could award them senior positions in the diplomatic service &mdash; their skills are impressive.  I am impressed; they are men of such innocence that they do not see what Senators may be attempting in proposing this amendment.  This amendment specifically enables the provision of signals for the national military vessels and aircraft of our State but it excludes those from outside the State.  However that does not include the normal search and rescue service, which is not a military operation.</P>
      <P>The Minister also raised the 1969 Search and Rescue Convention which we signed.  Will he give us more detail on that and let us know what other legislation has been introduced to comply with that convention?  It seems extraordinary that it would take us 28 years to introduce legislation to comply with it.  Since this is a new factor introduced to the debate by the Minister he should elaborate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Senator's last point, that convention was signed in 1979.  Inserting the type of provisions under discussion into our national law would run contrary to this international principle. The amendment proposes a new definition for the operation of the Commissioners of Irish Lights which states that &ldquo;&lsquo;civilian navigational purpose&rsquo; means for the purpose of providing maritime navigational assistance to civilian vessels and aircraft&rdquo;.  That will be provided.  One cannot exclude the provision of humanitarian services <Col N="399" /> to others in search and rescue operations. This legislation cannot limit the Commissioners of Irish Lights in that way.</P>
      <P>The DGPS is designed, constructed and operated to assist the American naval and air forces in worldwide navigation, and we use it.  There is discussion of the greater commercialisation of this service, which I mentioned on Second Stage, and that may have a bearing on future developments. Its use by civilians is incidental, though very important.  We cannot exclude it because it was designed and operates for military purposes and was used exclusively for these purposes at some stages.</P>
      <P>I have no argument with this issue, though it is not relevant to the purpose of the amendments. The Bill was initiated by the Opposition when in Government, and it did not see these problems then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There was only one problem with which is the one we are dealing.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights are subject to the policy control and superintendence of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  Their operations and systems depend on funds made available by that Department and the Government, so there is no need for the concerns expressed about their operations.  However, it is necessary to ensure that we are involved wherever necessary in search and rescue operations, as we are on a regular basis with the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the issue of French vessels.  The same would apply in that case.  If a French vessel is in trouble, we will come to its aid just as it would come to our aid.  That happens with fishing vessels, as the Senator knows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and consequently being reluctant to speak on this matter.  We have heard of the brilliance of a lighthouse in the bog, which is what the Senator reminded me of.  However, he is obviously concerned by this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald deals with shipping on a regular basis, and he knows that the signals are transmitted through the air.  If you want to intercept them down, you can do so by getting a cheap <Col N="400" /> DGPS system.  Then one has all the signals one wants from a military system installed and operated for military purpose all over the world.  It is now being used commercially, and the Commissioners of Irish Lights are reinterpreting it back on our behalf.  An unencrypted system is to be made available soon, free of charge, for the benefit of all seafarers.  That is important because extra equipment will not have to be bought for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I understand that Senators want to ensure we do not get involved in wars or other military activities, but that is neither the intention nor the function of the Commissioners of Irish Lights. They have a long history of rescue, protection and providing navigational assistance around the coast.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Civil Loran C Agreement between different countries, which arises in connection with amendment No. 7, and I will deal with that when the amendment is discussed. Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 are well-intentioned, but they would create many difficulties if they were accepted, and I cannot accept them on those grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not made a convincing argument nor has he satisfactorily answered the questions raised.  Senator Gallagher rightly said that one can find a technological answer to any technological difficulty.  The Minister has not been convincing in suggesting otherwise, unless Senator Liam Fitzgerald has a wonderful fountain of knowledge from which we are yet to hear.</P>

I understand that when our seafarers travel around the world they avail of navigational aids which are quite similar to Loran C. We should bear that in mind before we espouse the principle that because there is a danger of military abuse of a system, we will deprive seafarers of its use if they get into difficulties.</P>
      <P>Our international colleagues would not look very kindly on us opting out of collective responsibility in this area.  The principle is commendable, but in practical terms, this matter presents a great technological challenge.</P>

      <P>That is a red herring.  The GPS system was designed to assist the US naval and air forces in worldwide navigation.  Are the Senators suggesting that the Commissioners of Irish Lights should do away with that system?  It is used now for commercial purposes and is being developed further.  Do Senators want me to insert a provision in the Bill that the GPS system should not be available for navigation generally because its main purpose is to assist the US military? Senators on both sides of the House know that well.  I am not prepared to do that so do not try to introduce any other red herrings.  I do not want to upset the present situation and I am sure the Senator does not either but he is suggesting that I have some ulterior motive.  I do not.  The Bill was debated previously as it was introduced by the previous Government.  The Attorney General and the tripartite Government of that time did not see any red herring in this Bill.  The Senator chose to raise it on this occasion.  It does not concern military operations; it concerns civil navigation.</P>

      <P>These amendments provide that the powers conferred on the commissioners to develop and operate radio and navigation systems shall not apply to the Loran C system until such date as the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources may appoint by order and subject to any conditions he may specify in the order. <Col N="403" /> The amendment also provides that such a draft ministerial order shall come before both Houses of the Oireachtas for debate and shall not be made unless it is approved by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to allow the Bill to be enacted as soon as possible thereby ensuring that the commissioners can legally operate and maintain their existing range of radio and navigation aids in the interests of maritime safety.</P>
      <P>It also allows time for the Loran C issue to be reviewed in the context of the consultative process which I propose to initiate.  It ensures that it is Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann which will ultimately decide on the future of the project.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 is restrictive and extends beyond the Loran C system.  It could have serious implications in that it would serve to prevent the Commissioners of Irish Lights from providing future radio navigation systems which could be universally accepted as being of benefit to mariners.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 relates to Loran C and runs contrary to my amendment which allows this issue to be dealt with in its entirety.  My amendment is more comprehensive than amendment No. 8, as it would mean that a Loran C system may not proceed, not merely at Loop Head but anywhere, without being brought back into both Houses of the Oireachtas for a full debate, in other words, the Loran C project will not proceed in any part of the country without the explicit approval of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>As I explained on Second Stage the Attorney General's Office has advised that to purport to exclude Loran C from the scope of the powers being conferred on the commissioners in relation to radio and navigation systems could be interpreted to be at variance with our obligations under the international agreement on Loran C which Ireland has signed.  The international law of treaties stipulates that every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.  The Oireachtas, by adopting in national law such a provision, could be seen to be acting contrary to the international agreement into which Ireland entered in good faith.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised that these proposed amendments could damage our international reputation.  I believe the amendments I have proposed in respect of Loran C allow this matter to be dealt with comprehensively and it meets the interest of all concerned to the greatest possible extent.  I do not, therefore, propose to accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>My amendment was discussed at considerable length on Second Stage.  It is included in amendment No. 7 and deals comprehensively in a fair and open way with the relevant issues.  I ask Senators to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is dismissing my amendments to section 3.  However, he proposes to push his amendment through this House.  I am disappointed he is adopting this attitude.  The general essence of this amendment was put before me some seven or eights months ago by the Minister's predecessor. I found it unacceptable at that time and proceeded to draft a number of amendments which were under consideration when there was the change of Government.  The Minister's amendment is a cop-out; it is not a straightforward and honest.  It does not dismiss the Loran C system.  I appreciate that due to international agreements the Minister must take this decision, but I have been long enough in both Houses to know how the system works and how orders work.  I am well aware there are three types of order: the order that the Minister may make within his Department; the order that is laid before each House of the Oireachtas, lodged in the Oireachtas Library for 21 days and if not opposed automatically becomes law and the order the Minister makes where a resolution is presented before both Houses of the Oireachtas and is subject to a debate.  We all know how these resolutions are debated in both Houses.  They appear on the Order Paper, they are proposed by the Government Whip and usually nodded through by agreement. Anything that may be perceived to be difficult, senstive or of political concern is often pushed through, usually in the days just before Christmas or when Members are off their guard. It must be said that Members of both Houses do not have the back-up staff, research facilities or support systems the Minister has within his Department.  An Opposition Deputy or spokesperson, or a Senator or Deputy belonging to the Minister's party, may be duped and this may reflect adversely on the particular Member.</P>
      <P>On those grounds I cannot accept the amendment. It is a smokescreen that will allow Loran C to be put aside and slipped through when the opportunity arises.  I see no need to table the amendment as I tabled a number of amendments to this section.  I propose that section 3(b) reads as follows:</P>
      <P>That the Commissioners shall have, and be deemed always to have had, in relation to maritime navigation, power to erect or place any radio navigation system of similar style and scale to those in current use.</P>
      <P>I specifically state &ldquo;of similar style and scale to those in current use&rdquo;.  In correspondence with the Minister's predecessor, I proposed a number of amendments on 13 February 1997.  One of the amendments I proposed reads:</P>
      <P>In page 4, section 3(1)(b), line 1, after the word &ldquo;system&rdquo; and before the word &ldquo;with&rdquo; to include &ldquo;of similar style, scale and capacity to those in current use&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced in the House this week, I redrafted the amendment to omit the <Col N="405" /> word &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; specifically for the reason stated by the Minister &mdash; so that it would not restrict CIL because of modern technological developments but in order that it would specifically prevent them from building a monstrosity such as proposed at Loop Head in the form of a 720 feet mast.  I took cognisance of that point and redrafted the amendment to accommodate the Minister's concerns and acknowledge the advances in technology while ensuring that anything built in the future is of a similar scale and style to what is currently erected.</P>
    <P>It is very disappointing that the Minister cannot accept my amendment.  I believe it to be balanced and fair in the circumstances, and I urge the Minister to take cognisance of what I have said about this section.  I also suggest that the section read &ldquo;with all requisite works, roads and appurtenances, save in the case or except in the case of the Loran C system&rdquo;.  I would be happy if the Minister would accept my first amendment to section 3(b).  I would be prepared to withdraw the latter amendment if the Minister would accept &ldquo;of similar style and scale to those in current use&rdquo; because of the concerns that exist in County Clare, particularly in the Loop Head and west Clare areas.</P>
    <P>I will find it very offensive if the Minister decides that the wishes of the local people are disregarded, if the efforts and the work they have done over a considerable time is ignored just because the Minister has the power to ride roughshod over them.  I expect more from the Minister and I hope he will reconsider his decision.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 reads:</P>
    <P>(3) The powers aforesaid in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply to the erection of a LORAN C system or mast on the Loop Head Peninsula.</P>
    <P>That is to be a new subsection to section 3.  All the powers invested under (a), (b) and (c) of section 3 shall not apply to the erection of a Loran C system or mast on the Loop Head Peninsula.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that his amendment was far more comprehensive because it was for the entire country, not just Loop Head.  I am aware of what he says but I specifically included Loop Head so that the difficulty that arises in relation to legislating for internationally signed treaties could be dealt with.  In that way the Bill would deal with only one specific area rather than being seen as an attempt to wipe out the system across the country.  That would save face for the Minister internationally while, at the same time, resolving the problem on the ground in a particular part of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept the reasoning behind the amendment and I hope he will find it in his heart to see the reason and sense behind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

      <P>It is very hard to listen to all that has been said today about the rights of the people of Clare being disregarded.  That is total <Col N="406" /> rubbish as the Senator knows.  A Bill identical to this was debated by the last Dáil earlier this year. Some of the Members who will vote for this amendment passed an identical Bill when they were Members of the Dáil.  For the information of the House, that Bill was guillotined in the Dáil. The then Rainbow Coalition Government pushed that Bill through the Dáil, despite the tabling of amendments by the then Opposition.  I cannot listen to the Minister being ridiculed for not acceding to these requests.  That Bill then came before the Seanad.  The then Minister, Deputy Barrett, whom I admire greatly, knew the Bill would not go through the Seanad in that form because the combined Opposition intended to vote it down on only one aspect &mdash; the Loran C mast in Clare.  The then Minister withdrew the Bill from the Seanad.</P>
      <P>A new Government then took over.  The present Minister is abiding by the wishes of the people in County Clare, as the Senator knows, by tabling an amendment which clearly states that the navigational aids, which were probably deemed to be illegal, have to be rectified by legislation in such a way that the Commissioners of Irish Lights can continue to provide a service. However, the amendment clearly states the Loran C system and mast cannot be erected in County Clare without first bringing legislation before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  What could be easier and simpler than agreeing with that?</P>
      <P>The people of County Clare have nothing to worry about.  The Minister explained it at length the last day.  Somebody said we might all have been asleep.  I never heard of any legislation being quietly slipped through this House&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Senator Tom Fitzgerald said, it is interesting to note that Senators opposite who voted to adopt this Bill when they were Members of the Dáil seem to be on the opposite side of the debate now that they are Members of this House.

      <P>The Minister is, in effect, saying that, after due consideration and deliberation, taking account of the concerns which were forcefully and robustly articulated during the passage of the Bill through the other House earlier this year, he has decided to table an amendment which will allow the legislation to go forward without the inclusion of that system at this time.  The amendment gives an unequivocal and unambiguous commitment that the system can only be put in place with the imprimatur of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear Senator Taylor-Quinn state that many issues of enormous import, environmentally and otherwise, have in the past slipped through the Houses unnoticed, without a vote, almost on the nod.  It is disappointing that she should contemplate that her constituency colleagues in this or the Lower House should permit such a serious matter to be slipped through on the nod.  I am sure she does not believe it.</P>
      <P>The Minister provides that the Dáil and the Seanad may take a decision by way of a vote at a later stage if and when this issue arises again.  He must do this against the background of meeting his international obligations.  This is a responsible and considered way to approach what is a matter of concern in terms of environmental impact. None of us like high rise masts.  They are ugly and environmentally intrusive, apart from other aspects such as emissions.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Senator to be fair in responding to what the Minster is attempting to do.  He has had to be sensitive, careful and understanding and must publicly acknowledge his international obligations.  I am sure the Senator will take due account of this when the debate on these amendments concludes.</P>

It was not acceptable to me then and the Minister's amendment is also unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I have been consistent on this matter.  By contrast, when Senator Liam Fitzgerald was a Member of the Dáil he voted against the Bill on 18 February 1997.  While I would not attribute political gymnastics to the Senator in the interest of protecting his Minister&mdash;</P>

It will not cause difficulties nationally or internationally.  The Bill will still provide all the powers needed by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to future consultation. This should have occurred before the Bill was reintroduced to the House.  The Minister's predecessor agreed to the establishment of a forum that would meet interested parties and provide for consultation on all aspects of the matter.  He also agreed that a new planning process would be initiated if Loran C were to proceed and that all other sites would be examined.  The Minister has made no such commitments.  He must address these matters.</P>
      <P>If this matter were not so serious it would not be under consideration since 1992.  Legislation has still not been passed by the Oireachtas.  The Minister has a responsibility here.  While I understand that he may have reservations about the other amendments under debate, he should accept amendment No. 5.

      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn considers that amendment No. 5 would be useful.  I have indicated why I am unable to support it.  The amendment states: &ldquo;&lsquo;of similar style and scale to those in current use&rsquo;&rdquo;.  Loran C is in current use.</P>

      <P>The amendment is broadly restrictive and extends beyond the Loran C system.  It could have serious implications in that it would serve to prevent the Commissioners of Irish Lights from providing future radio and navigation systems which could be universally acceptable as <Col N="410" /> being of benefit to mariners.  In addition, other acceptable systems could not be adopted.  There could be an additional complication because Loran C is in use elsewhere.  The Senator said it was not an honest amendment.  However, it is honest and straightforward.  As I said earlier, it is good and suitable.  It is not a smoke screen as the Senator suggested.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn also mentioned matters slipping through the other House but the amendment tabled by her could be adjusted to suit any other Bill at any time.  For example, if another Bill dealing with shipping was introduced, only a small amendment on Committee Stage would be required to remove that aspect from the legislation. However, the Government amendment ensures that no action can be taken unless it comes before both Houses of the Oireachtas for debate and acceptance and is included in legislation. There cannot be a tighter control.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn said everybody knows how the system works and the notion of decisions made behind closed doors worries people.  If that were the case, it would require the collaboration of all sides of the House.  The Senator said matters can be rushed through on certain occasions such as just before Christmas when everybody is out doing their shopping or Members are off&mdash;</P>

      <P>During my 21 years in the Lower House I have bought the occasional item at Christmas but I was always aware of what was before the House.  Senator Taylor-Quinn suggested the Government could slip Bills through on such occasions.  However, in the Fianna Fáil Party, and I presume in the Fine Gael Party, Members are notified at least a week before of the items that are due to be debated in the House. Fianna Fáil Ministers must appear before their parliamentary party and outline the legislation they intend to bring before the House.  A list is also produced; I can show the Senator the agenda from today's meeting if she wishes.  I am sure this also happens in the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party.  Deputies and Senators are told what items are due to be debated.</P>

      <P>The Minister or the spokesperson must outline what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whips meet and agree the schedule in advance.  A list is then circulated to all Deputies and Senators a week before items are due to be <Col N="411" /> discussed.  The document also states that Members must be present on certain days and cannot leave until various items are concluded.  I do not know how well other parties are organised but this is the type of information Fianna Fáil Members receive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way an item can slip through.  After Members receive notice of what is due to be discussed, the House also publishes a schedule of items to be taken each day.  The Order Papers are available to all Members and one would be very negligent if one did not know that an issue was due to be taken.  In addition, people hear about certain matters and raise them with Members.  Senator Taylor-Quinn's point is unrealistic and a misrepresentation of the work done by the Members of both Houses.  They are more vigilant and diligent about their work than the Senator's point suggests.  I do not accept that problem exists.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment meets the needs of the people of County Clare and others who are concerned about what may happen if the mast is not located at Loop Head in County Clare.  It is a fair way to approach the problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned the division on the Bill in the other House.  I do not know where I was when that took place but I am present in the House 99 per cent of the time.  It is extraordinary that I was not present.</P>

      <P>However, the amendment had not been tabled at that time.  It arose from subsequent discussions.</P>
      <P>I did not wish to labour the point but Senator Tom Fitzgerald asked me to elaborate on my comments on Second Stage about the consultative process I intend to enter.  I said I planned to table this amendment, expressly excluding the Loran C from the power of the commissioners. The amendment will ensure that the Loran C project will not proceed unless a new order is made by the Minister.  It must be approved and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it can come into effect.  I said I would ensure that the Loran C project will not proceed unless new legislation is adopted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I also pointed out that I proposed to initiate a comprehensive process of consultation on the project and that I intended to carry out a fundamental review of all aspects of the Loran C issue.  I will do this in conjunction with the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  This will allow me to hear at first hand the views of all interested parties, particularly those living in the Loop Head area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> Amendment No. 7 would ensure that interested parties can contribute to the wide ranging consultation process which I envisage in the secure knowledge that no action whatsoever can be taken in the meantime to progress this project. I gave this undertaking on Second Stage and I reiterated it in a briefer form earlier.  As I pointed out, that there are difficulties with each of the three amendments and I cannot accept them. However, the Government amendment is a good one and will meet requirements.  I ask the House to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wrote to the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, on 13 February 1997 regarding the specifics of the Government amendment.  If the Minister examines the files in the Department he may get a copy of that letter in which I suggested a number of amendments. They included amendment No. 5 which is now before the House but it contained an additional word, &ldquo;capacity&rdquo;.  The Minister said this amendment would impede the use and installation of any future radio navigation systems which could be of benefit to mariners.  This is why I omitted the word &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; in the amendment which now states &ldquo;similar style and scale&rdquo;.  I recognise that advances occur in radio navigation and technological systems.  I altered the amendment to make it easier for the Minister to accept it because it will not impede or hinder the acceptance or use of radio navigation systems which could be of use to mariners in the future.  The Minister's argument on that point is redundant.</P>
      <P>The Minister said his amendment was fair and responded to the will and wishes of the people of Clare, but it does not.  He has not explained satisfactorily to the people of Clare the type of wonderful consultative process he will put in place.  Will it take the form of a forum or a tribunal? If the Minister and I have a chat in the corridor, that could be considered a consultative process.  We would like to know about the details, format and guidelines.  Who will be involved in the process and what will and will not be acceptable? Will all questions be answered to the satisfaction of the people of west Clare and Loop Head?</P>
      <P>Many questions which have been asked in various fora during the course of the debate have not been answered.  These are serious questions such as who is promoting the Loran C system, who wants it and why is it necessary.  Why did the Department of the Marine give the Commissioners of Irish Lights money to buy land to erect a Loran C mast when the commissioners knew they did not have the statutory power to purchase it?  The Department of the Marine gave the commissioners the money to purchase the land &mdash; they were acting <i>ultra vires,</i> yet they knowingly did so.  There is evidence in the Department to prove that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 a Commissioner of Irish Lights sent a document, through the chief executive who was still in that position in 1994, to the Department. <Col N="413" /> It was clearly stated in that memorandum that the commissioners did not have the power or legal capacity to do what they did.  It was also evident from that memorandum that they did not have the legal powers to build the Loran C mast but only beacons, lighthouses and other such objects, as stated in the 1894 Act.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say why the Department of the Marine and the Commissioners of Irish Lights proceeded in the knowledge that they did not have the statutory powers to purchase the land? Why did the Department provide money from the public purse to secure such a purchase?  Why did the Department fund the commissioners to fight a case in the High Court knowing that they did not have the required powers, as stated under the 1894 Act?  These are serious questions to which the people of west Clare have not secured answers in any fora.  Will the Minister answer these specific questions and let us know when the people of west Clare will have the opportunity to put their questions and get satisfactory answers? If the history of Loran C over the past six or seven years is anything to go by, we will face another sad debacle.</P>
    <P>We, the people of west Clare, will not accept this and as far as we are concerned, a Loran C mast will not be built on the Loop Head peninsula. The Minister may come into the House with his might and main and a massive majority and get this legislation through but a Loran C mast will not be built on Loop Head because the presence of the people in the area will ensure it does not happen.  The Minister should take this into account as he pushes through his amendment.  He will not accept the reasonable amendment I tabled, although he should do so.</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter for the people in the area and the Government is running roughshod over them.  It is unfortunate that the will and wishes of the people are not being considered. Many questions, which have not been answered during the debate that has taken place over the past four or five years, must be addressed.  From what has been said today, the indications are clear that nothing will change in the future.  When the legislation is passed everything will be hunkydory for the Department and the Commissioners of Irish Lights because they will have got the better of the people.  However, I ask the Minister to stand back from this because the Loran C mast will not be built on Loop Head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did what the previous Government did and came before the House without such an amendment, I would appreciate what the Senator said.  However, it does not make sense given the amendment before the House.  This amendment clearly states that there will be no progress with Loran C on Loop Head or elsewhere without bringing further legislation before the House.  That is excluded as far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was concerned when I heard the Senator say the commissioners did not have the powers <Col N="414" /> required and then speak about documents in my Department.  The question of documents in Departments is becoming extensive in that they appear to be coming from everywhere.  Perhaps the Senator should put all the documents she has on the table so we might discuss them openly rather than her mention one from time to time.</P>
    <P>It is possible that in 1985 somebody expressed a view that the 1894 Act could not be interpreted as including the Loran C system.  I took it that legal advice was taken on the matter and that, on balance, the commissioners had the authority, as most people would assume, because the Loran C system was operating around the country.  If we had kept to buoys and beacons and ignored the practices since 1894, we would still only have semaphore.  It would defeat reason to think in that way.  I assumed when I heard the Senator raise the point that such a decision had been taken.  My officials have taken note of it.  When an issue goes before the court, the matter is settled when an interpretation is given.  However, before one reaches that stage, people use logic and reason and defer to legal advice.  What happens in court may change everybody's view on a matter.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the question was raised as to whether the commissioners were empowered to construct and operate the Loran C station.  The answer to this important question hinged on the interpretation of the commissioners' powers under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, to provide buoys and beacons whose definition includes all other marks and signs of the sea.  Both the Department of the Marine and the Commissioners of Irish Lights had historic legal advice to the effect that radio stations for the DECCA navigator system came within the commissioners' power to provide beacons although such radio systems were not contemplated in 1894.  On the basis of this broad legal interpretation it was considered that Loran C, which is a similar radio system to DECCA, was within the remit of the commissioners' existing powers.  However, as we are aware, the court has since adopted a narrower view of their powers. There was no case of something being hidden in the Department or by the commissioners or information being suppressed and kept from the public view in the Department.  There was a difference of opinion.  The logical, reasonable opinion of any mariner or person dealing with the sea was that DECCA was operating quite successfully for a long time.  There were different kinds of beacons and it seemed reasonable such a system was within the terms but the court subsequently decided it was not.  That is history.  Legal people have different views.  They can earn money arguing about cases but Departmental officials have a job to do and are practical people.</P>
    <P>We spoke about rescue at sea and so on.  When someone from the Commissioners of Irish Lights is out at sea there is no legal interpretation of where he stands.  Such matters are thought about on dry land at a later stage.  People assumed this <Col N="415" /> was a reasonable interpretation, which I do too. However, the courts have taken a narrower interpretation. As I understand it a slightly different interpretation was taken in some of the planning issues but that is up to the courts.  I do not think anybody was up to something, acting surreptitiously or trying to hide something.  The job was being done in a normal, practical way amid a minefield of legalities.  We are now ensuring that issue is covered and are giving the commissioners the necessary powers.  It is a very serious issue to which we must give a great deal of time and consideration and one which must be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Senators asked about the consultative process. The only one I know of is to talk to the people concerned and listen to their views.  That is what I will do.  There is no great rush as we are making a provision which renders the matter less urgent. I fail to understand why the Senator cannot support my amendment the effect of which is to continue the powers needed by the commissioners. The other issue can be discussed at any length in whatever forum we wish.</P>
    <P>As it is an important issue, I am prepared to enter into detailed and extensive discussions which will involve examining the developments and changes taking place and also examining issues in a current and future context.  It will be more wide ranging than just having local discussions, which are also very important.  We are making a provision which allows for wide ranging and detailed consideration of the developments taking place internationally and how these relate to the problems in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister said, the consultative process will be a <i>laissez faire</i> informal operation in that no forum or tribunal will be formally established.  Therefore, there will be nothing official about this process.  That is not satisfactory and the process will lack teeth.  The Minister said he will consult the people concerned and then introduce an order to the House, end of story.  Unfortunately, that is the way I see it.  He said he does not understand why I cannot accept his amendment, which is very clearly to keep Loran C centre stage.  Amendment No. 5 is very simple and manages to save face for the Minister on an international level as it only refers to what is in current use in similar style and scale but does not refer to capability or capacity.  It takes Loran C off centre stage and that is not what the Minister wants.  That is why the Minister is not prepared to accept my very reasonable and balanced amendment.  He said earlier that the amendment could be interpreted as meaning the Loran C system which is currently in place.  I am amazed the Minister is not aware of the constitutional role of the Oireachtas as far as the Twenty-Six counties of Ireland are concerned.  I am amazed he does not realise legislation which passes through this and the Lower House refers only to what is within this jurisdiction, the Twenty-Six county Republic, and makes such a <Col N="416" /> weak and naive argument to say this amendment is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister's case is unsatisfactory.  He has not referred to &mdash; indeed he has astutely avoided &mdash; the issue of the planning permission.  He has not stated that an entire new planning process will take place if and when it is decided to proceed with a Loran C system.  The consultative process seems as if it will be like a good chat between the local people and himself, the issue of planning permission has been astutely avoided and overall the situation is unsatisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the need for a formal tribunal at this stage.  The Senator spoke about the constitutional role of the Oireachtas but what about the constitutional role of the Minister?  I am the Minister, I have high regard for the office of Minister, and I will conduct my office to the highest level.  I have never been dishonest with anybody.  I am a Deputy almost 21 years and have been in several ministries.  The Oireachtas and the Constitution give me that responsibility.</P>
      <P>If people wish to have a tribunal let them come forward and say so but I do not see a need for it. I said I will talk to the people concerned and that is the first thing I will do.  I am a new Minister in a new Government.  I am not concerned with what happened previously; it is my problem with which I am dealing now in a forthright and straightforward way, using the mechanisms of the House which meet comprehensively the circumstances at present.  The Senator wants me to involve my staff or other officials in a tribunal or forum.  I would rather meet those concerned about the issue, listen to their views and address them.  I would also have discussions with my officials, other officials involved and the commissioners, who are in touch with international developments, to reassess the global position.  Times are changing as are technologies.  I will examine all the concerns raised.  If after that someone wants a tribunal, that request can be assessed. Nonetheless, I see what I have said as being part of my responsibility and function and I will carry it out.</P>
      <P>The Senator said I wanted to keep the issue of Loran C centre stage.  I do not wish to comment further as I have said what I will do.  At this stage, I am putting it centre stage that the commissioners have the powers they need.  We are leaving the other issue aside to be discussed at length.</P>
      <P>The Senator spoke of the constitutional role of the Oireachtas and how legislation is restricted to the Republic.  Amendment No. 5 gives a definition &ldquo;of similar style and scale to those in current use&rdquo; but that does not state where they are in current use.</P>

If there are problems or issues in future, they can be referred to the Minister or the House.  We are concerned now with one problem and we are addressing it in amendment No. 7.  I cannot add much more as I have explained the matter as well as I can.  What we are doing is sufficient to meet the circumstances.

      <P>On rereading the wording of the amendment, the Minister is not keeping the Loran C issue centre stage.  He is requesting that it be left aside while all other aspects of the Bill are proceeded with.  I do not know how that can be reconciled with Senator Taylor-Quinn's assertion that the Minister is deliberately keeping the issue centre stage.  I am baffled by the difference between her assertion and my interpretation of the wording of the amendment.  If it had been the Minister's intention to keep the issue centre stage, why did he bother including the amendment? Why did he not simply include the system in the Bill to be voted on by the House?  The Senator spoke of the constitutional role of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister knows well it is the constitutional right of this House to decide to include or exclude the Loran C project.</P>
      <P>The Minister, by way of his amendment, has shown he is prepared to go through the consultative process again, not just to return to the Dáil but to the process Senator Taylor-Quinn dismissed as trivial, evasive and not consultative.  The Minister gave a commitment, in response to my colleague, the Government Whip, to consult again with those concerned about this project. Who else would he talk to but to those with whom the Senator has obviously been talking and whose concerns she so ably and effectively articulates today?  The Minister has given an unequivocal and unambiguous commitment on the record that this is what he is prepared to do.  He is prepared to turn back the clock and carry out this democratic process from the beginning.  He is prepared to consult the people concerned, listen carefully to them, deliberate on what they say and only then start the legislative process in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am sure the Senator did not intend to use the word &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo;&mdash;</P>

He will return to the people concerned, those who articulated environmental concerns, listen to them and debate and discuss the issues with them. Having done that, he will proceed with the legislative process.</P>

He is leaving it aside and allowing all other necessary and essential aspects of the Bill to proceed.  If they were not necessary, the previous Government, of which the Senator's party formed a part, would not have introduced the legislation so quickly to begin with.

      <P>As regards what the Minister said about amendment No. 5, it is clear that the wording &ldquo;of similar style and scale to those in current use&rdquo; means in the Republic.  It would be ridiculous to suggest otherwise.  If the Minister has a difficulty with that, perhaps he might accept my amendment No. 8 which states:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The powers aforesaid in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply to the erection of a LORAN C system or mast on the Loop Head Peninsula.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That deals specifically with the problem which arises, leaves the Minister with a good international reputation and does not exclude him from the international agreement as signed.  He can accept either amendment or both.  They are more reasonable than what he suggests.</P>
      <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald stated the Minister is moving the issue from centre stage.  This Bill empowers the Minister, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Commissioners of Irish Lights to proceed with Loran C. The Minister may be subjecting the issue to further discussion, but it does not move it from centre stage.  Loran C is the focus of the fine detail of this Bill.  This is a Bill of empowerment. It allows the Minister and the Department to empower the CIL to proceed with another caper, consultation or stunt, and we are back to the fundamental issue &mdash; Loran C. That is the bottom line.  If the Minister has difficulty with amendment No. 5 he has his answer in amendment No. 8.  That amendment states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The powers aforesaid in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall not apply to <Col N="419" /> the erection of a LORAN C system or mast on the Loop Head Peninsula.&rdquo;.</P>

Those circumstances apply uniquely to section 3 and do not arise in the other provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the point raised by Senator Ryan but I am advised by the Attorney General that it is not appropriate to apply subsection (3) to the <Col N="423" /> Bill as a whole.  For this reason, the amendments are not necessary.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as conferring on the Commissioners power to provide or operate any navigation system which has as its sole or principal purpose the provision of maritime navigational assistance to military vessels or aircraft (other than military vessels or aircraft of the State).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was discussed earlier and the Minister was not in a position to agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Ryan said, this amendment was discussed at some length earlier.  I assure the Senator that the Commissioners of Irish Lights have no function or interest in providing any navigation system which has as its sole or principle purpose the provision of navigational assistance to military vessels or aircraft.</P>
      <P>The powers in relation to radio and navigation systems conferred on the commissioners in this Bill relate to maritime navigation only.  There are occasions when military vessels, using the commissioners' navigational facilities, engage in activities other than of a specifically military nature. It is not unusual for military vessels to be involved in rescue in humanitarian or Red Cross operations.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was ratified by Ireland on 21 June, 1996, provides for the right of innocent passage.  This right applies to all ships, including military vessels.  Such vessels are also entitled to use navigational systems to aid their safe passage. The provision of maritime navigational assistance should primarily have regard to humanitarian assistance, which should be capable of being given and received by all.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has further advised that for Ireland to adopt a distinction on the basis of a navigation system being of a military nature would potentially violate the international law of the sea.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Planning permission has not been referred to by the Minister despite my seeking his opinion on it.  He has not said if he will agree to the commitment of the previous Minister, Deputy Seán Barrett, on planning permission.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to implement all outstanding sections of the Refugee Bill and initiate a public debate on the question of refugees, immigrants and asylum policy in Ireland, so that by placing clear and non-sensational information before the public the spread of the scourge of racism here may be halted.</P>
      <P>I apologise for the incorrect order of speakers, which was our fault and not intended to mislead you, a Chathaoirligh.  There is also a technical error in the motion: we have a Refugee Act, not a Refugee Bill.  I apologise again as it is not my usual standard to miss something like that.  I also sympathise with the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on his bereavement.</P>
      <P>I have had a problem with the Department of Justice, immigration and visas for many years.  I have collided with them about what could be called ludicrous situations if human beings were not involved.  There is a college outside Bradford in Britain where many Asians attend.  The college tried to bring 15-year old students on an educational trip to Dublin two years in a row during the late 1980s and early 1990s.  The first year they tried to come here, two students with legal status in Britain were refused visas to enter Ireland by the Department of Justice.  The Department apparently suspected the 15 year olds would abandon family, friends and education to stay in Ireland if they were admitted.  After some fuss with the then Minister for Justice, visas were issued.  The following year, the college returned and I am sure it was coincidental that two members of the party were again refused visas by the Department of Justice.  At that stage things became even more ludicrous because, by the time we got the Minister to intervene to change the decision, the rest of the party were on their way to Dublin.  The two &ldquo;offending&rdquo; young people were put on a plane to Dublin, they arrived without visas or passports and they were admitted to the country without any papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also run into this problem in a professional context.  Delegates to the International Association of Social Workers were refused visas to enter Ireland this year.  In 1992 an eminent Peruvian <Col N="426" /> development economist was held in Dublin Airport for two hours by immigration officials. There is a problem and we do not know what the Department of Justice is doing.</P>
    <P>To add to the confusion, we now have an increased number of immigrants and people seeking refugee status in the State.  The creaking State administration system is behind the problem. Whenever there is a problem, a variety of simple solutions are provided, and these are always wrong.  After 150 years, Ireland has had its first wave of immigration.  We are not in a position to strike poses about immigrants.  If it were not for other countries' generosity on immigration, Ireland would have collapsed in a mess ten years ago, not to mention 150 years ago.</P>
    <P>However, we have struck poses.  There have been disgraceful media and political responses. We are not in a position to strike poses but we have done so.  We have had media and political responses which can only be described as disgraceful. One headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7 June reads: &ldquo;Crackdown on 2,000 &lsquo;sponging&rsquo; refugees&rdquo;, and in <i>The Examiner</i> 3 October, it states: &ldquo;More free rides on the tiger's back&rdquo;. What can be said about that apart from the fact that applicants for refugee status are not allowed to work and, therefore, must rely on welfare because it was decided there would be even more public hostility if they were allowed to work?  In a country that has increasing shortages in the unskilled labour area it seems daft to impose such a condition on people and then to join a bandwagon when they are accused of sponging off the welfare system.  That was the media response: the usual, unfortunately predictable, headlines and fomenting of prejudice almost reminiscent of Enoch Powell's rivers of blood.</P>
    <P>The political response has not been much better. We had the Refugee Act which was as much a consequence of the decision of the courts to bring to an end the outrageous act of locking up applicants for refugee status in prison and keeping them there until we got round to doing something about it.  How anybody was surprised the courts ruled against this practice is beyond me.</P>
    <P>Our political response is to introduce the strictest border controls on immigration within the European Union.  Does it dawn on the party opposite, who have a particular commitment to Irish unity, that there is a certain irony in having the strictest controls on cross Border movement between this State and Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>The aliens order, which fortunately expired at the end of August, was a particularly nasty piece of work which did no credit to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or those who enforced it and raised serious questions about whether there was a serious racist element in the understanding of how illegal immigrants are identified.</P>
    <P>The Dublin convention , one of the small number of sections of the Refugee Act which has been implemented, contains a procedure for repatriating asylum seekers if it is felt that they <Col N="427" /> have come from another EU country and should make their application there.  We have not yet been enlightened by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the procedures adopted, perhaps the mind reading skills of those who make the initial decisions at our borders, on our buses and trains and at various transit points to fathom the validity of a claim to refugee status of the misfortunates who are at the receiving end of this new Irish crackdown.  However, we know the powers are being used.  There are straws in the wind: employees of Irish Rail asking if there are any blacks aboard trains, Irish citizens who happen to have dark skin have run into problems. A black citizen of the United Kingdom, from Manchester, was sent back on the grounds he was an illegal immigrant.  In a peculiar convolution of this nonsense, a queue of people stand in the rain on the tarmac at Cork Airport because immigration procedures have slowed down so much. There is no space for the queue inside the airport building.  If you arrive at the airport and immigration control is in its macho phase you queue in the rain, Irish or not.  It is time we asked what precisely is happening.</P>
    <P>What happens when an individual is suspected of being an illegal immigrant?  We do not know as no one will tell us.  What happens to suspected illegal immigrants who cannot speak English?  We do not know.  Have the 40 gardaí who have been deployed in this area done a crash course in seven or eight languages?  If someone cannot speak English, are they a suspect?  How are they admitted? We do not know how many people have been turned away since this new procedure was introduced.</P>
    <P>Under the previous procedure people were sent back immediately.  Now it is incorrect to turn away anybody seeking refugee status.  We are to allow them in and allow a decision to be made against which they can appeal within.  Do we always do that or have we changed the guidelines so more people are sent back for other reasons? Is it convenient that some immigrants cannot understand English or people pretend not to understand their language?  What training has been given to the people responsible?  How do they decide if a Romanian is fleeing because he was a member of a trade union or because of his sexual orientation?  Is it a State secret?  Can we told?  I doubt it.  I suspect it is an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement based on the gut feelings of whatever garda happens to be on this rather unpleasant duty at the time.</P>
    <P>There is a straight forward remedy which is to implement the Refugee Act in full.  It is not perfect legislation.  It continues the ridiculous requirement that applicants for refugee status may not work which means they will be accused of sponging off the State and we will happily sit back and allow that to happen.  However, the Act would be a huge improvement on the present position.  Why is the rest of the Act not being implemented?  The Government amendment <Col N="428" /> states the Minister is effectively prevented by a court injunction from implementing the remaining provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Taken at face value you would imagine there was a huge civil liberties issue involved, or some profound constitutional case.  The reality is that a 66 year old man has taken exception to an age limit of 65 for the position of commissioner and this man has been granted an injunction.</P>

      <P>It was much more Joycean.  The truth is that if the Government wished to deal with this matter it could do so at any time.  It is a convenient excuse.  I am worried about suggestions that people will be detained while investigations are carried out under the Dublin convention. The Minister should confirm there are no proposals before the Government to detain people.</P>
      <P>How many people have been turned away since 1 September with no chance of appeal?  What criteria are used for suspects?  How are claims investigated or adjudicated under our generous definition of refugees given the lack of training?  How do they communicate with non English speakers? Does the Minister have proposals for a holding centre for applicants while they are investigated under the Dublin convention?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to second this motion which I had originally tabled.  When Senator Brendan Ryan asked if he could table it I was extremely pleased and I am impressed by the way he argued the case.  I welcome his return to this House to make precisely this kind of case.  I also compliment the previous Minister, Joan Burton.  She had a very difficult job introducing this Bill and was not thanked for it by the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this motion because I was increasingly concerned at what I heard in the streets, the shops, the gym I go to, where they are again calling people niggers.  They say people get free housing and social welfare.  I thought begrudgery was finished in this country.  It is in the sense we no longer appear to begrudge people who make immense wealth but we begrudge anybody getting a free ride on the Celtic tiger.  I deplore that mean attitude, particularly in light of our history. Recently at an event sponsored by the Irish Refugee Council, President Mary Robinson referred to a dinner in New York when a distinguished American historian drew attention to the fact that in the last century Irish refugees were targeted in exactly the same way.  They were seen as dirty, diseased and dishonest and among those who targeted them were a previous wave of Irish immigrants <Col N="429" /> who had made it good.  I would hate to think we would reflect this kind of attitude in this country.  We have absolutely no right to do so.  I am old enough to remember when it was a common sentence in the Dublin District Court to get six months imprisonment or go to England.  We were prepared to use the English social welfare system to cater for our criminal classes.  We spoke in this House about the plight of Irish refugees who are our illegals in New York, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia and we used every political muscle to legalise and sanction them retrospectively.</P>
    <P>I am also on the side of economic refugees.  By our alliance with economic blocs and forces, by signing various treaties, we, willy-nilly, as part of the EU, have joined in the exploitation of weaker countries throughout the globe.  So what if somebody from eastern Europe decides to come to this country?  It seems a perfectly rational family decision.  If one is living in a place that is polluted by nuclear and industrial waste, which is the reverse of democracy despite the changes, where there are no real wages even on the part of some State services, where the safety net that used be provided by socialism has been whipped away and there is very little by way of decent education for children, what responsible person would not want to get out of that system?</P>
    <P>I tabled the motion originally so that the Government would have the opportunity to put the facts on record.  I believe a comparatively small number of people seek to enter this country. I would like to know why this amendment was tabled because I do not think the motion is confrontational.  The original motion offered the Government the opportunity to place the facts on the record.  I am glad additional staff are being recruited.  I see from the amendment that we welcome the implementation by the Minister of the Refugee Act to the fullest degree possible.  I would like the application of the entire Act.  I call on the person involved in taking that injunction to withdraw it at once.  Does this question of principle he seems to be involved in, or his own self-interest, justify clogging the whole refugee operation?</P>
    <P>An appalling situation arose recently of trying to flush out the numbers of refugees in the country by making them apply for special cards.  They were subsequently kept waiting in the rain for four hours, and apparently 1,000 people are now missing.  The targeting of certain groups is unfortunate and regrettable.  During the last election there was a newspaper heading &ldquo;McGrath Demands Action on Illegal Immigrants&rdquo;.  There were further headlines, for example, &ldquo;Garda Purge on Bogus Refugees&rdquo;, &ldquo;Our Lunatic Asylum Policy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Eleven Asylum seekers Held by Gardaí in One Night&rdquo;.  They were lifted for theft, attacks and prostitution.  I live in the north inner city and I have never come across one of these crimes committed by an asylum seeker.  I have come across plenty of theft &mdash; in fact, last week I was a victim of it, and I know the person involved <Col N="430" /> was not an asylum seeker &mdash; attacks and prostitution. Other headlines included &ldquo;Bogus Refugees Face the Boot&rdquo;, &ldquo;Refugees Call Girl Market&rdquo;&mdash; they would have some stiff local opposition there &mdash;&ldquo;Slam the Door on the Scroungers&rdquo; and there was a wonderful cartoon by Martyn Turner.  It said, &ldquo;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled multi-millionaires with a few quid to invest in local businesses&rdquo;.  The contrast is plain for everyone to see.</P>
    <P>I have assisted a small number of people to get asylum in this country.  I am not ashamed of that and I wish it were more.  One was a woman from the Congo who witnessed her family being butchered. Another, which is currently in progress, is a Syrian who bucked the system, he is an extremely well qualified scientist but he is not allowed work in this country.  Another person who contacted me was a man from the Sudan whose uncle was a very prominent person in attempting to push people towards a progressive view in that country. He was waiting at least six months for a decision.  He is the clearest case of a refugee I have come across and, if he is sent back, God knows what will happen to him.</P>
    <P>We have a lot of information and we should have a more broad ranging debate in another forum because we can instance so many people who have been sent back under arrangements such as the Dublin Convention.  People were sent back to places such as Algeria, detained, put on television for a forced interview and then murdered in custody.  There are sanctions against airlines who carry refugees.  We have every right to be very concerned about this matter.  I am delighted Senator Ryan, in a characteristic act of humanity, chose this subject and I look forward to the Government detailing what it proposes doing in this area.  I ask that we get facts and figures because there are reports of 5,000 people getting off a boat at Arklow every week-end.  We know this is all rubbish, and it is the responsibility of the Minister to place the real numbers in the public forum and allay this hysteria.  The Minister must also give a timetable for the full implemention of legislation which we all welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the question of sexual orientation is included.  If one looks at countries like Iran, the attitude there is bloodcurdling.  I can assure Members one does not have to be gay to be butchered by these people.  All they need is the finger of suspicion; anybody can be found guilty just by accusation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) welcomes the measures taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform since taking up office to deal with the backing of asylum applications including:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; recruiting additional staff to process applications; <Col N="431" /></P>
    <P>&mdash; obtaining suitable office premises so that the State services to which asylumseekers are entitled can be provided under one roof; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; restarting the asylum appeals process;</P>
    <P>(b) acknowledges the continuing liaison between the Minister and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and notes the acceptance by UNHCR of the Minister's offer of funding for the placement of a member of UNHCR staff in Dublin for a year in order to assist his Department in dealing with the situation;</P>
    <P>(c) welcomes the implementation by the Minister in August, 1997 of the Refugee Act, 1996, to the fullest degree possible;</P>
    <P>(d) recognises that the Minister is effectively prevented by court injunction from implementing the remaining provisions of the Act at present;</P>
    <P>(e) recognises that the problem of illegal immigration into the State is growing, as evidenced by the detection of 1,339 persons seeking to enter the State illegally this year to date, compared with 452 for the same period last year;</P>
    <P>(f) looks forward to the outcome of the review of the entire situation regarding non-nationals generally being undertaken at present by the Minister;</P>
    <P>(g) notes that the Minister's Department, together with other Government Departments and non-governmental organisations, is involved in the committee which co-ordinates activities relating to European Year against racism 1997; and</P>
    <P>(h) agrees that comment on the issues of immigration (both legal and illegal), asylum and refugee matters needs to be balanced, accurate and responsible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is important to put this serious problem in perspective. In 1996 there were 425 reports of illegal immigrants or asylum seekers.  That figure has more than trebled this year so far.  If that trend continues, there will be over 4,000 applications in 1998, 12,000 applications in 1999 and 36,000 applications in 2000.</P>
    <P>We have provisions for genuine applications for refugee status.  Unfortunately, the Minister is somewhat curtailed in dealing with appeals in this area because of a High Court application which is still <i>sub judice.</i>  It is not for me to comment on the rights and wrongs of the application before the High Court.  However, until it is resolved the Minister's actions are curtailed.  It was pointed out that the cost to the State this year has been in the region of £40 million and it is estimated that the cost in a full year would be £100 million if the current trend continues.  On that basis, the <Col N="432" /> cost could run to hundreds of millions of pounds before the end of the century.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to say the Minister and the Government are not playing their part.  The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has indicated his concern in this area.  He has pointed out that the major concern of this Government and State is to stem the influx of illegal immigrants.  So far about 300 illegal immigrants have been detected, mainly by the close attention of the Garda using its new powers, and returned at their point of entry; most of them came from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>We must face up to the reality that this is a small nation of 3.5 million people.  We cannot do what the Americans, British and French are doing.  On the other hand, I accept that for generations our people emigrated, mainly to seek work, to Great Britain, America and Australia. We have a proud record abroad and were welcomed in many of those places.  However, the influx of 1,400 or 1,500 people to Ireland has social implications in that it puts pressure on our social welfare system, which is already under strain, and our housing lists.  For example, we were recently informed in west Cork that there are 800 applicants on the housing list.  If this trend were to continue it would place a severe burden on the health boards and housing lists and on social change.</P>
    <P>Any person seeking refugee status and asylum on genuine grounds recognised by the United Nations should get a fair hearing.  The Minister indicated that 70 extra staff and additional funding will be provided to ensure applications are quickly processed.  Previous speakers referred to the number of applicants who had to wait in the rain.  However, I read in newspaper reports that while 3,500 applications were received by the Department, when they were closely monitored it was found that only about 1,700 had been properly channelled.  There is evidence of some sort of social welfare fraud, which is quite unfair.</P>
    <P>Any person coming here through the proper channels should have their case heard.  However, we must quell the notion that Ireland is a great social welfare state, that we are a soft hearted nation and that we invite people from all around the world to come here.</P>

      <P>The motion suggests there is some discrimination on the part of the Irish Government and people, which I deny.  We will give any application a fair hearing, but it is unfair for us to be seen throughout Europe as a place where illegal immigrants can be accommodated liberally.  That would be totally unfair on our State and could not be accommodated by our system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>My party supports the motion. The refugee situation has almost got out of hand here.  The Government was warned about this. There were only 39 applications for refugee status in 1992; almost 2,000 people have applied for refugee status in 1997 alone.  Since 1992 the line on the graph has been steadily rising.  It was clear to anyone watching what was brewing for the decision makers.</P>
      <P>Prior to the passing of the Refugee Act we did not even have a legal framework to deal with the refugee problem.  The Refugee Bill had to be dragged out of the Government.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, introduced a Bill which had to be withdrawn.  It was then reintroduced by the previous Minister, Deputy Owen, and was eventually placed on the Statute Book.  That Act provides for the appointment of a refugee appeals commissioner.  I do not know whether that office was ever filled.  It also provided for a proper appeals system for refugees but, as far as I know, nothing was done about that.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has looked at this issue would say that the Department of Justice would need a permanent staff of between 100 and 150 people to deal with the matter.  Senator O'Donovan said the Minister has provided additional staff.  How many people has he appointed?  The previous Minister realised, as does the Department, that between 100 and 150 people are needed.</P>
      <P>The general view is that an appeals commissioner should have a workload of about 1,200 applications a year.  However, that figure has been already surpassed this year, and that trend will continue in the years ahead.  What provisions have been made for the appointment of a second commissioner?  The Bill only provides for the appointment of one commissioner.  I do not want the Minister of State to make banal statements which tell us nothing and to talk in a general way about what the Government is doing.  I want clear figures on what the Government is doing to tackle this problem.</P>
      <P>We have always had a xenophobic attitude. Somebody said that no other nation had to rely on the generosity of strangers more than we did. However, we never applied that attitude at home. Ten years ago, when I was last a Member of this House, we spent several hours discussing the problems of undocumented Irish people in the US.  I was part of a deputation that met congressional leaders on Capitol Hill.  They introduced legislation which was partial to Irish emigrants.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 50 million refugees in the world today, approximately 5 million of whom are in Europe.  Some ten to 12 million people receive direct assistance from the UNHCR in Africa.  At least another ten million receive such assistance in Asia.  There are also substantial figures for Latin America.  One out of every 255 people on the planet is a refugee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As probably the sixteenth or seventeenth wealthiest country in the world we must now play a greater part in solving this major international <Col N="434" /> problem.  We all inhabit this planet together.  We had to send millions of our children abroad since we achieved independence and we know that millions emigrated before then.  In the 1980s, hundreds of thousands left.  We did not care but hoped that the US, UK and other EU Governments would turn a blind eye to them.  We were lucky that most of those who left were well educated or trained. Ultimately, they represented a greater economic loss to us than a gain to the host country.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government addresses this issue.  The response to date is inadequate.  It must ensure that all provisions of the Refugee Act are in force, including the appeals commissioner and his staff and that legal advice and interpretative facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>According to a recent opinion poll in <i>The Sunday Independent,</i> 56 per cent of respondents said more stringent measures should be taken against illegal refugees and those seeking asylum.  A few months ago a guesthouse accommodating Romanian refugees was fire-bombed.  This is symptomatic of the prejudice that has been allowed to develop by our inaction.  When the public see the problem getting out of hand with a queue of several thousand people outside the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government and Department officials in chaos and panic, the reaction will be one of prejudice.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will present a clear outline of the Government's intentions.  We do not want banal statements, but an indication of the targets that have been set to address this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first occasion to address the House as Minister of State.  I am pleased to be back with old friends from my days in the Seanad.  I hope to deal with many issues relating to my Department in the House.  Unfortunately, the Minister is unable to be present because of a family bereavement.</P>
      <P>I am glad to contribute to this important debate.  I will deal first with the Refugee Act, 1996, and explain why, as set out in amendment No. 1, no further implementation of the Act is possible due to the present High Court injunction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the core of the Act is the existence of a Refugee Applications Commissioner.  The Act provides that the Minister cannot make a declaration that a person is a refugee under section 17 except on foot of an investigation and recommendation by the commissioner.  An application for asylum is expressed in the Act in terms of an &ldquo;application for a declaration&rdquo; under section 17, so a person cannot apply under the Act to be recognised as a refugee unless there is a commissioner in place.  It is clear, then, that for all of the Act to be commenced from a current date, without having a Refugee Applications Commissioner in place would effectively put on hold <Col N="435" /> all applications for asylum.  We would have a statutory procedure in place which would have the effect of preventing the processing of asylum applications.  Nobody wants that.  I am unable to go into the detail of the litigation in question because the mater is <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    <P>The Government has been in office for four months.  In the three months before it was appointed the number of new applicants for asylum had been averaging over 100 per week.  There were between 2,500 and 3,000 applications on hand.  Almost 2,000 of those had been made in the first half of 1997.  No interviews were being conducted and the handful of staff dedicated to processing asylum applications were stretched to the limit simply registering the personal details of the new applicants.  It was clear that there was a serious and growing problem.</P>
    <P>On his appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue commenced an immediate review of arrangements. Within a few weeks he was satisfied that resources, both in terms of staff numbers and basic facilities, were inadequate to deal with the situation.  He therefore sought and obtained Government approval for additional staff to be appointed to his Department and for new premises to be obtained.</P>
    <P>A dispute about payment of legal fees, which had prevented appeals against refusal of refugee status from being dealt with for almost three years, was resolved several days before the Government took office.  The Minister arranged for appeal hearings to recommence on 12 August. Resolution of this dispute means that it is now possible to bring to finality the processing of appeals against a finding that an individual has no entitlement to refugee status.</P>
    <P>The staff dealing with asylum work has more than doubled since the Minister took office and recruitment of additional staff is in hand.  They have started a targeted programme of interviewing asylum seekers designed to make the most effective use of the still limited resources. The process of recruiting a further 70 or so staff is under way.  As they are appointed, the new staff will be trained in asylum law and practice, interviewing techniques and other skills which are necessary to process the asylum claims.  UNHCR has undertaken to provide every assistance in this training programme.</P>
    <P>It was obvious to the Minister that we would have to provide badly needed additional space for the persons involved in processing asylum applications and better conditions for asylum seekers to present their cases.  Recent publicity has served to highlight that matter.  A visit to my Department on a daily basis will show the need to address this issue.</P>
    <P>The aim is also to provide space in the same building for community welfare officers from the Eastern Health Board who are involved in providing the support payments to which those who seek asylum are entitled, and for other State <Col N="436" /> agencies involved in providing services &mdash; a &ldquo;one-stop shop&rdquo; in effect.  In the past few days, the Office of Public Works has completed legal formalities for the acquisition of new accommodation. Work on fitting it out, estimated to cost £2.5 million, has commenced.  It should be ready for use in February.  The building will also accommodate the member of the staff of the UNHCR, posted to Dublin at the Minister's suggestion.  To explain this fully, it is best to put the role of the UNHCR in proper context.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is the custodian internationally of the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, known as the Geneva Convention, and its related Protocol.  The UNHCR's concerns with Ireland are looked after by a representative accredited to Ireland and the United Kingdom, who is based in London.</P>
    <P>Until recent times Ireland had a very small number of asylum seekers &mdash; running until the early 1990s to between 30 and 50 a year.  Arrangements for dealing with these cases were formalised with the UNHCR in 1985.  One element of those arrangements was that the UNHCR would give an assessment before the Minister made a decision in each case.  This arrangement worked satisfactorily until 1994 when the annual number of asylum applications rose for the first time above 100; there were 362 applications that year. The UNHCR did not have the staff available to fulfil its role under the 1985 arrangements.  Earlier this year, the UNHCR took on temporary staff, with the aid of a subvention from the State, to clear a block of cases which had been processed up to the assessment stage by the Department.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, to both the UNHCR and the Minister that this arrangement is no longer workable due to the huge increase in the number applying and that a new approach is necessary to deal with the backlog of approximately 3,500 applications that has built up over the last two years.  It was always the intention that the Refugee Act would replace the 1985 arrangements in any event; the Act would have relieved the UNHCR of its role.  The Department has been engaged in detailed discussions with the UNHCR representative since July with a view to arriving at a new set of administrative procedures better suited to the scale of the problems now facing Ireland in the asylum area.  The Minister wants to place on record his appreciation of the advice and assistance given by the UNHCR in this matter and, especially as part of that assistance, the acceptance by the UNHCR of his offer of funding for the placement of one if its staff in Dublin for the next 12 months or so to assist the Department in dealing with the situation.</P>
    <P>I will not pre-empt the outcome of those discussions which are ongoing; in fact, the most recent meeting took place on Monday.  However, it is safe to say two things in relation to whatever procedure emerges from these discussions.  One is that each case will generally be assessed by State employed staff &mdash; with the appropriate training <Col N="437" />&mdash; rather than by the UNHCR as at present.  This is a development that the Refugee Act envisages in any event and will bring Ireland into line with other countries' asylum processes.</P>
    <P>The other likely feature is that the UNHCR will have a continuing role, albeit more wide ranging and general than hitherto, in the Irish asylum process.  I cannot emphasise too strongly how important it is that Ireland's asylum procedures should continue to have the confidence of the UNHCR.  That confidence is the guarantee that those in need of protection, in fear of persecution in their own countries, need to assure themselves that their cases will get a fair hearing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR, as a worldwide organisation, brings an important dimension of understanding to bear on all aspects of the asylum process.  The most recent public statement was in Prague last week during a meeting of Ministers of 33 European countries and eight international organisations to discuss measures to prevent illegal immigration.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform also attended.  In his contribution, the UNHCR representative stressed his organisation's concern &ldquo;that the intentional misuse of asylum procedures be discouraged&rdquo;.  He said:</P>
    <P>Indeed, a number of migrants seeking employment, rather than protection from persecution and violence, circumvent legal immigration regulations and request asylum.  . . For many would-be immigrants, asylum procedures seem to offer a chance to secure admission which they would not otherwise have. Attempts by people with no valid claim to international protection take advantage of asylum procedures and create serious problems by clogging those procedures. Moreover, such claims have greatly contributed to the confusion between refugees and illegal migrants and, in turn, reflected negatively on the asylum institution and, hence, on bona fide refugees.</P>
    <P>The representative continued:</P>
    <P>Another concern for States and the UNHCR alike is the phenomenon of asylum seekers who leave countries in which they have found or could have found protection in order to seek asylum elsewhere.  Movements of this kind have a destabilising effect on international efforts aimed at finding durable solutions for refugees.</P>
    <P>He welcomed solutions like the Dublin Convention, which came into effect recently, for Ireland and other EU states as a means of discouraging irregular movements of people while at the same time ensuring that asylum claims will get a proper hearing.  He went on to deal with the ability of states to address the issue of the return of rejected asylum seekers to their countries of origin as a contribution to &ldquo;preserving the quality of asylum&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> The concluding recommendations of that conference have been placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members of both Houses.  It is clear from those recommendations, which were adopted unanimously, that the problem of illegal migration is widespread.  It is also clear that this country, which for a long time was largely free of this phenomenon because of its geography and economy, is now experiencing some of the pressures our partners in Europe have experienced for many years.  What has happened in Ireland is a manifestation of worldwide economic migration pressures which are fuelled and facilitated by an extensive network of shadowy figures who profit from the illusions of the less well off without regard for their well being, the health of the economies which they are leaving or the effect on the destination countries.</P>
    <P>As the amendment to the motion points out, the number detected trying to enter the State illegally this year so far is three times what it was for the same period last year.  Earlier this year it became apparent that a large number of persons not entitled to enter the State were in fact abusing our common travel area arrangements to enter illegally from the UK.  In order to deal with this growing and serious problem, the aliens orders were amended to enable immigration officers to carry out checks on arrivals from the UK.  The effect of the measure is to introduce into Irish law a requirement that non-EU nationals seeking to enter Ireland from Britain or Northern Ireland must meet the same entry requirements as non-EU nationals seeking to enter Ireland from any other part of the world.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the statutory provisions, an immigration officer may refuse leave to land to a non-national who, for example, is not in possession of a valid passport or some other document establishing his or her nationality or identity or who does not have a valid Irish visa where required.  I emphasise that the immigration officers are implementing the law and ensuring that those who come into Ireland do so lawfully. People are refused leave to land because they do not meet the requirements of our law.</P>
    <P>In the nature of such checks, people who are entitled to use the CTA arrangements, as well as those not entitled to use them, will on occasion be asked by immigration officers who are members of the Garda Síochána to offer evidence of identification in order to establish whether they are entitled to enter the country.  The Garda authorities have been asked to ensure that immigration officers exercising these powers do so in a discreet and courteous way and to ensure that those who are questioned and are entitled to enter the country are thanked for their co-operation. While recognising the difficulties involved for immigration officers in carrying out the important task of dealing with a serious problem of illegal immigration, the Minister is concerned generally to ensure that there should be no occasion where the controls would be exercised in <Col N="439" /> a discriminatory fashion or without an acceptable level of courtesy.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge with regret the existence of organised networks of traffickers in humans.  This traffic is estimated by the International Organisation for Migration to be worth about US$7 billion a year to the traffickers.  There are high skill levels available to those networks, covering all the areas necessary to maintain this trade.  They produce exceptionally high quality forged and falsified passports and other travel documents and show a high level of awareness of weak spots in immigration controls.  As the rest of Europe strengthens its immigration controls, the pressure has now come on Ireland.  We need now to look at our own laws in this area to establish what measures we need to have in place to combat this exploitative trade in humans and to ensure that immigration policy can be formulated and implemented in an orderly fashion.</P>
    <P>The Minister is conducting a thorough review of our situation, especially when compared to other European states.  The Government amendment to this motion refers to European Year Against Racism 1997 and asks the House to note that our Department, together with other Departments and NGOs, participate in the national co-ordinating committee for the European year.  This special Year Against Racism arose out of a resolution of the EU Council of Ministers.  Its purpose is to raise awareness of the threat of racism; provide a catalyst for change; promote partnership in the broader sense of the word; provide an opportunity for exchange of experience and good practice; support innovative initiatives in this area and give political encouragement to continue European Union action against racism.</P>
    <P>In designating 1997 as the Year Against Racism, the European Council recognised that racism is diametrically opposed to everything that Europe stands for in terms of democracy, tolerance and respect for human dignity and fundamental freedoms.  I should add that the Council resolution refers not only to racism but also to xenophobia, that is, hatred of foreigners, and anti-Semitism.</P>
    <P>The resolution called on member states to appoint a national co-ordinating committee to oversee activities for the year.  A representative of the NGO sector was appointed to chair Ireland's committee.  I welcome this approach and the fact that the committee is functioning as a partnership between Departments and NGOs. The profile of the Year Against Racism was further boosted in Ireland by the support of the former President Mary Robinson, who officiated at the opening ceremony.  An allocation of £100,000 was made available by our Department for the year and this is being used to support a variety of initiatives and activities.</P>
    <P>In trying to spread the anti-racism message, we must endeavour to develop in our young people particularly, as the citizens of the future, a respect <Col N="440" /> for the fundamental equality of all human beings. For this reason, I was very pleased to participate recently with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, in the launch of an education pack developed under the auspices of the national co-ordinating committee for use in schools and by youth leaders.  Tomorrow, 23 October, was designated as Schools Against Racism Day.  The education pack also outlines an awards scheme to recognise schools and clubs which participate in certain activities.  A copy of the pack has been sent to almost every primary and post primary school and youth centre in the State.</P>
    <P>Another worthwhile initiative developed by the national co-ordinating committee, which I launched in Galway last July, is the media awards. There will be five categories of award which will be presented to journalists and photo-journalists who have made a significant contribution during 1997 to highlighting racism, anti-racism measures and the promotion of cultural diversity in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Senators who tabled the motion are obviously concerned that there should be accurate reporting of issues relating to refugees, immigrants and asylum seekers so that racism and xenophobia are not encouraged.  As evidenced by the Government amendment, I share the concern that reporting of all of these issues should be balanced, accurate and responsible.  This, too, is the idea behind the media awards.  I am pleased to say the Minister recently approved a number of small grants totalling over £12,000 for small scale initiatives, often at a local level, linked to the aims of the Year Against Racism.  Again, that is a worthwhile move because this message needs to be articulated locally just as much as at national level.</P>
    <P>I also remind Senators of the Minister's intention to proceed with the redrafting of the Equal Status Bill which was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court earlier this year. This Bill will deal with discrimination on a number of grounds including race, colour, nationality and national or ethnic origin.  It has the potential to give considerable protection to persons who are the victims of racial discrimination and will also, I am confident, contribute to changing attitudes towards the various minorities in our society.  The Bill is also necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.</P>
    <P>Ireland has historically been a relatively homogeneous society.  That appears to be changing. With our economic success, more non-nationals, including EU citizens, will wish to live and work here.  Also, the eventual enlargement of the EU will add to diversity here in Ireland.  That is why I support measures to combat racism and xenophobia, including legislative measures.  I particularly welcome the new provision in the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6a, which gives the European Union competence for the first time to take action to combat discrimination on a number of <Col N="441" /> grounds including racial or ethnic origin.  The Community has up to now been hampered by its inability to legislate on this matter and has had to confine itself to measures such as resolutions and declarations which are not legally binding.  The power in Article 6a has the potential to bring about a common European regime against racial discrimination.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that the measures I have described, taken together, will bring about an improvement in the position regarding asylum in particular, not only in fairness to those who have applied for refugee status who are entitled to a speedy decision but also to the taxpayer who must support applicants and their families while a decision is pending.  The Minister's review of the situation regarding non-nationals will, I am sure, lead to a policy which can be implemented in a fair and transparent way.  I thank the Senators for raising these important issues and giving me the opportunity to bring them up to date on developments in this increasingly important area of Irish life.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister and am glad she is here this evening having served under her excellent chairmanship on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights. I hope she will take what I have to say to heart. I would like to highlight medical problems which concern women refugees.  Because of the turmoil in Africa, along with other western countries, we are receiving more and more refugees from there. Female genital mutilation is a common occurrence in some African countries and western nations need to address the fact that refugees may try to continue such practices and that women who have been mutilated need special care in pregnancy and childbirth particularly.</P>
      <P>Internationally, about two million girls are mutilated each year.  There is no need for me to give the Seanad the gruesome details but the mutilation varies from removal of the clitoris to removal of the labia majora and the suturing of both sides of the external genitalia together. These procedures done on girls from ages varying from the first week of life to 12 years old, all without anaesthetic and performed by unqualified operators in general, may lead to the death of the child through haemorrhage, infection or tetanus. The girl, of course, cannot consent to this appalling act because she is only a child.  She is held down and often six adults are required to hold her.  Terrible scarring develops and many gynaecological conditions and urinary tract infections will be her lot for the rest of her life with serious psychological conditions developing as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While practised in some Muslim countries, female genital mutilation is not a required part of the practice of any religion and the African Charter <Col N="442" /> on the Rights and Welfare of the Child stresses that while positive traditional values and cultures should be preserved and strengthened, it requests in Article 21 that &ldquo;appropriate measures be taken in order to eradicate traditional practices and customs which are prejudicial to the health of the child&rdquo;.  There could be no more gruesome traditional practice which damages the child than female genital mutilation.</P>
    <P>Why is this of importance to us?  There are two reasons.  First, we must ensure we explain to the daughters of those refugees who may adhere to these old practices that this mutilation is not acceptable here.  One little girl died in London a few years ago from haemorrhage and others, refugees from Mali, have died in France.  In the United Kingdom, the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act was enacted in 1985.  This makes it a criminal offence to carry out the mutilations I described or to aid and abet such acts.  We have no such legislation.  Some refugee families in the UK try to get around the legislation by sending their daughters back to aunts or grandmothers in Africa, The Yemen or elsewhere but teachers and social workers are always careful to counsel families that any such act done abroad may mean trouble for them.  Some families bring unqualified operators from abroad to Great Britain and, unfortunately, some doctors in Great Britain and the United States have become involved in this vile practice.  It would be possible for those disposed to have their children so mutilated to bring them here to avoid attracting the attention of social workers by the prolonged absence of their daughters from schools in Great Britain.  Legislation should be introduced to ban such practices here.  Perhaps it could be done under the Children Bill and a separate Bill may not be needed. It should be made clear to any refugees from counties where female genital mutilation is practised that it is totally unacceptable here.</P>
    <P>The second problem with this practice deals with adult women who come here and arrive in a hospital pregnant or, perhaps, with gynaecological problems.  Our doctors and midwives need to be taught how to recognise and help such women. The policy document on women's health issued by the Department of Health earlier this year has a section on women in developing countries but female genital mutilation, despite its importance, is not mentioned in it.  Interestingly, UNICEF, the World Health Organisation and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees mentioned it.  Almost 100 per cent of girls are &ldquo;cut&rdquo; in Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mali, Sudan and Sierra Leone and even in countries such as Kenya the rate is as high as 20 per cent.  Any doctor or nurse visiting these areas should have some training in the problems arising from this practice and as we send many doctors and nurses on development missions it is important this matter be addressed.  We must ensure, also, that when such cases arrive in our maternity hospitals those in charge of the woman's delivery will understand the obstetric problems she will encounter and be <Col N="443" /> able to deal with them.  Requests by the woman's husband or any other person that the woman should be re-infibulated must be refused.  The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has so recommended but sometimes those supervising the delivery do not recognise the cause of the scarring with which they are dealing and resuture the woman.</P>
    <P>These women have rights.  The fact that they may have no English is another difficulty.  The woman may not be able to communicate directly with her medical advisers nor they with her.  History taking with refugees is notoriously difficult. If the Department of Health cannot provide interpreters in all languages &mdash; even French or Italian would be useful as many of the refugees are well educated &mdash; they should provide at least a pictorial atlas on different medical situations such as is used in Nigeria where there is a multiplicity of languages.  The Medical Council has not issued guidelines for these situations and comment from that body would be helpful so that the medical profession is mindful of the ethical obligations to patients.</P>
    <P>Many African women have particular problems associated with pregnancy such as eclampsia and high blood pressure, the consequences of which, if untreated, can be fatal.  Depression is common and is not helped by the refugee status of the patient. Many have sexually transmitted diseases and some have sickle cell anaemia.  We have an obligation where we pride ourselves on our treatment of pregnant women and our excellent maternity mortality figures to treat these women who are in such a vulnerable position in the best way possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, the incidence of HIV infection is much higher in these women than in Irish women.  The recent improvements in the treatment of women with HIV infection in pregnancy has dropped the vertical transmission rate, that is the infection from the mother to the unborn baby, from 24 per cent to 8 per cent.  These are the published figures but it is felt that it is realistic to aspire to a 2 per cent transmission rate and perhaps eliminate the infection of the baby altogether.  It is important to avoid any suspicion of racism so I suggest all pregnant women should be tested for the HIV virus to protect their unborn children from infection and to help their health too.  When no treatment was available it was acceptable that patients should not be tested but with improved treatment for HIV infected patients they should have all the help they can get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming the Minister of State to the House.  It is important that matters relating to refugees, immigrants and asylum seekers be addressed at a time when there is growing public concern.  As has been said in the debate, the big influx of asylum seekers and immigrants, whether economic immigrants or those genuinely trying to escape from harsh regimes under which they might be killed <Col N="444" /> and which are the antithesis of what we have here, has only been noticed in recent years.  When discussing such matters there is no point in looking for instant solutions and talking about finalities which have been mentioned by Senators.  We must address this matter in a reasonable and logical manner because if we do not, the people who are genuinely in need of our help will not get it and the attitudes of people here will change, as is unfortunately happening throughout Europe at present.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week I attended a meeting with some continental colleagues.  A new political party has emerged in Denmark in the past five weeks.  Local elections will take place in Denmark within the next three weeks and it is estimated that because of the situation expounded by this new political party it will get up to 30 per cent of the vote.  It is a racist party.  It wants immigrants out and a white Denmark with Danes only.  Public opinion has gone so much against the non-implementation of immigration policies that the public in Denmark has turned totally against immigrants. Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the changes in East-West relations, so many refugees have been coming from the East that the attitudes of people in mainland Europe have either changed dramatically or they have returned to being racist.</P>
      <P>There is no point in pretending that we can deal with these issues overnight and that we can produce skilled people to deal with the immigration problem.  Senator Connor said that the refugee problem has got out of hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it has got out of hand.  There are problems in dealing with those people but they are being dealt with in as rational and reasonable a manner as possible.  When the Senator said these people were left for four hours in the rain does he mean that it would have been all right if it was not raining?  This is a nonsense. There was a problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it was addressed.  Has the Senator never been abroad and seen queues for exit visas?  The Government is trying to deal with the matter as adequately as possible and help these people.  The Government has been in power for barely 100 days and the Minister has addressed the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Senator Connor ask the former Minister for Justice, a member of his party, to withdraw the court case and then possibly the commissioner could be selected immediately and the Government could address the matter more adequately than at present?  Racism in Ireland is growing because there are a huge number of illegal immigrants at present who are not being <Col N="445" /> adequately cared for and I say this from a human point of view.  The matter is being addressed but it cannot be resolved overnight.  There is no doubt that some people coming to this country are not genuine refugees.  Refugees seek to escape from their own countries.  If they come here and if the matter is dealt with properly there would be a better attitude towards them in terms of employment and social welfare benefits which they need badly.</P>
      <P>There has never been an absence of racism in Irish people.  We have all heard scurrilous remarks made in the past against blacks and against students from different countries who attend colleges here.  There is no point pretending Irish people were never racist.  In certain countries to which they have emigrated, they have been very racist.  We have, as a people in the United States, been very racist towards blacks. The taint of racism is not new to Ireland; it has existed in the past.  Foreign students were refused houses because they were either black or could not speak English.  The scourge of racism existed here and it will not go away.</P>
      <P>However, the problem will be exacerbated unless the Government continues organising access to Ireland for people who desperately need the benefits of a society relatively free from what they are fleeing.  The number of refugees is a growing problem which must be addressed not alone by our Government but by other countries. It is good we are having this debate because it sends out a message that the Government is not standing still on the matter.</P>

The amendment has much more to offer than the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party supports the motion and I compliment the Independent Senators for tabling it.  Senator Henry's contribution, focusing on the medical problems experienced by asylum seekers and immigrants to this country, is indicative of the contributions made by the Independent Senators.  Senators Ryan's and Norris's contributions on the humanitarian and civil liberties and rights issues involved are welcome and reflect the long standing interest the Independent Senators have shown in the issue of human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with much of what Senator Lanigan said in terms of a comprehensive and holistic approach to the problem.  However, I was unhappy with some of the Minister's remarks on a number of issues.  For example, I was pleased to learn that 1997 was the European Year against <Col N="446" /> Racism and that tomorrow will be schools' national day against racism.  However, I was unaware of that, and I wonder to what extent it has been highlighted.  I welcome the fact the Government intends to introduce the Equal Status Bill soon so that we can outlaw all forms of discrimination.  That is part of our international obligations and the sooner we do it the better.</P>
    <P>The remarks about refugees and immigrants, illegal or otherwise, struck a chord in that, of our many ancestors who went to England and the United States, few were asylum seekers; most were economic migrants similar to most of those seeking access to our country now.  The issue is complex in terms of how we decide who is an illegal immigrant.  Were we to determine it in a narrow fashion, many of our ancestors who emigrated would be refused were they to apply now. The appalling situation last Saturday week, when approximately 2,000 people turned up outside the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to renew their identity cards, was unacceptable. It is not good enough to state that people were forced to wait four to six hours in the rain because of procedures.  Why not deal with 100 people each Saturday?  The Department of Foreign Affairs has begun to organise its business in this way.  It is incredibly insulting to people who seek asylum here that they are treated in that fashion and I am sure the Minister agrees.  It is to be hoped that will not happen again and that the matter will be resolved by using a staggered system so that everybody is not expected to renew their identity cards on the same day.</P>
    <P>I remember a few years ago arguing the case of a young student from Tiananmen Square who spent 18 months in a prison here.  He did not know his geography very well and thought Ireland and Britain were one and the same with a land link between them.  He got off an airplane in Dublin Airport thinking he could take the bus or train to Birmingham where some of his relatives lived.  Instead he spent 18 months in Mountjoy Prison and some time in Fitzgibbon Street Garda station where there are two holding cells for alleged illegal immigrants.  Similar cells exist in a number of other Garda stations.</P>
    <P>Our record on asylum seekers was absolutely appalling until we enacted the Refugee Act, 1996. What has happened since in terms of that legislation has also been appalling.  In the past, we simply put people on the next boat or plane out of the country, or in prison, and without any recourse to appeal.  It was simply a case of a telephone call by a Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform official to the UNHCR in London, with no attempt to investigate whether there was any solid basis to the application.  Almost all asylum seekers were deported immediately.  That was unsatisfactory.  We now have the legislation but we do not have the mechanism in place to deal with the increasing number of applicants. The necessary mechanism must be put in place because, while the Minister can hide behind the injunction, which I hope will be resolved quickly, <Col N="447" /> she is responsible for those applicants in the country and those seeking asylum here.  The staff, procedures, health facilities and accommodation should be put in place and this must be done in an organised, coherent fashion.</P>
    <P>In the last election, the big issue on the doorsteps in the city centre was immigrants.  Racism and xenophobia were developing there because people did not understand what was happening. Our campaign headquarters has already received notes in the door speaking about Adi Roche in very derogatory terms, such as being a lover of various ethnic groups.  This is happening on a broad level and, if action is not taken at an early stage and in an organised and coherent fashion, I can see us developing into a very racist society in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the middle of one of the great historic migrations.  These migrations probably started in Ireland in the middle of the last century with the migration after the Famine when the population dropped from 8 to 4 million in less than 50 years.  This was an economic migration.</P>
      <P>Earlier I was thinking of what I would say in this debate and, more importantly, how to say it without causing offence.  I was interested to hear Senator Costello speak of racism.  During the last general election in my constituency we came across a definite undercurrent of fear &mdash; racism is too strong a word.  This is partly because we are experiencing one of these great migrations in which people are moving from the periphery to the centre of Europe.  For all its faults, Central Europe is like the US at the turn of the century. It is enjoying an economic boom which attracts those who are dispossessed, hungry and economically disadvantaged.  These people move to an area of greater economic prosperity to improve their family circumstances and the status of their children.  I was an emigrant in the past and we should remember that once one moves to another country one starts at the bottom of the economic, social and financial ladder.  I am old enough to remember notices on doors stating &ldquo;Blacks or Irish Need Not Apply&rdquo;.  I hope we will not see a variation of that in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I visited Ellis Island.  Any Irish person who visits the US should visit that place.  It is now sanitised but there are pictures on the walls and one can almost hear the cries and see the tears of those who passed through it.  Many of those people were Irish, others were fleeing the anti-Jewish pogroms which took place at the end of the last century in middle and far eastern Europe.  These people made America rich, bringing a cultural diversity and an economic strength. If one looks at American medical textbooks they are all written by first or second generation European refugees.  It is hard to think of anything good accomplished by Adolf Hitler.  However, one of the upsides of the forced German migrations of the thirties was the strengthening of American <Col N="448" /> intellectual property.  Immigrants created great advances and they are one of the reasons America is such an economic and intellectual giant and the leading world power.</P>
    <P>Ireland is far smaller than the US.  We do not have the resources or the economy to absorb large numbers of refugees.  This behoves us to establish a mechanism for those who wish to move here.  This Bill and the Minister's speech are a small step on that road.  It will not be easy. We must remember that we are changing from a relatively homogeneous to a more diverse society. To put it crudely, when I was growing up the only foreign influence on our food was the local chipper run by Italian immigrants.  There is now a great diversity of ethnic cuisine in Dublin.  We will have to learn to deal with these immigrants. That will take patience, good will and charity. There have been and there will be blips.  We must balance the problem of taking in more people than we can handle with learning to cope with those we can properly, gracefully and graciously. This will not happen overnight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Brendan Ryan for proposing this motion.  Never was a motion more timely.  Both Senators Ryan and Norris have dealt with the technicalities of the Refugee Act, which we discussed at some length last year, and the crucial need for it to be implemented as soon as possible.  I did not hear all of this debate but there has been a very tolerant, open and progressive response from Members.  That bodes well for society.  During the past year I have felt pessimistic on a number of occasions about comments made by Members which seemed to indicate a latent xenophobia. There has been none of that today and important contributions have been made.</P>
      <P>I will not deal with the Bill but with the next part of the motion concerning an informed debate.  There are those who talk about people coming to this country taking advantage of our social welfare system and so on.  We have heard this in pubs and seen sideswipes in newspapers and other places.  There is a story in today's <i>Evening Herald</i> which the country has been watching for the past three days.  It concerns a 14 year old girl who went off with an older man and for whom the whole country has been searching. They have been found.  It is interesting to look at the context of this case without making any judgments about the individuals involved.</P>
      <P>In Chester, England, this girl approached the social welfare services pretending to be her older sister and claiming to be pregnant.  She was collecting the keys to a local authority house in Chester this afternoon when found by the authorities. This is a salutary story as it reflects a caring society in England &mdash; a country which we do not often see as being so.  Those who try to assert that people coming to this country act differently to Irish people abroad are completely wrong.  We have always been supported by the welfare structures in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> I listened to Senator Fitzpatrick's comments about Ellis Island.  I have also visited Grosse Ile in Canada which has a similar museum.  I unveiled a plaque to Irish immigrants in Hamilton, Canada, where, less than 100 years ago, &ldquo;No Irish&rdquo; signs were posted; the Irish are now running that city.</P>
    <P>It is important to remind ourselves and those outside who are quick with comments and criticisms that this is a growing economy and a developing country with a lot of wealth.  It is going to be a magnet for the less well off, particularly those in Eastern Europe.  We must adjust to that fact as it is going to be the future.  How we adjust to these people is not simply a matter of accommodating and tolerating them, it is a matter of assimilating them into the community. I am no bleeding heart liberal saying we must accept everyone who comes to our shores.  I worked hard on the Refugee Bill and those who advised us and Government during that Bill have made it clear that the idea of the Bill was to put structure and order to our procedures.  I thought it could have gone further but it must be implemented and we must stick with it.</P>
    <P>There is not a street in any small town in this country which has not sent jobless people abroad, particularly to England.  People have lived entire lifetimes on social welfare there and we were glad they were able to do so.  In this House not long ago, we beat our breasts, whinged, whined and criticised the manner in which Irish immigrants were treated in the US.  They did not have welfare or hospital entitlements and could not take out medical insurance or receive proper support.  We saw the injustice in that and we tried to achieve a balance there though we did not do too well.</P>
    <P>There is not a courthouse in this country where, at one stage, on a monthly basis the judge was not heard to say to somebody &ldquo;I'll give you six months unless you want to go to England&rdquo;.  I heard that being said.  This country has played its part in exporting unemployed people and people who were, in effect, criminals, albeit petty ones. We sent such people to other countries to be looked after when we would not do it ourselves. We could not and would not provide jobs for them and we did not want them to go to prison.</P>
    <P>People commit, and are found guilty of, serious crime in this country; I wonder whether the stark photographs published in today's <i>Irish Times</i> would have been published if they did not concern somebody from eastern Europe.  I do not want anything to be interpreted from that comment, it is merely an opinion.  We regularly see headlines such as &ldquo;Travellers' Row&rdquo; or &ldquo;Travellers Break Up Navan&rdquo; in Irish newspapers; we do not see headlines such as &ldquo;Nine Kerry Men in Brawl&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nine Dublin Men in Brawl&rdquo;.  I grew up in a town where there were regular fights on fair day.  We learned to accommodate that and we grew out of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> Irish people took great pride in recent years in being the greatest <i>per capita</i> contributors to <i>Live Aid</i>; in previous years we took pride in the fact that we sent missionaries and teachers to developing countries and that we contributed the most money to the &ldquo;black babies&rdquo;.  That was fine until those people started to come here and we had to meet them face to face.  That was when we started to ask questions.</P>
    <P>I would like to have had an opportunity to deal with the issue of racism and its associated developments, namely, the recognition, tolerance and accommodation of difference.  Irish society seems to think that if a Muslim school or a travellers' encampment is set up, we have a pluralist society. We do not.  A pluralist society is one which will be judged by the quality of the relationship between the different groups within it.  That will not be achieved by giving people their own space; we must give them part of everybody else's space in a way which is rational and regulated.  I do not want to be seen to open the doors to everyone; I want the system to be a regulated and correct one.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I had a meeting with a group of people who teach travellers.  They witness at first hand many of the worst effects of racism and xenophobia towards our own people.  One of the things I discussed with them was the possibility of introducing a programme in Irish schools addressing the issues of racism and xenophobia which would initially target teachers.  We should address this issue, which is an important one in terms of the quality of our future life, in the same way as we address stay safe and sex education programmes.</P>
    <P>I began my contribution by saying that Ireland was going to be a multi-cultural society.  That is to be welcomed.  In Paul Durcan's poem &ldquo;Christmas&rdquo; he writes that the problem with Dublin is Dublin women have had to deal with white men in off-white underwear for too long. That is a great line and it is something we should consider as we look to the future.</P>

      <P>One of the things about which one can be proud of this country is that matters such as this are dealt with in the Houses of the Oireachtas with a degree of restraint which would not perhaps characterise a similar debate in what describes itself, with some arrogance, as the &ldquo;mother of Parliaments&rdquo;.  There is a tendency there to talk in extremes about matters such as this in a manner which would make one's hair stand on end.  However, that is as much as I liked about the discussion on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many questions were left unanswered.  It is peculiar to have a sizeable bundle of press cuttings <Col N="451" /> full of appalling headlines on this issue and yet find the press gallery empty.  One wonders whether refugees are only an issue when they are good for a cheap headline.  This is a serious issue and we should all show the kind of responsibility which was shown in this House.  None of us want cheap headlines on this issue and, therefore, nobody in the media is interested in this discussion. Perhaps that is the problem.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. It lacked substance and did not deal with the issues raised.  It did not explain, for instance, how refugees from a variety of countries are dealt with by members of the Garda Síochána who cannot, I suspect, speak any of these people's native languages. How is the wonderful courtesy, which the Minister describes as being required of all of these officers, applied when an investigating immigration officer does not have a single word of any language in common with the person he or she is investigating?  That is a simple question. Unless the Garda have taken a crash course in languages I do not see how this can happen.  How is it possible to investigate and be courteous to people or even determine whether they want to be treated as refugees if one cannot speak five words of their language?  How is it possible to make any kind of judgment in those cases?  We did not receive any answer to that question.</P>
    <P>Have people been turned away in significant numbers since 1 September?  That question was not answered either.  We also have considerable reason to suspect that among the amendments planned for the Refugee Act is a suggestion that <Col N="452" /> there would perhaps be some kind of holding centre for people while their applications are processed. Are there any grounds for thinking this? The Minister could have said &ldquo;no&rdquo;; it is not a difficult word to say and Ministers are usually very good at saying it.  I must assume that the fact the Minister did not deny this suggestion is an indication that something like this is planned.  It is a pity the Minister did not clarify this matter; we would all have been much happier about tonight's debate if she had.  We still do not know what is happening in that regard.</P>
    <P>There was a particular irony in the Minister's speech when she said that the taxpayer must support applicants and their families while a decision is pending.  The only reason the taxpayer must support these people is because we will not allow them to work under any circumstances.  Why can we not tell people that if they can obtain work for which no Irish people are available they may do it?  If one walks along Grafton Street or O'Connell Street, one will see jobs advertised in various places.  Ireland is no longer a country in which there are no available jobs.  I do not know why people do not fill them.  Why not let people work while we are overcoming gargantuan delays in making simple decisions?  We dictate that the taxpayer must support these people, not some external body.  Refugees cannot be blamed for living off the welfare state when we give them no option.  It is not their fault.  I will not be accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to see the Minister of State in the House, having met him earlier today at the conference on health for older women in UCD. However, I now want to talk about health services for younger women.</P>
      <P>Some of the most devastating congenital abnormalities in babies involve neural tube defects.  The neural tube is that part of the embryo which develops into the brain, the spinal cord and the nervous system.  At an early developmental stage, within a few weeks of conception, abnormalities in the development of the neural tube can occur leading to anencaphaly if the abnormality is at the anterior end of the tube and to spina bifida if the abnormality occurs at the posterior end.  The former is incompatible with life outside the womb and the latter, if not leading to a similar fate for the newborn child, means serious neurological problems in many cases for a child who survives.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Ireland has a high incidence of children born with neural tube defects and at one stage we had the highest incidence in Europe. About 70 to 80 children with anencephaly or spina bifida are born each year in Ireland.  Worse still, a woman may have several affected children. It can run in families and many babies may be lost as miscarriages.  This, naturally, has caused enormous distress to the parents and families of these children.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 years Irish and international researchers have made Trojan efforts to elucidate the causes of this problem.  It rapidly became evident there was a nutritional element because lower socio-economic groups had a higher incidence of problems.  Nutritional problems are often serious in this section of the community. Research showed that low serum folate levels were associated with the development of neural tube defects, particularly if these were present at the time of conception and in the early weeks of the development of the embryo.</P>
      <P>Great efforts have been made to encourage women who hope to become pregnant to take an added amount of folic acid in tablet form to prevent such problems developing.  If both prospective parents took the folates it would probably be even better.  The Department of Health in the United Kingdom and the Department of Health and Human Services in the United States were the first to issue recommendations on the use of folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. The recommendations relate to prevention of occurrent &mdash; first time &mdash; and recurrent NTDs and similar recommendations have been adopted by other national health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> The main points in these recommendations were as follows: to prevent NTD recurrence in the offspring of women or men with spina bifida or encephalocele themselves, or with a history of a previous child with NTD; such women and men should be counselled about the increased risk in subsequent pregnancies and about the protective effect of supplementation with folic acid; women with a previously affected pregnancy should, unless contra-indicated, be advised to take 4.0 mg of folic acid daily from at least four weeks before conception until the end of the third month of pregnancy.  In countries where a 5.0 mg rather than a 4.0 mg preparation is available, the former can be used but the lower 4.0 mg dose should be used as soon as this preparation becomes available.</P>
    <P>The 4.0 mg dose should be taken only under the supervision of a doctor for two main reasons. First, giving high doses of folic acid can complicate the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. Second, epileptic women on anti-convulsant therapy require individual counselling before starting folic acid.  The folic acid dose should be obtained from pills containing only folic acid and not from multi-vitamin preparations because of the danger of taking harmful levels of vitamins A and D. I am glad to say that such tablets are produced in Ireland by Clonmel Chemicals, among others.</P>
    <P>For the prevention of occurrence of NTDs the United States public health service recommends that all women capable of becoming pregnant consume 0.4 mg of folic acid per day and that total folate consumption should not be more than 1.0 mg per day to avoid the possible risks of high intake.  The United Kingdom expert advisory group recommends that women should take an extra 0.4mg of folic acid daily from the time they begin trying to conceive until the 12th week of pregnancy.  If a woman who has not been taking this additional amount of folic acid suspects that she may have just started a pregnancy, she should begin taking extra folic acid at once and continue until the 12th week of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>In practice, however, taking into account that the fact that at least 30 per cent and maybe 50 per cent of pregnancies are unplanned, any such campaign will not cover enough of the population when it is recognised that those young women in the lower socio-economic groups, who have the most likelihood of having a child with a neural tube defect, are the least likely to take additional folate.  As a medical doctor, the Minister of State will be aware that efforts have been made to improve this situation here and in Britain with little success.  Eating folate rich food, such as broccoli, frequently does not raise the blood folate levels sufficiently.  Another route has to be considered.</P>
    <P>In January 1998 the Legislature of the United States of America will introduce a law to fortify flour for the general production of bread and confectionery with folates.  It is now known that it is a genetic deficiency in the katabolism of homocysteine allowing it to build up to high levels.  This <Col N="455" /> is a major factor in this problem.  Folic acid is a cofactor in an important enzymatic reaction in the metabolism of homocysteine.  We in Ireland have about a 10 per cent incidence in the population of the genetic defect which allows high levels of homocysteine to develop if folic acid intake is deficient.  Some countries, such as Italy, may have a 15 per cent incidence and other countries, such as South Africa, a lower incidence.</P>
    <P>This is not just a problem of homocysteine and neural tube defects, because high levels of homocysteine may also be important in the development of cardiovascular disease.  It may eventually be found that reducing blood levels of homocysteine lowers instances of cardiovascular disease, which would be important to men.  We must take this into account when considering the fortification of flour with folates.  Over the next few years further research may elucidate the importance of folates here.</P>
    <P>The question of changing the diet of a population by the fortification of food or water is a very emotive issue, and Members will remember the debate on the fluoridation of water.  Looking at the beneficial effects that has had on the teeth of children, it is hard to see that debate as being worthwhile.  However, if the evidence is there that the overall good, especially of unborn children, is improved by the addition of folates, the Minister must consider acting as soon as possible.  The Food Safety Advisory Board has a report which explains all I have said in much greater detail and far more eloquently.  I hope it has been forwarded to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some flour naturally must be excluded so that those who wish to make bread with unfortified flour can do so, but so much of our food is fortified with minerals and vitamins which have obviously helped raise our nutritional standards, reduce levels of anaemia and other health problems that we need to move now on folates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this matter.  The prevention of neural tube defects is an important public health issue for society at large and for women in particular. The Department of Health and Children attaches particular importance to seeking a means of reducing the incidence of what should largely be a preventable condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been scientifically proven that the taking of extra folic acid prior to conception and during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is an effective health care initiative for the primary prevention of neural tube defects.  In 1992 the health promotion unit of the Department set about developing an information campaign on the benefits of folic acid in preventing neural tube defects. A detailed set of information leaflets and posters advising women on the link between folic acid and neural tube defects was devised by the health promotion unit and was circulated extensively <Col N="456" /> throughout the country via general practitioners, community pharmacists, health board outlets, maternity hospitals and Well Woman clinics during 1993.  Four possible ways of achieving an extra intake of folic acid were outlined: eating more foods naturally rich in folate, eating foods fortified with folic acid, taking folic acid as a medicinal or food supplement and having a combination of these approaches.  The general recommendation was that women should use whatever source or combination of sources they preferred to ensure that they obtained the necessary folic acid.  These materials are currently being updated in the light of emerging scientific evidence to ensure the optimum intake of folic acid by those who need it.</P>
    <P>However, subsequent research studies revealed that relatively few Irish women were actually taking folic acid periconceptionally.  This has been shown to be the case even in optimal circumstances, that is, among women who know about the link between folic acid supplementation and the prevention of neural tube defects, and who plan their pregnancies.  There is, perhaps, therefore a need to investigate alternative or complementary strategies to ensure an adequate intake of folic acid for those who require it.</P>
    <P>One alternative currently being examined by an expert group of the Food Safety Advisory Board is the fortification of a staple food with folic acid.  The question of food fortification, particularly mandatory fortification, is a complex one which requires much further research. Initially, an appropriate food staple, whether flour or some other, must be chosen after which the legal, industrial and other implications of this course of action must be addressed.  Any eventual proposals for food fortification would also have to be considered in an EU context in view of the implications for the free movement of goods. There are aspects of this issue which are outside the remit of the Department and consultations will have to take place with other Departments. All these factors indicate that this is not a matter which can be resolved quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I are satisfied at present to be guided by the advice of the Food Safety Advisory Board in this matter and, accordingly, I look forward to receiving the result of the deliberations of its expert group in due course.</P>
    <P>I assure the House of the importance the Department attaches to this issue.  At present about 75 children are born with neural tube defects every year in this country.  Both the Minister and the Department are committed to ensuring that no effort is spared to ensure that this number can be reduced or indeed eliminated altogether.</P>
