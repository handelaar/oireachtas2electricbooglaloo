      <P>I have received notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to address the issue of the responsibility of his Department in the Castlerea Town Trust, County Roscommon, otherwise known as the Demesne Townland, Castlerea, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Keogh of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to review regulations governing the subvention paid to patients in private nursing homes as a matter of great urgency.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to report the progress, if any, made following her meeting with Tipperary Urban District Council, Tipperary County Council and local public representatives regarding the attraction of new industry to Tipperary town.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Finneran's and Keogh's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Tom Hayes may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 7, motion 10; the proceedings on Second Stage of item 1, if not previously concluded, to resume at 8 p.m. The contribution on item 1 will not exceed 20 minutes in the case of spokespersons and 15 minutes in the case of all other Senators.  Business is to interrupted from 4 <Col N="1110" /> p.m. to 6 p.m. Item 7, motion 10, is to be taken at 6 p.m.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Leader would clarify the Order of Business.  He said items 1 and 7.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  Item 7, motion 10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I compliment the Leader on the function he organised yesterday to honour former Cathaoirligh.  It was extremely well done.  It was much appreciated by all of the former Cathaoirligh and their families who were present and a great deal of credit is due to you and your predecessor for putting it in train.</P>
      <P>I want to raise with the Leader this morning's statement on refugee policy by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I realise it is a very complex issue but there was a certain harshness and bureaucratic neatness about the solution being offered this morning.  Rather than rush to judgment, will the Leader make time available in the House to have a full discussion on this issue?</P>
      <P>Finally, will the Leader indicate in some detail the proposed programme of business for the remainder of the session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is crucially important to know the Leader's intentions for sitting days, particularly next week.  We need a plan to deal with the legislation to be initiated in this House.  I have argued with the Leader, in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and elsewhere, that more legislation should be first discussed here and he has done a good job in arranging the initiation of a number of Bills.  This leads to a different type of debate which is important.</P>
      <P>On a related matter, I have raised with the Chairman of the all-party committee on the Constitution the membership and structure of that committee.  It is unacceptable that Independents are not represented and there seems no reason for it.  We wish that matter to be clarified.  The Independent Group has already raised the matter with the Department of the Taoiseach.  We want a clear outline of the position and ask for the Leader's support in ensuring our representation.</P>
      <P>I previously asked for a debate on literacy, which is an important issue at a time when we are trying to promote ourselves abroad.  I accept the debate will not happen before Christmas but could I have a commitment that it will be taken on the first sitting day after the recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's last request.  The Labour Party has put down a motion on that subject; perhaps we can take it early in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: &ldquo;That item 5 be taken before item 1&rdquo;.  Item 5 is the Protection of Workers (Shops) Bill, 1997. We are seeking leave from the House to have the Bill printed.  It was debated in the Dáil earlier this <Col N="1111" /> year and accepted on Second Stage.  While it did not pass last week, good contributions were made by all sides and it was agreed even by those who voted against the Bill that the subject deserved further examination.  This House would be an ideal place for that discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Arctic conditions hit us and our thoughts turn towards Christmas, it is most harrowing to see many people sleeping rough on our streets &mdash; they are refugees from our economy. The number of homeless seems to multiply every year.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House for a debate on homelessness so that the Minister can indicate what he proposes to do, by way of public and social housing policies, in the name of the Irish taxpayer to confront successfully this problem?  The position is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Dr. Haughey Dr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware of the outrageous behaviour in Wales.  Our farmers and beef industry work hard and do not need to engage in illegal activities to stay in business and prove their worth.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to the House as a matter of urgency to make a statement on this matter.  Engaging in similar behaviour or boycotting British goods will not get us anywhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you, Sir, and the Leader take up the issue of refugees which Senator Manning raised?  During the debate on the matter in the House last month the Minister did not even hint at the decisions which were subsequently announced, despite the fact that I asked specific questions about many of those proposals.  It is profoundly offensive to this House that decisions which were about to be announced were omitted from the discussion.  It shows that Minister did not take the House seriously.  It was a very good debate which maintained the proper tone.  Unlike certain Members of the other House, Members of this House deal with such issues with a degree of responsibility.  I hope Ministers will take this House seriously in future rather than just going through the motions of speaking to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of children's toys has been spoken about widely.  This House should debate the issue before Christmas from two aspects: first, the working conditions of children who make toys in other countries and, second, the extraordinary amount of commercial pressure placed on parents <Col N="1112" /> through the targeting of children by advertising. Such advertising should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the issue of the committee on the Constitution.  Is it appropriate for a body which has not been set up with the consent of both Houses of the Oireachtas to describe itself as an Oireachtas committee, as the committee on the Constitution does?  Perhaps I am mistaken but I am not aware of any resolution passed by this House to set up such a committee.  I do not understand how it can describe itself as an Oireachtas committee if it was not set up by both Houses.  It would be very presumptuous if that were the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Haughey's statement on the Welsh farmers' blockade but he is not going far enough.  The situation has become too critical for any statement to the House by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to be sufficient. Will the Leader request the Taoiseach to intervene immediately?  The situation is escalating and will worsen.  I sympathise with the Welsh farmers involved but I do not agree with their course of action.  At this stage only the intervention of the Taoiseach can ensure the British establishment will rigorously enforce the law. This will have very serious consequences for Ireland and free trade in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the interference with agricultural produce going through the ports of Holyhead and Fishguard, will the Leader convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the necessity of ensuring that EU member states enforce their own laws on access, transportation and competition which are being infringed?  Will he also raise with the Minister the possibility of applying mandatory sanctions and compensation at European Council level, which would specifically address the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls of Senator Manning and Senator Brendan Ryan for proper behaviour by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to the asylum issue. Will the Leader ask the Minister if he is happy to be an accomplice in murder, which is what will happen?  Mention has been made of referring people to the first point of entry &mdash; for example, countries such as France, which happily returns refugees to Algeria on the basis that they may well be killed, but not by government forces.  If we follow this policy it makes us all accomplices to murder.  I strongly object to it.  There is no accountability and we do not know what procedures are involved.  Will the Leader require the Minister to attend the House and disclose the procedures in use for the exclusion of refugees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Government is experiencing difficulty in amending legislation dealing with payments to Members of the Oireachtas and <Col N="1113" /> political parties, despite the fact that the Independent Members of the other House have said they are not creating any difficulty.  I detect a certain self interest on the part of the Government, which I would like to share.  Is the Leader content that this House should have been so completely excluded from these payments for election expenses, especially in a situation where, although expenditure is necessary to get elected we are not allowed to discount it against income tax?  Why does this House not stand up for itself and say that if it is appropriate to pay for elections for the Lower House it is also appropriate to pay something towards the expenses of politicians in the Upper House?</P>
    <P>I support my Labour Party colleagues on the issue of Sunday opening.  I have been frequently reminded that, under the Constitution, this is a Christian country.  We are told to observe the Sabbath.  It is inappropriate for large English combines to coerce Irish employees to work on Sundays.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader convey our congratulations to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, for the reasoned and strong position she took when an attempt was made to browbeat her by the EU Commissioner, Monika Wulf-Mathies, whose approach appeared to be that we should construct a second rate system of transport in Dublin in order simply to spend the available money?  I congratulate the Minister for her honourable stance in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Justice the grave concern which I and other Members have regarding the horrific murder in Galway of the taxi driver, Eileen Costello O'Shaughnessy, who was only carrying out her job?  It highlights the increased violence in the country against women and taxi drivers.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to investigate a review of the taxi services, especially the safety aspect for both men and women drivers against syringe and knife attacks and even murder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader obtain a statement from the Taoiseach or Minister for Finance regarding the funding of the Moriarty and Flood tribunals?  The Moriarty tribunal has commenced its work.  What payments have been made to it since its establishment?  We learnt yesterday that the Flood tribunal has not commenced work, even though its first report was due before both Houses of the Oireacthas today.  When did the Attorney General make the necessary arrangements with the parties involved?</P>
      <P>Is the Government trying to sabotage the workings of these tribunals?  If so, the proceedings of both Houses of the Oireachtas regarding their establishment will be brought into disrepute.  It would appear that what we learnt yesterday conflicts with statements made by the Taoiseach in this House and the other House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arranged a debate on the increased amount of money being spent on advertising cigarettes?  Every hospital now seeks a cancer unit, which will cost millions of pounds.  There were pages of advertisements in yesterday's newspapers.  We have reached a point where there is no control over cigarette advertising. I noticed a full page colour advertisement for cigarettes in yesterday's evening newspaper with a small indication at the bottom that cigarettes can kill.  We must have a debate on the matter so that we may highlight the cost to the State of millions of pounds from cigarettes, a cost which far outweighs the revenue from the sale of cigarettes. It is matter that merits urgent discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment proposed by Senator Gallagher with regard to the Protection of Workers (Shops) Bill, 1997.  I ask the Leader of the House to convey our concern to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about his recent decisions which return us to the circumstances which prevailed prior to the Refugee Act when there was neither an independent assessment process nor recourse to the UNHCR.  It is particularly alarming that there may be mass deportations coming up to Christmas in the 150th anniversary of the Famine. We can only imagine the situation which would have prevailed if Irish people arriving in Canada or the US at that time had been sent back because they did not conform to legislative prescriptions.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House seek a response from the Government on the recent illegal actions at Welsh ports?  Irish farm produce has been dumped into the sea at Holyhead and no attempt to arrest those responsible has been made.  Last night the port authorities at Fishguard allowed a group of people to inspect Irish truck drivers' documents &mdash; an illegal action.  We must find out what happened because such actions could spark a range of other illegal activities against Irish farmers.  We do not wish to see the Welsh and Irish farmers pitted against each other. We have sympathy for the Welsh farmers, but illegal actions will not solve their problems.  The Government should urgently seek meetings with the Welsh Secretary and the British Agriculture Minister with a view to resolving the matter.  The resolution lies with the British Government and the EU, not with the Irish farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that Senator Norris, with whom I agree usually, lives in the city centre. However, I live in the suburbs.  I had a hospital appointment this morning at 8.15 a.m. and I left home at 7 a.m. only to arrive in Blackrock at 8.45 p.m. because I travelled through the suburbs, where Operation Freeflow is not in force.  I do not like to think of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, being bullied by anybody but I sympathise with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, realises that she is doing a disservice by delaying Luas.  The loss of Luas would be a blight on the Government.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to explain her actions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views expressed about the attacks on Irish food produce exports. Such tactics have been used on previous occasions in France and are part of a growing trend.  However, as Europeans in a union with a common free market, it is not in the best interest of the people or country concerned.  We should support the Government in trying to resolve the matter as quickly as possible before it extends to other sectors.</P>
      <P>I previously raised the issue of jobs.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to tell the House what efforts are being made by Forbairt and IDA Ireland to provide job opportunities outside the major growth centres mentioned in the Buchanan report?  What efforts in terms of direction and policy are being made to provide jobs which will sustain rural Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the urgent need for an initiative to deal with the waiting list for cardiac treatment?  Thousands of people are waiting many years for major surgery. Will the Leader also bring to the Minister's attention the fact that these patients could lead a full and active life after such operations?  I am aware of a case in Drogheda where a woman has had sleepless nights for over a year because she is worried her daughter may not be alive in the morning.  She requires an operation but it cannot be carried out because she cannot afford private fees and, as a medical card holder, she cannot get the attention she needs.  This issue is extremely urgent and the Government should act immediately on this matter which is most important to thousands of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the unacceptable incidents in Wales in which Irish goods have been <Col N="1116" /> prevented from entering Great Britain through Fishguard and Holyhead, will the Leader ask the Government to bring to the British Government's attention the need to comply with the Single European Act under which goods can move freely between countries?  The British Government should also be asked to enforce the law.  The point was made that if such incidents occurred in Dover or Calais, the police would move quickly to ensure trucks were not held up.  The same principle should apply in Holyhead and Fishguard. Another dimension is that these incidents are a symptom, however unacceptable, of what British farmers perceive as their Government's inaction in relation to BSE and the resulting collapse in farm incomes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole's queries about the business of the House before Christmas, the Seanad will sit four days next week and the following week.  The Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Bill will be initiated in the House today and four other Bills will be initiated here next week.  The number of Bills which will be initiated here in one week is unprecedented. It has never happened in my 16 years in the House and I understand it did not happen in the preceding years.  A total of six Bills will be initiated in the Seanad, one today, four next week and another one after the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>I will pass on the great concerns of Senators Norris, Ryan and Manning about refugee policy to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  However, I am sure everybody was pleased about the court findings yesterday. Serious aspects would have emerged if the decision had gone another way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>People may criticise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform occasionally but he should take some sustenance from the court findings yesterday.  It is a difficult portfolio but eight of the Bills which will come before both Houses in the near future relate to Justice.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole and Senator Ryan regarding the all-party committee on the Constitution.  I will use my good offices to see what can be done about their request.  Senator O'Toole also requested a debate on literacy for which I will make time available during the first week of the new session.</P>
      <P>With regard to the points raised by Senators Gallagher and Costello in respect of item No. 5 on the Order Paper, I have no objection to the Bill being printed.</P>
      <P>Senator Quill requested a debate on homelessness with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I will make time available for such a debate at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Haughey, Dardis, Tom Hayes, Jim Walsh, Costello and Chambers raised the serious <Col N="1117" /> situation obtaining in Welsh ports.  I communicated this morning with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, who assured me that he will raise this matter at the Council of Trade Ministers of the EU later in the week.  I also had discussions with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, who is seeking to meet his British counterpart, Mr. Jack Cunningham, tomorrow morning.  I assure the House that everything possible is being done at Government level to resolve this serious matter. I am sure further information will become available later today.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked me to congratulate the Minister for Public Enterprise in respect of LUAS, while Senator Ridge requested that she come before the House to clarify the situation in that regard.  I propose to debate this issue during the next session.  During the lifetime of the previous Seanad there was a lengthy debate on LUAS with the former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Senator Avril Doyle.  I was front bench spokesperson for Fianna Fáil on that occasion when approximately 25 or more Members contributed to the debate.  I suggest that if Senator Ridge familiarises herself with those proceedings, we can take the matter from there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mór an onóir dom bheith anseo inniú chun an Bille seo a léamh.  Is é seo mo chéad uair <Col N="1119" /> mar Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta bheith as comhair an tSeanaid agus is é mo chéad uair bheith os comhair an Oireachtais le Bille.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to developing our education system to address the principal challenges that face us at the turn of the millennium. In this, we have two main priorities.  Firstly, we want to bring into the benefits of education, groups who have previously been excluded.  This must involve both extending provision and creating new types of provision.  I have already been able to announce a number of initiatives in this area and will be in a position to announce further ones in the months to come.</P>
      <P>Our second priority is to develop our education system so that it can keep pace with the changing modern world.  We must enhance the place of education as a driving force in the economic life of our country.  Crucial to this is the need to put right any perceived barriers to economic development arising out of skills shortages, particularly in the technological sector.  At the heart of this Bill is a plan to deal comprehensively with this issue.  Soon after my appointment I met with representatives of the IDA and the major technological companies operating in Ireland as well as other State agencies and representatives of the teaching unions.  I also met with the heads of the Irish universities, the colleges of technology and the regional technical colleges.  Following these meetings I announced a programme to increase graduate and technician output from our institutions in order to meet emerging skills needs in the high technology sector.  This involved an immediate capital investment of £5 million in creating extra places in third level colleges for 1997.  At the time I launched this programme I said further consideration would be given to more capital investment in the context of the 1998 Estimates. We are now in a position to fulfil this promise.</P>
      <P>It was in this skills initiative that the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund had its genesis.  Three key objectives underpin the investment fund.  First, we want to renew and modernise the infrastructure of third level institutions, particularly in the technological sector, and guarantee they will continue to produce high quality graduates.  Second, we want to develop new areas of activities in our institutions, especially where emerging skills needs have already been identified and, finally, we want to invest in promoting the innovation which will be so crucial to maintaining and expanding our recent growth.  Underlying all of this will be an investment in developing the technology and skills base of our first and second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for major investment in the scientific and technological area became more apparent as I considered how the regional technical colleges and institutes of technology had been virtually starved of capital investment for their infrastructure; how the institutions of higher education had a dire need of a capital injection for the purchase <Col N="1120" /> of equipment; how research and development in the institutions had been operating on a shoestring for many years; the fact that, while plans for major developments in computer education in first and second level schools were announced, no money had been spent to progress these plans; the fact that the training for the hotel and tourism industry was being hindered because of a lack of proper facilities in the colleges, and the fact that apprenticeship training and post-leaving certificate programmes had had virtually no capital investment for a very long time, if ever.</P>
    <P>When all of these factors are put together they add up to a very significant need in the technological, scientific and vocational sectors of education. What we are putting in place with this legislation represents a dramatic response to those needs.</P>
    <P>This is not a very long or elaborate Bill. However, in terms of what it contains, it is a Bill of the utmost importance.  I would like now for the benefit of the House to detail the main provisions of the Bill together with the background and rationale for the provisions.</P>
    <P>In regard to the title of the Bill, Senators will note that it refers to an investment fund.  There is, indeed, provision in the Bill for an account for the purposes of receiving private donations and this account will be known as the &ldquo;investment account&rdquo;.  However, in the context of what is involved in this Bill the word &ldquo;investment&rdquo; in the title refers to the Government's commitment to invest in technological, scientific and vocational education and this investment represents a vote of confidence in this sector of education to deliver the human resource needs of a technology oriented economy.</P>
    <P>This represents the crux of the Bill.  By establishing a fund and allowing a flexible procedure for planning, the Bill will give a stable medium-term base for developments.  The insecurity which comes from the often fraught Estimates process will not affect this investment.  It will allow our development agencies to attract employment and inward investment with confidence and it will allow our institutions to seek to build on the State's funding.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill establishes the fund and outlines the two accounts which will form the fund, namely, an account with the Office of the Paymaster General and a private donations investment account.  It is opportune now for me in this context to acknowledge very significant private investment by individuals and companies in third level capital projects.  These have been for the most part in the university sector and great gratitude is due to the benefactors for their very generous contribution.  Credit is due also to those in the institutions who have sought and secured these contributions.</P>
    <P>It is important, of course, that private donations would be kept separate from Exchequer moneys in the fund and that any moneys accruing through investment or otherwise from private donations would be paid into the <Col N="1121" /> private investment account.  In this way benefactors can be assured that their contributions are clearly earmarked as being outside of Exchequer contributions.  The Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>This section also provides that, while the Minister for Finance is responsible for management of the fund, this function may be delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency.  It is in fact intended that all balances within the fund, whether provided by the Exchequer or by way of donation, will be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
    <P>Surplus private sector donations, to be kept in a separate investment account, may be invested in Government securities.  The management of this investment account will be delegated to the NTMA.  Similarly, any balances arising from moneys provided by the Exchequer to the fund will be managed by the NTMA.  In the latter case, this would be done through the cash management system which operates for the Exchequer generally. Under this system, any balances held in departmental or other accounts are effectively pooled together and the aggregate balance is managed by the NTMA in such a fashion as to achieve the maximum overall return.</P>
    <P>What matters is that additional money is added to the State's investment, not the manner in which that money is added.  Whether that is achieved through contributing to the investment fund or by way of the institutions themselves, we expect a significant amount to be added to the core allocation.  Experience indicates that direct contributions to institutions are more likely and that the ready availability of secure State matching finance will allow institutions to increase significantly the level of these contributions.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is, perhaps, the &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of the Bill.  It provides for payment into the fund, out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas, of £250 million over the three years 1998, 1999 and 2000.  The sum of £100 million will be paid in 1998.</P>
    <P>This provision represents a radical departure from previous capital provision for my Department. Although the money will be voted in the Estimates for the Department in the normal way, its provision in a special fund will facilitate a rolling programme of capital investment over a number of years which is difficult to achieve in the normal year by year capital provision.  The establishment of the fund and the specific provisions relating to the £250 million in section 3 gives effect to the Government's commitment to capital investment in education in a way never before outlined.  Although it is not stated in the Bill, I assure the House that payments into the fund will be additional to the normal year on year capital Estimates for my Department.  As a result, the total capital provision for my Department next year will be in excess of £220 million.  The corresponding Estimate for 1997 was £94.8 million, although the outturn for that year was higher than the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill outlines the purposes for which payments may be made from the fund.  The <Col N="1122" /> provisions in section 4 cover in a generic way the seven broad areas which will benefit from the fund.  Although it is not stated in the Bill, I wish to outline the indicative sums it is proposed to invest in each of these areas.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised that continued investment in human capital and in the production of a highly skilled labour force has been a major factor in Ireland's high rate of economic growth in recent years.  In particular, the availability of a skilled labour force has formed a crucial part of the IDA's success in attracting significant foreign inward investment, including many leading multinational manufacturers.  An interdepartmental group chaired by Professor Frances Ruane estimated that an additional output of 1,000 software graduates and 750 engineering technicians is required annually to meet emerging skills shortages in this sector alone.  An extra annual intake of this magnitude would require the creation of about 7,000 new third level places.</P>
    <P>The steering committee set up to advise on the most cost effective means of providing the additional places, chaired by the Higher Education Authority, consulted widely with industry and third level colleges.  In its report, submitted in June 1997, the committee recommended that a dedicated capital provision be allocated to fund the necessary capital projects.  Last July the Government approved an immediate capital investment of £5 million for 1997.  Provision of £60 million in the technology investment fund will ensure the proposed expansion programme can proceed effectively and within the necessary time-frame. It is worth recalling that Lindsay initially proposed a £50 million fund.</P>
    <P>Skills shortages have also been emerging in activities relating to tourism and catering.  This development has become a matter of great concern to the Government, given the growing significance of tourism to the economy.  The benefits, both in terms of contribution to GNP and employment creation, have been considerable.  More than £1 billion accrues to the Exchequer each year from spending associated with tourism, while a recent survey by CERT indicates that in excess of 188,000 persons are employed in the sector.</P>
    <P>The rapidity of the growth in employment has led to skills shortages, particularly in catering areas where demand for employees far outstrips supply.  The present capacity of the education system to respond to the problem was constrained by the infrastructural inadequacies of colleges, many of which were established more than 25 years ago at a time when tourism played a much less significant role in the economy.</P>
    <P>Efforts to increase the output of qualified workers from the education system and expansion of existing facilities at various regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Tourism College in Killybegs have been ongoing, but at too modest a level to address the extent of the demand problems.  The scale of the expansion necessary to meet the growing demand requires significant capital investment.  It is for <Col N="1123" /> this reason and because of the importance of the industry in terms of employment, that I propose that an additional £20 million be set aside from the technology investment fund to support appropriate capital developments in the colleges.</P>
    <P>There is strong evidence to show that there is a direct relationship between investment in good education and training programmes and economic development.  This is particularly the case for apprenticeships and post-leaving certificate vocational training programmes.</P>
    <P>Under PESP it was agreed that the statutory apprenticeship scheme would be improved to meet in a more effective way the need for highly skilled craftspersons.  The main objective was to ensure a satisfactory balance between supply of, and the demand for, apprentices.</P>
    <P>A new apprenticeship training model has been developed comprising of four on-the-job training modules and three off-the-job training modules. The aim was to increase the number of apprentices enrolling each year in designated trades from 2,500 to 3,500.  The current level of economic prosperity has resulted in increased enrolment of apprentices beyond the 3,500 which was planned for.  However, there is still a shortfall of training places for apprentices in a number of designated trades &mdash; for example, the electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery trades.  The investment fund will cater for a real need to increase the capacity of the regional technical colleges, Dublin Institute of Technology and WIT workshops and related facilities to meet the demand for an increased number of training places for apprentices in the traditional designated trades.</P>
    <P>The training given to students on PLC programmes has enabled them to acquire relevant and marketable skills.  This has been widely commented upon by industrialists and others in the business sector.  Through the knowledge, competencies and expertise gained from these programmes, PLC graduates can contribute to economic development and meet, through their specific skills, many of the needs of modern enterprises.</P>
    <P>Capital investment is required for infrastructural developments in the PLC sector.  Many post-leaving certificate centres need to have their physical facilities upgraded and expanded to prepare their students more effectively in both traditional and developing areas of science, commerce and technology.  I propose an investment of about £20 million from the fund for the purposes of capital infrastructure in the PLC and apprenticeship areas.</P>
    <P>The addition of a network of regional technical colleges in the early 1970s was an integral part of a major reform of the education system.  Apart from constituting a response to pressures of growing third level enrolments, the creation of a network took place in the context of industrial policies which promoted the development of manufacturing industries in regions of traditionally <Col N="1124" /> high emigration.  By equipping the local population with the necessary technical skills, industry could be attracted to the region and consequent employment creation would offer graduates new opportunities at home.  In addition, the colleges would assist in supporting greater regional equality of participation in education.</P>
    <P>From the outset these colleges, including Dublin Institute of Technology, have sought to anticipate the range and level of education and training provision required by industry and sought by students.  They now provide a wide range of programmes. In the last ten years, numbers enrolled in these colleges have more than doubled, with enrolments rising from 20,000 to 45,000.  Significant capital investment is required to bring the facilities up to standard, particularly in the regional technical college sector, which will ensure their continuing relevance to the needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>About £80 million will be allocated to the technological sector from the fund, which represents a huge capital investment.  This investment will ensure that the colleges will have the capacity to contribute to the provision of skilled labour and will ensure that their facilities will be of a sufficient standard to allow them to maintain their important contribution to economic growth through education, training, research and development.</P>
    <P>I hope the institutions in the technological sector will use the opportunity the fund provides to pioneer innovative proposals for developing their infrastructure.  This should especially be the case in the area of seeking to make and secure a fund raising contribution.  The projects which will be supported under this element of the fund will take some time to consider.  It is crucial to ensure value for the taxpayers' investment when making such decisions.</P>
    <P>Given the speed of technological change, it is recognised internationally that it is essential to replace and update equipment on an ongoing basis.  Graduates and postgraduates undertaking training and research require resources relevant to the needs of industry.  Such resources are fundamental to the success of the education system's contribution to economic growth.  In the context of the emphasis on high technology skills, it is crucial that every effort is made to provide colleges with the most appropriate equipment available. In view of the importance of having leading edge technology in the colleges and having regard to the recommendation of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council &mdash; STIAC &mdash; that additional funds are required urgently, it has been decided to allocate £30 million from the technology investment fund to support a comprehensive programme of equipment renewal.</P>
    <P>It is crucial for companies to continue to improve their existing products and production methods in order to survive and prosper.  Industry <Col N="1125" /> must continually seek to develop new products to meet changing patterns of demand and the increasingly high expectations of consumers familiar with technological change.  Most companies which do not enhance existing products or develop new ones will fail to maintain their place in the competitive market.</P>
    <P>In Ireland research and development in third level institutions has been recognised as vital to the development of a pool of expertise capable of providing support to industry.  Investment in modern, state of the art technology and research facilities is critical to the creation of such a skilled pool of researchers who have the knowledge and capacity to co-operate with industry in developing new products and enhancing existing methods of production.  The availability of research and development resources will ensure that companies based in Ireland can continue to compete successfully in the global market.  In addition, by providing opportunities for post-graduate research, the education system can develop the skills of individuals which can then be brought directly into employment in industry.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £15 million from the technology investment fund will enable the provision of substantial new research facilities especially geared towards promoting the transfer of advanced technology into production.  In the 1998 Estimates, the Government has provided an additional £5 million for current spending on research and development.  Added to the capital spending in the fund, this represents an extremely significant move to promote this vital aspect of our education system.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government we committed ourselves to promoting computer literacy throughout the school system.  This objective is not based on an abstract futuristic idea of where education is going; it is informed by the essentials of educational development which have always been central to our system.  The development of an information and communications technologies infrastructure in our schools will enable their use to deliver more effectively the curriculum at all levels.</P>
    <P>It has often been overlooked by people commenting on the development of computer literacy in schools that this technology can make an immense contribution to developing basic skills in children and, in particular, numeracy, literacy and second language skills.  This has been recognised by many educationalists and I want, in particular, to acknowledge the teacher skills development programmes run by the INTO.</P>
    <P>To date Ireland has been in the third division in using technology in schools.  Last Friday I launched a major initiative to bring us into the premier league.  The Schools IT 2000 programme will ensure that within three years there are a minimum of 60,000 multi-media computers in schools and that at least 20,000 teachers will have received ICT training.  As a first element, every school will be connected to the Internet by the end of next June.  This is one of the most <Col N="1126" /> ambitious programmes in Europe and across the globe to transform primary and second level schools in terms of ICT.  This will have a major impact on Irish education and will help to place our system at the cutting edge of international innovation in education.</P>
    <P>Schools IT 2000 is a minimum £50 million package. The allocation of funding in the investment technology fund of £25 million will be the mechanism for funding its capital elements.  This year we have allocated £3 million for teacher training and for the establishment of the national centre for technology.  Up to £15 million will be allocated over three years.</P>
    <P>I have already acknowledged publicly the generous initiative by Telecom Éireann in support of information technology in our schools.  The initiative, Telecom Éireann Information Age Schools, will involve at least £10 million being spent over the next three years and is the largest ever investment in Irish schools by any body outside the Department of Education and Science. The initiative will complement Schools IT 2000. Telecom Éireann has set a powerful example for others to follow.  We will ask other public utility and private sector companies to join with us in a national drive to leave a lasting legacy to the children currently in our schools and to future generations.</P>
    <P>Section 6 outlines the consultative process which may be engaged in by my Department with other Departments.  This provision gives an indication of the extent to which an investment of this magnitude crosses departmental boundaries and responsibilities.  In the skills area in particular, consultation and monitoring is necessary if we are to keep abreast of emerging needs and react positively and quickly to meet new challenges.  For that reason arrangements are being put in place to promote dialogue between Government, business and the education institutions in relation to the education and training needs of the economy, to develop and facilitate the forecasting of skill requirements and to provide mechanisms for the speedy implementation of decisions.</P>
    <P>A widely representative business-education partnership forum, co-chaired by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and myself, will be established. An expert group will advise on future skill needs and forecasting techniques.  A high level implementation group will be established comprising the chairman of the expert group, secretaries general of appropriate Departments, the chief executive of Forfás and the chairman of the Higher Education Authority.  This group will progress recommendations and monitor progress on implementation.  This structure will ensure an ongoing commitment to monitoring and meeting the skill needs of industry and forge an important and enduring link between Government, business and education for the economic benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for private donations to the fund.  It lays down that donations may be made to the fund but that they may have conditions <Col N="1127" /> attached, provided the conditions are consistent with the purposes of the fund.  I referred earlier to the importance of private donations to third level capital development.  While they will be welcome, I am not expecting that direct donations to the fund will form the principal means for augmenting the State's investment.  Experience would indicate that direct partnerships with institutions will be more common.  The fund will provide an essential platform for institutions to attract this type of support.  I will do all I can to help them with this.  Section 8 provides for an annual report on the operation of the fund.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of this important Bill.  I have spent some time outlining to the House the areas for investment because each area is important to the development of a vibrant technological ethos within the education system which, in turn, will contribute to both the vocational needs of the students and the skill requirements of industry.  In our Programme for Government we made a specific promise to grow and improve &ldquo;access to employment through a major drive aimed at raising the skills profile of people, through education.&rdquo; With the initiatives of which this fund forms the central pillar, we will have comprehensively delivered on this promise.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by some that we should not put this amount of money into this area while other aspects of education badly need funding. However, if we want to have the money to invest in other areas of education, we cannot afford not to make an investment such as this.  If we were to lose the opportunity to grow our economy because of a failure to invest in strategic areas, everyone would suffer.  There would be less money for social services, for disadvantaged schools and to tackle serious problems like early school leaving.</P>
    <P>I and my Department are proud of this investment fund.  It is for far-sighted investments such as this that this Government will be remembered. It represents an innovative, comprehensive and historic initiative which will make a major contribution to our future.  I commend the provisions of this Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I regret I must leave the House shortly to attend a Cabinet meeting on a minor matter which is taking place today.  I apologise to Senator Jackman in particular but I will be back later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I welcome the Minister to the House and bid him farewell with the same breath, but I know we will be welcoming him back again.  In saying that, it would be mealy-mouthed of me, even though I am in Opposition, not to welcome the £250 million which he has announced for science and education <Col N="1128" /> here, including the additional private funding in section 7.</P>
      <P>One of my concerns in regard to that section is that, traditionally, private investment almost always went to the universities.  There was a certain prestige in investment in universities.  Perhaps it was the fact that one would get one's name over the door or on a plaque.  The question I must ask was not fully answered by the Minister in this speech.  If the funds are invested by private individuals or corporations in this investment fund, will there be a framework for their distribution; and what will it be?  The Bill says very little in this regard and the Minister acknowledged that.  This begs the question: what will be the criteria for the distribution of such funds?  It would be remiss of us not to mention this and I ask the Minister to give us an outline of a framework when he comes back to the House so that we will know and acknowledge that each section is being treated equitably, that each group, whether primary, secondary and tertiary levels &mdash; the regional colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology or, indeed, the universities &mdash; will receive adequate funding based on their needs and their ability to respond to those needs.</P>
      <P>One of the aspects which concerns all of us in Ireland as we ride this wonderful, striped tiger is that at some stage it will not run anymore.  That Celtic tiger, this economic boom, is based to a great degree on the fact that through great policies we have introduced companies from abroad over the years.  In the main these have been hi-tech companies from the US, particularly Boston, which have given extraordinarily good employment to our young people of a nature which is highly technical and demands highly qualified staff, not just assembly but software programming, etc.  Of course those companies were attracted to Ireland by the skill levels of our young people, but they were also attracted by the large grants and tax concessions which were available here.  We can already see that these might be eroded, if not curtailed, to such a degree in the future that we will be competing to attract and retain these firms not just with Europe but with the Far East, where labour costs are lower.  We must ensure we retain those firms.  To do that we must enhance our technical skills and produce people with greater technical knowledge.  I am delighted that Ireland's standards in this regard are to the fore, but to ensure that those standards are maintained it is up to us to see to it that adequate funding is given to all sectors in education to produce those young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators would agree that to compete in the global market it is essential that we have a vision of the role of science and technology and that we put into place strategies which would ensure the implementation of such a vision.  Recent reports reveal frightening evidence about the number of students taking science subjects at present.  This phenomena is not unique to Ireland.  It is evident in Great Britain and Northern Ireland also.  This is possibly the result of students feeling that the <Col N="1129" /> subjects are not related to them in so far as when they leave the colleges they cannot see jobs arising from them or that the introduction of science at second level is a little late.  In other words, what I am suggesting that the curriculum should be modified in such a way as to encourage science subjects at primary level so that students will not experience such a dramatic change at second level.</P>
    <P>To give some idea of the rates of change, in 1992 there were 11,000 students taking physics at second level.  In 1997 the number had dropped to nearly 9,000.  In 1992 there were 7,500 students taking chemistry and now the number has dropped to 6,997.  While the number studying biology has increased, those figures must be a matter of concern.  A programme must be put in place to ensure students at an early level can see the advantages of taking science subjects.</P>
    <P>Anybody at the launch of former Deputy Nealon's book last night would know that both Houses are blessed with the number of people who have a background in education.  It seems a substantial number of Members are either teachers or lecturers, so there are other people who will speak on their own areas.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity of discussing briefly with my colleague, Senator O'Toole, how this funding could be of assistance to the primary level and I am sure we will find out later in the debate his exact feelings about this.  When I made this suggestion to him my legs were rapidly cut from under me, but I was only putting it forward to see if it would run at all.  I suggested that many of the colleges have equipment which is out of date, does not work as quickly as more modern equipment and cannot be updated.  This equipment is often thrown out, which is a waste of technology and resources, and there must be a way of distributing that equipment into areas where use can be made of it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested that Senator O'Toole would rise to the bait on this issue.  However, what I mean is that some of this equipment can be used at other levels, and I am not just suggesting that it would be at primary or second level. There are other areas, such as that of those who are marginalised and have no access to such equipment.  It might be possible to distribute that equipment to them rather than wasting the resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the tertiary level, my area of some expertise would be in the regional colleges and, while I always try to avoid being provincial about issues like this, there are two regional colleges <Col N="1130" /> west of the River Shannon of which the Minister will be aware, Galway Regional Technical College, which has a campus at Castlebar, and Sligo Regional Technical College, which do excellent work.  Their status should be increased to institutes of technology.  The Minister would agree that there is no cost to the Department involved in such a measure but it would enhance the reputation of the colleges.  It would also make them more attractive.  One must consider the number of students who are leaving Sligo and western areas to attend other colleges which have institute of technology status.  They do so purely on the basis that when they graduate their chance of getting a job is much greater than if they had graduated from a regional technical college, even though the quality of education is probably exactly the same.  I know some of the colleges are applying for institute of technology status and I would ask the Minister that this be given to them.</P>
    <P>There has been phenomenal growth in the numbers attending regional colleges over the years.  These colleges were constructed as if from Lego sets which were bolted together and, in my experience, they are inadequate for lecturing and have inadequate library facilities, etc.  In 1985-6 there were 11,000 attending the colleges.  In 1995-6 there were 27,000, an increase of approximately 150 per cent, while the amount of investment during the same period did not keep pace with that. Therefore, during that period there was an excess number of students in classrooms which were inadequate and badly designed.</P>
    <P>For example, the building capacity of Athlone Regional Technical College was for 1,000 students but the enrolment is 2,700 students; the building capacity of Tralee Regional Technical College was for 800 students but it has 2,200 enrolled.  Funding should be directed to preventing overcrowded classrooms.  It is only through the good will of the lecturers and their union that many classes are being taken.  In 1986 the college space per student in Athlone Regional Technical College was 26.6 square metres and in 1996 it was 6.8 square metres; in Tralee Regional Technical College it was 17 square metres in 1986 and 5.4 square metres in 1996.  These are extraordinary figures.  Library facilities are extremely overcrowded &mdash; 0.46 square metres per student in Athlone Regional Technical College and 0.24 square metres in Carlow Regional Technical College. This effectively deprives students of the opportunity to study in the library because if they do go there, it is often overcrowded and they are unable to study due to noise.  I will not dwell on this matter because others will mention it also.</P>
    <P>Technology is changing the way we live, the way we work and how we learn.  Being an island is no longer as relevant as it used to be, even to those on the periphery of this island.  We have electronically shortened the distance between ourselves and our European neighbours and brought the Orient and the United States to our doorstep.  We are no longer as constrained by such factors as time, distance or location. <Col N="1131" /> However, if this is true for us it is also true for other countries who equally recognise the need for not just participation in the global economy but also the critical part played by information technology in creating jobs and job opportunities. Ireland must not lag behind this new revolution, which is as important as the agricultural revolution of prehistoric times and the more recent industrial revolution.  This revolution is gaining pace and it is critical that we keep up with it.</P>
    <P>The Bangemann report made to the European Commission in 1994 noted: &ldquo;the first countries to enter the information society will reap the greatest rewards . they will set the agenda that others must follow.&rdquo; In this regard I commend the information society steering committee's recommendation to lift the level of awareness in Irish society of ICTs, that is, information and communications technologies.  It also outlines the benefits to Irish society of this knowledge and encourages the use of ICTs in enterprise education, the public sector and in the home.</P>
    <P>It is critical that our education system produces sufficient numbers of skilled people for the growing industries in hardware, software and services. We must encourage young people to be ready to take on these jobs in the expanding teleservices, electronics and software industries.  It is expected that within the next three to four years 20,000 new jobs will be created in those areas.  One major area of growth is in telecommunications services, where it is expected that up to 10,000 new jobs will become available inside three years. However, computer skills alone will not be enough to ensure employment in those areas; a foreign language will probably be necessary also. Ireland can develop this area and while the rest of the world is asleep we can take advantage of these job opportunities.</P>
    <P>It is wonderful to note that Ireland is a European software capital &mdash; we are the fifth largest producer of software in the world and second only to the USA in exporting software.  Half of the world's top independent software houses have operations here.  Given these facts it is critical that a programme is put into place to alert the young people of Ireland to those opportunities and to ensure that the skills they develop will be aimed in those directions.</P>
    <P>One fact of great concern to everybody involved in education is the downward trend in the numbers of students taking science subjects, a phenomenon to be found everywhere.  I am not sure how this can be redressed unless career guidance counsellors point out the opportunities to students at an early stage.  In my schooldays we learnt Latin and Greek but anyone taking those subjects now would be regarded as either a fruitcake or an intellectual and it is possible that science subjects could go the same way.  It was once thought in the US that anyone studying computer technology was what is termed a &ldquo;geek&rdquo;&mdash; I do not know the exact meaning of that word but it implies that one wears glasses, can only speak in <Col N="1132" /> technological language, does not go out on dates or talk to anyone of the opposite sex.  However, these attitudes are changing and people studying IT are now seen to have the ability to talk to girls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the opportunity of discussing this with him and his views are as clear cut as those of Senator O'Toole.</P>
      <P>It behoves everyone in both Houses to ensure a return from an investment of this substantial nature, although one cannot be certain about such a return until the employment figures are available.  Dr. Ian Hughes, a physics lecturer in Queen's University, Belfast, wrote an article in <i>The Irish Scientist Year Book</i> for 1997 which is worthy of discussion in this House as it concerns how one measures a return on investment and ensuring research is done.  Dr. Hughes states:</P>
      <P>All sides in the current debate on science and technology policy in the Republic of Ireland identify encouraging innovation as a central concern.  The Irish Research Scientists' Association identifies a lack of government funding for university research as the main barrier to increased innovation.  Recent experience in UK universities however suggests that investment in people, rather than investment in research, should be the central issue.  [It is extraordinary how views have changed on this matter.  ] The stark contrast in both the level of government funding of university research, and of the infrastructure in place to manage research in the UK and Ireland, is well known. Seven UK research councils, responsible for everything from particle physics to medicine, disburse around £1.4 billion in research grants annually.  In comparison, Forbairt's total research budget is £1.5 million.  Put another way, the total research funding for all university Physics departments in the Republic of Ireland is only around 12 per cent of the research funding for the Department of Physics in Queen's University alone.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, grants from the UK Research Councils make up only one third of the total research funding to higher education within the UK.  Funding from the European Union and charities such as the Wellcome Trust make an equal contribution, as does grants funding from industry and the public sector.  With around £4.5 billion in research funding available to universities within the UK annually, academics in the North are clearly better off financially than their colleagues in the Republic.</P>
      <P>I will give this article to the Minister as it is worth perusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also of great concern to anyone involved in education are those people who are marginalised by information technology, to whom it is the same as quantum physics.  It bears no relationship <Col N="1133" /> to them and, unfortunately, they will not get an opportunity to avail of it.  The Minister spoke about the lack of skills in tourism; I know of one company which established itself in an area of high unemployment and decided to work with CERT to employ local people and give them the skills to work in the industry.  Over 50 people began the course but only ten people are still on it, the other 40 having dropped out.  It is extraordinary to have a drop out rate of 80 per cent. We should examine why these people are marginalised and how information technology can help them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Dr. Thornhill from the Department of Education on his new position on the HEA.  I commend him on his great work in modernising the Department.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants these funds to be used adequately it must be based on mutual trust.  Such trust will be difficult to find if he does not adhere to agreements.  I am referring to the delay in payments to teachers at TUI level: the agreement under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work is not being adhered to.  If the Minister wishes to guarantee the co-operation of teachers at that level he must ensure the agreements which are already in place are adhered to and maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was very informative &mdash; I feel I have nothing to add as he covered so much ground.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his new portfolio.  I congratulate the Minister for Education on his very fine initiative to create this new fund which will address the future needs of our education system.  It will develop a technological emphasis in our system and give students skills which will prepare them to fit into the industrial world.</P>
      <P>The fund is a framework for financing the development of scientific and technological education. For a long time we were slow to recognise the importance of science and technology and their role in society.  We emphasised literary and artistic success while undervaluing the talents of our scientists and technologists.  I am glad the Minister is addressing this imbalance.  If we are to reach our full capacity we must make our education system more rounded and take every opportunity to appreciate the role played by science and technology in national development.</P>
      <P>As we move towards the next millennium we must ensure there is a firm skills base for scientists and technologists.  We are facing major challenges in our education system with a constantly changing curriculum and new modules at primary and secondary level.  We must bear that in mind when addressing the skills needs of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government decision will keep Ireland at the forefront of job creation in an increasingly competitive market place.  This investment will <Col N="1134" /> protect and promote job creation in international companies also.  It will modernise our society, give us access to employment and raise our skills profile.  It will also produce high quality graduates, which is the essence of the matter.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on putting this fund on a statutory footing, which will allow for greater certainty in future planning in this area.  I welcome the fact that the money will be managed by a national management agency and that donations will come from non-Government sources also.  This money will be in addition to the annual capital allocation and will not replace ongoing investment.</P>
    <P>As the previous speaker said, it is necessary to promote consultation between the Government, business and the education system so that we know the skill needs at any given time.  We must create a partnership which will develop strategies for national manpower forecasting and prioritise areas for the allocation of money, subject to evaluation processes.  I welcome this new forum, which will examine how such decisions are implemented and will ensure we get value for money.  I am glad it will have representatives from the education field, trade unions, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Higher Education Authority and many other agencies.</P>
    <P>We must identify the skill needs of each sector, forecast future trends, advise on the promotion of education and continuous training and improve awareness among job seekers of where they are likely to find jobs and how to acquire the necessary qualifications.  We must promote a partnership between the business world and the education and training sector to ensure we are working in harmony rather than in isolation, as happened in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to seven broad areas to which this funding will be allocated.  He said that £60 million will be allocated to computer software.  This will create additional places in technical colleges and universities and will ensure third level institutions have the necessary buildings and equipment to offer world class courses. This is welcome, because the problem with the third level points system is one of supply and demand &mdash; young people would be under less pressure to obtain high points if there were more college places.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also allocated £21 million to the hotel and tourism industry.  Ireland has lagged behind many other European countries in terms of catering training and the lack of proper infrastructure in our hotels.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government the Minister clearly stated his concern for post leaving certificate courses and the apprenticeship sector.  He announced a major investment of £21 million in telesales training in the PLC sector.  There is a huge shortage of apprenticeships in a number of areas such as electrical work, carpentry, plumbing and joinery.  We all know how difficult it is to get a plumber.  We should consider developing a <Col N="1135" /> training school for apprentices.  This would ensure there were always people available to deal with the emergencies which occur in everyone's life. This investment fund will cater for the need to increase the capacity of the regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and related colleges to meet the increasing demand for apprenticeship training places.</P>
    <P>The teleservices courses, which are a national initiative, provide training skills in that industry. There will be huge job creation in that area over the next three years.  It is forecast that telesales jobs will increase from the current level of 400 jobs to 10,000 jobs in three years time.  I welcome the emphasis on this area.  These courses are aimed at school leavers and those preparing to return to work.  The key element will be an overseas placement of six months in which students will be given job training and work experience in their chosen language.  This is a new departure for the PLC sector and a new student support scheme is being introduced.  It will promote fluency in European languages and information technology skills and an understanding of foreign cultures.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that the quality of our third level graduates, whether from regional technical colleges or universities, is protected and promoted. The investment fund will help to transform the technological aspects of our education system.  It will ensure that our third level institutions have the buildings and equipment necessary to offer first class courses across a full range of disciplines.  This can be done through improvements in the certificate, diploma and degree courses.  I welcome the investment of £80 million for this sector.  I also welcome the provision of another £30 million for a major renewal programme.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the necessity for research and development.  It makes a major contribution to the economic and social development of society, including our increasingly successful industrial performance.  It is important that universities and regional colleges develop a strategic policy on research so that institutions can take an active part in identifying research needs and encouraging staff to address them.  The aim of such a strategy is not to hurt the freedom of academic research, but to enhance it by providing a framework broader than that imposed by purely commercial considerations.  I welcome the allocation of £15 million to meet the capital needs in promoting research in technology development.</P>
    <P>There is a need to update equipment in our  colleges and to improve the tiny allowance paid to postgraduate research workers.  The quality of postgraduate research compares favourably with the best available in other countries and many of our postgraduates are the brightest and best of our young people.  We must encourage them to stay in Ireland so that we can make use of their abilities for the good of the country.  The Minister needs to look at this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> The technology needs of schools are to be addressed, where many are bewildered by accelerating advances.  I welcome this.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment that every schoolchild will be given the opportunity to develop computer literacy and numeracy. I welcome the decision by the Minister to provide primary and secondary schools with over 60,000 multimedia computers over the next three years as part of a drive to bring the education system into the information age.  A start has already been made.  The recent commitment of £10 million by Telecom Éireann, which will ensure that every school is connected to the Internet within the next two years, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Given the changes to the curricula and the shift in emphasis towards technological subjects, it is necessary to look at the structures within primary and second level schooling.  Hitherto, computer skills have been taught in isolation.  I therefore welcome the necessity for an integrated approach.  Computers should be used in the teaching of every subject, including mathematics, art and history.  They should be used as part of the education system and not as a separate skill.</P>
    <P>We need to demystify information technology. It is a matter of concern that many teachers have no knowledge of computers.  They come from different backgrounds in terms of in-service courses and are ill at ease in dealing with computer equipment.  Imparting competence to teachers in this area is an important module of investment in our education system.</P>
    <P>Information technology in secondary schools has not been able to provide the range of practical subjects available to vocational schools.  While vocational schools have become knowledgeable about the use of computers, including utilising them for keeping school records and compiling timetables, many secondary schools are deficient in that regard.  I welcome the intention to ensure that they become more familiar with the use of computers.  It will ease administrative and managerial work.</P>
    <P>Several computer technology programmes will now be made available at junior certificate and leaving certificate vocational and applied levels. The leaving certificate applied programme has become technology oriented.  Given these developments, those providing in-service courses for teachers should tutor them in information technology. As a teacher who is anything but computer literate, I have attended these courses and have found them stressful, primarily because the tutors do not have the necessary communicative skills in information technology.  They provide training in isolation and have failed to introduce an integrated approach.  Future in-service courses should not take place over two or three days, but over a week.  They should also ensure that teachers in the classroom can call on expert advice as they need it.</P>
    <P>Given that children will be involved in information technology, it will be bound to break down in the classroom on occasion.  Lack of confidence <Col N="1137" /> by teachers in using the system and the need for repair work must be addressed to ensure that prescribed syllabi are adhered to.  It is important to ensure that competent personnel will be within easy reach.</P>
    <P>I hope the forum will address the evaluation, prioritisation and allocation of resources to ensure best value for money.  It is a historic day that we are able to put this funding on a statutory basis and that we can plan the future of technology within our schools.  It is especially welcome that this process will include primary schools as it means that pupils will not have to wait until second level to become involved in information technology.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this historic initiative.  I wish him well with the programme.  I call on the Department of Education and Science to take note of my points on how it can be administered in primary and secondary schools to ensure that we will all benefit from this huge investment.  This is an historic day for our new education system in this technological era which will bring it forward into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year when addressing this issue I pointed out that for literacy policies to be serious children leaving primary schools should be as adept with the keyboard as with any other equipment.  The keyboard should be as familiar to them as a book because computer literacy is as important as any other literacy.  In making presentations to Departments and to the technology commission I made the point that every primary school child should have an e-mail address by the turn of the century and that every primary school should have its own website.  This would make communication easier and the website would take the place of school magazines. These suggestions were greeted with a certain amount of doubt as to whether they could happen. I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the work done. This is a significant and progressive step which can only be for the good of education.  Now that the money has been put in place we must ensure that it is spent properly.</P>
      <P>We should begin by examining ourselves.  It is important the Members of the Oireachtas are positively disposed towards information and communications technology.  I addressed a group of employers and I told them that I do not allow people who work with me to have the &ldquo;I know nothing about those computer things&rdquo; attitude.  If they feel they know nothing about them they should be looking for early retirement.  It is like wanting to use a quill instead of a pen.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  It is looking backward, not forward.  It is harking back to the past, to what people consider the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; when they walked barefoot to school.  We are in a new age and must deal with new technology and this <Col N="1138" /> entails training the next generation to use the technology.  We must also ensure that Members of the Oireachtas will also use the technology.</P>
      <P>I appreciate this legislative development but much more is needed.  A high level of resources is needed at primary school level if we want to put two or three computers into the 20,000 or so classrooms and equip them with the Internet connection. At an average cost of about £2,000 per classroom an investment of about £40 million would be required to install the hardware alone. In addition, another 10 per cent approximately would be needed for new equipment and maintenance on an annual basis.  That gives an idea of the scale involved.</P>
      <P>Parallel developments should take place hand in hand with this legislative proposal.  Information and communications technology equipment should be zero rated for VAT.  The Minister should consider this suggestion closely because it is disgraceful that people who are equipping educational institutions must also pay VAT.  At primary level the schools carry out fund raising for equipment, running everything from poker classics to selling rice crispie buns and it is a little rich for them to have to sell another 20 per cent of rice crispie buns to pay the VAT.</P>
      <P>IBEC must also take a lead in this regard, something it has not done to date.  It is taking a back seat and leaving the State to do all the running. IBEC needs to do more, a point I have made to it.  It is important that we show our appreciation of Telecom Éireann's investment of £10 million in the education system.  It is a huge investment which it was not obliged to make and it has not been duly thanked for having made it. The INTO has been in contact with Telecom Éireann on this issue for over two years and we think this is a big step forward.  Other companies, such as Compustore and IBM, have also take initiatives in the primary sector but much more needs to be done.  The majority of industry is not rushing to follow the lead given by Telecom Éireann in particular.  Industry will benefit from this development.  It is a valid research and development investment for companies.  It is wrong to think this is a matter for the communications and technology companies alone.  It is relevant to all companies because such investment will bear fruit for all industries.  We need to be sure that all industrial sectors are involved.</P>
      <P>In addition to seeking zero VAT rating for educational technology equipment being installed in schools, I also seek a provision in the Finance Bill to allow industry to invest in educational technology in a tax efficient manner.  Companies should be able to claim a tax break on the capital investment involved.  Such an incentive would be good for the country because it would be an investment in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not question Senator Coogan's commitment to the ideas he advanced.  My point about third level involvement is not a knee-jerk reaction. I am aware that the Department of Education and Science has established close relationships <Col N="1139" /> with a US company called Techcorp which recycles computer equipment mainly from third level institutions into other areas of education.  It sounds like a good idea but most technology used in industry or in third level education is in dedicated applications, either as spreadsheets or word processors.  The equipment used in primary schools must be state of the art because it must facilitate creative work &mdash; it will be used as much in the art class as in the science class, as much in languages as in publications.  The equipment must be state of the art and flexible.  It would make more sense for primary schools to send their cast off equipment to other places requiring confined applications.</P>
    <P>In the past a number of companies have, with good intentions, sent old computers to local schools.  However, the local schools do not know what to do with them. Senator Ormonde raised the issue of teacher training.  Lessons must be learned from what happened in the US and the UK when they went through this phase of development.  In those countries computers were sent to schools from warehouses and there was no parallel training for the teachers who were to use the computers. Many of those computers are still sitting in their boxes unused because the teachers have not the confidence or the competence to integrate them into the curriculum.  The Schools IT 2000 scheme which is part of the initiative announced by the Minister recognises the importance of training. The Department has earmarked a substantial sum of money for teacher training.</P>
    <P>A number of agencies and commercial interests have come out of the woodwork offering to deliver training yet they have no background in the field.  In the US and the UK, education technology courses were delivered by technologists or third level people talking down to primary and post primary teachers.  It did not work because teachers were offered skills based training which had no basis or relevance in a practical classroom setting.  We do not need that.  We only need to be able to drive the car, not to know how the engine works.  One does not need to lift the bonnet to be a great driver.  Similarly, teachers do not need technologists or experts in the third level area talking down to them.</P>
    <P>We need the involvement of such experts and academics because they have much to contribute. However, the training and education of teachers in the use of information and communications technology should take place contemporaneously with the installation of computer hardware equipment in schools.  I ask the Minister to recall this point at every opportunity.  As I put it to teacher groups, if technology is put into schools and children are showing teachers how to use it rather than the other way round during the first week, we have failed.  It means the teacher has not developed the necessary confidence.  The difference between the younger and older generations is that the younger generation will press a button <Col N="1140" /> on a computer to see what happens, but the older generation wonders what would happen if they pressed it.  This gap must be bridged and it can only be done through training and by giving people confidence and competence.</P>
    <P>Over the last two and a half years the INTO has identified a countrywide network of experienced teachers who use technology in their classrooms every day to enhance their teaching and make the curriculum come to life for their pupils.  This happens in small one and two teacher schools in the Acting Chairman's county as much as in large urban schools.  It is not an urban based phenomenon.  I was greatly pleased recently to walk into an INTO training course and find the principal of a small two teacher school in the west sitting like a 12 year old in Biblical times, surrounded by teachers and principals from some of the largest schools in the country, and explaining how they might use technology in a cross curricular manner.</P>
    <P>The talent bank of people put together by the INTO is willing and able to share their knowledge and expertise with colleagues if they are given the resources and flexibility to do so.  The INTO has discussed this matter with the Minister and officials from the Department, who are very open and supportive of that approach.  Many things are happening in this area.  The INTO proposes to implement its plan through magnet schools for information and communications technology.  It has launched an initiative where schools, which are at the cutting edge of this area, will join a scheme.  They will be identified as models of good practice and teachers from other schools will be able to visit them.  They will be part of the training of trainers.  Teachers will teach teachers.  The INTO is laying out criteria for such schools and is hoping to achieve a specific status.  We are confident that we will get the necessary resources either from the private sector or the Department's initiative.  We are in discussion with both on this matter.  The INTO is now the largest provider of in service education for teachers.  We have learned that the most efficient way to train teachers is to have teachers teaching teachers.  It works well.</P>
    <P>Technology will be put into schools and a design team of teachers who are specialists in this area must be involved.  They can outline what they have learned and what teachers will need. They can design a course which can be run for a small number of people on a pilot basis over a week.  It can then be tweaked and modified to produce a course which can be made available. Teachers will be convinced of the potential of using information technology in their classrooms if they have seen and heard it in action in a classroom in a neighbouring school.  Teachers are extraordinarily practical and, particularly at primary level, open.  They are willing to adapt as long as they are convinced that the change will help their work, make the job more efficient and enhance the learning and teaching experience. <Col N="1141" /> This means that whatever is provided must be up to date.</P>
    <P>People have asked how the project can progress. One proposal is that the information must be updated daily.  For example, a teacher on Inisturk is teaching maths to third class.  He or she wants to know what developments have taken place in this area and what he or she could use in their class that day.  The teacher clicks into a website which is updated daily and finds primary education in the menu and third class maths in the submenu.  He or she can then find whatever they want to do in their class that day, such as division.  They can locate information provided by other teachers in Achill or Tallaght or even outside Ireland.  This is what living technology means and how it will work.  It is not remote or distant but central to the entire education process.</P>
    <P>This will require further investment and the INTO considers that a virtual school involving teachers without pupils would be needed to update such a website daily.  These teachers would gather together the new and best practices in these areas and put them on the web daily so that they are available to teachers in classrooms. They could work on a cross, inter or extra curricular basis.  This is the future and it is not difficult to assemble.  Everything is now in place to do it.</P>
    <P>I was delighted Senator Ormonde raised a point which I was hesitant to mention because it might appear petty and small.  Funding must be built into budgets for maintenance and upgrading due to obsoletism or breakdown of equipment. Funds must be allocated for on site technical support. I thought Senator Coogan might have stressed the point earlier about the need to have technologists in addition to practitioners. Teachers can only use the equipment, not fix it.</P>
    <P>In the same way as one needs ready access to a mechanic to look after one's car, we need ready access to technicians to ensure that products which are not working are fixed or replaced quickly.  There must be a fleet of dedicated technicians who can repair machines on site or, alternatively, offer replacement machines if they must remove equipment from the school.  The planning must be in that detail.  I appreciate that Senator Ormonde, as a teacher, immediately identified that aspect.  I have removed the backs of computers and tried to fix them, but my record is abominable.  I have tried three computers in recent years because I thought I knew how to fix them.  Such technical support is required.</P>
    <P>Every school should also have at least one multimedia laptop computer.  This would allow teachers to take them home and work on them. My life is centred on my laptop machine.  Everything I say and do is contained in it.  There should be one such machine available for every ten teachers so that people can, for example, do preparation work.  We should also consider how to get more movement in this area.  People involved in technology and teachers who have done training <Col N="1142" /> courses should be able to buy computers at a reduced price.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a final appeal.  Schools throughout the country have made major efforts in this area during the past ten to 15 years, as has the Computer Education Society of Ireland.  School communities have spent many years raising funds to put computers in our classrooms.  Teachers have attended computer courses at their own expense or endeavoured to learn about computers in their own time.  Those schools which, without resources or support, have shown the lead in this area should not lose out.  There should not be a computer count in those schools which have pulled themselves up by their bootlaces. Any further equipment or assistance they receive should be treated as additional and they should not lose out.  I seek the support of Members on the other side of the House in that regard.  The schools to which I refer deserve to be complimented and given further resources.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy that only 10 per cent of money allocated in the budget will be earmarked for schools.  The primary sector will be fortunate to receive 50 per cent of that allocation.  However, I have enough experience to recognise progress.  I compliment Senator Coogan on the open, receptive and welcoming way he greeted the Bill.  The Senator's action is a sign that Members will respond to legislation on its merits.  I am sure that any criticisms I made are marginal.  I could have said much more but this is not the time to be critical. As Senator Coogan stated, it is time to see how this issue can be progressed.  I congratulate the Minister and his officials, who have worked hard in this area, for bringing forward the Bill.  I look forward to working with those officials and the private sector to make this initiative a success.</P>

      <P>This is a landmark occasion for Irish education.  It is on a par with other red letter days, such as the one on which Donogh O'Malley announced the provision of free education and, by so doing, changed the life prospects of thousands of young people.  It is also reminiscent of the day the scheme of grants for third level education was put in place.  These measures enabled young people to realise their full potential and to be treated fairly within the education system.  I regard today as a day of equal and fundamental importance.  Judging from the tone and tenor of previous contributions, today has been greeted with excitement and optimism on all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Education and Science is not present to receive my warm congratulations for introducing the Bill.  It is a source of pride for Members that he chose to introduce this fundamentally important legislation, which has farreaching consequences, in this House.  This is the first Bill he has introduced and it marks him as someone who is innovative, has a progressive view of education and is prepared to make the role and function of education in society &mdash; which is more important than sterile debate on <Col N="1143" /> ownership and control of education structures &mdash; of paramount importance.  What matters at the end of the day is how and what we teach our young people at this stage in their personal development and in the development of this country.</P>
    <P>I warmly congratulate the Minister because, under his stewardship, we are entering an important phase in the development of Irish education. I commend him, the Minister of State and the officials of the Department who, I do not doubt, had a major input in drafting the legislation. This is a day of optimism for everyone who cares about education and young people.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish in law the Scientific and Technological (Investment) Fund.  As stated earlier, on the face of it this appears to be a simple Bill dealing with a single issue.  It may be simple in that respect but it is not in any other.  The intent of the Bill is praiseworthy and its effects will be entirely beneficial to young people and society in general.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am pleased to contribute to the debate.  It is critically important that all our young people should be enabled to become the masters, not the victims, of technological education. When I say &ldquo;all our young people&rdquo; I mean precisely that and I may return to this issue later.</P>
    <P>It is important that young people come to terms with technological education for a number of reasons, not merely in respect of mastering the skills envisaged in the Bill &mdash; these will be the skills of survival in the next century &mdash; but because of the sense of personal development and self-confidence they will obtain by being exposed in this very practical way to the world of information technology from their earliest days in primary school.  This will have an enormous effect in boosting young people's self-confidence and their capacity to master technology.  Unlike many older people, they will not feel sidelined.  From the outset, young people will be aware that the technology exists for their use and benefit.  They will be so well versed in the use and principles of this technology that the development of their minds will take place on a par with that of the technology itself.</P>
    <P>We seem to be caught in a headlong rush of technological development and heaven knows where it will lead.  One of my great regrets is that I am not yet convinced I will be able to return in another guise to see what our schools and country will be like in the year 2020.</P>

      <P>I would be happy to return as a fly on the wall to see how schools will support themselves. I began my education in the era of &ldquo;talk and chalk&rdquo; and spent a number of years administering that meagre principle in a number of schools.  I would love to return in 30 years to see <Col N="1144" /> what the classrooms will be like, but I have not succeeded in negotiating a deal in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is critically important that our education system receive this transfusion if Ireland is to compete successfully with other countries.  As Senator O'Toole stated, it is vital that young people would master the skills necessary and develop an aptitude and sense of ease with computers and technology.  This will enable them to develop with and relate to technology.</P>
      <P>During my time in the Lower House I never ceased to be appalled by the fact that there was a serious shortage of skills among Irish people.  It was obscene, in places with high unemployment such as the city I represent, to see so many young people desperately seeking employment who, because of their lack of skills, were not in a position to apply for jobs as they became available. It pained me that, with the improvements in the science of forecasting matters such as these, we were not able to predict more accurately where the job opportunities for young people would be and have these skills made available to young people so that they could compete successfully for the jobs.  I hope the measure initiated here today will rectify that problem.  One is tempted to ask whether teachers were teaching young people everything except what they really needed to know.  The Bill, which attempts to address this phenomenon in a practical way, must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Recently I read a statement by Professor Allen, the Director of the new Institute of Technology Management in UCD, in which he said that all the technology in the world is of no benefit at the end of the day if we do not know how to manage it.  He also said, &ldquo;If we do not know how to manage it properly, it is not going to pay off for us at the end of the day.&rdquo; The skills of technology management are a logical follow-on from that envisaged in this Bill and I ask the Minister to make these skills available in all third level institutions. This is big business in the Far East and in countries with which we will be competing in the next ten to 20 years.  We should be leaders in the field and not be left behind by the Malasians and others who are making advanced technology management skills part of their education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of fundamental importance to ensure that the provision of equipment envisaged in this Bill in first, second and third level schools is matched with suitable in-service training for teachers.  It is important to invest in training teachers both in the skills of using this equipment and in their attitude and openness to the possibilities of such equipment.  Despite the sterling efforts of the INTO outlined here by Senator O'Toole, we do not have a strong tradition of in-service training for teachers.  We make a very scant investment in such training.  For too long we relied on, and got away with, a good system of training for teachers at primary level and not quite so good a system at second level.  Teachers were given initial training only at the age of 21 which had to last until they retired at 65.  There is a very shortsighted <Col N="1145" /> approach to investment in the workforce, schools and colleges which has to end because the key to our success is the provision of adequate and ongoing in-service training for teachers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the input of industry to this fund, part of which will be topped up by donations from private sources.  Initially I presume the private sources will be industries that stand to benefit most from the introduction and perfection of this type of education.  That is welcome because up to now it has not been a feature of Irish industry to provide proper in-service training for their workforce.  This is a feature of some of the new industries now locating in Ireland, particularly American industries.  They provide ongoing on-the-job training for their workforce. That is the key to a well motivated and highly skilled workforce.  I recall debating in the other House an Apprenticeship Bill which the then Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Rourke, introduced. We had a comprehensive debate on the scarcity of apprenticeships in crafts and trades and the attitude of the construction industry which had turned its back on investment in apprenticeship training.  At that time employers failed to invest in young people.  These same employers today pay outrageous money to brick-layers and other tradesmen who can set their own wages.  That has come about because the construction industry lost the good and caring habit of training young apprentices and passing on their skills.  That was a shortsighted attitude.  I hope that when this Bill is propagated and held up to industry, it will prompt them to make a more definite input into on-the-job training for their workforce so that we can cultivate the culture of ongoing learning.  If young people wish to advance in their jobs, they must be prepared to take on further and ongoing training.  That is the era in which we now live.  Young people will only be encouraged to adopt that attitude if they see it being practised and propagated by the captains of industry and commerce.  This Bill throws down the gauntlet and offers a challenge to industry to make an input into technological on-the-job training.</P>
    <P>This Bill envisages a three year programme.  It is an important programme which should be monitored carefully on an annual basis.  The expending of moneys must be monitored and the programmes evaluated for their relevance and success with young people.  There should be a rigorous programme of evaluation on an ongoing and regular basis to ensure the programme meets its objectives on time.  I see this as the first step along a very long road.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this programme is complete in three years' time, its success will have been such that we would at that stage embark on a second phase.  We will not have any option but to do so, as technology by its very nature will run ahead of us and we will, at that stage, be convinced of this programme's success.  I had hoped that the Minister would tell us who the unspecified donors were; I wanted to know who were the <Col N="1146" /> brave and patriotic people who would contribute to this investment fund.  Perhaps he will reveal their identity in his closing speech.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a huge milestone in the development of Irish education.  I am absolutely thrilled at its introduction and I warmly congratulate the Minister.  Having got this Bill off the ground, I hope he will see it as a lever which will enable him to double back and look at those young people who, as matters stand, are not in a position to benefit from this programme.  I refer to early school leavers and young people who leave school without being literate in the traditional sense of the word.  These young people are being cast out from our education system and have little to look forward to but a lifetime of petty crime and drug abuse.  There are hundreds of thousands of such young people in this country today.  While I commend the Minister on this Bill, his next priority should be to tackle the problem of these young people.  In the system of natural justice, they have as much right to share in the benefits of a good education system as the young people for whom we are making particular provision here today.  The Minister is correct in saying it is through the wealth generated by industry and so on that we will be able to put proper remedial programmes in place for the young people who are getting nothing from the £1.4 billion we make in education.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that Mr. Donogh O'Malley, whose motto was that every child should be given a chance, lit up my youth with his educational innovations. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, introduced his first Bill in this House today and I humbly offer him Donogh O'Malley's motto for the duration of his term of office, which I hope will be a long one and which I know will be a good one.  The Minister's motto must be to give every child in this country a chance and he must do that in the context of proper educational provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement on the £250 million technology investment fund.  In his speech he said his first priority was to bring groups who had previously been excluded into the benefits of education. Having been involved in education throughout my entire adult working life, it would be churlish of me to criticise the fact that this measure is only being introduced at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the people who have initiated educational innovations throughout the past decades with little or no assistance from the Department of Education.  In my own school, which is an inner city one, advances in information technology have been made over the past ten years using finance from the trustees of the Presentation Order, who foresaw the necessity to meet the needs of children of the eighties and nineties. They prioritised information technology by providing computer lessons for all students.  Even prior to the introduction of transition year, those students were as equipped for the technological <Col N="1147" /> age as the Bill before us suggests they should be. I do not want people to get the impression that no Irish students are computer literate; 38 per cent of second level schools are connected to the Internet and have access to E-mail.  That is not a bad figure, but it does suggest that quite a lot remains to be done.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a milestone for those who felt excluded in the past, not so much because of the amount of investment involved but because it marks a move away from the highly academic nature of our Irish education system, which for so long separated those who went on to third level education from those who did not.  The latter group possibly obtained a pass or honours standard leaving certificate and went straight into the workforce.  Others went to regional technical colleges and, more recently, some did post-leaving certificate courses.  Regional technical colleges and post-leaving certificate courses and colleges have always been viewed as cinderellas in comparison with the universities.  Today, we are acknowledging that there is another side to the Irish education system.  The people targeted by the Bill will be highly motivated and skilled and it will hopefully afford them the status they deserve.</P>
    <P>In relation to funding, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the University of Limerick, formerly the National Institute of Higher Education, under the leadership of Dr. Edward Walsh, moved into the technological age at an earlier stage than other universities, which took far longer to see the potential and need for a highly skilled workforce at graduate level.  Statistics show that such graduates are highly employable.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the funding sourced by Dr. Walsh did not come from the business sectors from which it is envisaged funding will come under this Bill.  He sourced his funding from American companies and other bodies who could see the value of what he was trying to do.  Dr. Walsh spends most of his time in America and during conferring ceremonies he always makes the point that the University of Limerick would not be where it is if it were dependent on the largesse of the Department of Education and the business community within the 26 counties.</P>

      <P>If one were to visit the University of Limerick, one would see a highly advanced technological university which is meeting the needs of the 21st century not only in these scientific areas but also, of late, in the area of humanities. My former friend from UCC, Dr. Mortell, learned quite a lot from Dr. Walsh and the University of Limerick as to how he should proceed. The NUI universities used the University of Limerick as a prototype fro their own development <Col N="1148" /> and Dr. Walsh certainly laid down a technological yardstick for Irish third level institutions.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the need to develop our education system so that it keeps pace with an ever changing world.  We can presume that many children will receive computer-based toys for Christmas.  Quite a number of toddlers are already familiar with computers.  In the past that kind of education did not continue when children went to school and any knowledge they had was learned at home.  In the past there was no technology in the school and their familiarity with it was generated at home.  I am glad the primary sector will now be able to avail of the benefits of the finances provided for in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Until I became a Senator I was on the board of governors of the Limerick Regional Technical College.  The advances within that college coincided with the improvement of the plant.  It is now a magnificent building with every facility imaginable.  It has a particularly wonderful area devoted to computers.  The building work taking place in the college in recent times is unbelievable. When such a college is improved the demand for places is boosted immeasurably.  I am glad Limerick Regional Technical College is doing so well and improving its links with the University of Limerick.  There should have been such links in the past to provide a career path from the regional technical college to the university if the students so wish.</P>
      <P>With regard to early school leavers, the school where I taught was aware that if students could be kept in school to complete the applied leaving certificate, they might be encouraged to stay for the next educational stage, the post-leaving certificate college.  I use the example of that school because it is a microcosm of what is taking place generally.  Such students were able to continue their education and do well in the leaving certificate applied course, which contains a large element of information technology and computer literacy.  Those students would have carried out their project work on computers.  They were thus able to move to a higher level of information technology through the post-leaving certificate course, which is available within the school campus. They could choose between high tech or quality child care courses.  When we discuss skills shortages it is worth remembering there is a skills shortage in the latter area also.  It is not referred to in the Bill but it is worth mentioning.</P>
      <P>Schools are now aware that education can be linked with job opportunities and that such a link need not necessarily mean that education is no longer as pure as it was in the past.  It is a question of marrying the broad concepts of education with gearing students towards employability, without making jobs the only end product of second level education.  Education can also be blended quite well with leaving certificate applied courses and post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is taking a partnership approach whereby the business sector, representatives of the IDA and representatives of the <Col N="1149" /> major technological companies will meet the heads of universities and colleges of technology. That is the way forward and we have been seeking such partnership in education for some time. It is interesting to note that since the board of governors of Limerick Regional Technical College was reconstituted, representatives from business, farming organisations and other industries have made a major contribution to the policy of that college.  In addition, the liaison officer employed by the college to liaise between business and education has had enormous experience in the business sector.  Such a policy must be the way forward.  The National Technological Park in the University of Limerick has emerged as a result of combining education with the high tech skills required by graduates for employment in that park.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Forfás document &ldquo;Where the Jobs Are and How to Get Them&rdquo;.  There will be many job opportunities in new teleservices, electronics and software businesses.  Second level students will be aware, through their career guidance counsellors, of those opportunities and they will be directed to those areas.  Only in the electronics area does the document make a reference to the fact that applications are particularly welcome from female candidates.  We are inclined to think that positive action is no longer necessary to direct girls towards non-traditional jobs, but it is as necessary now as it was ten years ago.  A student of the year from a Limerick college under the vocational education committee system who is female is just one of two females in the University of Limerick undertaking a course in teacher education in engineering.  If there are no women teaching engineering, there will be no role models and it will be hard to encourage women into non-traditional industries.  Even in the University of Limerick the number of women in non-traditional courses is still low.  The Minister should have made an effort to mention that fact, because jobs are no longer available in traditional employment sectors for women.  Positive action is still necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister said £25 million will be invested in the Schools IT 2000 programme, while Senator Quill repeatedly referred to the need for in-service training for teachers.  There are 15,250 teachers in the ASTI, of which I am still a member, and they teach 80 per cent of second level students.  Teacher training is essential for all teachers because information technology can be used to teach geography, English, history and other subjects.  Although information technology is mainly relevant to the scientific sector, particularly in this Bill, it is important to remember that it can be applied throughout the curriculum.  If it is confined to the scientific sector, it will not be part of the vibrant education policy which must be applied to the humanities.</P>
    <P>In-service training for all teachers is essential, but unless there are paid substitute teachers for teachers taking part in in-service training it will not be viable.  This is a sore issue in post-primary <Col N="1150" /> schools.  Teachers cannot simply close schools to participate in in-service training.  It would also be unfair to select some teachers for such training and exclude others.  They, too, need that training. Where will the finance come from to provide substitute teachers in schools such as mine which has 660 students?  How will in-service courses be organised?</P>
    <P>There is a major challenge ahead.  An international survey carried out by International Data Corporation in 1996 found that Ireland was in the third division in terms of being prepared for the information technology age and ranked 23rd of the 26 countries surveyed.  I hope the Minister realises the nature of this challenge.  He can be assured of our co-operation in meeting it. However, it is not simply a question of finance but a question of commitment to ensuring that everybody, teachers and students, avails of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who was a classmate and is a fellow Galwegian.  I compliment the Minister for Education and Science on this terrific initiative. Only positive results can emerge from this legislation.</P>
      <P>Our education system has made a major contribution to the development of this nation.  The world is changing at a rapid rate and what is new technology today will be old hat tomorrow.  It is essential that our education system not only responds to existing needs but plays a leading part as well.  We are facing a major challenge in developing our educational needs.  In order to bring those people initially charged with that responsibility up to date, we must show clear leadership and determination in meeting the needs of a rapidly growing knowledge-based economy.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions I have had the opportunity of visiting Silicon Valley.  On my last trip there I was amazed to hear employers say they had great difficulty in filling some of the highly skilled jobs on offer.  We must ensure that does not happen here.  We must match the demand for highly skilled personnel with a motivated workforce.  We are poised to take advantage of the success of the economy and other positive developments.  Central to all this excitement is the rapidly expanding world of information technology which is developing at breakneck speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Confirmed investment in human capital and in the production of a highly skilled labour force has been the key to Ireland's economic growth in recent times.  In particular, the availability of a highly skilled workforce has formed a crucial part of our success in attracting inward investment, including many leading manufacturers.  It is estimated that 1,000 software engineering graduates and 750 engineering technicians are required annually to meet the emerging skills shortage.  In order to do something about this, the Government approved a capital investment of £5 million last July after consulting widely with third level colleges and industry.  The provision of £60 million <Col N="1151" /> from the Education Technology Investment Fund is designed to ensure that the expansion programme can proceed effectively within the proposed time frame.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and Senator Ormonde touched on the major skills shortage that has been affecting the tourism trade, including catering. This is a matter of great concern considering the growth of this sector in recent years.  The benefit both to GNP and employment creation has been considerable when one considers that approximately £1 billion accrues to the Exchequer each year from tourism spending.  It behoves us to pay special attention to this area in which, as the Minister indicated, some 188,000 people are currently employed.</P>
    <P>The rapid growth of this industry has led to a shortage of skilled workers.  The present capacity of our education system to deal with the need for more skilled graduates in this area is questionable. When the regional technical colleges were initially set up this type of demand did not exist and, consequently, we are in a deficit position. The efforts that have been made to date are modest.</P>
    <P>Regional technical colleges have played a major part in reforming the education system. From the outset, the regional technical colleges, together with the new and existing universities, have tried to anticipate these needs and level of training required by industry.  They now provide an excellent range of subjects from the humanities to new technology.  In view of the rapid change in technology we should upate such equipment on an ongoing basis.  Resources to provide this are fundamental to the success of the educational system's contribution to continued economic growth.</P>
    <P>The major new package of funding which the Bill will ensure will allow us as a nation to play a much greater role in the expansion and utilisation of information technology.  It will also help us to create high quality jobs for highly educated and skilled people.  With this investment in new technology we can move on to greater employment and greater prosperity.  We must never allow a situation to develop where we have to turn away companies who are willing to participate because of our inability to provide them with a suitable workforce.</P>
    <P>The Schools IT 2000 Programme deserves special mention as an integral part of the special investment that education technology is bringing about.  A number of important themes provide the foundation for the Government's schools programme. At all stages it has drawn on international experience to ensure the proposals include only those aspects which can be shown to meet our stated objectives directly.  More importantly, the concept of partnership runs throughout the document.  It will involve schools, parents, local communities and third level colleges together with private and public sector organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> The Government wants to support innovation by providing a framework for encouraging future development rather than setting up rigid policies. The Government's objectives are to put in place a permanent schools information technology infrastructure at a number of important levels. The plan does not merely involve putting computers into schools but will also help to develop teachers' skills &mdash; a point that has been mentioned by a number of speakers &mdash; in using new technology to provide support and to implement agreed policies.</P>
    <P>The Government has pledged to put in place a comprehensive technology infrastructure in schools.  Within the next three years the Minister hopes to have some 60,000 multimedia computers installed in schools.  It is also intended that every school will be connected to the Internet and thus be in a position to use the Internet via high quality lines.  This will be achieved through a programme called the technology integration initiative. This initiative will operate on two strands. The first will involve the connection of every school to the Internet.  It will also involve targeting assistance to disadvantaged schools to ensure all schools can participate.</P>
    <P>An Opposition Senator said earlier in the debate that he hoped everyone would start on a level playing pitch.  It is intended that this will be the case.  Once this is achieved, hopefully we will move towards achieving and maybe surpassing the current minimum targets.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said primary and second level schools will be the poor neighbours when it comes to receiving new technology.  I hope, however, that special schools will also be considered for some of this technology.  Computers have played a major role in schools for the physically handicapped, where they have been of great benefit.  I have first hand experience of this in a school I am associated with.  Young children who may have impaired hand movements, for example, or other physical disabilities can, with the aid of computers, do their homework without the assistance of their parents, whose help was hitherto required.</P>
    <P>Helping teachers to develop the skills necessary to use information technology has been shown throughout the world to be the key to successfully introducing IT to the classroom.  If teachers are not on board at the outset, one is fighting a losing battle.  This has been recognised by a number of successful courses, including those run by teachers' unions.  A minimum of 20,000 teachers will receive information technology training in the next few years.  The Government will also ensure that those teachers coming on-stream will have pre-service training before taking up their positions &mdash; this plan is to be welcomed.  They also intend that they will have access to distance learning programmes.</P>
    <P>These objectives will be achieved through the teaching skills initiative.  Under this training will be provided on three levels.  There will be basic <Col N="1153" /> awareness training in the use of information technologies; there will be training in the use of information technologies as an active curriculum tool, and there will be advanced training targeted particularly at teachers participating in developing programmes.  The final element of the plan will put in place a permanent support infrastructure which will have a number of elements. It will involve the development of curriculum innovations to enhance the use of information technologies in the classroom; it will establish a national network to advise and support schools in developing their own technology plans, and it will establish a national framework to support the development of multimedia tools and products tailored to the Irish curriculum.  This will be achieved through the schools support initiative.</P>
    <P>This will have a number of important elements. The ScoilNet project will involve the establishment of an on-line advisory support service for schools based in a regional education centre.  A network of advisers will provide local support to teachers and schools alike.  Through the school integration project a number of schools will be to the fore in piloting innovative ways of developing further policies.  The objective will be to make Ireland the world leader in school based information technology developments.</P>
    <P>None of this will happen without effective co-ordination within the Department of Education and Science.  An education information and communication technologies unit will act as a focal point for our involvement in this programme.  The most important element will be the National Centre for Technology in Education.  Informed by policies developed through partnership, the NCTE will be the driving force behind Information Technology 2000.  I understand from the Minister that the director and core staff will be appointed next month and that the centre will be operating soon after that.  The centre will, in addition, provide support on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>Substantial funding will be needed for this programme. There is in place at least £50 million which will allow us to achieve the minimum targets within three years.  The Government will invest £40 million in the programme.  The capital element of this has already been allocated for payment from the education technology investment Fund.  This will be added to by a further £10 million being contributed by Telecom Éireann, which represents the largest ever investment in our schools by anyone outside the Department of Education and Science.  Many of the details of Telecom's investment have already been announced and other companies have expressed a willingness to contribute.  We can see from all these elements &mdash; the fund, Telecom Éireann's involvement, the sponsored Internet link-up and the Schools Information Technology 2000 that this is the most comprehensive and focused educational package that has ever been put together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to listen to the views of my colleagues and Silicon Valley is, inevitably, mentioned <Col N="1154" /> in discussions such as this.  It is worth saying that Silicon Valley has the highest number of toxic dumps per unit area in the United States.  It is a mistake to believe that information technology is a clean industry.  It generates a substantial quantity of quite toxic waste material.  I do not say this as a criticism, but as a chemical engineer, I have a defensive interest in this question.  I hope we move from assembly into the high tech area of fabrication, as is being done by Intel in Leixlip.  If we do, however, we will have to take responsibilty for the considerable environmental burden that this will bring.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued at the promise of an Internet connection for every school by the end of June 1998.  The school attended by two of my daughters still requires girls to bring toilet paper to school because the school cannot afford to supply it and it still requires every family to contribute 50 pence per week to pay for central heating.  We would not want to have schools with high tech in one room and no toilets in another.  We need to develop on a broad framework.  I do not disagree with the principle of technology in education, but access to the Internet is not the place to start.  The simplest way to start &mdash; and I speak as a user and teacher of information technology &mdash; is to ensure that every child who leaves primary school is able to type.  The biggest obstacle to using information technology is the inability to find letters and numbers on a keyboard.</P>
      <P>The Minister has asserted on numerous occasions that this fund is separate from, and in addition to, the normal capital provision.  My recollection from the newspapers is that the funding for capital programmes in the Department of Education and Science Estimate for 1998 &mdash; separate from this fund &mdash; shows a decrease of, I think, 17 per cent.  I accept that the £100 million represents a vast increase, but we are exaggerating the generosity of the Government a little, although this measure is extremely welcome and badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of this fund is extremely good.  As a lecturer in a regional technical college &mdash; which the Minister said would be called something else by Christmas which is fast approaching &mdash; I agreed when this plan was announced that it was a good thing principally because it represented a recognition of reality.  There is a myth that we have a binary system of education in which both sectors have equal status.  The philosophy of the Department of Education and Science and of successive Ministers has been that one sector is more important than the other in terms of areas such as support services, access to career advice or security services.  The institution in which I work, for example, is not allowed to employ a resident night security person.  They have to buy in security from outside.  We are not allowed to employ grounds staff.  They have to be bought in from outside.  In a whole series of areas such as technical and secretarial support there is not equivalent status.  There is one important area and one which has to make do.  I have hopes that this fund represents <Col N="1155" /> a movement towards something like equivalence.</P>
    <P>I teach a degree course in engineering which requires the highest level of leaving certificate points of any engineering course in the country; it is higher than any of the universities.  We can do our job, but in all the regional technical colleges we do it in extremely straitened circumstances. The physical infrastructure and the provision of support staff in regional technical colleges is abysmal and that results in a public view of the technological sector which does not, in the minds of parents in particular, accord with equivalent status.</P>
    <P>Regional technical colleges have been extraordinarily successful.  I heard the chief executive of the Irish Trade Board, Mr. Oliver Tattan, say at a university function that regional technical college engineers were far more useful to industry than university engineers.  I do not know if that is true but I was more interested in his opinion than most of the university audience because I work in that area.  Yet, in spite of that, the degree to which regional technical colleges are involved in the development of policies in the area of science, technology and research is minuscule.  Bodies have been set up to advise the Government on policy in this area without representation from the technological or regional technical college sectors.  I do not know why people say it is a good thing to have a vibrant technological sector separate from the universities and then rely on the advice of universities to develop science and technology policy, particularly research policy.  That is a contradiction.</P>
    <P>Duplication between regional technical colleges is actively discouraged.  Yet duplication between universities of areas that have been successfully developed by the regional technical colleges seems to be actively tolerated if not encouraged. There is the ridiculous position where the University of Limerick has opened a department of chemical engineering with public funding, yet I work in a similar department which is screaming out for more resources.  Although the universities receive public funding in the same way as the regional technical colleges, they seem to have a capacity to operate independent of public policy which, until they are brought into a framework, will frustrate the Minister's intentions.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary deference of the Department of Education and Science to the universities never ceases to amaze me.  For example, if University College Dublin decides that leaving certificate honours mathematics is not good enough to do engineering and increases the standard for no particular reason other than it does not like leaving certificate honours mathematics any more, the Government will agree.  That creates another obstacle for young people who want to get into technological education.  Students require a B in honours mathematics to do engineering in UCD, which is unique in the third level sector. That will not produce any better engineers but it <Col N="1156" /> creates a pecking order which allows universities to operate with a degree of autonomy which is sometimes used to advance their sense of status.</P>
    <P>Universities have created a mystique about degrees.  An honours degree is worthwhile but what type of quality assurance programme do we have for pass degrees?  Hundreds, if not thousands, of young people get degrees in our universities and other institutions which are only subject to the quality assurance of an external examiner who looks at the best in the class.  Quality assurance is not just an issue for the technological sector but it is only mentioned there.</P>
    <P>Universities give out diplomas like confetti. They offer various diplomas for different periods of study.  Some are important diplomas while others are awarded to people who complete a brief, yet worthwhile, period of adult education. How does that affect the public's perception of the status of a regional technical college diploma after three years of third level education?  If we want to create equivalent status, then a university should award a diploma comparable in terms of commitment to a diploma awarded by a regional technical college, otherwise there will be a totally unbalanced public perception of the two sectors of education.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with this Bill which promised to change the situation.  Section 4 is the essence of the Bill as it deals with capital expenditure for the provision of scientific, technological or vocational education.  At the top of the list are the underfunded, undercapitalised universities.  I live in a city where the university has not stopped spending money on buildings in the past ten years.  I am not concerned about that but the students I teach are painfully aware of the fact that the college in which they work is, in terms of physical infrastructure, light years behind the other institution to which they could have gone had they not chosen to pursue a career in technological education.  I become extremely nervous when I see the universities queueing up for further funding.  I get even more nervous when the Minister hints that he will look more favourably at programmes where there is matching funding for third level institutions.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman said the President of the University of Limerick, who does not believe in public expenditure although he is a great man to spend public money, spends most of his time in the United States raising funds.  If the director of a regional technical college did that the Department of Education and Science would severely criticise him for neglecting his duties at home. One cannot talk about equivalent status when one level of institution is regulated in almost every detail and the other can operate with a degree of autonomy which seems to suggest it will spend money whatever way it wishes.  Huge amounts of State funds were found for its core technological services and equally vast sums of money, about which those of us in the technological sector can only dream, were found elsewhere to provide a quality service for its students.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> The Minister must meet the commitments made when this fund was announced.  I am concerned that a change of Minister or of philosophy could result in a further redirection of funds.  The sector of education in which I work always benefits from the presence of a Fianna Fáil Minister. Tragically, those of my colleagues on the Left when in Government, like myself, tend to have a deferential attitude to universities which usually means the regional technical colleges and technological sector suffer.</P>

      <P>One of the regrettable things about this Bill is the megalomania of the Department of Finance to control everything.  There are 21 references to the Minister for Education and Science and 13 to the Minister for Finance.  This is a Bill on education, yet the Minister needs the consent of the Minister for Finance on seven occasions.</P>

      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan disappoints me, coming as he does from the regional college of technology sector, with which I had the good fortune to be involved over a number of years in the 1980s in my capacity as a politician.  I am disappointed that almost his entire contribution was negative towards the Bill.  If he was at any time positive, the extent of his positive contribution was summed up in about four or five words.  There was a slightly redeeming feature towards the end of Senator Ryan's contribution, when I heard the Minister remark that the Senator had moved towards the centre of gravity in his approach to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Having said that, my contribution is not about attacking Senator Ryan or anybody else.  I welcome the contributions of other Opposition Senators, because when one is faced with a situation such as this, where a significant public fund is established, it is difficult to exercise the role of Opposition Senator and at the same time be positive.  I commend Senators Coogan, Jackman and O'Toole for their positive, balanced and reasonable evaluation of the Bill.  Despite their obligation to screen it carefully, they were able to see its significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> I welcome the fact that this Bill, which heralds a new era in the history of investment in education in Ireland, is being initiated in the Seanad. It is an historic milestone, irrespective of what has been said by those who do not have the same confidence in it.  In committing £250 million to technological education over a three year period, this Minister and Government are indisputably demonstrating a vision and understanding of the enormous challenges and opportunities the new technologies present for economic development in Ireland for the foreseeable future.  If I were asked to describe how Minister Martin presents himself through this Bill, I would say that he shows vision, willingness to consult from the outset, an innovative style, leadership, commitment but, most of all, delivery, because one of the hallmarks of this Bill is its money up front approach. Maybe that is what is so hurtful in certain quarters. This is not a Minister who sets out to be a rezoner of education, but one who sets out to be a leader in the field of educational research and policy.</P>
    <P>The fund, drawing also from the private sector as it undoubtedly and inevitably must, is a powerful statement of confidence in the pivotal role education must embrace in the Ireland of the new millennium.  The highly enthusiastic endorsement the decision has received from hi-tech industrialists and educational establishments alike testifies to the boldness and scope of the project.  It represents a huge vote of confidence in our children's future, among other things, and reflects a maturity and a coming of age in how we, as a country, plan for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The wide ranging package which this Bill embraces sets out to meet the immediate needs while at the same time laying down a blueprint for future success.  The spiralling demand for employees in the hi-tech sector, in teleservices, electronics and software industries, as well as the emergence of skill shortages in activities related to tourism and catering, require huge infrastructural changes.  This Bill is targeting resources unambiguously, not philosophising or theorising.</P>
    <P>The money up front approach, which, as I said, is one of the great hallmarks of the Bill, reflects a clear determination to facilitate the necessary supply of skills at the earliest possible date. Equally, the decision to act on the longer-term strategy in the same manner, with immediate large investment in technological literacy at primary, second, post-leaving certificate and third levels, along with the launch of a new business and education training partnership forum, will firmly underpin Ireland's place in the new technology revolution well into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>Criticism of the relevance of the leaving certificate was raised in a number of major reports on the economy and education in recent years.  Culliton, the OECD, the ESRI and the Marino Institute of Education criticise the leaving certificate as being unsuited to the needs of many students.  It is now widely accepted that the emphasis on the cognitive is less and less <Col N="1159" /> important as technology advances and information increases.  Of course, information is doubling every five years.  Therefore, we can no longer retain all important information.  What future and present young generations need is knowledge of how to access information, evaluate it, interpret it, process it and present or apply it in different ways.  This presents new challenges, for example, to the way we teach.  I hope that the heart of this Bill is about targeting resources, the wherewithal to take on the new methodologies.</P>
    <P>Not alone is it a challenge to the way we teach, but a challenge to what we teach, because we must abandon the emphasis on the didactic style, the great old reliable which has existed from time immemorial, and embrace a learner-centred approach where learning will be more experiential, self-directed, investigative and evaluative.</P>
    <P>Perhaps accessing information will become the most fundamentally important skill.  Following on that, its evaluation, interpretation and application will be vital to employability.  Indeed, in that context the in-service training programmes, to which all previous speakers have referred, must be properly integrative so that the vast potential of what is being done here is realised in classrooms at primary, second, post-leaving certificate and third levels.  The greater potential for employment in the future will be in technology related areas, so employability necessitates knowledge of the skills which come with this new revolution. We are not alone in discovering that this is a significant way forward for the future.  The Scans report in the US during the Presidency of George Bush also identified new priorities in those related areas.</P>
    <P>Clearly the decisions we are making in this Bill imply a large and vital role for technology in education. Computer based learning will become pivotal to success and interfacing with the world wide web &mdash; the Internet &mdash; will become even more important.  This is the philosophy at the core of the Bill and it is underpinned by the money up front approach.</P>
    <P>The revolution wrought by CD ROM is a major source of information and its gathering will be of enormous importance.  The communication and interpretation of information will be equally important.  This inevitably signals the importance of computer skills, audio-visual skills and competence with the various related technologies. Video will become not only vitally important but absolutely imperative in many areas.</P>
    <P>This clearly implies that schools must be equipped with the full range of computer facilities &mdash; hardware, software and interactive technology. This, of itself, would be of little use without training teachers in the use of the new information technologies.  We must face up to the fact that huge resources will be needed for training on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I was very taken with the contributions of some Opposition Senators who said that we should start this programme of in-service training for <Col N="1160" /> teachers, who will be the people imparting these new techniques in all subjects in schools and colleges. It is vitally important that, as Senator O'Toole, among others, stated, the timing is right to do it.  The Minister, some of my colleagues and I recall vividly hearing of schools receiving computer equipment which remained wrapped in cardboard for years because we failed to take an integrated approach.  In the ordinary course of events teachers were adaptable, willing, committed and motivated; but they regarded computers as ephemeral, marginal and irrelevant to their work.  They were afraid to press a button in case they did not understand what happened.  It is vital that training begins when technology is introduced so that roles are not reversed; otherwise young &ldquo;whiz-kid&rdquo; children will instruct the teachers and the programme will be undermined. I am delighted that there are such children, but we must achieve the necessary competence and confidence among our excellent pool of teachers.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Information Technology 2000 programme, launched last week by the Minister, is targeting resources and infrastructure towards the classroom for the development of teacher skills and towards research.  Its key objective is the achievement of a natural partnership in this area and it is vital that teachers, parents, industry, public sector, private sector and community organisations form such a partnership. That may sound grandiose, but it means that implementation at the coalface is all the more important, because it is more complicated. Senator Ormonde was right to emphasise the <i>modus operandi</i> for the assessment and constant evaluation of its implementation, as it will ensure its continuing success.  What happened in the past, when schools were selected for pilot programmes, should not happen again on a national basis.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for putting this funding on a statutory basis.  I had the privilege of serving on the governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology where, despite Senator Ryan's vehemently expressed pessimism, I saw the strong efforts, tremendous motivation and commitment of teachers and researchers to obtain funds to develop technology and research. Senator Costello probably sees this also because he is on the Dublin Institute of Technology governing body at present.  Sometimes these actions were illegal as the Vocational Education Act, 1930, did not legally permit or facilitate such work in Dublin Institute of Technology colleges. Nonetheless, the will was there and if this spirit is allied with resources, huge potential will be realised.  This sector will be encouraged by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Níl an dara rogha ann.  Tá riachtanas fíorthábhachtach le hinfheistiú sa teicneolaíocht nua.

      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  I congratulate him on his initiative in providing the vehicle of an investment fund with both State input and potential private donations.  The fund of £250 million is highly significant. However, I request clarification on the constitutionality of the proceedings before we move to the next stage.  Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution are the relevant provisions and they are categorical.  Article 21.1.1 states that &ldquo;Money Bills shall be initiated in Dáil Éireann only&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to the Bill to say why the matter should be addressed.  Far be it from me to limit the number of Bills initiated in this House but the constitutional point should be clarified.  Article 21 states that Money Bills shall be initiated in Dáil Éireann only and every Money Bill passed by Dáil Éireann shall be sent to the Seanad.  Article 22 defines Money Bills as follows:</P>
      <P>A Money Bill means a Bill which contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following matters . [including] the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on public moneys or the variation of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money.</P>
      <P>This Bill certainly involves a charge on public moneys and the appropriation of public money, as there is a specified fund over the next three years dedicated to investment.  It therefore comes within the terms of Articles 21 and 22.  I request clarification on this point because Article 22 goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The Chairman of Dáil Éireann shall certify any Bill which, in his opinion, is a Money Bill to be a Money Bill, and his certificate shall, subject to the subsequent provisions . be final and conclusive.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle should certify whether this is a Money Bill and I ask the Minister to resolve this to our satisfaction before the next Stage.</P>
      <P>I applaud the Minister for providing a three year planning programme of capital investment funding with a minimum of £250 million from the public sector and the potential for substantial private donations.  It would be good to see an indication of where those donations might come from; but I hope they are forthcoming from the business sector, multinational and indigenous, which benefits inordinately from the high quality of skills, training and education received by our young graduates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also delighted to see a sum of money ringfenced in a planned fashion.  A similar procedure <Col N="1162" /> is being adopted with local authorities, where motor taxation is to become a dedicated, guaranteed fund for the provision of services.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should maintain that initiative, which was introduced by his predecessor.  Ring fencing the money is a good idea because one then know what will be available in each of the next three years.</P>
    <P>The third level sector will feel it has won the lottery.  However, some university presidents think they will lose out as the money will largely go to the technological sector, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges.  The Bill is specifically directed at technological education, so that is understandable. However, according a recent newspaper report, only Portugal has less vocational and technological training than Ireland.  Some 23 per cent of our school going population receives such training while the relevant figure for Germany is 77 per cent with a similar figure in France.  We have a great deal of ground to make up.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I have some criticisms of it.  There is almost no increase in the Estimates for capital funding for first and second level education.  Very low priority is given to that sector except for the £50 million allocated for computer education in schools.  However, the breakdown of that figure is £25 million for computers and £25 million for teacher training, which is not enough.  Much of this money was, in fact, allocated last April by the previous Minister for Education, which further dilutes the amount provided for computer education in schools.  Young people have a natural love of technology and should be taught to use computers at school.</P>
    <P>There are other hard pressed education sectors which will feel they should have benefited to a greater degree.  However, the technological and business sectors will be quite happy with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am chairman of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee which has been emphasising for some time the lack of funding for vocational education and training.  That sector is not described as a third level sector, although it is doing a great deal of third level work through the post-leaving certificate courses.  There are between 17,000 and 18,000 students on PLC courses, many of which lead on to third level diplomas and degrees.  The pathway process is the key to education for those at the end of the scale and needs tremendous investment.  The Minister has not clarified in this Bill or his remarks the extent to which such courses will benefit from the legislation.  Will the vocational education committees, which are not described as being part of the third level sector, receive an injection of capital funding for their technological courses?</P>
    <P>Despite the Government's promises in relation to the PLCs, there has been no indication that such students will receive maintenance grants parallel to those received by other third level students.  It would cost approximately £15 million <Col N="1163" /> to do that but it is a major sector involving between 17,000 and 18,000 people.  I will be carefully examining the budget to see if there has been any move in that direction.  However, there has been no indication so far that Fianna Fáil is going to deliver on its manifesto in that respect. How will the money in the fund be dispersed?  Will these critical areas of vocational training and education benefit?</P>
    <P>I know Senator Ormonde is very interested in the area of adult education and literacy from her experiences as a teacher and guidance counsellor in Coláiste Eanna.  According to the OECD report there are very high levels of serious adult literacy problems in Ireland.  We are almost bottom of the scale, with approximately 25 per cent of our adult population, or 500,000 people, having serious problems with numeracy and literacy. That sector, which has operated up to now on a hand to mouth basis, needs a very fast injection of funds and personnel.</P>
    <P>I recently received a letter from the Dublin Adult Learning Centre in Mountjoy Square which gave the stark details of the problems it faces.  It stated that the adult literacy and community budget currently stands at £2,315,000.  In 1998 it will receive an additional allocation of £70,000, despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of our people require adult literacy education. The letter stated this will be divided between approximately 100 adult literacy schemes in 38 vocational education committees. At a time when the economy is booming, that seems to be kick in the teeth to that hard pressed sector of the community which operates on a shoestring and on a largely voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>That centre in Mountjoy Square, which is worth £200,000, is owned by the archdiocese of Dublin which is prepared to sell it for less than half its market value.  It is a very suitable premises and could be a centre for adult and literacy education. However, the Department of Education has, so far, refused to contribute towards that purchase of about £80,000.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister that the archdiocese is prepared to contribute the benefit of over £100,000 in terms of the sale of that centre.</P>
    <P>The Minister must address these issues in terms of priorities and the desired direction of the education system.  A recent study indicated that 16 year olds in Ireland were more prone to taking drugs and alcohol than their counterparts in any other European country.  Paddy Clancy recently published an excellent comparative study of entry into third level education in 1986 and 1996 which showed no significant progress in access to third level for those in disadvantaged areas.  We are providing a fine investment fund at the top of the scale and are involving the business community. However, the Minister should provide similar funds at primary and second level and should encourage business to get involved at that level because that is where the process of good education and training must begin.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and the Government's commitment to spend £0.25 billion in the next couple of years on this area.  I also welcome the Government's recognition that we must react must faster than before.  The Minister has acted decisively to head off a potential crisis.  I had intended to spend half my time complimenting the Bill and the other half arguing against some of its flaws.  However, I do not have enough time to compliment the Bill, which has already been done in many ways today.  I find this is a very curious Bill, especially with regard to finance.  I am confused why this means was chosen to implement the spending of £0.25 billion on capital projects in education.</P>
      <P>When the education fund was announced on 6 November my first reaction was that it was an imaginative new idea.  It appeared to be a way of getting beyond the constraints of annual budgeting and to be taking a long-term view, something we have not experienced in the past.  It also appeared to be a way of getting away from funding capital projects through the annual Estimates. Instead of fighting for capital projects, the Government would allocate a global amount each year to go into an investment pot.  I was in favour of this because money would then be allocated as needs arose by the Department of Education and Science rather than by the Department of Finance, but subject to the restrictions set out in the legislation.  That approach would also allow the Government to allocate money in good years, some of which may be spent in later years when finances were tighter.  It represented a useful creative idea and I understood that is what was intended for the legislation.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill makes clear that this is not the favoured approach.  Perhaps it once was, in which case it may have been nobbled by the Department of Finance.  For example, despite the mention of specific amounts, the Bill does not bind the Government to contribute £0.25 billion. Rather it sets a ceiling on what it may contribute but gives no commitment that this limit will be reached.  Indeed, it gives no commitment at all over and above the initial £100 million, which doubtless the Minister will provide in today's budget.</P>
      <P>However, there is worse.  Even when money is allocated to this fund from the Exchequer, it can be clawed back.  Section 5, which applies only to private donations, provides that money in the investment fund cannot be used for any purpose other than that prescribed in the Bill.  There is no such provision against clawback for the money provided by the Exchequer.  Perhaps something can be done about this on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far from the Bill providing a way of getting beyond the constraints of annual budgeting which is desirable for capital projects, it now provides for it in an even more restricted form.  Not only is no State money guaranteed beyond 1998, but even 1998 money is not safe from clawback.  More significantly, the Bill provides that all payments should be authorised by the Minister for Finance. <Col N="1165" /> Instead of allocating a global amount to education, which is then spent according to education priorities, every payment will be under the control of the Department of Finance with no freedom of action delegated to the Department of Education and Science, despite the fact that the legislation lays down strict guidelines on how the money in the fund may be spent.  At best, this is no different from the existing way of allocating funds.  It may even be worse.  As far as the State's money is concerned, I see no reason for introducing this mechanism.  It confers no benefit.</P>
    <P>The fund may have been established to facilitate private donations.  If so, the structure outlined in the Bill is inadequate.  It appears to fly against the reality of corporate donations.  Most prospective donors, whether individual or corporate, want full acknowledgement for their beneficence. They do not want their contributions to become invisible in a big pool.  While anonymous donors are very useful &mdash; one such donor, whose name is probably widely known, has given by far the biggest private contribution to Irish education over the past decade &mdash; most donors want recognition. There is provision for a private donor to attach conditions to a donation.  However, there is nothing in the legislation to encourage private donors to give to this fund rather than directly to an educational institution of their choice.  Indeed, they would be better to make a direct donation to that institution.</P>
    <P>There is an even more important consideration. The nightmare scenario for private donors is to find that their money displaces Government spending.  By giving a donation they want to increase the overall funds; they do not want to give the Government any excuse to reduce its own contribution.  I understand from experts in philanthropic areas that the principle of additionality is sacred to most donors and that they are much more serious about it than even the EU Commission.  Many donors will be very wary about having their money mixed up with State money in one big fund, especially one which places no binding commitment on the State to make any contribution, which allows the State, in its own absolute discretion, to clawback its contribution if money becomes tight in the years ahead and which allows the Department of Finance rather than educational interests hold the purse strings and have the last say on money spent.</P>
    <P>If the aim of the Bill is to create a donor friendly environment which will stimulate massive private sector contributions to Irish education then it is misconceived in its present form.  Hence the reason for my confusion.  I hope the Minister will enlighten me when replying or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Why are we considering this legislation?  Why cannot the Government allocate the money and spend it in the time honoured way?  What good does this Bill do that cannot be done under existing structures?  What benefit does it confer that existing legislation does not?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> I am in favour of spending the money allocated. Would that it were more.  It remains my hope that the crisis in skills, to which so many of us have referred, will prompt a fundamental re-examination of how we plan our education in the future.  We have a new, highly energetic Minister who knows the system backwards and is committed to adopting it to future needs.  I am impressed with his performance, at the way he has recognised needs and is doing something about them. My concern is that his undoubted knowledge, ability and energy be put to the best use.  I am enthusiastic about this Bill.  I look forward to having my questions answered and perhaps addressed on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill.  It one of the most imaginative legislative responses to education for some time.  I agree with Senator Quinn regarding the recognition, incentives and safeguards for donations from private individuals and corporate bodies.  The explanatory memorandum refers to the provision of £250 million into an account for the purposes of buying equipment in the years 1998-2000.  Will the Minister confirm that this is the intention of the legislation and that the Government will provide that money?</P>
      <P>An ideal situation arises when the Government provides money and the incentive to private individuals and corporate bodies, who may have an emotional attachment or other good reasons, to contribute to the education of our young people. However, there is no provision for tax or other incentives which will encourage donors to provide money.  Provision for this may be made in other legislation, but there is no such provision in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the first ever budget debate in the Seanad on budget day.  It is unique that the House will have completed a debate on the budget before some Opposition Members have made their first contributions in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on the fact that the budget contained many surprises.  I am not aware of any other budget where there were so few leaks and the predictions of journalists, <Col N="1167" /> experts and politicians about its contents were so wrong.  It was a model of silence and discretion.  I welcome the surprises contained in it and it is a great credit to the Minister, the Cabinet and the civil servants involved that those elements were not leaked.  It is a long time since a budget was not exposed early.  I showed an interest in the budget details last week but I got no joy from anybody.  It is difficult sometimes for people to resist the temptation to give such information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget is refreshing because there is a new attitude and philosophy on the part of the Minister for Finance.  During the last four years the standpoint of the Minister and Government in the context of the budget was what could be taken from people and to whom it could be given.  That attitude is not necessarily wrong or immoral but it should not be encouraged.  The Minister for Finance took a different stance today.  He said we should consider what people are getting and how much they can retain.  There was not the attitude of confiscation or that the Government wants to take away money from some people who are too rich and give it to others who are too poor.  The stance was to give as much as possible to those in need and to leave as much with those who earn as politically and morally possible.</P>

      <P>It was refreshing to hear a Minister taking a stance in the other House which did not capitulate to the likes of Senator Brendan Ryan and other politically correct people at every turn. The Minister took a courageous stand which was pro-enterprise and pro-business.  He did not give in to the left wing lobby groups&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Just because the Independents tabled the motion, the House should not expect them to say identical things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with two areas under which the budget should be considered: the first is spending and the second is the taxation elements.  The spending problem has been tackled by the Minister by keeping within his limit of 4 per cent which all political parties and the social partners accepted.  It appears his spending target is 3.8 per cent.  We should applaud that and I was sorry to hear an Opposition spokesman saying on television immediately after the Budget Statement <Col N="1168" /> that the spending level was too high.  That is rich from an Opposition which, when it was in Government in times of prosperity, was unable to keep within its spending limits.</P>
    <P>The Minister has kept within his limits and he made several courageous points about public service pay.  It is unusual for politicians to make courageous comments about this matter.  They usually say very little about it and then capitulate. However, I am worried that the Minster has said much but will also capitulate.  I hope that is not the case and that he has the courage to stand up to the public service in the future.  I hope his words do not come back to haunt him.  He stated that it is totally unacceptable that the public service pay and pensions bill of £5.6 billion is expected to increase by 6 per cent over 1997 on top of an increase of 10.5 per cent in 1997 itself. I will nail the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to that cross every year he holds that office because he is right.  Public service pay is the key to overspending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Public service pay must be tackled because it is running riot.  The Minister recognises that, but is he prepared to tackle the problem?  I hope he is and I believe he probably will.</P>
      <P>Many people expected the Minister's action in respect of tax in the budget to be symbolic.  This is of great importance to the Progressive Democrats because they wanted the higher tax rate to be reduced from 48 to 46 per cent.  It means a great deal to the pro-enterprise, pro-business community that this is seen to be done.  The Minister had to reduce the tax rates because he was elected to do so on foot of a promise he made.  It is absurd for people to bellyache now that he is fulfilling his election promises.</P>
      <P>The Government promised to reduce direct taxation.  However, if the Minister had gone before the Dáil and stated that while he had promised to reduce direct taxation from 48 to 40 per cent over the years but had decided to leave it unchanged because of pressure from SIPTU or another of the unions which Senator Brendan Ryan supports, no one would respect him.  The Minister has done what he said he would do.  That is right because the people voted for a pro-enterprise Government.  The fact that the higher income tax rate has been reduced does not mean we should have to tolerate the politics of envy practised by left wing elements.  There is nothing inherently immoral about a low higher tax rate and people should recognise that.</P>
      <P>There is also nothing inherently immoral about what seems to be the most dramatic feature of the budget &mdash; no one has yet commented on it &mdash; namely, the decrease in capital gains tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only has corporation tax been reduced from 40 per cent, it has been halved.  It is extraordinary that the Minister had the courage to take such action.  Corporation tax, which does not raise much revenue, was imposed on a Fianna Fáil led Government in 1983 by Senator Ryan's left wing friends.  They did not care how much revenue it raised because it had the symbolic effect of crucifying those who were doing well, namely, people who had been successful in business and made small capital gains.  The left could state that they were looking after the poor and crucifying the rich by making them pay capital gains tax the Minister has had the courage to state that this is nonsense and has, from today, reduced capital gains tax from 40 to 20 per cent. Unfortunately, he also reduced the threshold from £1,000 to £500 which is merely tinkering with small figures.</P>
      <P>For those who believe development land should be exempt from the reduction in capital gains tax, the Minister has left the 40 per cent level in place in respect of such land.  That is perfectly acceptable.  The profits made on development land are so excessive that those who benefit from them should be obliged to pay a larger amount of their windfall gains.</P>
      <P>The Minister's concerns about capital gains tax relate to small investors who invest £10,000, £5,000 or less on the Stock Exchange.  Taking account of increases in profits &mdash; 30 to 40 per cent &mdash; on the exchange in recent years, a person investing £5,000 will make £1,500 per year which is not an excessive amount of money and there is no reason that person should have to pay £600 of their profits to the Government.  I welcome the Minister's decision to recognise that this is punitive and also to recognise that capital gains tax never raised significant revenue.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that one of the predictions made in the newspapers &mdash; that the ICC and ACC Banks would have been prepared for privatisation by this evening &mdash; does not seem to have come to pass.  I may be mistaken but I do not believe they were mentioned in the Minister's speech. However, I hope the Government will reverse the policy imposed by left wing elements in the previous Administration that there should be no privatisation. That sort of doctrine should be thrown out because it is not practised in any other European country.  Ireland is the only country in Europe which prevents privatisation under any circumstances.</P>

      <P>I welcome the reduction in corporation tax. The Minister surprised us again because everyone believed the top level of this tax would be reduced from 36 to 33 per cent.  However, it has been reduced further than expected to 32 per cent which is a bold step.  I welcome the fact that the Minister did not yield to the temptation to provide funding to the constituencies of Dublin North and Limerick East where by-elections are due to take place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are measures in the budget which must be welcomed.  The decision to increase pensions by 6 to 7 per cent is a good way to use resources generated by the extraordinary success of our economy.  When comparing our economy with those of other European countries, we must realise that we are better off than many of them <Col N="1171" /> and perhaps the measures we have put in place are working better than elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that social welfare rates have been increased.  I am also glad that there have been some, not nearly enough, increases in child benefits.  Every study carried out on poverty has recognised child benefit as the single most effective way to deal with family poverty.  We have the second highest level of child poverty in Europe; relative to our average income, not by abstract international standards, approximately 25 per cent of children are living in poverty.  It would have been worthwhile to provide further resources for child benefit.  My preferred solution would be to increase significantly child benefit and make it taxable income, in which case people like myself would be marginally better off and those who badly need it would be dramatically better off.</P>
      <P>The announcement in the budget to make donations to charities by the corporate sector tax deductible is a welcome development.  It brings us into line with civilised behaviour in other countries and might prick the social conscience of the corporate sector.  However, listening to Senator Ross, I am not sure that such exists.</P>
      <P>While many expenditure items in the budget are welcome, the taxation proposals are extraordinarily loaded in favour of the well off.  A married couple with no children on PAYE, paying the full rate of PRSI, on a total income of £9,000 per year, or £180 per week, will gain £127 per year, i.e. £2.40 per week but a married couple on £50,000 per year will gain £1,124 per year, i.e. £22 or £23 per week.  These figures undermine the increases in social welfare.  There is an increase of 1.5 per cent in net income for a person on £180 per week and 3.6 per cent increase for a person on £50,000 per year.  That is not just and it does not end there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For business people who regard £50,000 per year as a minimum income and graduates in their thirties who earn £66,000 per year, this represents an enormous giveaway.  On the top rate of tax 2 per cent of £100,000 is £40 a week, plus all the other benefits, will total approximately £3,000 to £4,000 per year.  Capital gains tax on share options has been halved, a further redistribution of resources in the direction of the very rich. Many of those who benefit most from share options are not the people who create wealth, they are people who happen to be in institutions when they were converted from building society to banking status.  These people did nothing to benefit the economy.  They work mainly in the financial services sector, which is a parasite in our society and generates no wealth.  It is a matter of great regret that these people are getting an extraordinarily generous handout.  This budget <Col N="1172" /> will benefit the very rich, not middle income groups.</P>
    <P>There has been much nonsense spoken about public sector pay.  The reason the country is booming is that we pay teachers properly and the education sector is a success.  Multinational executives say that one of the main reasons they base their companies here is our well educated workforce.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> or the Oireachtas does not educate these people.</P>

      <P>The teachers educate these people and society decided to pay teachers properly. Believers in the market economy must realise that if we pay people well, we will get good people to do good work.  That is the basis of their ideology except, apparently, in the public sector when you pay people badly and expect them to do a good day's work.  We made the right decision in the 1980s and we are making the right decision in the 1990s.  It is a bit rich for Senator Ross, the great defender of the nurses, to speak as he did about public sector pay.  In fact, in his speech the Minister quoted nurses' pay as the example for the increase in public sector pay.</P>
      <P>Electricity in Northern Ireland is privatised and charges are almost 30 per cent higher than they are here.  I do not think we should consider privatising electricity.  Successive Governments have claimed the right to privatise the TSB.  I would say to them that a considerable number of depositors, including myself, would challenge any attempt to sell off the TSB and take the money into public ownership.  That is an extraordinary decision of expropriation of resources that do not belong to the State in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is an historic night and our compliments to Senator Ross for being responsible for this debate.  We had a Christmas cracker of a budget announced today.  We are debating the budget in Seanad Éireann when some of the main speakers in the other House have not yet had the opportunity to contribute.</P>
      <P>This budget would not be possible but for the prudent management of the economy by Fianna Fáil going back to 1987.  I remember the input of the former Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, at that time and subsequently the positive negotiations in Europe by Fianna Fáil that brought major benefits to this country by way of Structural Funds.  Today we are reaping the benefits of those negotiations and part and parcel of the budget is a positive attempt to maintain the economic growth of recent times.  Inherent in the budget are factors that will create more employment and investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the social aspects of the budget, this is the first time a Minister has given an extra £10 a week to an old aged couple, for which we <Col N="1173" /> must compliment him.  While he has maintained the necessary economic activity, he has not forgotten our large elderly population.  An elderly couple will receive an extra £10 and an elderly person will receive an extra £6.50 a week, an increase of between 6 and 7.5 per cent.  That is a very positive move.</P>
    <P>This budget is, by and large, in line with commitments given by Fianna Fáil in our election manifesto.  We have honoured our commitments in regard to tax and investment.  The Minister's credibility is very apparent in this budget.  The reduction in the top rate of income tax from 48 per cent to 46 per cent and in the lower rate from 26 per cent to 24 per cent is more than my party promised before the last election.  That reduction is very welcome.  Over the years all parties have said that the PAYE sector was carrying too much of the load and that it is was a disincentive to work.  The measures taken by the Minister today are a move in the right direction and will encourage people to enter employment rather than receive social welfare payments.  The Minister has also increased social welfare payments at double the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Another historic aspect of the budget is that the borrowing requirement is just £89 million.  In the early and mid 1980s we never thought that was possible.  At that time the international monetary bodies were knocking at our door and the country was close to bankruptcy.  However, the minority Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 put us on the road to recovery through prudent management of public finances and the national debt so that we could eventually benefit from our good receipts from Europe.  All those measures were put in place at that time and we are reaping the benefits today.  Our nation is now moving forward in parallel with the other European nations.  We are meeting the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty and the reduction in 1998 will be followed by an even greater reduction in 1999.  We are on a very solid and safe road to the single currency and a more economically cohesive Europe.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on initiating measures to bring people back to work.  The increase in the number of places on the back to work allowance scheme by 5,000 to 27,000 is very welcome.  The additional £36.8 million being allocated to the health services is also welcome.  I am delighted the farming community has not been excluded on this occasion.  Money is being provided for the very worthwhile installation aid scheme and capital allowances for pollution control.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Ross in welcoming the reduction in capital gains tax.  We must support investors who create employment.  Such job opportunities will not be created unless we encourage people to invest.  The Minister seems to grasp what must be done.  For the first time in my life this nation is on the road to prosperity. This budget will not inhibit that prosperity; it lays down strict but very positive and far thinking <Col N="1174" /> guidelines for a bright future for this country in Europe.</P>

      <P>It is great that this House has an opportunity for the first time to discuss the budget.  However, we must re-examine the timing of the debate because we would need a little longer to digest the budget to get maximum value from the debate, particularly from an Opposition point of view.  I received a copy of the Minister's speech and the summary of the budget proposals on my way to the Chamber.  I glanced through them while I was trying to listen to the contributions of my colleagues on both sides.  We need a little longer to absorb the details and the small print which is not in the Minister's speech to the Dáil.  However, I welcome the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to discuss the budget, which has not been done before in this House.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, Deputy Noonan, the Fine Gael spokesperson on Finance, has just stated in the Dáil, this Government inherited the best economy since Michael Collins was Minister for Finance.  It was handed it on a plate.  It is easy to be wise in hindsight but many of my colleagues and I have often questioned the wisdom of calling a general election last June, given the Exchequer returns which followed, the McCracken tribunal and other matters which would have made for interesting electioneering and perhaps changed the outcome of the election.  However, as I said, it is easy to be wise in hindsight, particularly in political life.</P>
      <P>The Government has been handed an economy which is in the best possible condition due to the last three budgets.  We were expecting a creative budget with tremendous emphasis on taxation policy change but I am afraid that opportunity has been missed.  The Government had an all time high tax buoyancy and all the economic indicators were unprecedentedly positive.  I must underline that that favourable position was due to our actions over the last three budgets.  Everyone will claim credit for what is good but no one wants to know when there are difficulties in the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was thought this Minister could not get it wrong because he had so much money to play with without overheating the economy. However, he has got it wrong in many areas, the most important of which is his missed opportunity to radically change policy rather than patching and mending and being politically sexy by introducing little changes here and there to capture the public's attention.  This has put progress at risk.  Expedient measures decrease economic <Col N="1175" /> confidence in the marketplace and among the public.  There are no clear medium term objectives, which are needed.</P>
      <P>Great opportunities present themselves only every four or five years and they must be grasped. There was an opportunity this time to create a fairer society where everyone would share in the fruits of economic growth.  That did not happen. There were some excellent points in this budget but the opportunity to allow everyone share in the fruits of growth was missed, which I regret.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the Minister's commitment to controlling public expenditure.  I share that commitment but this is not just a crude matter of keeping numbers and pay levels in the public service down.  We must employ the best and brightest people in our public service and we must pay them to join it.  Once people are within the public service we need greater flexibility so that when there is a need for extra personnel in a particular area or when new services are required, people will be able to move across the service.  We must be able to introduce skills on a short-term basis, on contract if necessary &mdash; perhaps they are needed in a certain area or for a short time.  We must ensure that we deliver a proper service to the public as we enter the next millennium because the years ahead will be critical. We would not have the kind of buoyant economy and the Exchequer returns we have today if we did not have a public service which underpins governance in the way ours so excellently does. Problems exist and they must be sorted out through up-front negotiation.  We need increased productivity and we must pay for the best and brightest people to deliver that with greater flexibility.</P>
      <P>We should not get into ideological straitjackets here and in the few moments available to me I cannot take the middle ground between Senator Brendan Ryan's and Senator Ross's ideological views.  This debate is not all about privatisation and nationalisation but we must do what is best for the individual.  I am not hung up in any ideological straitjacket and I am not opposed to privatisation or to the State running the service where that is required.</P>

      <P>The Minister made much of public expenditure and he spoke about increasing current expenditure by 7 per cent or £520 million.  If Senator Ross had had time to do his sums he would realise the Minister subsequently went on to outline £1.5 billion of expenditure; those figures do not add up.</P>

      <P>The EU refused to accept 10 per cent corporation tax so the Government accepted our level of 12.5 per cent.  In relation to corporation tax, we are not told to which sectors the 12.5 per cent will apply.  Will it apply to the banking, farming and service sectors?  We do not know as it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature.</P>
      <P>What about child dependant allowance?  We have been told by all the relevant commissions and bodies that the way to reduce poverty for the lower paid and those on social welfare is to ensure our children are not left in poverty.  By today's standards, 25 per cent of our children live in poverty, yet there is nothing in this budget about child dependant allowance.  Parents are entitled to an additional £1.50 children's allowance in respect of their first and second children and slightly more for third and subsequent children, but there is nothing about child dependant allowance.  That is an enormous anomaly; the budget was unjust and unfair in that sense.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reduction from 40 per cent to 20 per cent in corporation tax provided it frees up capital for greater investment in jobs.  That is the thinking behind this measure but the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.</P>

    <P>In relation to hospital waiting lists, £4 million has been allocated to alleviate this in spite of all this Government had to say on the matter in Opposition.

However, there has been no overall policy change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Member of this House I am delighted to be here this evening on this historic occasion of a budget debate taking place in conjunction with the Lower House.  I compliment the Leader on organising today's affairs in such a manner as to allow this debate to take place and I also compliment those who tabled the motion.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the Seanad on the financial statement my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has just presented to the Dáil.  As Members of the House are aware, the Minister has just finished making his speech and by now I am sure you are aware of the principal elements of the budget.  While I do not intend to repeat what the Minister has already said, it is important to set out the economic background to the budget, the overall strategies it addresses and the main policy decisions which have been agreed in the 1998 budget.</P>
      <P>This year has been another year of strong growth for the Irish economy.  GNP growth this year is now expected to be 7.7 per cent, the fourth year in succession of growth of this magnitude. We are broadly acknowledged as being Europe's economic success story of the l990's with increased prosperity, stable prices and a level of employment growth &mdash; more than 50,000 this year &mdash; which is the envy of many larger countries.  In spite of continued strong output growth and employment increases, inflation has remained moderate at around 1.5 per cent.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement for this year is expected to be approximately £280 million or 0.7 per cent of GNP, compared with the budget target of more than £600 million.  The general Government balance is likely to show a surplus of approximately 0.4 per cent of GDP.  This is based on a number of factors which I would like to outline.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the continued success of the Irish economy are the subject of some discussion. However, it must be acknowledged that it has resulted from the confluence of a number of significant developments.  These include: prudent management of the economy which led to lower interest rates and increased investor and consumer confidence; the consensus approach in successive agreements with the social partners which resulted in moderate pay increases, industrial peace and the maintenance of competitiveness; the reduction in the debt burden; an increasing labour force; investment in education and training over a number of decades; strong foreign direct investment; the contribution of EU structural and cohesion funds to improving infrastructure and productive capacity and, reform of tax regimes for individuals and business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These reflect a policy focus on the longer-term benefits of getting the fundamentals right.  It is <Col N="1178" /> important that we should bear this in mind in our approach to policy development.  I will illustrate how this thinking underlies this year's budget.</P>
    <P>This Government's Action Programme for the Millennium outlines the main fiscal objectives for the next five years.  Today's budget addresses these objectives.  A significant current budget surplus is projected each year until the year 2000.  By the year 2000, even when account is taken of a significant capital deficit, Exchequer borrowing will be eliminated.  Over the period to the year 2000, Government spending will decline as a proportion of GNP.  This will be achieved while providing for the investment needs of our developing economy.</P>
    <P>At this stage of the economic cycle we must use the opportunity of strong growth to run surpluses and reduce the debt burden.  Ireland's debt is still very high.  The key to reducing the debt, and thus to putting the economy in the best position to meet the challenges of the future, is to run a budget surplus when the economy is doing well, as at present.</P>
    <P>This approach is consistent with the terms and with the spirit of the stability and growth pact which is an integral part of EMU.  The stability and growth pact states that budgets should be kept in balance or in surplus in normal economic conditions.  By any standards, current economic conditions are better than normal and the case for running a budget surplus in these favourable circumstances is compelling.</P>
    <P>I will now set out the economic background, some of the key factors which have influenced the budgetary strategy and the main budgetary provisions announced by the Minister today.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated the economic outlook remains favourable.  GDP is expected to grow by 8 per cent in 1998 and GNP by 7 per cent.  This will be reflected in employment with the number of people at work projected to increase by 48,000. Unemployment is expected to fall by about 15,000 as continued high rates of labour force growth take up a significant proportion of the new jobs created.  Inflation is expected to remain moderate at about 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The budget presents clear evidence of the Government's intention to deliver on its commitments under Partnership 2000.  Taking the 1997 Budget and the measures announced today into account, the overall resource commitment to reduce personal taxation by £900 million on a full year basis over three years and to spend £525 million on social inclusion and equality measures over three years will have been largely delivered in the first two years of the three year programme.</P>
    <P>There are, however, still many challenges to be faced on the economic and social front, and this budget addresses these.  It sets out to create the right conditions to sustain strong economic growth so that more people get jobs, and to ensure that inflationary pressures are contained. It also aims to position the public finances to <Col N="1179" /> address investment needs of the economy, reduction in the tax burden, social inclusion, preparation for economic and monetary union, post-2000 Structural Funds, long-term demographic changes and reduction of the national debt.  The conclusions to be drawn from this view of our longer term needs are clear.  We must adopt more ambitious budgetary targets than have been achieved over the last decade so we can address longer term needs from a position of financial strength.</P>
    <P>On the basis of taxation and expenditure measures announced by the Minister for Finance, the targets for the 1998 budget are a current budget surplus of £1,109 million, a capital deficit of £1,198 million, an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £89 million and a general Government surplus of 0.3 per cent of GDP.  Control of public spending will be central to the achievement of the budgetary targets.  The Government is committed to ensuring that, over the lifetime of the Government, the growth in net current expenditure will be limited to an annual average increase of 4 per cent.  Controlling current expenditure is a key element of our budgetary and economic policy.</P>
    <P>A balanced approach is adopted in the budget which takes account of the need to improve social inclusion measures while at the same time keeping control of public spending and creating an environment in which business can flourish and which encourages investment.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus on some of the key measures announced in the budget.  The range of social inclusion measures is designed to deliver on the undertakings aimed at combating disadvantage set out in the Government's programme; to make further progress towards meeting the commitments on social inclusion in Partnership 2000; to continue the reorientation of the social welfare code in a work friendly direction and to contribute towards the achievement of the strategic aims of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget allocated £273 million in a full year for social inclusion and this budget allocates a further £282 million on a full year basis. Resources which had been promised over three years in Partnership 2000 will now be more than provided in two years.  This illustrates the Government's commitment to ensure that economic growth is accompanied by real social advance for those in need.</P>
    <P>The social inclusion measures include the following. In general, personal rate social welfare payments will be increased by £3 per week while qualified adult allowances will increase by 3 per cent from the first week of June next.</P>

      <P>The increases in personal rates are <Col N="1180" /> well above the expected rate of inflation of 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>In line with our election commitments to the elderly, the full personal rate of all old age and related pensions will be increased by £5 per week, giving increases ranging from 6 per cent to almost 7.5 per cent or at least three times the expected rate of inflation.  This is one of the substantial and important highlights of this budget.  In a household where both partners have pension incomes, there will be an increase of £10 per week.  Where there is only one pension income and a dependent spouse, there will be an increase of over £6.50 per week.  That provision will be greatly welcomed.</P>
      <P>Child benefit rates will increase by £1.50 per month for the first and second children and by £3 per month for the third and subsequent children, with effect from September 1998.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> Pending the outcome of the current evaluation of community employment, an additional 1,000 places on the part-time jobs option and 1,000 places on the jobs initiative are being provided. The gross cost of these places is £11 million in 1998 and £17 million in a full year.  The allowances payable under community employment are being increased in line with the social welfare increases at a cost of £6 million in 1998 and £10 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme makes clear its commitment to reduce the burden of personal taxation in order to reward effort and to improve incentives to work.  The changes announced in the budget are not confined to tax reductions but are designed to ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share.</P>
    <P>The 1997 budget committed £400 million on a full year basis for reductions in personal taxes. This budget commits over £500 million to the main personal tax reductions.  Standard rate of income tax and the higher rate are reduced by 2 per cent to 24 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, from 6 April next.  Personal allowances are increased by £250 to £3,150 per annum for single persons and by £500 to £6,300 per annum for married couples.  There is an increase of £250 per annum for widowed, single parent and widowed parents allowances.  The standard rate income tax band is widened by £100 for single persons to £10,000 and by £200 for married couples to £20,000 per annum.  The budget limits the amount of capital allowances for buildings that passive investors can claim against non-rental income.</P>
    <P>To assist the long-term unemployed back to work a special tax allowance is being introduced of £3,000 plus £1,000 for each child for persons unemployed for one year or more who take up a job.  The allowance will be tapered down over a three year period.  Another measure announced is double tax deduction for wages for employers who employ a person who is long-term unemployed. The deduction can last for up to three years provided the former long-term unemployed person is still in employment.  It is hoped that these initiatives will go some way to encouraging the long-term unemployed back into the labour force.  This is another significant and imaginative part of the budget.</P>
    <P>The budget also focuses on business tax measures with the aim of promoting the expansion of business and employment and releasing additional resources for investment.  Corporation tax is a key element of our business and employment strategy. From 1 January 1998, the standard rate will be reduced from 36 per cent to 32 per cent, while the rate on the first £50,000 of profits will be reduced from 28 per cent to 25 per cent.  A time-table is set out for the further reductions that are needed to reach our target rates of 12.5 per cent and 25 per cent on trading and non-trading incomes respectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> The aggregate amount that can be raised by a company under BES is reduced from £1 million to £250,000 from today.  This is to facilitate a better targeting of BES relief on smaller companies who find it difficult to raise equity from other sources.</P>
    <P>A single capital gains tax rate of 20 per cent is being introduced except for disposals of development land, which will remain taxed at 40 per cent. I acknowledge what Senator Ross and Senator Finneran had to say in this regard.  This change will release pent up investment funds and create an incentive for the acquisition of further capital assets.  This will encourage investment and growth in the future.  Changes in capital allowances for building, including hotels, tax credits on dividends, capital gains and capital acquisition tax are also being introduced.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope Senators will agree with me that today's budget pursues a mix of polices designed both to achieve fiscal discipline and maintain the right conditions for sustained growth.  Central to that mix is a policy of personal tax reductions linked to wage moderation designed to encourage investment and job creation.  The budget rewards effort and provides for our key investment needs while also promoting social inclusion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to have this debate and I congratulate the Senators involved.  As Senator Ross said, we had an opportunity to speak about the budget within minutes of the Minister's speech in the Dáil.  I am delighted that the Leader of the House was able to accede to that request.  Like Senator Doyle, I am speaking with very little foreknowledge of what was to be debated here because we heard the Minister's speech only in the last hour.</P>
      <P>The Minister posed two questions &mdash; does this budget show financial discipline and does it show steps towards sustained growth?  I would like to examine this budget to see whether it achieves those matters.  Let us look at the Minister's objectives. No former Minister for Finance has had the opportunity the current Minister has.  The Minister himself has acknowledged that.  Since no Minister has had a better opportunity than this one, our objective is to see whether the today's steps have continued the objectives that have been sustained for ten years by all Governments.</P>
      <P>The Minister was correct in telling the Dáil that &ldquo;Ireland has in this decade undergone an economic transformation&rdquo;.  Admittedly, for a change, the Minister does not claim all the responsibility for that.  He gives credit to the social partners and to previous Governments.</P>
      <P>The Minister said we have to do three things. First, we must ensure that we create the right conditions to sustain strong economic growth so that more people get jobs.  Second, we must take steps to ensure that any inflationary pressures are contained. Third, we must prepare for the problems we face in the decades ahead.  Let us concentrate for a few moments on those points to see if the budget achieves them.</P>
      <P>The Minister also noted the budget was characterised by three things: control of public spending, correction of tax inequities and overdue acknowledgement of the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> Does the budget take the long-term rather than the short term view?  It is easy for a Minister for Finance with a lot of spare cash to solve many problems and to distribute goodies in a way that will please almost everybody.  I would be more anxious to see if it takes the long-term view to protect us in future, which is what the Minister set out to achieve.  Will the economic miracle continue because of the steps taken by the Minister?</P>
    <P>Is it a caring budget?  Does it take into account the caring society we wish to have as a nation and that we have attempted to achieve in the 75 years since independence?  Does it encourage investment by those who invest in creating enterprise as well as those who invest their labour, enthusiasm, effort and drive?</P>
    <P>Taking the first point, as to whether the budget takes the long-term view in encouraging investment, there are some definite steps which were the right ones to take.  There is little doubt that corporation tax will not win the votes of the vast majority of citizens who do not pay such a tax. The vast majority of citizens, however, depends on enterprises that do pay corporation tax.  The steps taken on corporation tax constituted a brave decision by the Minister because while they are not necessarily all that popular, they do take the long-term view.  I congratulate him for that.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there is little doubt that capital gains tax does not attract the attention of individual voters because the average taxpayer does not pay that tax.  It is, however, the very seed upon which future enterprises will succeed.  They will succeed if corporation tax and capital gains tax help those who are going to invest in the future &mdash; and nowadays such people are not individuals, they are to a large extent pension funds &mdash; to decide whether this country is the right place to invest in and which industry should they invest in.</P>
    <P>Any reduction in income tax is obviously a help in that direction.  It is tempting not to give reductions at the higher level and I can understand why.  However, for those who are investing, that is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>One sting in the tail of those three areas that will encourage investment is the tax credit on dividends.  It only gets a couple of lines in the Minister's speech and it received very little attention. I am not quite sure of its effect, but if it will cost the State £60 million in a full year this is a clever little hook the Minister has inserted.  I am not sure of the immediate effect but it must have some disincentive to those considering investment if the tax credits which were installed in order to encourage investment are taken away.</P>
    <P>Is it a caring budget?  Yes it is.  It has to be a caring budget.  In spite of what Senator Doyle says, the steps taken with regard to social welfare have to be admired.  This is not necessarily an investment in the future but that is not what we look for in a caring budget.  Is it a caring budget in regard to the elderly?  It has to be.  The steps that are taken in this regard go a long way in the right direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> Does this budget encourage work?  Does it encourage those who are not working at the moment to go to work?  What we call the economic tiger is leaving some people at the bottom of the pile.  The gap between the haves and have nots in our society is larger than in the average European society.  Figures published by the EU recently showed that the average of those who are classed as have nots in the European Union is 17 per cent.  In Ireland the most recent figures show 21 per cent although this figure is not quite as bad as Britain.  Does this budget do anything to lift those who are stuck at the bottom of the pile?  I suggest that not enough has been done in this area.</P>
    <P>I cannot help but welcome the initiative to help the long term unemployed referred to by Minister Cullen.  Let me just touch on it.  To assist the long term unemployed back to work a special tax allowance has been introduced of £3,000 plus £1,000 for each child for persons unemployed for one year or more to take up a job.  This is quite innovative.  The allowance will be tapered down over a three year period.  Another measure announced is double tax deduction for wages for employers to employ a person who is long term unemployed.  This is innovative and is to be commended but is it enough?  I do not think we have done enough in the budget for those who are at the bottom of the pile, many of whom are now into that area where they have never worked and their parents have never worked.  If we talk about a caring society we must talk about caring for people in the future.  I saw a man on television the other night saying that he had turned down a job which paid £280 per week because it would not pay him to go to work.  This man was the father of four children.  If we cannot encourage a man such as that to go to work then we have failed in the budget to grasp an opportunity that was open to us.</P>
    <P>We must note the strong points in this budget, but its weak point is its failure to lift those at the bottom of the pile off the bottom of that pile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Ross on proposing this motion.  I did not expect to discuss the budget speech so early in my political career. I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the budget so soon after its introduction, although it is a disadvantage not to have time to examine the facts and figures in the budget statement.  I am aware that I am taking part in a historic occasion. Few Senators know that Minister Mc Creevy and I were classmates in the Franciscan College in Gormanston.  We played on the same football team and he has shown today that he has lost none of the attributes that he had in his college days.  He has proven to be a generous and a fair man.  He is a member of the same profession as myself and as an accountant he is cautious and, as he said today, prudent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat joint Programme for Government recognises the <Col N="1187" /> need to reduce the burden of personal taxation in order to reward effort and to give people incentives to take up work.  The three important areas in the Programme for Government have been covered by the Minister for Finance.  The first is the area of personal taxation.  The Minister has delivered to the hard pressed PAYE worker.  This is not just a once off budget but is part of a plan for at least the next four years.  After the next general election, we hope, the same Minister will be in office.  The budget also gives social inclusion to those who are long term unemployed and disadvantaged. Above all this, it curtails public spending to the 4 per cent promised by the Government.</P>
    <P>How is all of this possible?  In the last week the economic commentators and journalists were writing that the Minister was going to be curtailed to about £350 million in tax cuts.  Later they suggested £400 million and the figure sat at that.  The Minister, however, has managed to give £517 million in tax cuts while at the same time keeping spending under control.  It is no wonder, having listened to the commentators on television this evening, that the only people who have nothing good to say about this budget are the members of the Opposition parties.  I can see why Senator Doyle is so disturbed.  The Opposition see that the Minister intends to remain in office and to guide the ship for the next four years.</P>
    <P>As an accountant I pay particular attention to the area of taxation.  There is no easy way of dealing with this issue.  The Minister cannot deliver on the three aspects: tax rates, personal allowances and tax bands.  He has made a fair attempt by giving serious tax cuts which are in line with the Programme for Government and with the hope of reducing the low rate of tax to 20 per cent and the high rate to 42 per cent.  If the economic climate allows, this will be reduced to 40 per cent, as is the situation in our nearest neighbour.</P>
    <P>There is also an increase in the personal tax allowance for widowed parents after a bereavement. People in this situation are very vulnerable and I have met people in my own practice who could not survive financially.</P>
    <P>I pay particular attention to the promise that cross Border workers will receive tax concessions. These are to be detailed in the Finance Bill.  I hope to see the day &mdash; and I think the plan is in train &mdash; when our tax rates will be the same as in Britain.  People are separated from us by the Border and people on both sides of the Border pay different rates of tax.  We live and socialise together and I hope that eventually the rates on both sides of the Border will be the same.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Governments have reduced income tax at all stages.  In 1984 the highest rate of income tax was 65 per cent.  Some people may not remember that; but I remember how complicated it was to deal, not alone with the high rate but with the various rates between it and the lowest. Fianna Fáil Governments have, since 1987, <Col N="1188" /> reduced the top rate from 58 per cent to 48 per cent so that we are down now to 46 per cent with 42 per cent in sight.  The standard rate of tax has reduced since 1987 from 35 per cent to 27 per cent.  Last year, having been given an economy that was very succesful, the Rainbow Government could reduce the tax rate by only 1 per cent. That is all they could do in their years in power. The Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party can feel very proud of his achievement.</P>
    <P>I am glad that corporation tax rates have been reduced, although many people will not be happy with the reductions.  An anomaly existed in this area over the years because there was relief for companies which exported goods and for manufacturing companies which only paid 10 per cent tax, while small businessmen with limited companies paid 50 per cent tax, which was subsequently reduced to 40 per cent.  As Senator Quinn said, these people create employment so they should get tax relief.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister has cut taxes, he has also shown caution.  The ESRI report states that this boom will not last forever.  The Minister has recognised that by not allowing the economy to overheat as happened in Britain.  I have great faith in his ability to ensure that our economy remains successful in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to put on the record that we have never had a debate on the budget at such an early stage in the Seanad and Senator Ross should take credit for using his Private Members' time to do so.  There is no reason such a debate could not take place every year and I ask the Leader to bear that in mind. That is the last point on which I will agree with Senator Ross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank God for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross took grave exception to the negotiations on Partnership 2000 because he felt the authority of the Oireachtas was being undermined by trade unionists and other people sitting in Government Buildings who were making decisions with IBEC, with whom he has a love hate relationship, and determining the direction of the economy.  While other changes could have been made in this budget, the commitment to give tax relief to the PAYE worker, which amounts to under £1 billion, has effectively been met with a year still to go in the agreement.  That is good for the stability of the country.  However, I regret that the Minister chose to do so on the basis of reducing the tax rates rather than widening the tax bands. This was done for obvious political gain because that is what the punters in the pubs will recognise as an improvement.  We now need to examine the thresholds at which people pay the higher rate of tax and at which they enter the tax net rather than the five year plan to reduce taxation to 20 per cent and 40 per cent.  Those two thresholds <Col N="1189" /> must be brought into line with other economies in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not spell out how he intends to improve the income tax position of cross-Border workers which causes serious difficulties. Many people, including teachers, live on one side of the Border and work on the other side.  Over the past two years I made representations to Deputy McCreevy when he was in Opposition and as Minister for Finance.  I look forward to seeing how he will resolve this issue.  People must pay their taxes but we must decide if they should be paid where they reside or where they work. They should not have to pay on both sides of the Border.  There will be winners and losers no matter what the Minister decides to do.  Perhaps an allowance could be introduced which might deal with both situations.</P>
      <P>I do not understand what the Minister said about tax breaks, tax concessions, tax shelters and tax avoidance or evasion.  It is unfair to say they are synonymous because they are not.  I do not agree with reducing BES funding from £1 million to £0.25 million.  It was a good idea to increase it from £0.25 million or £0.5 million to £1 million three budgets ago because businesses which were trying to develop could not raise funds.  Everyone, not least Senator Ross, knows that banks know nothing about risk capital as they do not take risks.  People invested in BES schemes, although many lost money.  Tipperary Crystal and Tintawn Curragh Carpets, for example, are in trouble. There were risks from the time banks gave guarantees, but that was eliminated five budgets ago.</P>
      <P>The BES scheme is a good opportunity for people, such as PAYE workers, to understand how industry works and to invest in the economy. There is nothing wrong with that because it is an investment in the country's future.  To develop an industry is the same as marketing tourism abroad at a cost of £3.5 million to the State, as outlined in the Minister's speech.  I did not hear a good explanation why that was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something funny about the scheme of tax reliefs for hotels.  I listened to debates on tourism over the years and I heard strong pleas to build a hotel in Leitrim.  County Roscommon could also do with help in that area, although it has a few good hotels.  Why is County Donegal included in that scheme?  One cannot compare Leitrim with Donegal in terms of tourism.  There are many hotels in Donegal and new ones will continue to be approved there.  During the last debate on tourism I proposed that tax breaks should be decided on the basis of projects rather than geographical areas, such as Dingle or Westport. There is something wrong if someone in Belmullet cannot get a grant to build a hotel but someone in Westport can get a full tax allowance to build one.  The project, not the area, should be considered for tax relief.  Someone can build a new hotel in Downings as long as they get people <Col N="1190" /> to invest in it.  I am not impressed by this old fashioned approach.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister did not take on board proposals I made to him about increasing the capitation grants to managers of primary schools.  The minor move towards helping the disadvantaged is only a pebble in the water which will not cause a ripple.  I guarantee that the partners in education, parents, management and ourselves, will pressurise the Government to give proper grant aid to primary schools.  This money is not for teachers but for those who run schools, with whom we share an interest.</P>
    <P>The budget failed to bring the people into the economy in a more effective way.  It is good that capital gains tax has been reduced from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, except for disposals of development land.  I welcome the changes in corporation tax to bring it into line with Europe.  I would have liked the Minister to make changes in employees' PRSI but, perhaps, we could consider that in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government identified seven main concerns in its Action Programme for the Millennium, of which taxation and the need for an inclusive society were two.  The Government recognised the need to reduce personal tax in order to reward effort and give people the incentive to take up work.  It stated that we would seek to establish an inclusive society where all citizens have the opportunity to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country &mdash; everyone should have the chance to contribute to the wealth of the nation and to share in the benefits of economic growth.</P>
      <P>The Government identified the following areas as priorities: people with disabilities, people benefiting from social welfare, carers looking after people at the home, and the need to tackle long-term unemployment.  Today's budget shows that this Government was not paying mere lip-service to these needs and priorities.  This Government is taking action.</P>
      <P>The Minister has produced a budget which addresses the key issues, as one would expect from a prudent yet farseeing individual.  They are the control of public spending, the correction of tax inequities and an acknowledgement of the role of the elderly and the reward which is due to them.</P>
      <P>The challenges which face us are the creation of the environment to allow for continued job creation, the containment of inflation and careful preparation for the future.  Nothing is certain and the economy must continue to grow and develop to ensure the creation of wealth, which will allow us to maintain the lifestyle to which we as a nation are slowly becoming accustomed.  This budget address specifically these key issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All proposals on public service pay must in future outline the implications for the pay bill. Surely that is the way to govern any country or run any company.  Nobody I know in business <Col N="1191" /> would take on a proposal without knowing how it would affect the bottom line.  Everybody will accept that public service pay must not grow out of all control.  Spending in this area reduces the money which is available to all other areas of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Taxation is another area which impacts on a huge number of individuals, single persons and married couples, part-time workers, old age pensioners, professionals, lone parents, high flyers, employers and the Government.  This budget reduces the personal tax rates to 24 and 46 per cent respectively.  Personal and PRSI allowances are increased, the standard bands are widened, exemption limits are increased, the widowed parent bereavement allowance is increased, the threshold for levies is increased, the allowance for the blind and incapacitated is increased, withholding tax is reduced, DIRT is reduced and tax relief for carers looking after family members in the home is being critically examined.  Let us be clear.  All of these measures mean one thing: more disposable income in everybody's pockets.</P>
    <P>In particular, I welcome the additional tax free allowance for the long-term unemployed returning to work and the allowances which are available to employers.  This imaginative measure is a serious move in the fight against long-term unemployment, one of the main problems facing us as we move into the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Another important issue for employers is the reduction in corporation tax from 36 to 32 per cent, while the rate on the first £50,000 is being reduced to 25 per cent.  As a person with a small business, I know that all of small manufacturing and services companies will welcome this.  It will continue to provide businesses with the incentives necessary to make profits as they will benefit more and more from each extra pound of profit.</P>
    <P>In the area of social inclusion, I want to focus in particular on child income support, family income support and employment support services. Child benefit is increased and, where a parent has twins, it is paid at 150 per cent of the normal rate, nearly enough to make you want twins.  The grant payable on the birth of three or more is to be increased to £500 and a new grant introduced when the children reach the ages of four and 12.  This can only be welcomed by anybody who has received money in that particular situation.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement will be assessed on earnings net of income tax and income thresholds will be increased by £7 per week.</P>
    <P>The number of places available on the back to work allowance scheme will be increased by 5,000.  This is another measure which is geared at assisting the unemployed to return to work and it is extremely welcome.</P>
    <P>Carers will receive their own free travel passes, with the carer's allowance being extended for six weeks after the death of the person being cared for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> The Minister has also allocated £7 million to a programme for people with a mental handicap, £3 million to people with a physical or sensory disability, and £1.5 million to the psychiatric services. He has allocated £4 million for the hospital waiting initiative, an additional £3.5 million for dental services, £5 million for new acute hospital units, £5 million for cancer treatment and £2.5 million for accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>While I must admit disappointment that child care tax relief is not included yet by the Minister, I welcome his continued commitment to this issue and his acknowledgement that it will, and must, be dealt with in the very near future.  The importance of dealing with this issue in a pragmatic and operational way is second to none and I am happy to wait until our next budget to ensure all angles are covered in this vital area.  I applaud the Minister's courage in ensuring that he does not approach this complex and difficult area in an emotive and bulldozer fashion as outlined earlier this evening here.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes to increase jobs, investment and tax revenue and he has introduced a clear manner of doing so in today's budget, all the time continuing to reduce the tax burden and tax rates on the PAYE sector and on earned income generally.</P>
    <P>This budget is well thought out.  It is proactive rather than reactive.  It delivers on tax reform, and recognises and rewards effort.  It helps us prepare for the future, ensuring that the economy will continue to grow and everybody will benefit from the continued and deserved prosperity of the nation.  I commend the Minister and the Government on their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to do so until interrupted by the Leader.</P>
      <P>It is good that we have taken the initiative to have a debate on the budget at the earliest possible moment.  It was anomalous that while the budget was discussed in the other House, we could not debate it until well into the new year. We now have an opportunity to discuss it at the same time as the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, on those aspects of the budget which I found attractive, but a number of other features were disappointing.  He had an opportunity to present the best budget of all time.  The economy has been exceptionally well run by successive Governments in the nineties.  It is now on a stable footing and for the first time we have a budget surplus and a large amount of money available for distribution.  I am glad that certain categories, such as old age pensioners and widows, have been granted a hefty increase.  I am not satisfied with other social welfare increases or the tax changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a deviation from the direction taken by budgets in the last few years, including those of the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil/Labour Coalition in 1993-4.  The thrust of those budgets was to make money available to the less well off, people in poorly paid or part-time employment, and participants in community employment schemes. The idea was to create as much equity as possible in the distribution of surplus money, but that has not been maintained &mdash; it seems this is what the Progressive Democrats call &ldquo;payback time&rdquo;.  Previous budgets in the nineties did not alter the top rate of tax, currently 48 per cent, although the standard rate was decreased in the last budget. Those other budgets broadened the standard rate band, the threshold at which tax is imposed; last year it was widened by £500 but this year the <Col N="1194" /> increase was only £100, which is tiny.  The thrust has been diluted considerably and Fianna Fáil's promise has been broken.  This is essentially a PD budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is negative as usual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which puts its emphasis on the top rate and corporation tax.  Another commitment was broken in that area.  The proposed lower rate of 20 per cent has not been introduced. The present Minister for Finance virtually staked his reputation on retaining the corporation tax rate of 10 per cent but he has now done a U-turn by agreeing to raise it to 12.5 per cent, the rate struck by the previous coalition Government.</P>
      <P>I am also disappointed that the increases in child benefit and family income supplement will not be paid until the autumn, almost 12 months from now.  There has been no attempt to improve the lot of the less well off.  For example, there is no provision for adult literacy, a subject we discussed earlier.  There is no provision for the socially excluded; there is merely a promise to look at child care and to establish a committee on care in the community.  The income tax take will increase by 6.3 per cent but the capital tax take will decrease by 10.4 per cent, which gives a good idea of the thrust of the budget.  The Minister had a great opportunity but he has squandered it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident from this debate that the Minister has got the balance right, since both Senator Ross and Senator Ryan, who are at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, are complimentary about the budget.  I am sad that my colleague from Wexford has abandoned the Chamber as I hoped she would be here to listen to me.  Like Deputy Noonan, she mentioned that the Government had the best set of financial results since Michael Collins.  It shows an abysmal ignorance of history to infer or suggest that Collins inherited a benign economic position from Britain when we gained independence.</P>
      <P>Also, a degree of short-sightedness is shown in these comments in that the foundations of the present economic boom were laid in 1987, following the disastrous growth in public expenditure under the coalition Government led by Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  The social partnership agreements, which have contributed so much to underpinning our economic growth in the last decade, were also initiated during Mr. Ray MacSharry's term as Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputy Noonan and Senator Doyle overlooked the profligacy of the last Government, which did a great deal of damage to public expenditure during its two and a half years in office. But for the recent correction made by the electorate, <Col N="1195" /> we could have had a similar scenario to that inherited in 1987.  The Minister drew attention to one aspect of this increase &mdash; public service pay grew by an alarming 10.5 per cent between 1996 and 1997 and a built in 6 per cent is leading into next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has balanced this by ensuring that the marginalised who have not yet enjoyed the benefit of the growth in our economy &mdash; the Celtic tiger &mdash; are catered for in this budget.  The socially inclusive aspects of the package are to be commended.  As he pointed out, the taxation increase of £282 million will ensure that the partnership target of £525 million will be reached within its first two years.  The social welfare increases are to be welcomed, particularly the £5 per week increase in the old age pension, which is three times the rate of inflation.  That is a measure of the commitment to care for our elderly and marginalised.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement will now be calculated on net rather than gross income, which is a long overdue amendment of the scheme.  The basic allowance will increase from £11 to £15 per week.  An unheralded aspect of the budget is the extension of free travel to carers, which is to be welcomed.  The introduction of free travel for the elderly was one of the great initiatives introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Haughey and it has done much to enhance the lives of the elderly at very little cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The package of £3 million for people with physical or sensory disabilities has already been mentioned.  We should also welcome the 1,000 extra places on the part-time jobs option which will cost £70 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Widows deserve special recognition.  Widows with children will get an increase in the tax free allowance from £1,500 to £5,000 in the first year after bereavement.  Given that many women work and have an income this is a welcome development. The Minister should be commended for tapering this relief over five rather than three years.  All these tax exemption limits will remove 15,000 people from the income tax net.</P>
    <P>The initiatives for helping the long-term unemployed, especially the tax free allowance of £3,000, are innovative and welcome.  Unemployment is the one economic indicator that has failed to move as we would wish.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures on taxation, including the reduction in the income tax rates from 48 per cent to 46 per cent and from 26 per cent to 24 per cent.  However, the Minister might have considered retaining the 48 per cent rate for high earners, especially for those earning between £100,000 to £200,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister reconsider the figures for the BES scheme?  The reduction from £1 million to £250,000 is alarming and may not be a sufficient quantum of money to kick start a business.  Perhaps it could be increased to £500,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> I compliment the Minister on the budget.  It cares for the needy, rewards effort and risk takers and sets out a strategy to preserve our economic growth for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the budget, especially the social welfare provisions.  I also welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Wallace, to the House.  She started her Oireachtas career in Seanad Éireann.  Given that this is European Day for the Disabled, I congratulate her on her new appointment.  She must be pleased that funding of £24.15 million is being made available by the Minister for Health and Children for services for people with disabilities.  The Government is committed to enhancing opportunities for people with disabilities to achieve independent living and community integration.  I congratulate the Minister of State on this achievement so soon after taking office.  I also welcome the provision of £100,000 for the Irish Hospice Foundation and £100,000 for that great lady, Sister Consilio and her Cluain Mhuire hospital, which she has been running on pennies for years.</P>
      <P>The allocation for tourism is to be welcomed. The Ryder Cup will be staged in Ireland in a few years and the <i>Tour de France</i> will be launched here next year.  These events help to bring people to Ireland and maintain tourism numbers.  I also welcome the substantial allocation of £20 million for the development of Croke Park over the next three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is present I will concentrate on some aspects of the budget which are of importance to women.  I am disappointed that the tax exemption thresholds have not been further increased.  Women are paid less than men &mdash; they get approximately 70 per cent of the average industrial wage.  Any increase in that area would have meant a great deal to them.  I regret that the tax exemption threshold still stands at approximately £4,100.  It is an exceptionally low figure for elderly retired women.  For example, women over the age of 85, of whom there are far more than men, on occupational pensions of not much more than £100 per week will still pay tax.  It is most unfortunate that a bigger effort was not made to exclude them from the tax net.  While the tax rates are lower, it would have made a bigger difference if an additional few hundred pounds had been added to the tax exemption thresholds.</P>
      <P>I am glad that marriage counselling and mediation services have been given much needed funding.  Money must be put into this if we mean to tackle the problem of marriage breakdown.  I am also pleased that back to work schemes have not only been increased in terms of numbers but also in terms of the areas to which they apply. This is another area of importance to women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> The extension of free travel to carers is important.  However, more money should have been provided for respite care.  Perhaps the Minister of State will promote these areas.  Respite care has been given very little funding over the years; indeed, there are some areas where no respite care is available.</P>
    <P>We are inclined to introduce legislation without adequate concern for its funding.  I therefore applaud the Government for at least providing additional funding for the child protection services. These are much needed services and I hope this funding will be directed towards them.</P>
    <P>It is important that the funding for people with disabilities is wisely spent.  However, no provision is made for personal care assistance or allowances. Senators have applauded the allocation of £20 million to the GAA.  I am glad Sister Consilio was allocated money.  However, what about Sister Mary Joseph in the Dublin south inner city area, who asked me to try to get money for sports facilities in that area to try to help juveniles who become involved in drugs?  She sought only £3.5 million to set up a huge complex.  Yet £3 million has been allocated for sports facilities.  How much of this will be allocated to tourism?  Can we not spend money in areas where sports facilities are urgently needed?  A sum of £3.5 million would have enabled Sister Mary Joseph to do a huge amount of work which could make a major difference towards the culture of dependency in our inner city areas.  I am very disappointed that this has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that increases in social welfare benefits have been provided.  They are badly needed.  While I am glad that increases in tax relief are being provided to charities, we are doing nothing about providing tax relief for private sources and corporations in respect of contributions to funds of the kind proposed to be established under the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for contributing to the debate.  Understandably, it has been used by Members to make special pleadings.  With regard to the remarks of Senator Henry on my soft left and Senator Ryan on my hard left, I do not disagree with what they said, nor with the special pleading which other Members have made on behalf of their pet projects.  However, that is easy to do.  Let me make a special plea to them.  If Members request more money for various projects they should tell the House how the money will be provided.  That is what the Minister for Finance did today.  He outlined how he proposed to take money from one source and give it to another.  However, those making special pleadings for good causes never say from where the money will come.  It is one of the luxuries of not being in Government, but it is an obligation of which they should be aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> I resent the accusations that believers in the free market do not have a social conscience &mdash; a phrase which has been bandied about in the House.  Social consciences do not belong exclusively to the left; they belong to everybody. However, some people are a little more realistic about their social conscience than others.  These people share the sympathy for the poor, for women and for other groups in society, but they concede that others feel that way and they do not believe that changes can be made overnight.</P>
    <P>A budget is about saying where the money will come from.  I agree with those who called for more money for the elderly, the disabled and the blind.  I applaud the Minister for Finance for the measures he has taken for those groups. However, we cannot give money to everybody without saying where the taxes will be increased to fund it.  That is a message which does not come from Opposition parties, but that is the nature of politics.</P>
    <P>With regard to capital gains tax, I agree with what Senator Brendan Ryan said about share options.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The point he made was absolutely correct.  They are a problem in the free enterprise sector in which I work.  In certain cases they are immoral and unjust and they should not be granted in such circumstances.  However, capital gains tax was punitive to those who made small gains &mdash; not those who made hundreds of thousands of pounds, but to those who made a couple of thousand pounds.  That is why we should welcome the reduction.  It is not welcome for those who make millions on share options and I have no sympathy for them.</P>

      <P>It is easy to misrepresent those who tackle public service pay, who maintain that we have a good public service and who ask why the public service should be victimised.  I do not disagree with those who maintain that on the whole we have a good public service.  However, let me not be misinterpreted &mdash; public servants are privileged to have security of employment, to be well paid and to have received pay increases in excess of the private sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Dr. Haughey Dr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the adjournment of the debate I was talking about the issue of tax incentives to encourage corporate bodies, individuals and other institutions to make contributions to this innovative fund.  Provision should be made for tax incentives in the Finance Bill, but an amount of work is needed to include tax incentives for primary and second level education.  Provision has already been made for third level education.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn expressed concern that the £250 million which the Government has promised may not be included in the overall sum and that any private sector contribution would be deducted from that amount.  I would be annoyed if the Government was to welsh on a definite statement that in the period 1998-2000 this sum will be made available.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the numerous references in the Bill to the Department of Finance. However, control through an administrative system is essential and we cannot allow one Department free reign over another.  I hope the <i>status quo</i> will remain and the Department of Education and Science will have discretion within spending limits.</P>
      <P>The Minister set out the sectors which will receive allocations and the relevant amounts. Those who listened to him must agree that we are putting forward sensible and innovative legislation to cater for young people for the next two generations.  There will be £20 million available for crafts, £20 million for vocational education, £80 million for infrastructure, £30 million for third level education equipment, £15 million for research and development and £25 million for schools in the Schools IT 2000 programme.  That represents a large amount of money fairly shared across the board.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not cover tax incentives to encourage corporate bodies to make donations or institutions to compete with other bodies, such as universities, for contributions from people who are in a position to bestow them.  I urge the Minister to sympathetically consider a system which would encourage individuals to contribute money.  The fact that no provision has been made so far for first and second level education must cause concern.  I urge the Minister to put this matter at the top of his agenda.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and I compliment the Minister and the Government for introducing this innovative legislation.  It is the first legislation to involve the public and private sectors and hopefully they will come together in a synergistic effort to promote the welfare of our youth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as somebody who has been involved in research.  It is a tremendous <Col N="1200" /> boost to everybody who has been campaigning for significant investment in scientific and technological education and training for many years.  The heavy hand of the Department of Finance is much in evidence and while I am confident about the £1 billion that has been promised for next year, there is a caveat regarding funding in the following two years.  I hope the Celtic tiger does not turn into a rug, as Deputy Noonan suggested in the other House, and lower amounts are directed towards this area in 1999 and 2000.  It is important that funds are available for a reasonable length of time in this area so that plans can be made to apply them properly.  I am also worried that there is no mention of the administrative costs of the programme.  Will they come from the funds set aside under the Bill?</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Haughey's point about the importance of addressing primary and second level education.  Provision has been made for the spending of some money in those areas. However, the further we progress in discussions about scientific and technological developments, the more we realise it is important to provide funds at primary and second level.  This ensures that children begin to consider these areas as options in education rather than arriving at third level and discovering they do not have the background knowledge which would allow them enter those fields.  School pupils must be technically literate, have a good knowledge of science and have chosen scientific subjects at an early stage so they can use them at third level.</P>
      <P>It is essential to avoid increasing skills shortages that are developing in Ireland so that we remain attractive to overseas companies.  More importantly, in ensuring that skilled people are available to service indigenous companies, we must be careful not to select flavour of the moment skills shortage areas.  For example, in terms of the area in which Senator Haughey has most knowledge, there is a shortage of pharmacists. As the Minister is aware, the school of pharmacy is small and it takes time to make changes in that area.  We must look ahead to ensure shortages do not develop further.</P>
      <P>The large pharmaceutical industry is already importing many graduates from abroad.  It is a great pity, given the growth of the pharmaceutical industry, that the need for more graduates in this area was not anticipated.  The computer area was addressed, but it is also a sector where we did not look far enough ahead.  In view of that, I urge the Minister to divert as much money as possible towards teacher training.  If teachers at second level do not have in service training and the skills to pass on to their pupils, a problem will develop at third level in terms of suitable students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems arise at third level, such as academic contracts which include the longest hours in Europe.  It appears that will worsen rather than improve.  Without adequate investment in teachers at second and third levels in these areas and despite the best efforts of academic staff in universities, regional technical colleges and the <Col N="1201" /> Dublin Institute of Technology, the quality of graduates will suffer.  We cannot afford to replace one problem with another; the shortage of people cannot be replaced by poor quality graduates.</P>
    <P>Another problem I have frequently mentioned is the role of research in all third level institutions. The skills of those working in research must be constantly improved.  Education in this area must be supported and it is not only a case of providing money.  Time must be made available.  I am concerned about postgraduates being used for an enormous amount of service work.  Time must be provided for the research they are undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Minister's new fund provides huge opportunities for new programmes, new funding mechanisms and new ideas to maximise the research resources which exist in colleges.  We should not be afraid to be bold.  Many ideas could succeed and I commend them to the Minister.  For example, the support of long-term research projects is vital.  Funding is available for three years; but even with improved technological methods, that is a very short time for many research programmes. New staff positions in teaching and research need to be funded so people have adequate time to deal with these areas.  There is international competition for our post doctoral research scientists.  We must understand that and ensure they have the resources they need.  Otherwise, they will go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Much of our current research is devoted to becoming involved in international schemes.  This is good, but it is also important to encourage intra national co-operation between researchers in different third level institutions, either with or without an industrial input.  This could be done by giving new types of grants under which people must co-operate with other institutions.  This happens in Germany and similar projects could be established in Ireland to ensure there is co-operation on an all-island basis.</P>
    <P>Nutritional and genetic research programmes are ongoing and there are other areas in which projects could be initiated.  Interdisciplinary projects should be encouraged and better resourced. The interface between research in various disciplines could be addressed, for example, between orthopaedics and the development of durable and biologically compatible joint replacements. This area is extraordinarily important.</P>
    <P>The Irish Research Scientists Association is currently setting up an expertise register as a resource for Irish and multinational industries to support their research and to find research partners for overseas companies.  The Minister should support this type of effort.  Awareness among the public about the value of Irish research should be promoted.  For example, my colleague, Dr. Owen Smith, who was researching coagulation and blood products, has brought forward tremendous research on the use of Protein C in meningococcal septicaemia.</P>
    <P>Work must also be carried out on the next generation of telecommunication traffic switch <Col N="1202" /> stores.  We must remember that new developments in these areas make the public aware of their importance.</P>
    <P>I commend the Irish Research Scientists Association for informing local radio stations and newspapers about important awards presented to Irish scientists, many of whom are junior professionals in their fields.  Hearing that a local man or woman has made good makes the public realise the importance of these areas.</P>
    <P>The practice of offering people 75 per cent of their grants should be discouraged and, where possible, full funding should be provided.  A project must be developed to its fullest irrespective of whether 75 per cent of a grant or the entire amount is provided.  If adequate resources are not provided, it is usually the project which suffers.</P>
    <P>Postgraduates should be paid proper salaries &mdash; perhaps £5,500 plus fees.  On a previous occasion I pointed out that Forbairt grants do not cover course fees, which might amount to £2,500.  This means that 50 per cent of a student's grant is used on paying fees and they are, in effect, working for £2 or £3 per hour.  That is incredible when one considers the amount of work they do and its value to the country.  It is important that postgraduates receive proper funding.</P>
    <P>Ireland is very poorly represented on international research organisations.  Having served on several of these bodies, I cannot understand why we do not increase our investment in this area because of the spin-off effect it could have on tourism.  Anyone from Ireland who is involved with an international medical or scientific organisation trying to arrange a venue for its next meeting usually keep their heads down because this country is generally the popular choice to host international meetings.  I recognise that those involved must put enormous work into the organisation of such meetings.  Therefore, Irish research workers must be given some aid towards becoming involved in international organisations.  We must be remember that their involvement may be of great value to this country.  Fees for involvement in an international organisation can be quite high and I would be grateful if the Minister &mdash; without delving into the grant provided for research &mdash; could discover a way to subsidise those fees.</P>
    <P>Irish research requires a global presence because we are not as isolated as heretofore.  It is important to make our mark internationally.  The great changes in communication have made a major difference in this area.  These organisations have become almost virtual research institutions, with the assistance of the Internet, etc.  We must ensure that we make the best use of advances in this area, which can be done at minimum expense.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Universities Bill I highlighted the fact that we sometimes have to buy in research expertise.  This may mean paying international researchers large amounts of money to come to Ireland to become involved in research projects.  I raised this issue when, on the <Col N="1203" /> Universities Bill, we attempted to place a cap on the amount various professors could be paid.  As I pointed out to our former colleague, Professor Joe Lee, professors of history come much cheaper than their counterparts in engineering, polymer physics or genetics.  This must be taken into account when attempting to promote these areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill allocates £30 million to update research equipment, which is good.  However, it is estimated that there is a current shortfall of between £50 million and £80 million in bringing such equipment, some of which is considered dangerous, up to date.  On a previous occasion I pointed out that a piece of equipment in a hospital with which I am familiar, and which shall remain nameless, was so old it had to be repaired using a part obtained from a museum situated at the factory in Germany where the machine was built.  In other institutions it was decided that researchers should discontinue using radiological equipment because of the dangers involved.  We cannot expect Irish researchers to perform internationally when they are obliged to deal with outdated equipment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the location of the fund with the National Treasury Management Agency because it will be untouchable.  It would be better not to develop any further quangos.  The Department of Health and Children and the office of science and technology are equipped with dependable, transparent, fair and accountable means to bring forward research funding.  The Health Research Board and the National Research Support Fund Board also have the confidence of the research community and the public purseholders.  I hope we do not run into the sort of problems encountered with the Wellcome Trust where VAT was deducted from the money allocated for health research work.  We very nearly lost more money for such research than the State was providing at that time.</P>
    <P>Like Senators Haughey and Quinn, I am disappointed that action has not been taken in respect of tax relief on funding from the private and corporate sectors.  It is very difficult to attract such funding.  We in Ireland are competing on an international basis.  I would be glad if the Minister for Finance would recognise that fact and try to do something about it.  Where there is a shortfall from public funding, support mechanisms must be put in place to enable people to try to obtain money from private and corporate interests.  It was for this reason that Trinity College fought strongly to maintain the separation between private and public funds for the university because of the reticence on the part of some private contributors to give money if they believe they are merely displacing funds which should be provided from the public purse.  Such funding is of great importance in promoting the education and training of Ireland's Celtic tiger cubs.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>Is mór an onóir dom teacht go dtí Seanad Éireann chun freastal ar an mBille um gCiste Oideachais Eolaíochta agus Teicneolaíochta (Infhéistíocht) agus ba mhaith liom, ó chroí, thar ceann an Rialtais agus thar ceann an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, buíochas a ghabháil do na Seanadóirí uilig a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht thábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>I would like to sincerely thank all Senators for their interesting and incisive contributions on this most important Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is imaginative, innovative, important and historic.  It is important because it points up and emphasises the Government's real commitment to developing high level scientific and technological skills in support of our national economy. It is historic in that it is the first time such a massive injection of capital funding is being committed to the education sector.  In addition, the proposals in the Bill are both innovative and imaginative.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science, and others have spoken today of the need to keep abreast of the rapidly developing technologies.  It is an unfortunate fact that despite the rapid growth in student numbers, particularly in regional technical colleges and the institutes of technology, the physical infrastructure of these institutions did not keep pace with this growth. Notwithstanding the shortcomings in accommodation and equipment, the institutions, nevertheless, maintained a high level of quality in their output.  The availability of highly skilled technicians, diplomates and graduates has played a major part in developing the high technology section of Irish industry in both multinational and indigenous companies.  This industry has, in turn, contributed greatly to our achieving a thriving economy, which is an amazement to and the envy of our European partners.</P>
      <P>It is time, however, to recognise that the technological sector of education is in need of a major capital injection and this Bill provides the framework for this injection.  I recently announced a major initiative involving a total investment of £1.5 million over the next two years, in advanced software technologies.  When launching that initiative, which will draw on the expertise of the universities, I said that Ireland has now firmly established itself as a software capital of Europe and that in order to cement this position in the future, continued reinvestment in the sector is crucial.  To put the matter in context, we should appreciate that seven of the top ten independent software companies have major operations here and that annual output from the sector is of the order of $5 billion.  Apart from direct investment in the industry, it is vital that we also invest in the institutions providing the graduates and high level technicians to source the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Action Programme for a New Millennium, published by the Government, gave a strong commitment to the development of science, technology and innovation.  The commitment is to the <Col N="1205" /> development of an STI infrastructure capable of supporting the researchers, technicians and innovators needed to underpin the competitiveness of Irish firms in the dynamic global environment of the new millennium.  The policy document recognised the importance of continuing to attract high technology industry to Ireland and promised to increase the throughput of electronic and computer graduates in our higher education institutions. The programme also committed the Government to addressing training deficiencies in the tourism area.  It is to the credit of the Government that it moved so swiftly to fulfil the commitments in its action programme.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Bill there has been much emphasis on high level technological and scientific education, and rightly so.  The policy behind the Bill has a much broader perspective.  It addresses the needs of, and provides for investment in, all levels of education in the area of modern technology and communications.</P>
    <P>The Schools Information Technology 2000 Initiative, which was launched recently, will ensure there will be at least 60,000 computers in Irish schools within the next three years.  This means that pupils in primary and secondary schools will benefit from this major investment in computer technology.  We must accept that at present Ireland is not on equal footing with other European countries in the integration of information and communication technologies, both in first and second level education.  The Schools Information Technology 2000 Programme aims to redress the balance and bring our first and second level students up to the levels of computer literacy on a par with more advanced European countries. We are relying on a wide-ranging partnership to bring this about, a partnership between the State, parents, schools, local communities, third level institutions and the rapidly growing private sector.  In terms of capital investment for hardware and software equipment, the investment fund pledges a State investment of £25 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to first and second level pupils, the investment fund will provide infrastructure support for apprenticeships in the colleges and institutes of technology.  It will address also the capital needs in the further education area.  This is a sector where dramatic developments have taken place in a relatively short time.  From fairly modest beginnings, pioneering vocational preparation and training courses, it has grown into a substantial further education sector where in excess of 18,000 students are following a great variety of post-leaving certificate courses, many of them in technological areas.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken of the third level sector and its remit in producing high skilled technicians and graduates.  In addition, the fund will provide for research development and technology transfer. This will involve highly educated and highly skilled post graduates working at the leading edge of science and technology.  Thus the wide focus of the fund mirrors in the area of modern technology <Col N="1206" /> the continuum of education from primary, through second, further and higher education to the highest level of post-graduate activity.  The purpose for which the fund was set up, therefore, represents a coherent policy to develop technological experience and education through the entire education sector.</P>
    <P>A sum of £250 million, in addition to the normal annual Estimates which the fund will provide &mdash; we are leaving aside any contributions which may come from private sources &mdash; represents a very large investment by any standards.  It might be said that this money should be invested instead in other areas of education.  This has been suggested throughout the debate here this evening. While I appreciate that this may, indeed, be argued, I suggest that this is not an &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; situation.  The Government is prepared to address all aspects of education, but the investment fund is a special case.  It is there to meet a very specific need at all levels of our education in the context of a hugely technological-orientated world. Investment of the kind in question, though modest up to now, has reaped a rich harvest for the national economy and for the wellbeing of our people.</P>
    <P>It is timely to give technological development a further boost in order to maintain our economic growth.  I know I am not alone in that view.  Public reaction to the Government's initiative has been almost universally favourable.  This has been symbolised here this evening by the positive contributions of the vast majority of Members of this House.  This is very gratifying.  Inevitably, we are told that £250 million over a three year period will not be enough.  One newspaper editorial gave the opinion that compared to the long-term requirements, the proposed sums of money involved are modest enough.  I would not describe an investment of £250 million as modest by any standard, at any time.  However, in view of the speed with which modern communications and information technology is changing, it is difficult to gauge what future investment needs may be. This is one of the reasons we propose to monitor carefully in the future emerging skill needs so that we can ensure our education and training institutions can readily adapt to changing requirements.</P>
    <P>In this area, too, the benefit of partnership is recognised.  It is of particular interest to me, with a foot in both Departments, that both the Tánaiste and the Minister for Education and Science are to co-chair an education-business forum with wideranging representation.  Emerging skills requirements will be monitored and assessed by an expert group.  Decisions aimed at addressing these needs will be driven by a high powered implementation group.  Thus the various interests of State, higher education and business will work together to identify areas for attention and will monitor progress towards meeting needs.</P>
    <P>I will now turn my attention to some points raised by Senators throughout the debate today. Senator Coogan asked specifically what the <Col N="1207" /> framework would be for spending private donations to the new fund.  He is a third level professional and has his finger on the pulse.  The Bill provides for donors to lay down conditions as to how their donations might be used provided the conditions are not in conflict with the Bill.  Where conditions are not laid down, expenditure of donations will be on the same basis as Exchequer funds, namely, through consultation and in accordance with priorities at any particular time.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde referred to the need for young people to be made aware of where the jobs are and the qualifications necessary to get these jobs.  It is proposed that a partnership between all the relevant agencies of State and private business be set up to identify skills needs and monitor the progress of decisions made to meet these needs.  These are the areas in which job opportunities will arise and young people will be kept abreast of such opportunities at all times.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned VAT on educational equipment and I am sure he has already made strong representations to the Minister for Finance in this regard.  He also made a number of valid points about teacher training in new technologies, as did Senator Henry.  This will be taken on board.  Senator O'Toole put down a marker that schools which, through their own efforts, are already to the fore in computer equipment should not be penalised in the shareout of computer equipment.  His point is well made and will be taken on board.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill emphasised the need for a suitable training programme in new technologies for teachers.  I assure the Senator and the House that the lesson has been learned that equipment without the people to benefit from it is worthless.  Part of the Information Technology 2000 Programme will be training of a minimum 20,000 teachers in tandem with the introduction of computers in the schools.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello raised the constitutionality of introducing this Bill initially in the Seanad on the basis that it may be a Money Bill.  That matter was raised before it was decided to introduce the Bill in the Seanad.  This is not, in itself, a Money Bill.  The money involved is voted for by the Dáil through the Estimates process for the Department of Education and Science and will be paid into the fund.  The legislation provides for that and deals with the mechanics of the fund's operation. The money will be paid into the fund and the legal framework for the operation of the fund is included in the Bill.  This is standard procedure with any Bill and there is no constitutional conflict inherent in it.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn stated that the Bill only provides for payment of £100 million into the fund in 1998 and no commitment is given to Exchequer payments beyond that.  I assure the Senator and the House that this Government is absolutely committed to providing not only the £100 million for 1998 but an additional £150 million over 1999 and the year 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> At the launch of this initiative on 6 November, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Education and Science all confirmed this Government's decision to provide a total of £250 million of Exchequer money to the fund over the next three years.  That is our <i>de facto</i> position.  This decision will facilitate immediate initiation, planning and implementation of a capital programme within the framework of the £250 million. Obviously, once the programme has commenced, contractual commitments will have been made and the balance of the money for 1999 and 2000 will be provided.  While the Bill is framed in normal, careful, legal language the Government's commitment to it is unequivocal.  I ask the House to accept that; we mean business.</P>
    <P>The Government has no intention of using money in the private investment account as a substitution for State money.  The Bill is careful to ensure that private money will not be part of general Exchequer funds but will be held in a separate account.  This will safeguard the private donations and reassure private donors.  Further reassurance is given through the provision that money donated cannot be used for purposes other than those provided for in the Bill.  The existence of the private investment account in the fund is to enable private donations to be made if donors so wish.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science has already stated he expects that major private donations will continue to be made directly to the institutions, not to the fund.  The operation of a fund of this kind is, in fact, much more suitable to a rolling programme of capital investment than is the normal Estimates operation which provides that money expended at the end of any financial year is returned to the Exchequer.  This disadvantage does not arise in the case of this fund.  This is a dedicated, technological investment education fund which will be handled by the National Treasury Management Agency.  The NTMA is one of the gems of public service in this country and an international centre of excellence in international currency and debt management.  The NTMA will be able to use the funds and protect them in a dedicated fashion for this particular technological education investment fund and will be in a position to ensure the country gets the maximum use of the fund and the resources therein at all times.</P>
    <P>While under current arrangements the sanction of the Minister for Finance is required for payments, the Department operates under a system of delegated sanctions which obviate the need for seeking sanctions in individual cases.  The same arrangements will apply in the case of money expended from the fund.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Henry for her positive and detailed contribution.  Like Senator Coogan, she is a professional in the third level sector and is familiar with what is happening there.  I know she is positively disposed towards achieving equality of opportunity in the technical and scientific fields of education.  Under the late great Donogh O'Malley we created equality of opportunity for <Col N="1209" /> all the children of the nation and that principle has evolved through our education system.  We must strive for further equalisation under that system so that students will have options, education will be provided and technological skills will be imparted.  That will ensure that job opportunities, resulting from the boom of the Celtic tiger, can be sustained into the future and we will have the kind of skilled graduates who can avail of them and ensure that this country will not lose out as we leave this century and prepare for the next millennium.</P>
    <P>I recommend the terms of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Bill, 1997, to the House.  It is a Bill which provides for investment in an area of modern society without which this country would stagnate economically. We owe it to our young people to provide them with the skills and knowledge necessary in a technological world and to ensure the economy they inherit will be relevant, developing and capable of providing them with sound employment and a high standard of living.  The Bill provides for dedicated investment which, in effect, we have no choice but to make, an investment which we can confidently expect will repay the country in large measure as we face the growing opportunities of a new millennium.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am calling on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to address the issue of his Department's responsibility in relation to the Castlerea Town Trust, County Roscommon, otherwise known as the demesne townland, Castlerea, County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter because of strong representations made to me by the people of Castlerea who have provided me with reams of signatures because of their disquiet at the developing trends on the town's demesne.  The town demesne is an <Col N="1210" /> open recreational amenity park which runs right through the town centre and which local people use for leisure purposes.  Castlerea is one of the few towns I know of which has such a park.  The park is cherished and used extensively by the people of Castlerea and they are very upset about proposed developments for it, namely, a proposal to build houses there.  They have made their objections known to the local planning authority which granted planning permission and the matter has been referred to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what responsibility, if any, the Department of Agriculture and Food has for this demesne.  It has been brought to my attention by the people of Castlerea, and particularly by the residents of Ballindrimley, that the Department of Agriculture and Food has an overriding say in proposed developments for the town demesne.  The Castlerea Town Trust which seems to have responsibility for administering this park does not seem to have a final say in the disposal of property from the demesne and that is the issue I raise tonight.</P>
    <P>The town trust does not appear to be answerable to anybody, is not elected, refuses to discuss the business of the town demense with any local representative group, appears to be an independent body in its own right and has administered the park without taking into consideration the views or objections of the people of Castlerea.  It is undemocratic.  The disposal of and, as far as some people are concerned, the desecration of a town park by building houses on it should not be left to people who do not have the support of the local population.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister of State outline the involvement of his Department in this matter?  What and how many safeguards can he offer to protect the interests of the people of Castlerea with regard to their well preserved and cherished park?  Public representatives have a responsibility to speak on behalf of people when they do not appear to have a voice about a matter that is precious to them. It is extraordinary that the population of the town of Castlerea cannot or will not be given a voice in the future of its park.  Indeed, it is extraordinary that not even the local authority seems to have authority in this matter.  It is absurd and unhealthy that a number of people who have a vested interest in the park, in so far as they disposed of some of the property to some of their members, should have such a large say in what is considered to be a public property.</P>
    <P>The view of the people of Castlerea, which was expressed to me in the strongest terms, is that they object strenuously to a number of people who are answerable to nobody interfering with and disposing of a recreational area which is part of their town's heritage.  If the Minister of State does not have the authority to dictate what should happen with the town park, we should <Col N="1211" /> introduce legislation; hopefully, it will not come to that.  However, democracy must not only work but be seen to work.  At present it does not appear to exist or work as far as the people of Castlerea are concerned.</P>
    <P>As public representatives we have a duty to ensure that a public amenity which has been available to Castlerea for generations should remain that way.  The developers, vested interests and others who are not answerable to the public should not have the final say and should not be able to dispose of what is, by right, the property of the people of Castlerea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear of this proposal.  Over its long history the Land Commission provided many plots of land for use by local communities as sports fields, fair-grounds, cow parks and so forth.  In each case a trust was set up to oversee the management of the lands and the trustees, who were appointed by the Minister, were registered as legal owners of the lands.  The Department is still responsible for overseeing the administration of these trusts, that is, for replacing trustees, arbitrating in disputes and so forth, and this gives rise to a substantial amount of work for scarce staff resources. The legislative provisions relating to the Land Commission trusts are contained in the Land Purchase Acts which set out the various circumstances under which trusts may be revoked and/or lands disposed of.  Any action taken on the part of trusts must obviously comply with these provisions.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Castlerea Town Trust a number of representations have recently been made to my Department concerning the operation of the trust.  This trust was set up in the time of the Congested Districts Board, a body abolished in 1923.  It is a multi-purpose trust and is of an extremely complex legal nature.  The matter is at present being reviewed by the Land Commission solicitors.</P>
      <P>It appears from the representations made that planning permission for housing has been sought for part of the trust estate.  However, no proposal to dispose of the land for private housing has been received by my Department.  Indeed, I am surprised at this suggested development because in October this year the honorary secretary of the trustees wrote to my Department seeking consent to the long-term leasing of part of the estate to a local soccer club which has had use of the grounds for a number of years.  This proposal is at present being studied.  In light of the representations made by the Senator and others, my Department will be in contact with the trustees to determine their intentions in relation to the future direction of the trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> The Department is aware of its responsibilities in this and in all Land Commission trusts.  An appropriate example in the region is the Dunmore Demesne Trust where the use of the lands has recently been changed from agricultural to sporting and recreational use to facilitate the wishes of the townspeople.  There are no proposals before the Department for the building of houses or for the sale or disposal of lands on behalf of Castlerea Town Trust.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the important issue of the regulations governing subventions paid for patients in private nursing homes.  This is a matter of grave urgency. I am grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for his attendance as he has responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>This is a good day for the elderly.  In the other House, the Minister for Finance today outlined in the budget substantial benefits for the elderly. Other provisions will result in extra places being made available in nursing homes, which have been badly needed for some time.  As a result of the aging of our society, this has become a vital issue and must be addressed.  We are already on course to do so.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing subventions paid for patients in private nursing homes were criticised last month by the Ombudsman.  The Minister responded to the Ombudsman, but the situation is still critical for a number of elderly people and I am anxious to know how this matter is progressing. The regulations provide that the means of children of dependent elderly people are taken into account when deciding the level of subvention for residents of private nursing homes.  The subvention averages £73 per week for a patient and can sometimes be as high as £120.  However, nursing home care costs between £300 and £400 per week, which is a considerable sum.  The balance of the costs are made up of the resident's pension and by the family.  About 53 per cent of the elderly in residential care are in private nursing homes.</P>

    <P>Patients are assessed on their means and, if their children are working, their means are also assessed and taken into account for the subvention.  The patient and the family, therefore, must provide about £200 per week after taking account of the subvention and pension.  State owned homes are paid between £320 and £460 per week per patient by the State and there is no assessment for people going into these homes.  The full cost of their care is met and they receive £15 per week comfort money as well.  I have no objection to that because it is the way it should be.  At the moment, however, families on modest incomes are being put under considerable pressure to subsidise <Col N="1213" /> private nursing home care.  In other words, a son or daughter with three children and an annual income of £17,000 can be assessed as being capable of paying £48 per week from net earnings towards nursing home care.  If it is necessary for their elderly relatives to go into a nursing home most families will try, as far as is possible, to meet the costs involved.  They are only too delighted to do so, if they can possibly afford it.  As we know, however, this is becoming a greater problem because families are smaller.  When it was possible to divide such costs among larger families there was less of an onus on each individual member. That is changing and it is also becoming a bigger problem because of the growing number of older people.</P>
    <P>If this cost difference is not being met, what is the nursing home to do?  Will it put such people out on the street?  I wish to instance a particular example which shows up an anomaly in the system. I am talking about the case of an elderly single woman who has no direct relatives.  She receives a small public service pension of £8,500 a year.  In the past this person owned a home which she sold off to raise a capital sum to provide for herself in her old age.  Unfortunately, because of the increase in nursing home costs this capital has run out.  This unfortunate woman now finds she is earning too much to receive an old age pension and receives a subvention of only £1.88 per day.  There is a huge gap between her pension, which is just over £100 a week, and the £300 weekly cost of a nursing home.  What will happen to somebody like that?  These anomalies must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The budget has started well by acknowledging the fact that we need to look after older people in our society.  It is not only this generation who should benefit from the Celtic tiger, but also those who sacrificed so much in the past.  Since the Minister of State has not only a responsibility but also a great commitment and interest in this matter, will he tell us how the re-examination of the regulations is going?  In so far as he can, will he tell us whether there is room for improvement and, if so, will such improvement be made?  Will subvention levels be increased?  Has the Minister of State a response to the call by those working in nursing homes to have a special category subvention to meet the shortfall in patients fees?</P>
    <P>I thank the House for allowing me to bring this issue to its attention.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Keogh for raising this important issue on the Adjournment.  I would like to say at the outset that the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993, has two principal objectives.  These are to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act and to provide a system of nursing home subvention so that older people, most in need of <Col N="1214" /> nursing home care, would have access to such care.</P>
      <P>The Act is a major step forward in ensuring that dependent older people receive good quality nursing home care.  The Act also provides health boards with another option in meeting the needs of older people locally and with some flexibility.</P>
      <P>By 30 June 1997, 376 homes had been registered under the Act and approximately 5,800 people were in receipt of subventions.  Successive Governments have been committed to the support of older people who need nursing home care and considerable resources have been earmarked for this sector.</P>
      <P>In this connection, the Government has provided additional resources to enable health boards to improve the implementation of nursing home legislation, including the support of more older people in nursing homes.  It is my intention to develop services for older people during the lifetime of this Government which will encompass continued improvements in the support of older people in nursing homes as resources permit.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware of recent criticisms by the Ombudsman of the fact that health boards take account of the circumstances of adult sons and daughters in determining the rate of nursing home subvention payable.  It has long been accepted that adult sons and daughters of persons in nursing homes would contribute towards the costs of their parents' nursing home fees if they could afford to do so.  The nursing home regulations were drafted with this in mind.</P>
      <P>It should also be borne in mind that the State recognises the contribution made by sons and daughters towards their parents maintenance costs by allowing income tax relief on such contributions. However, in the light of the views expressed by the Ombudsman in the course of a recent public address, I am currently having the matter reviewed in my Department to determine whether any changes need to be made in the regulations.</P>
      <P>I assure the Senator that I am having this matter dealt with as expeditiously as possible in the interests of applying fairness in the manner in which applicants for nursing home subventions are treated, while at the same time ensuring that available resources for nursing home subventions are applied to those older people with the greatest need.</P>
      <P>I take on board the Senator's remarks about the anomalies that certainly exist.  We need to have a fresh look at those to see if we can do anything about them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the subventions themselves, we are looking at them at present and, as the Senator may have noted, some £6.9 million was recently given to the various health boards to help them with the subventions, with moneys they had already spent in relation to 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator might also have noted that in today's budget there will be capital allowances for <Col N="1215" /> people who are interested in providing nursing homes in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Between pensions and everything else that has come on stream today for the elderly, I hope we are going in the right direction.  However, as the Senator has already said, we need to clear up the <Col N="1216" /> area of subventions.  I hope to come back to the House again when we have a clearer message on it.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 December 1997.</P>
