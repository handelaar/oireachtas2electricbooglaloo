      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to examine the necessity of providing a remedial teacher to Bodyke, Broadford, O'Callaghan's Mills, Orgonnolloe, Kilbane and Tuamgraney national schools as these schools are in an isolated rural area and are willing to combine their resources.</P>

      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mulcahy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide a heart and lung transplant unit in Ireland in order that such a unit might save the lives of young people suffering from cystic fibrosis and to provide a much improved quality of life for all people suffering from cystic fibrosis.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to outline the reasons a farmer (details supplied) has been refused a suckler cow grant for 39 cows and a headage payment for 1996 and how he can justify the non-payment of these entitlements to the farmer in question in view of what can only be <Col N="406" /> described as a very minor error on the farmer's part.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Taylor-Quinn's and Senator Mulcahy's matters and they may be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Enright may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2, 3 and 34, motion No. 26, in the names of the Independent Senators.  Item 1 will be taken from now until 1 p.m.  We will make as much progress as possible and decide by agreement whether to take all Stages.  I propose a time limit of 15 minutes per speaker on Second Stage.  Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. until 6 p.m. and the same arrangements will apply.  The Whips can discuss these matters during the day.  Motion No. 26 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and item 3, Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, will be taken at 8 p.m.  This is an addition to the business agreed last week and it is included by agreement.  It is proposed that only Committee Stage of the Bill will be taken this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business. This side of the House always acts responsibly. Perhaps the Leader of the House would enlighten us about our forthcoming responsibilities by telling us when the election will be called. That would make it easier to conduct the business of the House.</P>
      <P>Members of the House are usually loth to praise themselves, but the frequency with which the Cathaoirleach announces Messages from the Dáil to the effect that Seanad amendments to Bills have been accepted is gratifying.  Today he announced that Seanad amendments to two Bills were accepted by the Dáil.  When I first became a Member of this House such an occurrence was rare.  It is a testament to the quality of Senators that Seanad amendments are being accepted and that legislation is being debated properly.</P>
      <P>Four or five weeks ago I asked the Leader about the bound volumes of the Official Report, which are now six years behind.  I understand the volumes are with the printers and all that is required to publish them is money from the Department of Finance.  As all Members know, these volumes are of vital importance to enable us to look back over records, etc.  We can find information in the daily reports, but it is easier to find it in the volumes where there is an index.  I ask the Minister to bring this matter to a conclusion by getting the volumes printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us who pay our VHI contribution by cheque got an awful shock yesterday when three times the normal amount was deducted.  We made an agreement with the Department of Finance for deductions once a month.  One Senator contacted <Col N="407" /> the Department and was informed the VHI was taking three months in advance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the matter has been resolved.  It was put down to the famous &ldquo;computer error&rdquo;.  The necessary refund is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I totally object to the way this was conducted.  I do not want to see it happen again because we have more than VHI bills to pay at the end of the month. Although Members of this House receive a paltry sum, we have never discussed the recommendations of the remuneration review group.  We should be to the forefront in protecting ourselves and putting exactly what we get before the people.  We should not allow people on salaries of £250,000 dictate to us that we are not worth our salary.  The matter should be discussed in the open &mdash; by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and then the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader could do us a favour and take us out of our misery by giving us at least a hint when the election will be held.  He may be able to do this indirectly by indicating the legislative programme over the next few weeks and the Government's proposals in that respect.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government to give urgent consideration to the needs of people with disabilities.  I know Senator Maloney has been active in asking for a debate on disability &mdash; both physical and mental.  The Irish Wheelchair Association was among the bodies who put forward proposals prior to the budget.  Given the present buoyancy in the economy their demand was modest.  Perhaps the Government will look at it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald about the degree to which amendments to legislation have been accepted in the House.  This is a positive development.  Much of the legislation in the past few months has been improved because of the amendments put down on this side of the House and accepted by Ministers.  The fact that the Government is in a minority in this House has also been beneficial in this respect.  This side has hopefully been responsible in the manner in which it has used its voting strength and the Government side has been receptive to reasonable suggestions.  In amending so much legislation, the House has done some good work in recent months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time to debate the ESRI report on the economy published this morning.  I would like this report, which shows our economic growth will continue for another ten years, to be discussed before the general election.  The report also shows that by 2005, our living standards will surpass those of the British and that unemployment will fall to the levels in France and Germany.  I am sure the <Col N="408" /> Leader and the Members of the House will concur that these are signs of good Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring this morning's launch of this excellent document &mdash; the Second Progress Report of the All Party Committee on the Constitution &mdash; to the attention of the House. If any Members of the Seanad wish to attend the launch in the Department of an Taoiseach, they would be very welcome to do so.  We recognise the excellent work which has been done by Senators so far and we want to give them an opportunity to do an even better job.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's statements in relation to the apparent conflict of evidence which he gave to the beef tribunal and the Dunne tribunal on payments to politicians are a matter of comment in the public press this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach come into this House and explain these contradictions?  It was this House, as part of the Oireachtas, which gave authority to launch those two tribunals.  If there is a conflict between the Taoiseach's statements at the tribunals, he should come into this House and explain it rather than issuing statements to the newspapers which are being contradicted by commentators and bringing Members of the House into disrepute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the matter of the postal service in the House yesterday and I understand that we could have all party agreement, with the Cathaoirleach's consent, to raise matters of concern to Members of the House in relation to this issue.  Members from both sides of the House want to make statements on the serious situation <Col N="409" /> which prevails at the moment where the postal service has almost collapsed.  It has certainly collapsed in my part of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried very hard to have a debate in this House on National Roads Authority funding.  Unfortunately, such a debate has not taken place.  I am embarrassed at the number of times I have raised this issue in the House.  I have also requested a debate on local authority funding and, again, I am embarrassed at the number of times I have raised this issue.  Has the Leader a particular problem with me or is he unable to bring the Minister for the Environment into the House?  The Minister had time to go to RTÉ and make a statement which could not be challenged by anyone other than Pat Kenny and his ilk.  I want to know whether the Minister for the Environment can come into this House to discuss matters of fundamental importance to the nation and to rural communities.  Perhaps this is a last ditch cry but I appeal to the Leader to bring the Minister into this House to answer questions of paramount importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;410 kilometres of asbestos piping.  This is a national issue.  How many kilometres of asbestos piping are there in other counties? We are talking about upgrading water schemes in rural Ireland, but this issue has not been mentioned.  The Minister is totally out of touch with the reality of the situation.  I am appealing to the Leader to provide the House with an opportunity to inform the Minister of our concerns and then I will not have to be out of order on the Order of Business.  I hope this will be my final appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the payments for beef farmers from EU and <Col N="410" /> Exchequer funds?  I understand the money will be paid through meat factories.  This important matter needs to be discussed.  The Minister intends to visit Egypt soon and perhaps that could also be included in the debate.  The allocation of money is welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the ESRI report, I join Senator Doyle in hoping that there will be continued prosperity.  Will the Leader make time available for a debate on the Eurostat report? This leaked document showed that Ireland is second in the European league of children living in poverty.  There is an urgent need to discuss the ESRI report in tandem with the real position of families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>A mechanism exists for a mid term review and we should do everything possible to ensure that the agreement is changed because <Col N="411" /> it militates against Irish producers.  Senator Dardis appeared to misunderstand my point.  If there is a reduction in export refunds in the beef sector, it would be more beneficial to Ireland to spread it over the whole year and not just implement it from January to March.  In the sheep sector, New Zealand is allowed to export large quantities of lamb to the EU.</P>

      <P>Reductions spread over the entire year would be more beneficial to Ireland. This matter is so important that there should be all party support for a renegotiation of the GATT.  There is a provision in that regard and the matter should be taken seriously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his continuing co-operation.  He and other Senators are right when they talk about the significant number of important amendments to various Bills, not least the Universities Bill, which was passed by the House last week.  We all agree with Senator Lee's article in this week's edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> that a balanced and good Bill emerged from the process, not least on the issue of representation on governing bodies, where Senator Fitzgerald's contribution was particularly significant.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the question of the scarcity and slow arrival of bound volumes of Parliamentary debates.  It is a pity, and in an age of modern technology the cost of such volumes should be reducing rather than increasing.  We should not be waiting up to seven years for bound volumes to become available.  I will make further inquiries into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also asked whether I could shed light on the date of the election to the other House.  I cannot, but Senator Dardis asked if I could say when we would be sitting.  We will be sitting at least two days next week.  Senator Kiely asked about the possibility of a debate on agriculture. The only day that could take place would <Col N="412" /> be Friday of next week because two days are being devoted to the Finance Bill and there are other pieces of legislation to be dealt with.  I will discuss the possibility of a special Friday sitting with Senator Kiely.  We will be sitting three days the following week and I expect we will be sitting the week after that because, as Senators know, the Upper House is ever vigilant.  This means there will be at least three further weeks of legislative work of this House.</P>
    <P>Senators Doyle, McGennis, Burke and others raised the question of the ESRI report.  If there is time, we should debate it.  I take the point made by Senator McGennis that it is at a time when there is unalloyed good news on all sectors of the economy and for the future of the economy and the provision of jobs that we should turn our attention to some of the most pressing social problems.  If the rising tide is going to lift all boats we should be focusing attention on the people least able to speak for themselves.  I have no difficulty in debating both reports at the same time. The worst thing that can happen to any country is that it lulls itself into a sense of false complacency, something nobody wants to allow happen.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the report on the Constitution, which is about to be launched.  I have only had a glance at it.  It contains some good things and some odd things.  I would like to read it more carefully.  I am not surprised that Senator O'Kennedy left the Chamber before the full import of some aspects of the report became known to colleagues on all sides of the House. We will look at it between now and the end of the session.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy also raised the question of the Taoiseach's statements.  The Taoiseach would have no difficulty coming before this House. Indeed, it might be useful to invite his predecessor and his predecessor in turn if a precedent is to be set.  He would have no difficulty in explaining the consistency of what he said.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator McGowan is raising the issue of postal services and other matters at the end of today's business.  I guarantee that his statements with a covering letter will be on the desk of the chief executive of An Post tomorrow.  I will not send it by post.</P>
    <P>The Senator would not pass the advertising standards if he said the appeal he made was his last.  I think we will hear further appeals from him.  I have a genuine problem.  The local authority debate has taken place.  There will be a major chance for the Senator to raise issues during discussion of the Bill to abolish local charges, which will cover all aspects of local government.  The Senator will be able to make his point in that major legislative set-piece within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright mentioned EU funding and social welfare matters and, like him, I welcome those changes.  Senator Townsend called for a debate on agriculture and tried to hold it this morning.  It is a question of finding time.  I realise <Col N="413" /> it is an important issue but it may be necessary to sit on a Friday or a Monday to hold such a debate, because 12 Bills are due to be introduced to the House before the end of this Parliament. Like Senator Burke, I warmly welcome the granting of special tax status to regional airports.  This is one of the most imaginative measures for a long time and we look forward to the major investment and job creation.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of this short but important Bill is to provide for validation of marriages where the three months' notification of marriage requirement under the Family Law Act, 1995, was given by some couples to the wrong registrar of marriages.  The Bill sets matters right in those cases by validating, with retrospection, the marriages concerned.  The Bill also avoids such cases happening in the future by providing that a marriage shall not be deemed to be invalid in law solely by reason of notification being given to the wrong registrar.  The opportunity is also being taken in the Bill to make some useful technical changes to the law in relation to barring orders granted in the case of cohabitants, to irrevocable powers of attorney and to disclaimers of interest in cases of intestate succession.</P>
      <P>Section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995, requires parties to a marriage to notify in writing the registrar of marriages for the district in which the marriage is to be solemnised of their intention to marry not less than three months prior to the date of the marriage.  The effect of section 32 is that, unless special exemption has been obtained from the Circuit Court or the High Court under section 33 of the 1995 Act, a marriage shall not be valid unless the parties have met the notification requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy enshrined in section 32 of the 1995 Act derives from a considerable body of sources. It was recommended by the Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown in 1985.  It formed part of the Government's statement of intentions with regard to marriage, separation and divorce in the run up to the 1986 divorce referendum, and the merits were discussed in the Government's White Paper on Marital Breakdown published in 1992.  In the Government's information campaign prior to the divorce referendum in 1995, the section was highlighted as one of the Government's measures to protect and support marriage. The provision now contained in the 1995 Act was the subject of debate during the period February 1994 and September 1995, and received a broad welcome in the House.  The period of three months, as provided for in the Act, was considered <Col N="414" /> appropriate to allow for a period of reflection on marriage as an institution of the greatest importance.  The provision was welcomed by all interest groups, including the Churches.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health, who has responsibility in relation to the administration of the Office of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, informs me that considerable steps were taken by the Office of the Registrar-General to advise the public, clergy and registrars of the new notification requirements. Those steps included the production of information leaflets for couples intending to marry, for celebrants and for registrars as part of a process which began early in March 1996.  Notices in relation to the new requirement appeared in all national newspapers and in the Sunday newspapers, in 40 provincial newspapers and some magazines and there were advertisement slots on RTÉ and commercial radio.  In addition, a number of circulars were issued to registrars reminding them of the importance of those procedures and of the need for strict compliance with the guidelines, and training courses for registrars were also held.</P>
    <P>Since introduction of the notification requirement on 1 August 1996, the notifications which have been processed by registrars have not given rise to difficulties in the vast majority of cases.  I understand that between May 1996 and April 1997 notifications of intention to marry have been received in respect of 17,500 marriages approximately. Of that total, 167 cases were referred to the Office of the Registrar-General for review. While 42 cases were found to be in order, 25 cases failed to give the required three months' notification. The Registrar-General is confirming with the 25 couples concerned that their marriages cannot be registered.  Some 57 cases to date have been identified as cases where notification was given in error to a registrar for a district other than the district in which their marriage was to be solemnised.  A further 43 cases are currently being examined to establish if the requirements of the Act have been met.  Where problem cases have been identified, the registrar has communicated with the couples concerned.</P>
    <P>I think it important to emphasise that the substantive requirement under section 32 of the 1995 Act of three months' notification of intention to marry is not in any way being affected by this Bill. Neither does the Bill provide for the validation of marriages where parties failed to give notification in time or failed to give any notification. On the passing of this Bill it is the intention of the Registrar-General to clarify the position, in writing, for all couples where doubts have arisen.</P>
    <P>Of course, circumstances can arise where the notification requirement under section 32 could present difficulties for the parties.  In recognition of this fact, it is provided in section 33 of the 1995 Act that a person can apply to the court for an exemption from the notification requirement.  In line with the substantive nature of section 32, <Col N="415" /> exemptions by the court shall not, however, be granted unless the applicant shows that its grant is justified by serious reasons and that it is in the interests of the parties to the intended marriage. I think it important to reiterate that, notwithstanding the passing of this Bill, unless a couple has obtained prior exemption from the three months' notice requirement, their marriage is not, and will not, be valid in law if they failed, or fail, to give three months' prior notification of their intention to marry.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with those cases, 57 in all so far, where notification was given to the wrong registrar. In those cases it is reasonable to assume that it was the intention of the parties concerned to comply with the law.  The notifications were, unfortunately, placed with the wrong registrar and this was not discovered in time for all concerned to do anything about the situation.  The Minister for Health has stated on several occasions in the House his concern about the matter and his regret about the position that has ensued for the parties concerned.  I have shared in that concern and, in consultation with the Minister for Health, indicated my intention to bring forward amending legislation.  The Bill implements the commitment both of myself and the Minister for Health on the matter.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. Sections 2 and 3 amend the Act of 1995 in relation to the notification of intention to marry provisions in a number of respects.  Section 2(1)(a) of the Bill inserts a new subsection (5) into section 32 of the 1995 Act which will require health boards to pay fees to certain registrars of marriage, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Minister for Health, to compensate them for processing the marriage notifications they receive under the section.  The registrars concerned comprise about half of all registrars and their remuneration at present is made up of fees paid by the public and by the appropriate health board for each registered marriage.</P>
    <P>Section 2(1)(b) of the Bill, which substitutes a new subsection (6) for subsection (5) of section 32, contains a definition of the registrar of marriages for the purposes of the 1995 Act.  In relation to a marriage to which section 11 of the Registration of Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1863, applies, it will mean the registrar appointed under section 10 of that Act or a person authorised by that registrar to act on his or her behalf.  In relation to any other marriage, it will mean the registrar appointed under section 57 of the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844, or a person authorised by that registrar to act on his or her behalf.</P>
    <P>Section 2(2) of the Bill introduces a degree of flexibility as regards the jurisdiction of the Circuit Family Court to deal with applications for exemptions from the marriage notification requirement. Under section 38(4) of the Act, as it stands, exemptions may be given by a judge of the circuit in which any of the parties to the proceedings ordinarily resides or carries on any business, profession <Col N="416" /> or occupation.  Accordingly, the parties to an intended marriage have to apply to that circuit for such an exemption.  Section 2(2) of the Bill provides that applications for exemption from the marriage notification requirement may be heard by the judge of any circuit.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill is the provision which deals with the validation of marriages where notification was given to the wrong registrar.  Subsection (1) provides for validation where notification was given, under section 32 of the 1995 Act, to a registrar appointed under either the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844, or the Registration of Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1863, and that registrar was not the registrar for the district in which the marriage was intended to be solemnised.  It also provides that, in the future, where couples give notification to the wrong registrar of marriage this will not of itself invalidate the marriage.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) validates any marriages which have taken place since 1 August 1996 where a judge of the Circuit Family Court may have granted an exemption from the notification of marriage requirements in cases where the court did not have the jurisdiction to do so because the parties did not ordinarily reside or carry on any business, profession or occupation in that court's jurisdiction.  The provision is for the avoidance of doubt and is a logical consequence of the amendment being proposed under section 2(2).  That problem will not arise in the future because of the provisions in section 2(2) of the Bill which allows the judge of any Circuit Family Court to grant exemptions.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions amending the rules on notification of intention to marry.  I now turn to the amendments in relation to other areas of the law that are provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, a cohabitant who applies for a barring order must have lived with the respondent for a period of not less than six months in aggregate during the period of nine months immediately prior to the application for a barring order.  It has come to my notice that there may be a difficulty of interpretation of the Act in those cases where a cohabitant is seeking the renewal or extension of a barring order.  For the removal of doubt, section 4 of the Bill inserts a new subsection into section 3 of the 1996 Act.  It provides that where by reason only of a barring order or interim barring order the parties have not lived together for the requisite period prior to the application they shall be deemed for the purposes of the application for a further barring order to have lived together for the requisite period prior to the application for a barring order.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill amends the law in relation to certain powers of attorney.  The Powers of Attorney Act, 1966, is detailed and complex legislation. A main feature of the Act is that it introduces a power of attorney which endures notwithstanding the mental incapacity of the donor. Common law rules had been to the effect that a <Col N="417" /> power of attorney must cease on the intervening event of mental incapacity of the donor.  The Act repeals sections 8 and 9 of the Conveyancing Act, 1882, under which certain powers of attorney could not be revoked by the donor's death, mental incapacity or bankruptcy.  Both sections had been widely criticised as being confusing and failing to provide adequate protection for third parties. Section 20 of the 1996 Act made it clear that the only powers which ought to be irrevocable should be those given by way of security, for example, to protect a mortgagee in the event of default in repayments by the donor of the power. The section applies to powers of attorney whenever created.</P>
    <P>When the 1996 Act was introduced, it was widely understood that there were no cases where powers of attorney had been granted otherwise than by way of security.  However, my attention has recently been drawn to a case where a person had given a power of attorney which was expressed to be irrevocable and was in consideration of an annual payment to the donees.  The intention of the donor was that the donees should be in a position to act in the event of the donor's incapacity.  Legal advice was obtained by the parties to the effect that the power was valid under section 8 of the 1882 Act.  Although there may be other similar cases, none has so far been reported. I am of the view that any power of attorney given before the date on which the 1996 Act came into operation under the 1882 Act otherwise than by way of security should not be so affected by section 20 of the 1996 Act.  Accordingly, I have provided in section 5 that section 20 shall not invalidate powers of attorney given otherwise than by way of security under sections 8 and 9 of the 1882 Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 6 is to clarify the law in relation to the disclaimer of interest in cases of intestate succession.  The section is being included following submissions made to me by the Law Society and the Revenue Commissioners for clarification of the law in this area.</P>
    <P>The rules governing the distribution of an estate on intestacy are set out in Part VI of the Succession Act, 1965.  There is some doubt as to the position of the State, as ultimate intestate successor under section 73 of the Succession Act, 1965, when the next-of-kin of a person who dies intestate disclaims an interest in the deceased's estate.  Section 73 of the 1965 Act provides that, in default of next-of-kin, the estate of an intestate shall pass to the State as ultimate intestate successor. Section 6 makes clear that the disclaimed estate shall be distributed as if the person disclaiming had died immediately before the death of the intestate and if that disclaimant is not the spouse of the intestate or a direct lineal ancestor of the intestate, it shall be distributed as if the disclaimant had died without leaving issue.  The effect of section 6 which, in effect is a codification of existing practice, is that where there are any <Col N="418" /> possible successors of the intestate, other than the disclaimant, they will take precedence over the State for the purposes of intestate succession.</P>
    <P>I believe that Senators will appreciate that, while the provisions in the Bill will possibly affect only a small number of persons, they are, nonetheless, important in their own right and for the persons concerned.  I am happy to respond, by way of this Bill, to the various submissions made to me on these issues.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary and welcome. None of us anticipated that the Family Law Act, 1995, would have to be amended because of practical problems involving people seeking to marry.  There was support on all sides of the House for the provision specifying a three month prior notification of marriage.  The divorce debate was raging at the time and the view was taken that marriage, entailing a serious commitment, was not to be entered into lightly.</P>
      <P>This Bill has several purposes, but its immediate purpose is to validate a number marriages that have been found to be invalid due to a technicality. It is right that this legislation should be expedited to rectify that situation, particularly in cases where notice was given to the wrong registrar or the exemption was for a court other than the court in the area concerned.</P>
      <P>However, I have grave concerns about the numbers mentioned by the Minister.  Of approximately 70,500 marriages last year, a small number will not be covered by this legislation because they did not give three months' notice.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, stated in the Dáil that if they did not give notice, then it was their own problem.  I do not believe that any couple who exchanged marriage vows in a church did so believing their marriage was invalid.  This legislation should cover those couples also, and I have tabled an amendment similar to that tabled in the Dáil.  I hope the Minister can accept it and, if not, perhaps he can explain why not.  I do not believe that the approximately 25 couples affected, and the approximately 60 other couples being investigated, exchanged marriage vows on the basis that they were contracting illegal marriages.</P>
      <P>The provisions validating marriages that were notified to the wrong registrar are very welcome. These are probably teething problems with the necessity to give notice that this legislation will solve.  This was not anticipated when the Family Law Act, 1995, was being debated.  Allowing couples to apply to any Circuit Court for an exemption is also sensible and welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in this Bill that amends section 3 of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.  I am concerned with that as it provides that if a person has a barring order in place for six months and applies for a renewal of that order, under the existing law it would be impossible to renew the order because the couple would not have been living together for six of the nine preceding months.  There is a need to protect women and <Col N="419" /> children, and Women's Aid has told me that it also has a problem with this provision.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for natural justice, however, and there is a presumption in the proposed change to existing legislation.  That presumption is that the partner, who is usually male, will return to the family home and be violent again.  That might be true, but it is still a presumption. It is accordingly a breach of natural justice to allow someone to apply for a barring order on the basis that this will happen.  Women's Aid pointed out that problems arise with the stipulation of the need for cohabiting couples to be residing together for six aggregate months of the nine months immediately prior to the application, and this amendment does not solve that.  There is a constitutional difference between cohabiting couples and married couples, but the time requirement is causing problems for those dealing with violence against women.  The solution may be to remove that requirement and have all cases dealt with on their merits when they come before the courts.  While protecting those who are vulnerable, this amendment suggests that the person who has been violent will continue to be violent if readmitted to the home.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Powers of Attorney Bill, 1996, baffled me when it came to the House.  I thought it was a Justice Bill, which had nothing to do with me.  I was presented with it one morning and had no knowledge of it.  Having read the amendment to that Act, I am still slightly confused.  I would not pretend to understand it, so perhaps the Minister will explain it in layman's terms.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with succession.  Does this mean, for example, that the extended family, which might not have been able inherit property because a person died intestate, will be able to do so?  If that is what it means, it is welcome.  This is technical legislation required to deal with case law which has come to light and the problem of validating marriages.  After the Family Law Bill was passed, a Government Deputy suggested there was in flaw in the legislation and there would be a need for amending legislation.  Was he correct, or is this Bill unrelated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  As Senator McGennis said, it does not affect many people, but it is important legislation for those it does.  It deals with 57 cases where notification was given to the wrong registrar.  In those cases it is reasonable to assume it was the intention of the parties concerned to comply with the law, but notifications were unfortunately placed with the wrong registrar.  This was not discovered in time for those concerned to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> I know one of those affected.  Couples in this situation are concerned and face many difficulties. Having planned a marriage, gone through a ceremony and complied with the law, it was a shock for them to learn that the State did not consider these couples to be married.  When looking at this issue we must consider difficulties for each couple affected by this anomaly which arose when notification was given to the wrong registrar. For that reason this Bill will be welcomed by couples whose marriages will be validated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendment to the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, which tidies an anomaly which arose in that regard.  Where a barring order existed there was a legal difficulty renewing it because it did not comply with section 3 of the 1996 Act.  On the amendment to the Succession Act, I understand that heretofore if a person died intestate, the next of kin inherited and, if not, the estate passed to the State.  It is important that the extended family has the opportunity or the right to inherit the value of the estate.  The intention of the original person who died would be that the estate would stay within the family and not pass to the State.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the passing of the Bill only to say that I welcome it, especially for that small number of couples, 57 in all, who, subsequent to being married and believing it to be legal, found that because they informed the wrong registrar they were not legally married.  For that reason I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As previous speakers have indicated, this Bill is largely technical.  It surprised me to learn of the marriages made invalid because of the new requirement of giving notice.  It was important that it be urgently redressed.  The concept of giving notice of marriage was a new one to registrars, clergy and citizens, so it was natural there would be teething problems in its administration. However, it must have been horrific and distressful for those concerned, after all their plans and good intentions for walking up the aisle, to be told by the State that their marriages were officially invalid.  I am happy to see that situation resolved in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further clarification on the domestic violence legislation is another provision in this Bill.  That was major reforming legislation passed by this House.  For the first time, and despite the difficulties existing in the Constitution whereby it appeared cohabiting couples could not get the protection of the law in the way they should, the Minister and his advisers worked to ensure some protection was provided by way of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.  This provided that where a couple lived together for a period of at least six months in a total nine month period, one or the other was afforded the protection of the law as of right.  The legislation is amended to clarify the aggregate total time to be taken into consideration in a subsequent application for a barring order, or a final barring order after an interim one has been granted.  That needed clarification <Col N="421" /> and I welcome it.  Can this run on indefinitely? What would happen with the subsequent application? Is the time period aggregated on an overall basis?  I am not clear on that, but the provision goes some way towards clarifying the situation for those concerned.</P>
    <P>The Powers of Attorney Act, 1966, was very technical.  My understanding is that the Bill made it clear that the only powers which could be made irrevocable were those which could be given by way of security.  The Minister said it was the understanding of the Department that those were the only powers of attorney which could arise, whereas it appears there are other circumstances warranting the same provision.  I understand the Minister now states that section 20 would not invalidate powers of attorney given otherwise than by way of security.  I take it that it is to cover the possibility of other provisions having been made by way of power of attorney and to allow them to endure.  For what it is worth, I welcome that.</P>
    <P>It is stretching it to include disclaimer of interests and intestate succession in family law, because in my view it deals solely and entirely with succession law.  Nonetheless, if the Minister is ingenious enough to include it in this legislation, I am happy with that.  It needed clarification. It was an area which concerned me because the law becomes a little vague in terms of intestate succession beyond the immediate boundaries of family.  This provision states that up to now a disclaimed estate automatically reverted to the State, whereas there might have been others, not necessarily the next of kin but other family relations, who ought to have been considered prior to it reverting to the State.  By deeming the person who disclaims the estate to have died immediately before the person who died intestate, it allows succession to extend to the family of the disclaimer.  That is something which will be welcomed by practitioners of law and by relations who may have been excluded by the State taking what was left over in an all too quick fashion.</P>
    <P>Some bank and savings accounts of deceased people remain unclaimed, uninvestigated and unidentified.  There is a role for legislation in tackling that issue because the money is being held by financial institutions without proper investigation as to who owns it and with no real intent to distribute it to its rightful owners.  Many old people would have put a little nest egg aside and perhaps told no one about it.  Their relations probably do not know about it and unless detailed inquiries are made the financial institutions will not disclose its existence.  That money, which can be sizeable, should be taken from the financial institutions and invested in a charitable purpose, or some effort should be made to ensure it reverts to the family in question.  There is a role for legislation in that area and it is something which ought to be tackled.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who addressed the <Col N="422" /> House during the debate and I appreciate the general welcome they gave to the Bill.  A number of issues were raised upon which I would like to comment briefly.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the policy enshrined in section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995, welcomed by both sides of the House and by various interest groups, including the Churches, when it was debated in the House, is that the notice requirement reflects the belief that marriage is an institution of the greatest importance and one which should not be entered into lightly.  It also reflects the view that the taking on of marriage requires both maturity and reflection.  The three month period provided for in the Act was considered appropriate to allow for a period of reflection and to prevent hasty marriages.  The substantive requirement of three months' notice provided for in the Act is not affected by the Bill before the House.  Its purpose is focused for those cases where the notice was given to the wrong registrar, although sufficient notice of period was given.</P>
      <P>I apologise to Senators that the remaining provisions of the Bill are so technical and I concede they are such, especially those dealing with the Powers of Attorney Act and the Succession Act, 1965, although the number of cases to which they have relevance would be very small.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed Senator McGennis thinks there is any breach of natural law in the amendment to the Domestic Violence Act.  I think the reverse.  We are saying that where a barring order is made in the case of cohabitants and, as a result of and following on the compulsion of that barring order, the parties have, of necessity being living apart from each other, it would offend natural justice for the man to then say that the woman does not qualify for the renewal of the order because they have not been living together. In fact, this was so because of the court order.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis's fears for natural justice are not valid for the additional reason that the granting of the renewal of a barring order is not automatic.  It is not the case that the woman says that she wishes the expired order renewed and, as of right, is automatically granted such a renewal.  The court must be satisfied that it is right, proper and appropriate for the order to be renewed.  That would depend on the history of the couple during the period of the initial order. For example, if the parties had behaved in a proper manner and gave assurances to the court, the court may decide that it was inappropriate to renew the order and that the couple should be given an opportunity to sort out their problems. Alternatively, if, for example, the man had been causing difficulties for the woman, breaking the barring order or making threats, the court may decide that it was appropriate to renew the order. If this was necessary to protect a woman initially involved in a domestic violence situation, it would be inappropriate if living apart could be used as a technical ground to enable the man to return home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> Senator Gallagher raised the question as to whether this could be an ongoing process.  It cannot be so, as a barring order can only be renewed once.  The Domestic Violence Act extended the period for which an order could be granted from one to up to three years.  There is no second renewal.  If a permanent order was required, a further formal proceeding would be required in the Circuit Court seeking a judicial separation or some such measure.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the Powers of Attorney Act arises from a technical interpretation of sections 8 and 9 of the Conveyancing Act, 1882.  However, this provision is of limited application.  I am aware of only one case in which it would apply. However, I felt it inappropriate to intrude on the power of attorney granted under that Act.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Succession Act provision is of limited application.  In the 40 years I practised law I never came across a case where the State emerged as the ultimate successor.  Such cases are very rare.  The amendment arises from the wording of section 73 of the Succession Act, 1965.  This provides that the State succeeds to the estate if a person dies intestate.  However, what of cases where the next of kin disclaimed their rights to succeed to the estate?  The net intent of the technical amendment is that where there are any possible successors of the intestant other than the person who disclaimed his or her rights, they will take precedence over the State in succession. That is fair, right and logical.  The State is the final successor only when there is no next of kin.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that Senator Gallagher raised an eyebrow on including this amendment in family law legislation.  By definition, next of kin are members of the wider family.  It is logical that this provision should be included in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their assistance and understanding with this important legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Section 32 of the Act of 1995 shall not apply to marriages solemnised between the 1st day of August, 1996 and the 31st day of June, 1997.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the purpose of this legislation, and the Minister has reiterated that there is no attempt to interfere with the three month notice period.  I support that requirement.  This Bill <Col N="424" /> addresses those couples whose marriages are invalid because they notified the wrong registrar or received an exemption from the wrong Circuit Court.  There are over 25 couples in this situation through no fault of their own.  The Minister will say that there was widespread notice of this requirement.  However, having examined these cases, the Registrar General will agree that these marriages were conducted in a church.  If that is the case it is possible that a number of elderly priests may not have been as aware of the civil requirements as of canon law.  These couples should qualify for the protection of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The three month requirement came into force last August.  Some of these couples may now be expecting a child.  What if the husband dies before the marriage is validated?  What is the status of that marriage?  I presume it does not exist and that the issue of the marriage is illegitimate, although that concept no longer exists.  What would be the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> property and inheritance?  The Minister introduced technical amendments in this legislation as a result of a particular case.  If we do not extend the protection of this legislation to the approximately 25 couples I mentioned, one of those couples might find themselves in extreme difficulty, particularly if a child was born of that marriage, if a partner dies and if property becomes an issue.</P>
    <P>This time requirement is new.  The settling down period for the application of the requirement has expired and all Churches which conduct marriages are aware of it.  The Catholic Church already had a requirement that a person who was under 18 years of age should give six months' notice to the church of his or her intention to marry.  However, there is now a new legislative regime and, if we are to be fair and ensure that the possible scenario I outlined does not arise, we should validate the approximately 25 marriages which are invalid at present.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>If a substantive requirement under marriage law has not been complied with, from the point of view of the State there is no marriage. The normal consequences with regard to a child or property apply.  There is no point in having a law if it is not substantive.  Either we are serious about the necessity for this requirement or we are not.</P>
      <P>The effect of Senator McGennis' amendment would be that the substantive requirement of three months' prior notification would be dispensed with for the period of 1 August 1996 to 31 June 1997.  What the Senator is trying to achieve is not clear.  If one were to follow the logic of her amendment, the substantive requirement would be dispensed with entirely.  I do not believe that is the Senator's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar amendment to the one now being proposed was tabled in the course of the debate on the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, in <Col N="425" /> respect of the Family Law Act, 1995, and also in the course of the debate on this Bill in the Dáil. The amendment tabled to the 1995 Act during the debate on the Divorce Act provided that section 32 of the 1995 Act shall not apply to marriages solemnised between 1 August 1996 and 31 December 1996.  This arose in a context where it was being suggested that marriages celebrated in the months of August, September and October 1996 might be invalid because registrars did not have the power to accept notifications prior to the 1995 Act coming into operation on 1 August 1996.</P>
    <P>The presumption under rules of statutory interpretation is that the Oireachtas intended that couples be entitled to notify the registrar of their intention to marry and that the registrar should have power to receive such notices prior to the commencement of section 32.  The advice from the Attorney General was and is that the provisions of section 10 (1) (b) of the Interpretation Act, 1937, cover the situation that arises in relation to notices of marriage given prior to 1 August 1996.  That provision deals with where an Act of the Oireachtas is expressed to come into operation on a day subsequent to the passing of such Act.  It makes clear that if an Act confers a power, the exercise of which is necessary or expedient to enable the Act to have full force and effect immediately upon its coming into operation, such power may be exercised at any time after the passing of such Act, even though it has not technically come into operation at that time. Consequently, on the basis of ordinary rules of statutory interpretation and by virtue of the provision of section 10 of the Interpretation Act, the Attorney General's view was and is that prior to 1 August 1996, when the Act came into operation, couples were authorised to notify registrars of marriage of their intention to marry and registrars had power to receive the notices so given.</P>
    <P>The view of the Attorney General is that the legislation now being proposed deals fully with the problem encountered to date in relation to persons giving notice to wrong registrars.  Of the 17,500 applications received to date, only 167 have been referred to the Registrar General and, of those, 42 were in order.  Those which give rise to difficulties arise as a result of notification being given to the wrong registrar or failure to give timely notice.  While we have addressed the question of notice to the wrong registrar, we cannot address the question of people's failure to give timely notice without dispensing altogether with the substantive requirement.</P>
    <P>While I regret the situation of that small number of people, we are not in a position to address it.  The Registrar General will be in communication with them and will discuss, if they so require, what action they should take.  In the circumstances, I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I usually draft my own amendments. The Minister said my intention was not clear, but my contribution in support of the <Col N="426" /> amendment made my intention clear.  Ignorance is no defence in law, but this legislation has been introduced because people were not fully familiar with the requirements.  It will, therefore, validate their marriages.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's opinion regarding the situation of the 25 affected couples is unbelievable. I presume somebody spoke to these people during the review and ascertained why they did not give notice.  Other than telling them their marriages are invalid, did the Registrar General ask why they did not give the required notice?  If it were discovered they acted in ignorance of the requirement, why can this legislation not be extended to them?  If the Minister says it is impossible to do so, I will accept his opinion. However, it is difficult to accept the Attorney General's opinion that in order to validate those marriages one is effectively removing the three month notice requirement.  Whatever about the problems that arose regarding the Succession Act and powers of attorney, some of the people to whom I refer might end up in dire circumstances as a result of the invalidity of their marriages simply because they were unaware of the requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>They can deal with the matter without undue difficulty.  They can give three months notice and have a simple marriage ceremony before the registrar.  They need not go through the same rigmarole again.  Some might already have done that; the registrar or their legal advisers would have advised them to so do.</P>
      <P>Everybody recognises the need for this substantive requirement.  We cannot now provide that it was not necessary after all for the period of time mentioned in the amendment.  We are dealing with the problems which arose where the wrong registrar was involved.  However, we cannot deal with situations where the time requirement was not complied with.  The remedy is in the hands of the couples concerned.  They can give notice now, if they have not already done so.  Any responsible solicitor they might consult would advise them to give three months' notice and fix up the matter before a registrar without having to go through all the formalities again.  This is not an insuperable problem which requires a legislative solution.</P>
      <P>The remedy is there and it is satisfying to know that in the overwhelming number of cases, 17,500, the process worked as intended.  When one deals with a large number of incidents there will always be negligence, carelessness or oversight in some cases.  The requirement is good and we have to enforce it.  It is not a major problem for that small number of people to put in order.</P>

      <P>There is no problem provided both parties are fit and healthy.  There is also the question of the marriage certificate and other certificates that may, for example, show Marian McGennis was born three months after the marriage took place as distinct from a year and a half. <Col N="427" /> This is not a major problem but it will appear on the official marriage records.  I hope both parties to these 25 marriages can put their affairs in order, provided they remain fit and healthy.  If they do not, there will be a human problem.</P>

      <P>I did not fully grasp the requirement in renewing a barring order and the suggestion of natural justice was incorrect in the context in which I mentioned it.  I thank the Minister for clarifying the matter.  Under section 4, in order to strengthen the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, &mdash; and this is also the view of Women's Aid &mdash; the time requirement should be omitted completely.</P>
      <P>Apart from pretending that a couple have lived together for six months prior to the implementation of a barring order in order to ensure the protection of women and children in the home, there are other areas in which the time requirement is a problem for cohabiting couples &mdash; not just in terms of renewing a barring order which has been in existence for a year or more.  The best and cleanest way to deal with this is to remove the time requirement, which may be a constitutional matter.</P>
      <P>From discussions with Women's Aid I know it is having problems with the aggregate time requirement; not just in renewing barring orders but also in cases where a partner is jailed for part of the preceding nine months, and maybe not for domestic violence.  I know the Minister is affording a woman the right to go to court and ask for the renewal of a barring order.  I understand that is the purpose of the section from the Minister's explanation.  However, in order to strengthen the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, we should have removed the time requirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I address Senator McGennis's point I wish to refer back to my answer on the renewal point made by Senator Gallagher.  I understood that a renewal applied only once. However, my officials have told me they are not sure that interpretation is correct.  They think further renewals may be possible.  My understanding was that the Bill provided for a once only renewal and that it could not continue on a permanent basis.  My officials are not so sure whether my interpretation is correct.  I probably should not be giving legal interpretations in any case.  I always try to be as helpful as I can on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGennis raised the requirement of people having to live together for a certain length of time and whether we should have dealt with <Col N="428" /> this in the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.  The Attorney General advised at that time that the limitation should be placed on the scope of the provision.  The existence of a barring order obliges a person to leave his or her home and renders that person liable to arrest in respect of behaviour which might not otherwise constitute a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>The provision covers a nine month rather than a 12 month period, as in safety orders because of the more drastic nature of the remedy.  The fact that a period of six months of the last nine is specified should ensure that a person who has recently left an established cohabitant relationship because of a partner's violence will have a one month period of grace in which to apply if, for example, she has moved to a women's refuge.</P>
    <P>I remember examining this matter.  The problem of cohabitant relationships presented considerable difficulties as it was entirely new.  Two people could have cohabited for two days.  Does that leave one of them open to being barred from their home when the relationship was as new or recent as that?  In marriage, the intent is different. People may say they are no longer cohabitants and that the relationship is over.  There has to be a period under which one can say people are cohabitants within the meaning of the Bill because the remedy is draconian &mdash; being forcibly excluded from one's home by law.  Should that remedy be accorded to people living together for days, weeks or a month in a relationship not affirmed to any degree of permanence?</P>
    <P>The basis of this kind of remedy was, is and should be that two people are living together in a relationship that has at least some aspect of permanence. This would prohibit a violent situation arising between them that would intrude on the permanent relationship that had been established. This requires a period of living together. We decided on the period in the Bill taking those factors into account.</P>

    <Title>Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1996, implements EU Directive 93/104 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time. Together with other employment protection measures, this directive forms part of the social action programme or Social Charter, as it is commonly known.  The directive, which applies to all member states, including the UK, provides Europe-wide protections for employees regarding rest, holidays and maximum working time.  These new standards are already exceeded in most employment situations by good employers in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents a historic step forward in worker protection legislation and is one of the most important pieces of employment legislation to be drafted in modern times.  In addition to providing a modern employment code for workers in this country, the Organisation of Working Time Bill replaces a body of cumbersome law dating back to the 1930s with a single flexible piece of legislation.  This one measure replaces over 137 pages of detailed and prescriptive primary legislation about working time and conditions of employment, as well as hundreds of regulations, licences and orders.  The Bill is a major simplification of Irish employment law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> Following enactment of this Bill, the concerns for workers' health and safety will be at the heart of the way in which work is organised.  Workers across the economy will benefit from a legal right to minimum daily and weekly rest and adequate rest breaks during the working day.  Those who stand to benefit significantly from this Bill are part-time, casual and atypical workers, some of whom have missed out on the standard of rights available to full-time employees.</P>
    <P>The drafting of the Bill involved an extensive process of consultation in the form of meetings and representations from hundreds of interested individuals and representative groups.  These consultations included extensive contacts with overseas industry in Ireland which continued right up to the final stage in the Dáil at which point amendments were made in a number of areas to clarify and refine provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Partnership is fundamental to Government policy in the management of our socio-economic development.  We have seen from the ESRI report the kind of fruits that partnership has brought about so far and which it will continue to bring into the next century.  This approach has been particularly successful over the past ten years and is set to continue with the new national agreement, Partnership 2000.  This approach, involving the social partners and the Government, has been fundamental to the creation of conditions for maximising profitability and employment and sharing the benefits of our extraordinary growth.</P>
    <P>A significant feature of the drafting of this Bill has been the ongoing contact with both sides of industry.  The Organisation of Working Time Bill has the support of both IBEC and ICTU; this is important as they represent the parties who will be charged with upholding the terms of the legislation. This partnership approach will be developed further when a monitoring group is formed to oversee the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the transposition of the directive has been to provide acceptable minimum standards.  I am satisfied that these standards will enhance competitiveness by giving rise to a top class working environment.  The Bill is a balanced and integrated set of measures which will ensure that the health and safety of workers is protected and the real needs of employers respected.</P>
    <P>Our most successful companies are those which already subscribe to the highest standards of health and safety protection for their workers and they will, generally speaking, be unaffected by this legislation.  Health and safety protections do not undermine competitiveness but are seen by progressive companies as a key part of their business strategy.  I present health and safety awards every year and it is our blue chip, flagship companies which are usually to the fore because they put health and safety first.  Such companies have nothing to fear from this legislation.  The skill, quality and commitment of our workforce is one of Ireland's key competitive resources.  That skill, <Col N="431" /> quality and commitment is not enhanced by unsafe working practices or by asking people to work excessive hours in order to earn a decent wage.  The majority of employers already offer their workers conditions of employment which are better than the Bill's minimum terms.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that long hours spent at work can damage a worker's health.  Tired workers can put themselves, their colleagues and the general public at risk.  The Government has a responsibility to minimise such risk.  The main policy concern behind this legislation was to give those in employment the statutory right to rest in the interests of the health and safety of the employee. Stress, fatigue, and other health problems can be linked to excessive time spent at work and to long periods of working.  In addition, the modern working environment places many new demands on workers, including adopting new forms of working, time constraints, production and deadline pressures, competition and performance pressures.  A legislative structure that recognises the necessity to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the employee is essential in the context of these new pressures.  The Organisation of Working Time Bill represents a statutory framework for the protection and safeguarding of the employee in a changing working environment.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeals seven pieces of conditions of employment legislation applicable to various sectors and replaces them with generally applicable legislation.  The Acts to be repealed are Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 and 1944, which generally apply to industrial work; Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts, 1938 and 1942; Night Work (Bakeries) Acts, 1936 and 1981; and the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  The Bill also repeals section 4 of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991.  The Organisation of Working Time Bill consolidates existing labour law, modernises it and ensures that these rules apply across sectors of the economy which have previously been excluded, such as the public service and the service economy generally.</P>
    <P>Before going on to outline some of the features of the legislation, I wish to speak briefly about the flexibilities which are a core part of the legislation. As I have said, the Organisation of Working Time Bill implements the EC directive on working time.  In drafting the Bill we have taken advantage of the flexibilities permitted by the directive, with the exception of the open-ended individual opt out from the 48 hour week which I will deal with at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about the effect which the Bill will have on employers and employees.  I wish to assure the House that there is huge flexibility in the Bill to accommodate different shift patterns and different overtime arrangements.  The directive has been implemented in the most flexible manner, taking advantage of long averaging periods and maximum use of permitted exemptions.  In general <Col N="432" /> the Bill's standard provisions on rest breaks and shift patterns can be varied once there is appropriate compensatory rest offered, and agreed working arrangements which are working well can be accommodated within this flexible framework.</P>
    <P>In addition to implementing the directive, we have taken the opportunity to include new features in the Bill, and in this respect we have gone beyond the minimum requirements of the directive. We are addressing a number of new problems which have emerged in recent times and making improvements to some existing statutory rights.  First, we are introducing in primary legislation a special value for work carried out on Sunday. Second, we are outlawing the concept of zero hour contracts.  Third, we are extending holiday entitlements to employees previously excluded from entitlements.  Fourth, we are introducing a simplified procedure for claiming entitlements under the Act in the event of a dispute.</P>
    <P>We are also introducing a new procedure to give employees a say in how work and rest time may be organised in their own workplace. Another important feature is that it will apply generally to all employees in the public and private sectors alike.  Historically, conditions of employment legislation and the remedies available under such legislation were not available to public sector employees.  It is important to point out, as there as been some ill-informed comment on the matter, that we are legislating equally for the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>The Bill will repeal the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  It will extend the current legal right to paid holidays from three to four weeks, phased in over three years to 1999.  Last year workers were entitled to 15 days holiday, but this year they will be entitled to 16 days holiday, to 18 days in 1998 and a minimum of 20 days holiday in 1999.  We are also using the opportunity to improve the holiday entitlements of part-time workers and those on very short contracts.  The right to holidays is being extended to all employees regardless of hours worked.  People will earn holidays against time worked.  In addition, for the first time the law will specify that employers must have regard to balancing family needs against work requirements in the timing of annual leave. This is the first time the requirement to have regard to family responsibilities has been included in employment law.</P>
    <P>With growing participation by part-time employees in the workforce, we want basic rights, such as holiday pay, extended to all employees. Some 13.8 per cent of workers are part-time employees, an increase from 8.5 per cent in the last eight years.  I have been an atypical worker for most of my working life and such workers are equally entitled to protection under employment protection law.  As we move from traditional secure employment in nine to five jobs to more varied types of contracts where employers seek that type of flexibility, we have an obligation to <Col N="433" /> ensure that the right of such workers who offer that flexibility are respected.</P>
    <P>This balanced approach is designed to ensure that standard workers and non-standard workers have the same legal entitlements.  For example, a person who works for one employer on a Monday, another employer on a Tuesday and a third employer on a Wednesday &mdash; what Charles Handy terms &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; workers &mdash; will earn holiday rights against time worked without having to meet the eight hour threshold under the existing law.</P>
    <P>In a further recognition of the way in which the workplace has changed since the holidays legislation was enacted in 1973, the qualifying period for a public holiday will be reduced to 40 hours in the five weeks immediately preceding the public holiday.  This provision will bring public holiday entitlements to a range of part-time and atypical workers who would not have benefited before this because of their working arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that every employee is entitled to one day off per week, which must be Sunday unless Sunday working is specified in the employee's contract of employment.  This means that voluntary Sunday working will be protected by the Bill.  If Sunday is not included as a working day in a person's contract, they cannot be obliged to work on a Sunday.  I regard Sunday as a special day and this is why I have introduced for the first time in law an entitlement to a premium for Sunday working.  Over the past number of years the number of people working on Sunday has been rising steadily.  While seven day working is a feature of many industries and services, the increase appears to be due to extended operating time for industry and an increase in Sunday opening hours for shops.</P>
    <P>Most employees who work on a Sunday already have a premium built into their rate of pay to cover Sunday working.  However, there are groups of workers who are still offered a flat rate for Sunday working.  It is generally accepted that Sunday working should command a premium; in the various employment regulation orders the premium varies across sectors, but the principle is generally established.  The Bill proposes to set this principle down in law and give every employee who has to work on a Sunday an entitlement to an additional payment.  This covers people who are rostered for Sunday duty and those who only work on Sundays.  This measure has at the same time the effect of recognising the special nature of Sunday as a traditional day of rest by ensuring that employees, if they have to give up their Sundays, are rewarded accordingly while permitting Sunday work which has become commonplace in a large range of employment sectors.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people at work and a greater participation rate in the labour market of women than ever before.  Part of this increase is made up of part-time employment and other <Col N="434" /> atypical work.  The needs of business are changing and greater flexibility is required, with extended opening hours and increased operating times for industry.  New working patterns have revolutionised our traditional view of regular working hours and the full &mdash; time job.  I am aware that there is a demand from some workers for part-time and atypical work to match their own personal circumstances and this appears to be the case for many women who take up such employment.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the trend towards greater flexibility in the workplace has led to the development of some disturbing practices.  Of particular concern is the development of the practice known as the zero hour contract.  This practice, where the employee must make himself or herself available throughout the week for work that may not materialise, is perhaps the most demeaning.  It is similar to the old hiring fair.  In this type of employment relationship the employee has zero rights and zero protections.  It is unreasonable that an employee should be subject to costs, such as childminding and travel, in respect of work which may not materialise.  To illustrate this point, it is not uncommon for some employees to be on call for work which may arise at a moment's notice or to remain on standby without any guarantee of any work or income.</P>
    <P>Changing patterns in the organisation of work have placed new pressures on employees.  It is by no means unreasonable to expect that greater demands for flexibility on the part of the employer must be accompanied by certain protections for the employee.  In the Bill we propose a twofold measure to effectively ban zero hour contracts and require employers to give advance notice of working hours to their employees. Under these new measures employees will not only be entitled to advance information on their rostered hours but they will also be entitled to be paid for a minimum proportion of the number of hours for which they are required to be available. From now on, if an employee is on standby for the entire week and has not received notice of the times of work and is not given any work, he or she will be entitled to pay for a proportion of the time that he or she is required to be available. The Bill will outlaw zero hour contracts.</P>
    <P>It is a primary objective of the proposed new legislation that it should be enforced in a manner which is familiar to both workers and employers, that enforcement should be informal and cost effective and that it should provide speedy determinations. In most cases we are converting previously negotiated employment standards to new legal rights.  Arising from this background our approach to the enforcement of these new statutory rights has changed.  Working time issues, such as disputes over rest times, have traditionally been dealt with by the Labour Court and a reservoir of expertise has been built up in dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we propose to give an expanded new role to the Labour Court, which will act as the arbitration body for the purposes of this new <Col N="435" /> law.  The Labour Court and the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission will provide a cost effective speedy service in which I am confident that any problems or disputes arising in this legislation can be quickly resolved.  For example, under the old Holidays Act, people had to go to the District Court to establish holiday rights.  Under the Bill, people can use the Labour Court as a quick, flexible and informal mechanism.  It is better that employment law is dealt with by the Labour Court rather than the civil and criminal courts.</P>
    <P>Under the enforcement provisions an employee or a trade union with the employee's permission will be permitted to take his or her case to a rights commissioner and, on appeal, to the Labour Court without resorting to formal legal proceedings, as was the case previously in the holidays area.  If somebody has a series of appeals before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, he or she will not go to the Labour Court with a holiday claim if they were unfairly dismissed or there is a minimum notice claim.  The person can go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal as a one-stop-shop.  This will make matters simple and customer friendly.</P>
    <P>I have spoken earlier about the repeal of existing prescriptive legislation in this area and also about the way in which the world of work has changed.  An important objective of the legislation is that all employees benefit equally from the health and safety protections in the context of their different employment circumstances. While it is likely that the majority of employees will be unaffected by the Bill, having greater protections already, there is plenty of scope to vary the standard provisions if required.</P>
    <P>There is substantial opportunity in the Bill for the social partners and employee representatives at local level to negotiate working time arrangements which accommodate the interests of both employer and employee.  It would be impossible and arguably wrong for Government to attempt to regulate in a prescriptive manner all employment types and arrangements.  At present there are approximately 12 cases per week coming before my Department where an employer wants to change shift arrangements.  Under the legislation of the 1930s the Minister or the Department, on my behalf, has to approve variations on shift arrangements.  This red tape is unsuited to the modern flexible work place.  The Bill will empower employers and employees to devise their own working time arrangements: if the circumstances in an employment are such that compliance with the principal statutory rest periods at the time required in the Bill are not possible, alternative rest and working times may be agreed at local or sectoral level and the terms of such agreements will be binding under the legislation. Through this measure we are responding to and encouraging the move towards genuine partnership at local level.  A local agreement which does not fit precisely within the standard terms of the <Col N="436" /> legislation can be accepted and registered with the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>For employers, the Bill gives scope to organise working hours to accommodate production demands.  For employees, the Bill sets out new standards and norms of protection for the first time.  Competitive pressures and the adoption of new systems of work have given rise to new work patterns.  The organisation of work is facing rapid change at every level.  We recognise this and are responding to these changes in this Bill, which sets out a modern framework of employment law into the next century.</P>
    <P>This legislation will apply to all employees with certain exceptions, namely, doctors in training and work at sea, sea fishing and the transport sector. The transport sector will be exempted by regulation to provide for a more comprehensive description of the types of transport employees which are to be excluded.  The exemptions provided in this legislation do not mean that the working time in these sectors will remain unregulated. On the contrary, separate sector specific directives are being discussed in Brussels for these areas and will become law in due course. We do not wish to double regulate these sectors. The directives which are being drawn up for these sectors take account of the special features and characteristics of working time in these areas.  I understand that the Commission will be publishing a White Paper on the remaining sectors to be regulated in the near future.  I am aware that a number of Senators have concerns, particularly in relation to doctors in training.  I share those concerns and we will be working in Brussels to ensure this matter is progressed as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition to these exempted categories, we also propose to exempt the Defence Forces and the Garda.  I am satisfied that in normal circumstances the Defence Forces and the Garda have sufficient protection built into their rostering and holiday arrangements.  However, due to the nature of the service provided by these two categories and in accordance with the exemption permitted in the framework directive, it would be impractical to apply the terms of the directive to their work.  We do not want a situation where somebody completes their working hours while in hot pursuit of an escaping criminal.  In accordance with the directive the Bill also gives an enabling power to exempt employees in the civil protection services where the nature of the work could conflict with the directive.</P>
    <P>I am also incorporating additional flexibilities for certain sectors recognised as having such a need.  These sectors include industries subject to seasonality or a foreseeable surge of productivity and include agriculture, public utilities, the media, security industry and industries which cannot be interrupted on technical grounds.  These sectors listed in the Bill can avail of a six month averaging period for the 48 hour week and may also be the subject of regulations which will give additional flexibility regarding the timing of rest. <Col N="437" /> In addition, employees who, as a matter of fact, determine their own working hours will be exempt from the working time provisions of the legislation.</P>
    <P>There were a number of important changes to the Bill during its passage through the Dáil.  Arising from the ongoing consultative process and in response to strong representations from certain sectors which would have had difficulty with the immediate application of the 48 hour rule, the Bill was significantly amended on Committee Stage to include a phase-in period to ensure that employers and employees have sufficient time to adjust to the new working hours limit.  This is intended to deal with the practical difficulties which would arise if the 48 hour rule were to have immediate effect.  The phase-in period of two years provided for the Fifth Schedule of the Bill allows 60 hours per week to be worked in the first year of operation and 55 hours in the second year. I am satisfied that this will deal with most of the practical issues raised during consultations with industry representatives.  Further amendments were introduced in relation to record keeping and employees who determine their own working time.</P>
    <P>In response to representations on behalf of shop workers, with whom I had lengthy discussions, the Bill was modified to provide for the preservation of existing rest break entitlements. In addition, following discussions with unions, employers, the social partners and others, I have clarified and improved the sections on the provision of information, zero hour contracts, holidays and Sunday working.  Regarding minimum notice, if somebody takes their weekly rest break on a Saturday and Sunday, notice for their working hours on Monday morning and for the following week have to be given by Thursday evening of the previous week.</P>
    <P>Having secured the support of the social partners, both IBEC and ICTU, the Organisation of Working Time Bill represents a balanced package of measures to protect employees in relation to their rest and working hours without interfering with existing legally acceptable agreements or the conduct of business.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about the 48 hour week and, as I said earlier, the Government has decided to phase in this provision over two years to ensure that both employers and employees have sufficient time to adjust to the new limit.  The new arrangements permit 60 hours to be worked in the first year after commencement of the Act, reducing to 55 hours in the second year and 48 hours in the third and subsequent years.  This transition period is designed to meet the specific needs of such sectors as coops, construction and building and the security industry.  It allows time to make adjustments to rostering, recruitment and training and to take advantage of cyclical factors in the building and construction sector.</P>
    <P>This Bill is concerned with protecting the health and safety of workers.  It is damaging to <Col N="438" /> worker's health and safety if they are systematically asked throughout the year to work excessive hours.  In the same way that we do not allow an opt out regarding wearing a hard hat on a building site, it is important that the protections included in the Bill for valid reasons are accepted. I regard them as important core issues.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement of the Bill.  Section 2 concerns interpretation and defines the terms used in the Bill.  Section 3 exempts members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, persons engaged in work at sea, doctors in training, family members who are employees and persons who can themselves determine the duration of their working time.  This section also empowers the Minister to exempt from any provision of the Bill by regulation employees involved in transport activities or in the civil protection services where application of the Bill would undermine the efficiency of the service concerned.  When we talk about transport activities we are referring to workers involved in transporting.  It does not include, for example, clerical staff in CIE; but it would include lorry drivers, for example, employed by a manufacturing company.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of the section was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to clarify that people who determine the duration of their own working time are exempt from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 exempts people from the daily and weekly rest provisions, set out in Part II, an employee each time he or she changes shift and an employee whose employment involves periods of work spread out over the day.  This section also empowers the Minister to make regulations regarding split shift workers.  The section allows the Minister, on condition that compensatory rest is provided, to exempt by regulations specified sectors set out in article 17 (2) of the directive from provisions of the Bill regarding daily and weekly rest, rest intervals at work, night working and information on working hours.  The Minister must consult with the employers and employees likely to be affected by the proposals before making such regulations.</P>
    <P>This section also provides that a collective agreement approved by the Labour Court, registered employment agreement or an employment regulation order may exempt affected employers and employees from compliance with the sections of the Bill set out in Part II which deal with daily and weekly rest and rest intervals, provided that the employees benefit from compensatory rest.  In other words, if there is a variation, workers must get compensatory rest.</P>
    <P>Section 5 exempts employers from compliance with the working time provisions of the Bill without prejudice to the employees' entitlement to compensatory rest in exceptional or emergency circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that if an employee is not entitled to the minimum rest provisions set out in the Bill by reason of ministerial regulation, an approved collective agreement, including a registered <Col N="439" /> employment agreement or an employment regulation order, the employer must ensure that the employee has available to him or her equivalent compensatory rest.  The principle running throughout these sections is that if there is a variation from the standard rest provisions, there must be equivalent compensatory rest.</P>
    <P>If for objective reasons it is not possible for an employer to ensure that the employee avails of the minimum rest to which he or she is entitled then the employee is entitled to appropriate compensation, which may not be of monetary or material benefit but take the form of provision of a benefit which improves the physical conditions under which the employee works or the amenities or services available to the employee while at work.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a standard provision concerning making regulations.  Section 8 empowers the Minister to appoint inspectors.  Section 9 repeals certain enactments.  Section 10 is a standard section dealing with expenses.  Section 11 provides for an entitlement by an employee to a minimum rest period of 11 consecutive hours in each 24 hour period.  The weekly rest break is 24 hours plus 11 hours, giving a total minimum weekly break of 35 hours.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for an entitlement by employees to a rest break while at work of 15 minutes in a period of four and a half hours' work and 30 minutes in a period of six hours' work. Breaks at the end of the working day do not satisfy these requirements.  This section was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide that the minimum rest period of 30 minutes may be extended to one hour for certain categories of employee by regulation made by the Minister. This was done to preserve the existing rights of shop workers to a one hour lunch break.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for an entitlement by everyone to a weekly rest period of 24 hours which must be in addition to the daily rest period of 11 hours.  This may be granted over a 14 day period.  In the event of technical or other objectively justified circumstances the employer may decide that the weekly rest is not preceded by the daily rest entitlement of 11 hours.  Unless otherwise specified in an employee's contract of employment, the weekly rest period shall include a Sunday.  If the employee must work on a Sunday he or she will be entitled to another day off during the week.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that an employee required to work on Sunday shall be entitled to a premium payment for this work which may consist of a payment or bonus time off in lieu or a combination of both.  If the employee does not already receive a Sunday premium he or she shall be entitled to the appropriate premium payable to a comparable employee in a collective agreement in force in a similar industry or sector in accordance with the arrangements set out in this section.  A Dáil Committee Stage amendment now requires an employee, when making a complaint, to bring to <Col N="440" /> the notice of the Rights Commissioner or Labour Court a relevant collective agreement.  The Sunday premium is set by reference to the going rate in the industry which will be determined by the Labour Court by looking at collective agreements already in force for comparable workers.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that an employer shall not permit an employee to work for more than 48 hours averaged over a four month period.  A six month averaging period is permissible in the sectors set out in Article 17(2) of the directive, such as agriculture, tourism, electricity production, etc. This section also allows for the averaging period to be extended to a maximum of 12 months by collective agreement.  The averaging period shall not include absences from work due to statutory annual leave, sick leave or maternity or adoptive leave.  As I said, this will be phased in over a period of two years.  This mechanism will permit working of 60 hours per week in the first year and 55 hours per week in the second year after commencement.  Allowing averaging over 12 months by collective agreement will take account of all kinds of seasonal work and employers and employees should find it practical to implement.</P>
    <P>Section 16 defines night time, night work, night worker and special category night worker.  In accordance with the directive, the section provides that, where a night worker is not a special category night worker, the employer must ensure that the employee does not work greater than an average of eight hours per night or 48 hours per week averaged over a two month period.  It provides that employers and employees may enter into a collective agreement which must be approved by the Labour Court, which may extend the period over which the night working is averaged. Where a night worker is categorised as a special category night worker, following a risk assessment of the hazardous nature of the work, an absolute limit of eight hours per night per 24 hour period applies.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that an employee shall be entitled to be notified in advance of the hours which the employer will require the employee to work.  Where unforeseeable circumstances justify a change in the notified times, an employer may alter the starting or finishing times.  This section was strengthened on Committee Stage in the Dá il to clarify that notice must be given on Thursday evening of the following Monday morning's work.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that an employee may not be subjected to zero hour contracts without compensation. In broad terms the section provides that, in the event of an employer failing to require an employee to work at least 25 per cent of the time, the employee is required to be on standby under the contract of employment.  The employee will be entitled to payment for 25 per cent of the contract hours or 15 hours per week, whichever is less.  An amendment was passed at Committee Stage in the Dáil to ensure there would be no entitlement to the minimum payment if there was only an expectation that employment would be given.  However, if people are required by their <Col N="441" /> contracts to be available they receive the minimum payment.</P>
    <P>Section 19 sets out the three mechanisms for earning an entitlement to annual leave.  They are similar to those applying to employees, including part-time employees, in existing legislation on holidays while allowing for the increase in holiday entitlement from three weeks to four weeks, or from 6 per cent to 8 per cent of time worked for part-time employees.  The new four week entitlement shall not come into effect until April 1999. Up to then the First Schedule sets out the transitional arrangements giving entitlement on a phased basis.  For the leave year beginning April 1997, there will be 16 days leave; for the leave year beginning April 1998, 18 days and for the leave year beginning April 1999, 20 days.</P>
    <P>Section 20 sets out the criteria which shall apply to the times at which annual leave may be granted and to the arrangement whereby an employee may be paid for this leave.  A change from the existing arrangements is that an employer must take into account the need for the employee to reconcile work and any family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Section 21 sets out the criteria which shall apply to public holiday entitlements.  The qualifying period for part-time workers is that at least 40 hours' work during the five weeks before the public holiday will be required for entitlement to a public holiday.  This section was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to ensure that an individual employee will be entitled to a public holiday even though that employee is never rostered to work a public holiday.  Someone not rostered to work on a Monday will still get bank holiday entitlements.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that the mechanism for calculating the rate of pay for a public holiday shall be set out by regulation.  This section also provides that time off granted to an employee for holidays or public holidays shall be regarded as time worked for pay purposes.  Section 23 provides that an employee or his or her personal representative in the event of his or her death shall be entitled to the payment of any holidays or public holidays compensation owing at the time of cessor of employment.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides that the Labour Court shall approve of collective agreements which are concluded to vary the basic terms of the Bill concerning working time.  Before it can approve of a collective agreement, the Labour Court must be satisfied that such agreement accords with the directive, has been concluded in the manner usually employed in determining the pay or other conditions of the employees concerned and that the body negotiating the agreement is representative of the employees concerned.  The Labour Court shall determine its own procedures and shall keep a register of the approved collective agreements which shall be available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>Section 25 specifies that an employer must keep records for at least three years to show that <Col N="442" /> he or she is complying with the legislation.  This section was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to allow the Minister to exempt employers from keeping records in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides that an employee who refuses to co-operate with an employer in breaching the Act shall not be penalised by the employer. It was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to prevent double compensation which could arise if awards were made pursuant to unfair dismissal in addition to claims under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides that an employee or an employee's trade union may make a complaint to a Rights Commissioner who shall investigate the complaint and make a decision.  The complaint must be presented before six months following the occurrence of the breach unless exceptional circumstances prevent this.  Provision is also made for ministerial regulation.  Section 28 provides that people may appeal a decision of a Rights Commissioner to the Labour Court but must do so within six weeks of hearing the Rights Commissioner's decision.  Where a decision has not been appealed by the employer and has not been implemented within six weeks, the Labour Court, without an investigation, may make a determination which is the same as the Rights Commissioner's decision.  There is the usual appeal to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides that the Labour Court's determination can be enforced by the employee, the trade union or the Minister in the Circuit Court without hearing the employer or any evidence in relation to the complaint.  The court may order the employer to pay interest on an award.</P>
    <P>Section 30 deals with evidence in relation to prosecution of a person for failure to attend before the Labour Court or refusal to give evidence or failure or refusal to produce documents. Section 31 allows the Minister to go to the Rights Commissioner on behalf of an employee where it would be unreasonable for the employee to pursue a complaint.  This shall be treated in the same way as a complaint from the employee.</P>
    <P>Section 32 obliges employers who employ outworkers to keep a register, the details of which will be set out by regulation.  Section 33 prohibits double employment where the aggregate total of hours worked exceeds the provisions of the Act. Section 34 provides that an offence may be prosecuted by the Minister.  Section 35 sets out the procedures for the preparation by the Labour Relations Commission of a code of practice for the purposes of any section of the Bill.  This ties in with negotiated agreements between both sides which are registered as a registered collective agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 36 is required to clarify the powers of inspectors under the Bill.  Section 37 is a standard provision.  Section 38 closes a loophole and extends the period in which the Health and Safety Authority can take a prosecution in circumstances where proceedings are delayed by an inquest.  Section 39 provides for a solution to the difficulties encountered with the enforcement of <Col N="443" /> decisions of a Rights Commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Labour Court under a range of legislation where details relating to an employer are incorrectly set out in a decision.</P>
    <P>Section 40 is a new section added at Committee Stage in the Dáil to ensure, in the case of complaints, that holiday entitlements may be claimed at the same time as entitlements under other enactments.  Section 41 increases fines under health and safety legislation from a maximum of £1,000 to £1,500 in District Court prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a detailed and complex measure.  It represents a balanced and sensible approach on working time and a comprehensive response to recent developments in the workplace.  It sets out a framework of employment law which is suitable for Ireland as a vibrant economy heading towards the 21st century and which builds its prosperity on respect for the basic rights of workers and decent minimum standards.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. This debate will be perceived as an easy ride in comparison with the Second Stage and Committee Stage debates on this Bill in the other House, particularly in relation to certain key issues.  The good news is that my party enthusiastically welcomes and supports the broad thrust of the Bill. We believe the Bill will, as the Minister of State said in her closing remarks, provide a necessary framework for the workplace as we enter the new millennium.  The bad news is that I will concentrate on some key areas of the Bill which the Minister of State has already debated in some detail in the other House.  Those areas are exclusion, competition, the real or imagined impact which the Bill will have on our industrial competitiveness, Sunday trading and the thorny question of the opt out.</P>
      <P>Flexibility in regard to the opt out was argued for cogently in the other House by our spokes-person on Labour affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, Deputy Harney and other Members of the Opposition. However, their cogent arguments fell on deaf ears.  The Minister of State held her ground and we are now presented with the result of that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to competitiveness, the Minister of State has spoken exclusively about the health and safety aspects of the Bill.  Nobody can argue with the proposals in the Bill which will improve health and safety at work.  The Minister of State was right to refer in the other House to 19th century, Victorian thinking in this area which needed to be significantly updated.  However, my concern centres around industrial competitiveness, our role in an expanded Europe and the possibility that inward investment might be threatened by our adherence to the strict interpretation of this EU directive.  I use the adjective &ldquo;strict&rdquo; because the EU, when putting forward this directive before the Council of Ministers, indicated it will <Col N="444" /> review the directive after seven years.  Our Government, however, is opting for a much shorter phasing in period of two years and is not concentrating to any large extent on the possible adverse implications for industrial competitiveness of the inflexible 48 hour rule.</P>
    <P>References were made to the famous IDA letter, which was subsequently withdrawn.  When the letter from Kieran McGowan first appeared in the media, it seemed on first reading to be a breath of fresh air, in that somebody working at the cutting edge of industrial development and attempting to attract more jobs to this economy was outlining possible difficulties which might arise for him and his directors in their dealings with potential inward investors and their competitors, specifically the Northern Ireland and Scottish industrial development boards.  The Scottish board has achieved a number of industrial coups over this country over the last decade.</P>
    <P>The letter was subsequently withdrawn and a different interpretation was placed on it. However, the incident reminded me of the banner headlines which appear in the printed media, which are what people remember.  If a story is refuted or an apology is sought, the clarification and apology are invariably buried at the bottom of page 6 of the newspaper and the public is left with the original banner headline.  The perception still persists therefore that, in spite of the reforming nature of this legislation, Ireland could be at an industrial disadvantage because of the Government's lack of response to the question of flexibility on the 48 hour opt out rule.</P>
    <P>Siemens, the German electronics giant, decided two or three years ago to seek an overseas location within the European Union.  At the time it seemed surprising it was seeking a location outside Germany because the whole thrust of German economic policy is towards providing a more equitable balance between the former East and West Germany and one would have thought that Siemens would have invested in East Germany rather than a non-German location.</P>
    <P>Ireland was batting along with the rest of the EU countries for what has since turned out to be a significant industrial development employing several thousand people but, unfortunately, we failed to attract Siemens.  The British Government was delighted to announce at a press conference, attended by the chief executive of Siemens, that the plant was going to the depressed north eastern region around Sunderland and Newcastle.  The chief executive was asked at the press conference what had influenced his company to locate in the United Kingdom.  He referred to the Social Chapter and what he euphemistically called the flexible working conditions and environment for creating profits which existed in the United Kingdom to a greater extent than in the other competing countries.</P>
    <P>The question of opting out of the Social Chapter has been at the centre of British political debate since the directive was first passed.  It is too early to say for sure, but the indications are <Col N="445" /> that the new British Government &mdash; which one presumes will be a Labour Government &mdash; will retain much of the Tory industrial policy in this regard, although some Labour spokespersons have been saying it will sign up to the Social Chapter.  We will have to await the political developments in that country to see what it is going to do.  However, there is no question that it is a very difficult area which is fraught with complexities. The Irish Government has decided to implement the 48 hour rule with no flexibility or opt out, except in certain specific areas with which the Minister of State has dealt.</P>
    <P>It is important in this debate to register a certain reservation, which was put much more strongly by my colleagues in the other House.  I can now indicate to the Minister of State that we will be tabling an amendment on flexibility, similar to that tabled by Deputy Tom Kitt in the other House on Report Stage.  I and many of my colleagues feel very strongly about this matter because freedom of choice in a free and democratic society should be paramount.  I differ from the Minister's ideology in one key area: I have always believed the Labour Party policy and ideology were based on the notion of the granny State from the cradle to the grave and there was no great encouragement or enthusiasm for individual choice, entrepreneurial type innovations or for those who wish to break the mould.  However, the Minister may think what a load of old rubbish, the Senator is wrong, the new Labour Party which is a social democratic party is for freedom of choice also.  While that may be the message the effect of this legislation, and a view shared by many of my colleagues in both Houses, is that inflexibility on the 48 hour working time restricts freedom of choice.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister said that only 6 per cent of the working population would opt for increased working hours in a week but surely those people are as entitled to that view as anybody else in this working environment.  What is more important is that increasingly inward investment is influenced by internal working practices agreed between the workforce and management. It seems, from what the Minister said on the wide consultation procedure in which she and her Department indulged &mdash; although it is welcome &mdash; has been strongly influenced by the trade unions' views on this issue.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Tom Kitt referred to meetings he and the Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; the former Minister with responsibility in this area &mdash; had with Mr. Peter Cassells and Ms Patricia O'Donovan and to the fact that they failed to agree on flexibility.  In recent years an increasing amount of job creation in this tiger economy is being provided by non-union multinationals.  It is like the love about which we should not speak, it is not something that emerges into public debate.  Whenever one hears about the significant job creation in-flows from American and other companies it is trumpeted across the media and, unless one looks at <Col N="446" /> the small print, one does not find out that in practically all cases they are non-union.  They operate their own bargaining position and worker-employer relationships within the environment of the industry.  The views of the trade union movement on this issue as it affects our continuing competitiveness in the European context is largely irrelevant.  As trade union membership is on the decline why should this albeit extremely powerful lobby group have such a dominant view which seems to have been accepted by the Government?  It is based very much on the experience of a new company, Masonite, in County Leitrim.  It is a welcome development and will employ 350 people.  I asked if they would be unionised and they said, no, and nobody will say a word to them.</P>
    <P>Sunday trading is a complex area.  I will not go into it in detail now.  The arguments have been well made but there should be a national referendum. The people should be asked if they wish to have Sunday trading as is currently practised by multinationals, not by the small corner shop and not by the small newsagents.  It is not beyond the ken of this Government to frame legislation &mdash; even in the absence of a referendum &mdash; to allow the small shops to operate throughout rural Ireland and at the same time severely curtail and restrict the large multinationals.  They open on Sunday from 12 noon until 6 p.m. Why cannot legislation be framed to enable shops to open only for one hour, say from 12 noon until 1 p.m. or again from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m. or 10 p.m?  That is when people are most likely to go to their local shop on a Sunday if they are stuck for something.</P>
    <P>I compliment and put on the record a tribute to my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, for initiating specific legislation in this area which the Government has graciously accepted.  I hope we can return to this on Committee Stage and again we will put forward some proposals on Report Stage. I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for indulging me a little longer than I had hoped.  I welcome the broad thrust of this legislation and wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and in view of the fact that an election may be imminent, I am glad we will have an opportunity to pass it.  When initiated, many Senators and other individuals, especially the self-employed in service industries, spoke about their fear of Sunday trading.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with some of the issues.  The Minister made a number of important amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  For many years legislation has been introduced which often imposed prohibitions on employers.  All Governments have been associated with this as a result of European directives and so on.  When one considers that legislation being enacted now will be law into the next Millennium and beyond, and considering it has been a long time since there were any real changes in this area, the Bill is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The self-employed, especially those in the service industry, and those who can determine their <Col N="447" /> own hours were concerned about the changes proposed in this Bill.  When we last had the opportunity to discuss employment with this Minister of State and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, we spoke about the huge increase in job creation in the service industry. The people working in that area were deeply worried about the legislation and its effect on their businesses and on the work and service they provide. The Minister has dealt with this matter successfully and ensured that these people can work unhindered and can decide their own hours.</P>
    <P>I wonder how politicians would fare if this legislation applied to them.  Since Sunday I have worked in the region of 48 hours, and I have no doubt many of us would not be able to work within the rules and regulations being proposed here.  We must seriously consider the health and safety element of employment and it is important there are rules and regulations to ensure people have time to enjoy a very important aspect of life &mdash; recreation.  We all know workaholics and at the end of the day we ask how they do it but people do not always consider the health aspect.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred the implementation of the incorporation of flexibility time, such as lunch and coffee breaks, in the extended number of hours worked per day to take place over a five year rather than a three year period.  However, if serious problems emerge within a couple of years of the legislation taking effect, perhaps the Government might review how it affects companies.  While we wish to protect workers we do not want to see problems emerge from a too rapid implementation of the legislation before companies have time to adopt and train other staff they may have to employ.</P>
    <P>The sooner the Government legislates to ban Sunday trading, other than for the four weeks leading up to Christmas, the better.  There is no need for multinationals to open their businesses on Sundays.  When I was growing up these shops were not open.  Individuals or families went to local events such as parish fund-raisers and football, hurling or soccer matches.  Many local business people must now open on Sundays to compete when they would rather be at home with their families.  However, families now spend their Sundays browsing around shops.  They may not spend money, because ultimately the amount spent in the economy over a given year does not increase in response to businesses opening on Sundays.  There is no need for a referendum on this issue.  The Government should allow Sunday opening for the four weeks leading up to Christmas and no more.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the changes made to the Bill as originally drafted.  It is important to respect the fears expressed by employers.  The legislation should be reviewed after 18 months to see how it is working and to ascertain the effect it has on smaller companies whose staffs are unionised.  Many companies <Col N="448" /> investing in Ireland today do so on the basis that their workforces will not be unionised.  When canvassing last night in preparation for a possible forthcoming event, I met some of the workers of a company that has been taken over by a larger company.  The told me that the new company is seeking more working hours regardless of extra pay considerations.  They were not unionised and I understood the importance of this legislation in terms of protecting them.  I was told that the new company, which had taken over other companies in other countries and increased turnover by many millions of pounds, had indicated that pay increases could be considered when production was increased.  This legislation will at least ensure the workers involved will have an adequate amount of time off work, which is important for their health and safety.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive Bill.  I was a member of the Council of Europe when the EU Social Chapter was discussed.  The UK has not subscribed to it, although at the time its members on the council were not opposed to this legislation. If and when there is a change in Government in the UK, it may accept this and other measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has addressed the issue of the determination of own working time.  This was very important because it was a matter of great concern.  I attended a celebratory function of our club team when it won the county championship last November.  A number of young men and women who work for themselves told me that the 48 hour rule would put them out of business. I am delighted that this matter has been resolved.</P>
    <P>The Government should make a decision on the issue of Sunday trading.  Many Members of both Houses do not want to see it continuing in the way it has developed beyond taking place in the four weeks leading up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the legislation should be reviewed within 18 months.  There is no guarantee regarding the working of the regulations until they have been in place for some time.  This element of flexibility will be of use to employers, whose co-operation is essential to the success of the legislation, which is concerned with the safety and improvement of work practices in industry today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said this Bill was a detailed and complex measure.  That may be so but I preferred her description of the Bill as a balanced and sensible measure on working time and a comprehensive response to recent developments in the workplace.  I am glad she has tackled problems such as zero working hours, part-time workers and Sunday trading.  There is little to complain about in the Bill apart from one aspect I have discussed with her already, that is the exclusion of doctors in training &mdash; I have also discussed it with the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is about health and safety.  The Minister of State said &ldquo;It is a fact that long hours spent at work can damage a worker's health.  Tired workers can put themselves, their colleagues and <Col N="449" /> the general public at risk.&rdquo; In the case to which I am referring, the general public are patients. This is a risk like any other, and the Minister of State said &ldquo;The Government has a responsibility to minimise such risk.&rdquo; Frankly, the Government is not trying to minimise this risk sufficiently. Doctors in training should be covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>This is very serious.  In Ireland, doctors in training or non-consultant hospital doctors make up a substantial percentage of the medical labour force.  They currently number 2,500 or 40 per cent of all doctors.  It is suggested that these doctors work long hours for only a few years, and this does them very little harm, whatever about their patients.  Many of these doctors are in training for 12 years, and are working in excess of a maximum of 65 hours per week, often without payment for the extra hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the parents of workers and the effects of long working hours on family life.  Imagine the effect of working over 65 hours per week on the lives of young people of 25 to 35 years of age if they are trying to raise families.  We are said to be promoting family life but how can these people have proper families when they are working in these conditions and are not being given any protection by this Bill? We should have made more of an effort to balance their family needs and to understand that this is important for them.</P>
    <P>At present, a non-consultant hospital doctor's work consists of a basic 39 hours per week, which is remunerated at a flat rate.  There are different rates for additional overtime hours up to an agreed and approved maximum of 26 hours' overtime. There have been improvements in this area recently.  At one stage, when such doctors worked more than a certain amount of overtime, they received half pay.  Nobody else in the country was in this astonishing position.  The Minister for Health is trying to bring in a provision where people can opt to have time taken off the amount of hours they have to work instead of working overtime.  This is not a matter of quality health service but of health economics, and it is extremely bad that junior doctors are not being included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another problem in that, no matter what figure we set as the total number of weekly hours to be worked by non-consultant hospital doctors, they often exceed the maximum limits. The concept of 65 being the maximum hours worked loses its meaning after a while.  Some junior doctors are afraid to complain when they work over a certain number of hours, although that number may be specified in their contracts. These additional hours are being worked by doctors who are supposed to be in training, they are not trained people.  These excessive hours have nothing to do with training.  They are being worked to deliver a health care service but what sort of health care service is it?</P>
    <P>European Union Directive 93/104/EC exempts doctors in training from its protective provisions <Col N="450" /> on a maximum work week.  When the directive was under political discussion Ireland and the United Kingdom conspired together to exclude doctors in training.  Existing work practice agreements concerning the maximum working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors in Ireland are not being implemented properly at present.  The issue of unrostered hours, their identification and how the problem can be addressed, have proven over the years to be an almost insurmountable obstacle to achieving a practical and effective solution to the number of hours worked by non-consultant hospital doctors in Ireland.  Unrostered hours can best be defined as hours worked in excess of approved and agreed rosters.  We cannot know what they are.  However, they are not to be confused with overtime hours as they usually are in excess of a recommended roster.  These excessive hours are also usually worked by surgeons, anaesthetists, casualty officers and paediatric trainees, all those who work at the coalface and who are expected to deal with the most important emergency cases in the hospitals.  These people are frequently over tired.  I echo the Minister of State when she says that unsafe working hours put the worker and their colleagues at risk.  In this case, they are also putting patients at risk.</P>
    <P>We claim to want to ensure a high quality health care system.  The decision to exclude doctors in training from the protective provisions of the directive has the potential to delay the development of the health system.  It is unreasonable and unrealistic to demand non-consultant hospital doctors to give 100 per cent quality performance while working exhaustive hours under pressure.  It also sets a very dangerous precedent to exclude non-consultant hospital doctors from health and safety initiatives, given that such exclusion affects the health and safety of such doctors.  It sets a very bad example for them to tell people to do one thing while they are doing another.  Many international studies show that most mistakes involving the medical profession happen when doctors are over-tired.  In some cases which have involved medical litigation, it has been shown that the doctor had little or no sleep in the previous 72 hours.  That is three days, one day longer than the entire working week recommended by the Minister of State in some cases.</P>
    <P>I will not quote cases that arose here, but legislation was introduced in New York when a lawyer whose daughter died in a hospital casualty room from an asthmatic attack found out that the casualty officer on duty had had no sleep in the previous 24 hours.  In England, a young anaesthetist who was not a British national was involved in a manslaughter charge and it emerged the doctor had had four hours sleep in the preceding 72 hours.  I do not know how we can ally ourselves in the Council of Europe with a country where there are such working conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of this Bill states that there has to be 11 hours consecutive rest in every 24, but not many junior hospital doctors are getting that. <Col N="451" /> Section 16 states that there should be an eight hour limit on night work for every 24 hours. These provisions are excellent, but a doctor will begin work at 6 p.m. and work until 9 a.m. the next day.  Are our limits safe?</P>
    <P>Following lobbying from the Permanent Work Group of European Junior Hospital Doctors, or PWG, the European Parliament's Committee on Social Affairs recommended to the Parliament that the clause excluding doctors in training from the scope of the directive be deleted.  The European Parliament voted by an overwhelming majority to urge the Commission to delete the exclusion clause which would have extended coverage to junior doctors.  Despite this, the Council of Ministers adopted the directive with the exclusion clause intact, but, because of the strong recommendation of the Parliament, they included a sentence in the Preamble of the directive saying:</P>
    <P>where as given, the specific nature of the work concerned, it may be necessary to adopt separate measures with regard to the organisation of working time in certain sectors or activities which are excluded from the scope of the Directive.</P>
    <P>This was to allow member states the right to extend the provisions of the directive to the excluded sectors outlined in the directive text. Governments in the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Germany have introduced legislation to limit working hours for doctors in training along the lines of directive 93/104/EC.  I do not understand why we cannot do the same and why we are following United Kingdom's lead, which, as Senator Farrelly said, has opted out of the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty.  I feel strongly about this and ask the Minister of State to see what can be done so that we follow other European countries rather than the neighbouring island and Northern Ireland.  This not only affects workers in hospitals but also has a serious effect on patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which implements EU Directive 93/104.  I also welcome the fact that, with other EU states, we have chosen to include part of the directive in our national law.  I share Senator Henry's concerns about junior hospital doctors, in particular &mdash; I will come back to that.  A great deal of debate took place in the Dáil on how this legislation will affect our competitiveness, particularly in terms of attracting foreign investment.  I firmly believe in the importance of this type of social legislation to ensure the health and safety of our workers. This Bill will not have an adverse effect on attracting good employers.  We do not want to attract employers who will exploit our workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the ESRI report published today, the reason there is likely to be a steady increase in employment into the next millennium is that we are producing a well educated workforce <Col N="452" /> whose productivity is increasing.  Such factors, along with the management of the economy which is a broader issue, have ensured foreign investment in jobs and they override any suggestion that employers will feel constrained by our health and safety legislation.  I strongly believe we are correct not only to protect our workforce but to put this directive into law.</P>
    <P>Today over 800 jobs were announced in my region under the banner of Shannon development and a few hundred more jobs were announced in the mid-west region.  This is an indication of the buoyancy and health of our economy in terms of attracting investment from within this country and from abroad.  We need to balance existing jobs among the available workforce. It is wrong to encourage some sectors of the workforce to work long and unhealthy hours while others have no jobs.  It is also wrong not to make provision for people to have a life outside work.  People have family and social commitments and it is very important they have the opportunity to balance their working life with their family life.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact provision has been made for family commitments in terms of how holiday time is organised.  I also welcome the inclusion of atypical workers as there is an increasing number of such workers in the economy.  These people do not work the regular hours of nine to five; they work flexi-time or job share.  We need more debate on balancing people's family and child care commitments with work commitments. Issues such as parental leave are important not only for mothers but also for fathers.  The sooner we include the concept of parenting in people's working lives the better.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of practical detail in the Bill.  It is good that the 48 hour working period was teased out and the way in which it is incorporated in the legislation is practical in that the limit is over a reference period of four months and longer for seasonal workers.  The practical issues which arose have been taken on board.  The Bill also states there should be an eight hour limit on night work for 24 hours.  The legislation has taken into account the fact that people have different requirements according to the type of work they do.  The fact that a person may organise their own working time means they are not strictly covered by this legislation which is flexible and covers many of the concerns raised in the House and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I welcome the protection of Sunday workers and the fact zero hour contracts are covered and that people have a right to be informed of the likely hours they will be required to work at the beginning of the week.  It was appalling that people had to sit at the telephone not knowing if they would be called to work.  That was unacceptable exploitation of people in low paid employment who did not have other options and, therefore, were exploited by employers.  I welcome the fact that issue has been dealt with in the legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> Like Senator Henry I am familiar with junior hospital doctors but, unlike other Members, I am not familiar with other groups of workers exempted.  My husband was a junior hospital doctor when I had my first child and we spent most of the time in Canada.  I do not know if it has changed its legislation.  At that time it was difficult to bring up a young child when the other partner had to work all night and the following day, was exhausted at the end of the work period and was rarely off such a roster.  I do not know how much this has changed but the sooner this sector is included in the legislation the better for the doctors and the patients for whom they care.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said specific regulations were being drawn up in relation to these activities but I gather it is being done in the EU rather than here.  I agree with Senator Henry that the sooner this sector is included the better.  Junior doctors have a responsible job and it is essential they are in top form when carrying out their duties.  I hope specific regulations including this sector will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the Bill covers the majority of workers.  The flexibility of the legislation will be workable.  I am sure other Members received representations from various people; I received one from a local branch of a trade union.  It was supportive of the Bill.  It stated it was satisfied there would be maximum scope for flexibility by way of local collective agreements which take account of the needs of the individual enterprise without exposing workers to pressure from employers to work excessive hours.  That is what the Bill is about.  It is all very well to say people should be allowed to work as many hours as they wish and that an individual freedom is being called into question, but that is not the reality of people's working lives.  Often people work long hours not because they want to but because they are pressurised by their employers to do so.  They need the job and they feel they must accede to such a request.  Workers need this protection and I am glad this legislation is being introduced.</P>
    <P>The use of the Labour Court in the legislation is good because it is the specific court for this area and it works well.  The concept of using ordinary courts is impractical and would probably add extra costs.  The Labour Court has the mechanisms and experience to deal with issues which might arise under the Bill.  That is a welcome aspect of the legislation.  The Bill also ties in well with other legislation, such as the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill, which we debated a few months ago.  It is important all workers are protected, especially in the present industrial climate, where job security is not as commonplace as in the past and where people often need protection to ensure they are not exploited.  That the legislation covers private and public employment is important because it covers all workers.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of this Bill but I have a horror of EU regulations and <Col N="454" /> directives because as far as I can see they have not been for the good of this country.  I blame them for leaving Ireland denuded of its population and for leaving Europe, once the hub of employment, with 20 million people unemployed. However, this country has a slight edge on Europe in attracting employment and industry but Scotland and Wales, by not obeying these directives, are now attracting employment which would have come here and there is a danger we will lose more industries to England, Scotland and Wales.  We were doing well in the sixties and early seventies.  I often think that, had we not passed all those Bills and introduced all those rules, this would be a brilliant country today. However, we have been going backwards since the mid seventies and it is only over the past few years we are starting to go forward again.  This trend is in danger of being spoilt again.</P>
      <P>This must be the most over-regulated country of 3.5 million people.  Our biggest growth industry over the past 20 years must be appointing inspectors. Every Bill appoints more inspectors but no Minister ever tells us what it costs.  Has any cost been put on this measure?  I am sure there has not.</P>

      <P>I am not in favour of EU directives because they cost a lot of money.  Who will pay? The over-burdened PAYE worker will, who else? We talk about reducing tax yet we introduce Bills whose regulations create additional costs and expenses.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry's point about junior hospital doctors.  This group of workers should be covered by this legislation.  I have been a member of a health board for 22 years and know the hours these doctors work are ridiculous.  We talk about health and safety but they are just the play words of the EU.  The main reason for the directive is not health and safety, although it was a good phrase to use to sell the idea.  Nonetheless, junior hospital doctors should be subject to this regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently not very many low paid workers but child minders are very poorly paid and I do not see anything in this Bill which will improve their lot.  Child minders are the slaves in <Col N="455" /> Ireland today.  They mind children all day and, as soon as the parents are on holidays, the minder is redundant but they are not entitled to holiday money or anything else.  They receive nothing for three to four months of the year, yet they are expected to be on standby to mind the children as soon as the parents return to work.  It is time we thought of these people who are doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>I am pleased about the provision covering Sunday work, which I detest.  This practice is starting again with the big supermarkets opening on Sunday for no reason other than pure greed.  No one will make any more money once everyone opens on Sunday.  There will be a battle between the big supermarkets and the casualties will be the small corner shops which provide a great service.  Many of them have disappeared from rural Ireland and they will soon disappear from the cities.  In Ireland today, every village has derelict, shuttered buildings where once good family businesses were run.  How will this Bill affect family businesses? Can the man, wife and family run their business and work as many hours as they wish? Will they be subject to the same regulations as an employee?</P>
    <P>Many small contractors employed one or two people to do handiwork but we introduced so many regulations those workers could not afford to stay in employment, so they went on the dole and into the black economy.  In other words, we forced people into it.  Over the past 20 years we have turned this proud and hard working country into one dependent on social welfare and the State for everything.  We should be more careful.</P>
    <P>One thing on which I agree with the Germans is Sunday work.  In Germany, one can hardly buy a paper on a Sunday because everything is closed. I remember as a gasúr in Sligo when the shops were open until 11 p.m.  The unions fought until they got the shops to close at 9 p.m., then 6 p.m. and they eventually achieved a five day working week.  We all agreed with it.  Why then are we, 30 years later, going back to the same old system which our fathers and mothers fought?  We are introducing a seven day working week.  That is worse than in the past because then we at least had Sunday free.</P>
    <P>What about families going for a Sunday drive? Are we giving any thought to family life?  Only essential services should be provided on Sundays. We have managed for years without opening large supermarkets on Sundays.  We should not allow Sunday opening.  It is unfair.  God made the world in six days and called the seventh day holy but now working seven days is no longer enough; we have to work at night.  Greed is the root cause.</P>
    <P>Many people have to hold down two jobs to pay the mortgage and have a decent standard of living.  These are expensive times.  Are we going to deny those people the right to work?  Are we going to impose a maximum number of hours they can work?  What about the individual who works a five day week and works in a pub on <Col N="456" /> Saturday night?  Are we going to deny that person the right to earn a few pounds at the weekend? Where will this end?</P>
    <P>Some people have a number of part-time jobs. Who will provide holiday pay for them?  How will the amount of holiday pay be assessed?  This legislation will create many problems.  Governments will have to be careful with EU regulations. We are driving another nail into the coffin of family businesses.  If we allow Sunday work to continue we will destroy family life.  This Bill militates against family life, which has been almost destroyed anyway.  Sunday work should be abolished.  At least there should be an overtime rate for Sunday work which would help to curtail it.  I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill but how much will it cost?  I believe it will be very costly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with this type of legislation. Whether we will test that disagreement through the division lobbies is another matter. We are reaching a point where the State believes it must regulate for everything and in areas where it is not appropriate to do so.  How does the Fine Gael Party that I knew and respected go along with this legislation?  No one should be compelled to work more than 48 hours per week.  It should be a matter of choice.  If people are prepared to openly and willingly enter agreements to work all the hours God gives them within the ambit of health and safety, that should be allowed.  There is a tenuous connection between health and safety and working hours.  The exemptions confirm that view.</P>
      <P>Let us assume that it is appropriate for people to work no more than 48 hours per week.  How should this be regulated?  It should not be regulated by the State but by voluntary agreements between trade unions and employers.</P>
      <P>The other argument made in support of the Bill is that there is a requirement to implement the directive.  If one considers how lackadaisical we have been over the implementation of a succession of European directives one would say that this directive, issued as recently as 1993, is being implemented very quickly.</P>
      <P>This morning we heard about the Celtic tiger and the welcome news from the ESRI that economic growth will continue at a high level for the next ten years.  The Minister has grabbed the Celtic tiger by the tail in this legislation.  We are entering a highly competitive world.  There is a global economy.  Yesterday I listened to an IDA executive speak about how a small town like Kilcullen could attract overseas investment.  The point was made that it was possible, and likely, that executives would board aeroplanes in New York and by-pass Ireland on their way to countries such as Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. We are confronted by an international, competitive market in which only the fittest survive. We have shown the capacity and energy to survive in that market.  It is wrong to restrict that energy and survival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> Self-employed people can make their own regulations regarding working hours.  Many of them work long hours.  In farming if the corn is ripe it will not wait for a 48-hour week.  I know of an occasion when corn was cut for 36 hours non-stop.  Two drivers were involved but the only stoppage was to refuel the combine harvester. There are similar industries in which, when the pressure is on, the harvest must be reaped.  One has to make the best use of the hours available.  I object to this Bill because it reduces our competitiveness and choice.  These matters should be a question of choice.  That is what liberalism is about.</P>
    <P>What of the pressure an employer might impose upon employees who are unwilling to work longer than the number of hours allowed by the legislation?  That is a matter for unions and employers and it can operate easily if left to them.</P>
    <P>Prison officers, Garda and the Army are excluded from the provisions of this Bill. PDFORRA has expressed concern about the section of the Bill which relates to its members. The security industry has justifiable reservations about the Bill which should be taken into account.  The Irish Security Industry Association made a submission to the Minister on how the regulations would impinge upon its members. This is a responsible, national body with quality assurance and membership conditions.  It made a reasonable proposal asking the Minister to introduce an opt-out clause to the directive which could be achieved by making it conditional on a collective agreement.  The industry added that this approach would demonstrate to the EU that the Government was taking the necessary measures, as required by the directive, to ensure that no employer would require a worker to breach the 48-hour limit without the worker's agreement.</P>
    <P>In addition, the association urged the Minister to exempt the industry from the provisions of the Bill in view of the special circumstances in the EU directive.  The industry provides a civil protection service and under section 3(3)(b) of the Bill qualifies for the exemption by the Minister from any specified provision of the Bill.  That is the case made by the association and I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's views on it.  The association agreed to establish an independent ombudsman and said it would support the introduction of a State registration scheme.  It is acting responsibly.  There are specific difficulties in the industry.  One can envisage cases where security personnel would be on duty for more than 48 hours, but they would be capable, within health and safety parameters, of working those hours without causing difficulties for themselves.</P>
    <P>One of the attributes that has made this economy vibrant and attractive to investment is our ability to work hard.  We have proven that over many years.  If somebody wishes to take home only 50 pence in the pound after working overtime, they should be allowed to do that.  If somebody wishes to cripple themselves with a mortgage <Col N="458" /> on a £160,000 house in Dublin and believes they must work twice as hard to pay off the mortgage, that is their choice.  With regard to our activities in the Seanad, how would we get through the Committee Stage of Bills if the staff of the Clerk's Office were asked to restrict their activities to a 48 hour week?

      <P>Yes, the staff has the summer to average their hours, but that is not a satisfactory arrangement either.</P>
      <P>Another relevant matter is the issue of form filling.  Increasingly we ask business to do what should be the function of Government.  We impose obligations on business to employ people to fill in forms which must be remitted to Government. That is not appropriate if we are to have competitive industry.  Senator Quinn pointed out that the end result of these regulations might be that the employer will decide not to employ a person.  They could have a negative effect.</P>
      <P>I also object to the powers given to the inspector under section 8.</P>

      <P>The power to enter and &ldquo;to require the employer of an employee or the representative of such employer to produce to him or her any records which such employer is required to keep and inspect...&rdquo; and so forth are wide ranging powers to confer on an inspector.  Even if such powers have existed since the 1930s it does not make them any more desirable.  We are asking people to become agents of the State and to do the paperwork of the State.  We then send in inspectors to check the paperwork.  That removes the element of choice which is central to an open market economy.  The State should permit the exercise of choice.</P>
      <P>There are industries in which it is necessary for people to work long and unsocial hours.  Senator Farrell's comments about self-employed people were correct.  The owner of the corner shop which sells newspapers, sweets and groceries, works hard for many years to build up his or her business. Such people will be allowed to continue their work and their businesses are indicative of what can be achieved through sheer hard work.</P>
      <P>There is an element of the attitude that the State knows best in this legislation.  The implication is that the State should know how to regulate people's behaviour.  In my view, that is not the concern of the State.  Nobody should be required to work more than 48 hours per week if they do not wish to do so.  However, that should be brought about by agreement between the individual and the employer or between the individual's union and the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> With regard to enforcement, I believe this legislation, when passed, will be left in a dusty cupboard and will not be enforced.  Indeed, I am not suggesting it should be vigorously enforced because I share Senator Farrelly's sentiments about flexibility in its implementation.  My fundamental belief is that this Bill is not the way to regulate this area.</P>

      <P>A number of key points were made.  Senator Henry made an eloquent plea on behalf of non-consultant hospital doctors.  I share her concern for the patients and for the working conditions of doctors.  We have applied pressure in Brussels to secure progress on the common directive. However, under section 3(4) I can include non-consultant hospital doctors by regulation.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health recently concluded an agreement which reduced their working time to 65 hours.  Neither Senator Henry nor I consider that satisfactory, but it is an improvement on the previous position.  We hope to make progress on this matter both domestically and by putting pressure on Brussels.  The rules in the directive were negotiated by the former Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, and later by Deputy O'Rourke.  If there was an unholy conspiracy between Ireland and Britain, they were the unholy conspirators.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators referred to the issue of Sunday trading.  I agree that Sunday should be special.  Senator Farrelly spoke eloquently about how people went out to enjoy themselves with their families each Sunday.  They attended and supported local community functions.  Certainly, swanning around a supermarket is a sterile way to spend one's Sunday and I would not regard it as a break from my week's work.  However, I consulted with all parties involved in this issue, including the &ldquo;Keep Sunday Special&rdquo; organisation, MANDATE, the bishops, the Consumers' Association and RGDATA.  I have also taken legal advice.  That advice is that one cannot have one set of rules for small shops and different rules for large shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators seemed to seek such a distinction in their contributions.  Everybody has been the recipient of unexpected visitors on a Sunday and has had to rush to the corner shop to buy milk or rashers or apples to make an apple tart.  That facility would not be available if shops were forced to cease trading on Sundays.  Traditional shopping after Mass or Service on a Sunday would also not be available.  This is particularly important in rural Ireland where people travel to the village from outlying regions to worship on a Sunday and to purchase a few bits and pieces. They might only travel to the village twice a week, once to collect their pensions and on Sundays to worship.  Nobody would agree with the closure of corner shops on Sundays.  It would cause a social revolution in rural Ireland for <Col N="460" /> which Senator Mooney, a champion of rural Ireland, would never forgive me.</P>
    <P>We cannot have different rules for large and small shops unless we hold a constitutional referendum on the matter.  MANDATE accepts that and is now seeking a referendum.  Obviously that is a big step that would require extensive examination. However, the Bill makes it more expensive for people to trade on Sundays by ensuring that employers pay a Sunday premium, even if the people working in the shop are students who work only on Sundays.  These workers must be paid more than the standard hourly rate.  That provision will be an inhibition to the spread of this practice.  If it does not pay people to open shops on Sundays and if stores find they are only cannibalising their own business by doing so, they will soon close.  Some of the flag ship businesses, such as Dunnes Stores, who started this trend have discovered they are cannibalising their own business and they have limited the number of stores that are open on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell took a strong ideological view against EU regulations and directives.  This Bill is a major deregulation measure.  It deregulates the prescriptive system which dates from the 1930s through which I am obliged to endorse 12 to 14 requests to approve of shift hours.  It deregulates the requirement that piecework placards must be put on the wall in both Irish and English and the legal prohibition from having pictures which show one is working on collars or cuffs or buttons or buttonholes.  It replaces that type of prescriptive legislation with a flexible instrument.  It is a major instrument of deregulation.</P>
    <P>We play our part in Europe.  The good economic news today is not exclusively due to EU transfers but they have played a significant part in our current economic strength.  We cannot take the European shilling, euro or ecu, then say we will not play our part as good Europeans and engage in social dumping and undercutting due to unacceptably inferior social standards.  I am proud we signed the Social Chapter.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke about the UK opt-out to the Social Chapter being a competitive advantage and he cited the case of Siemens.  That was one swallow but there are far more locating in this country.  Since last November when this Bill was published, almost 12,000 additional jobs have been announced.  This does not mean we have used any competitive advantage.  Business knew these rules existed.  We have had discussions with multinationals who had two minor areas of concern which have been addressed.  They were concerned about excessive record keeping and senior executives who determine their own working hours, are not subject to direction by the company and are exempt from the maximum ceiling.</P>
    <P>These companies have flagship standards of worker protection.  They are successful precisely because they recognise that human resource management is the key to their future competitive strength.  They treat their workers well and without <Col N="461" /> this they would not be successful.  They know that tired workers are likely to write inaccurate computer programs or misplace microchips and are therefore not of any benefit to the company. These companies' major concern from a competitive point of view was about the bad mouthing of this legislation by certain people &mdash; the hype that it was going to be competitive doom and gloom, which it will not be.</P>
    <P>First, fewer than 6 per cent of all workers work more than 48 hours a week.  We are applying this measure in a flexible manner.  Lunch hours and tea breaks do not count as working time.  If someone works a standard week, gets an hour lunch break and a 15 minute tea break in the morning and afternoon, this is 48 net hours translating into 53 gross hours a week.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis misunderstood when he gave the example of harvesting.  There is very generous averaging &mdash; four months automatically, six months in the listed sectors which include those primarily seasonal in character and 12 months where the employer concludes a collective agreement with the workforce.  There is no problem with working all the hours God made to get in a harvest, provided there is compensatory time off at the dead time of the year.  If there is a rush of business to meet a seasonal order, there are no problems because that seasonality is built into the year.</P>
    <P>A 48 hour week allows people to work eight hours a day, six days a week the whole year round, which is a great deal of working hours.  It is not an oppressive rule.  People should not be forced to work excessive hours which put their health, family life or fellow workers or customers' lives at risk.  We have to say enough is enough. Many of the apocalyptic statements made during the debate on this Bill as regards the 48 hour rule were made in the 19th century when children were stopped going down the mines and up chimneys and working hours were reduced from a six and a half and seven day week.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis spoke about the importance of allowing people to voluntarily opt out.  We do not normally allow people to voluntarily opt out of basic safety precautions, such as having properly bedded scaffolding.  Eleven people died in workplace accidents in the first quarter of this year.  As Minister with responsibility for labour affairs, I have to ensure we observe proper health and safety practices.  I know that exhaustion leads to carelessness which causes loss of life.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell and Senator Dardis raised the issue of inspectors.  The inspectors already implementing other labour legislation will be utilised here.  There is no extra charge to the Exchequer.  Inspectors must have powers to check matters are in order.  If someone is involved in major breaches in legislation &mdash; which I hope will not be the case &mdash; and people are expected to work a seven day week, inspectors must have powers to check the records.  These are standard <Col N="462" /> powers which have always applied under labour law.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised the issue of child minders and holiday money.  Child minders will earn holiday money and will be entitled to earn against time worked.  The Senator also asked how holiday money will be calculated where there are multiple employers.  Each employer will owe 8 per cent holiday money against time worked.  This will be phased in from 6 per cent to 8 per cent in 1999, as outlined in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Much nonsense has been spoken about competitiveness. Often our greatest disadvantage competitively is that we hype up matters.  We met the American Irish Chamber of Commerce who mentioned their concerns.  They said there was an aura of over-regulation around this legislation but they could not be specific.  I pointed out it was deregulation.  We badmouth ourselves by saying this legislation is uncompetitive.  It will not create any competitive disadvantage.  Our competition is based, as Senator O'Sullivan said, on the fact that we treat our workers well.  This is underlined in the ERSI report, in which I must declare an interest.  The quality of our workforce is our key competitive advantage.  People do not work well when they are not treated well and are exhausted.</P>
    <P>In Britain there is no statutory right to holidays.  It will have to phase in a statutory right to 20 days holidays; there are companies there which will have to increase their holidays from two to three weeks.  Perhaps they are moaning and groaning about competition.  The UK is covered by the EU directive and it will have to ensure these ground rules are obeyed.  It is interesting that the UK is the only country which is proposing to use the individual opt out, but this may change tomorrow.  We do not see this as a competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>Our prosperity is founded on the tradition of social partnership.  Senator Mooney asked if I had listened to the trade unions who are in a dominant position.  He knows what side of the political fence I come from &mdash; I have a trade union background. However, as Minister with responsibility for labour affairs, I have to take a balanced view of issues and steer a course down the middle. IBEC did not get all it looked for, but neither did Congress.  We reached a consensus and IBEC and ICTU have signed up to what is in the Bill and agree it represents a balance.  Some issues have been in IBEC's favour and others in Congress's.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a balanced package of measures with which both sides are happy to comply.  It does not represent a dominance of one view over another.  It is good legislation and I welcome the positive comments made in the House. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection 2, line 28, after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&rdquo;, provided that section 14 shall not come into operation until the matter of Sunday work has been decided by the people by way of a Referendum&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment echoes the comments I made on Second Stage.  I did not elaborate on the issue in any great detail then as I indicated that I would table an amendment on Committee Stage.  The amendment is intended to put on record our views on Sunday trading.  The reason I am suggesting that this issue be put before the people by way of referendum is that we have had Sunday trading in this country by stealth.  The issue first came to my attention in early 1994 when Marks and Spencer arrived in Dublin.  Until then, the only form of Sunday trading we had among larger companies only took place in the lead-up to Christmas.</P>
      <P>The various churches pointed out, as they were entitled to do, their opposition to large scale multinational Sunday trading in the lead up to Christmas.  At that time they called on the Government to regulate the issue.  Unfortunately, the Government did not respond.  I appreciate the complexities that were, and still are, involved in this issue.  My understanding is that consultation &mdash; which seems to be very much the buzz word here today &mdash; started in 1993 or 1994 and has been ongoing since.  I do not intend to denigrate the use of the word; it is very important that we have consultation.  We still have not reached a stage where we have, in any shape or form, regulated Sunday trading other than the recent acceptance by the Government of the Bill drafted by my colleague, Deputy Kitt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to sound like I am attempting to score a political point when I say that Deputy Kitt's achievement should be recorded.  It is a source of pride to me that a colleague of mine, who has become something of an expert in the area of labour relations, drafted this legislation and brought it to the attention of the Government. It was obviously good enough to be accepted by the Government of the day.  Deputy Kitt should be complimented for his initiative. Deputy Kitt, in his contribution on this issue on Committee Stage, pointed out that this matter had been widely discussed within the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party.  He was correct in saying so; I was one of a number of members of the parliamentary party who were of the opinion that the Bill had not gone far enough and that the proposals contained in it, on which there appears to be consensus across the floor of the House, did not go far enough.  The people were never asked <Col N="464" /> whether there should be large scale Sunday trading.</P>
    <P>In June 1994 I was approached by Mr. Louis Copeland, a man who would be well known to people involved in the retail trade as he runs a number of outlets here in Dublin.  Mr. Copeland is also an officer of the Dublin Small Businesses Association.  He articulated a concern, which had been expressed to him and with which he was familiar from experience, about the impact which Marks and Spencer's decision to commence Sunday trading would have on family run businesses in Dublin and throughout the country.  Mr. Copeland and others were opposed to this idea.</P>
    <P>At that time, Marks and Spencer decided they would operate Sunday opening for a period of 20 weeks as a pilot scheme.  That decision signalled the opening of the floodgates.  This was the first example of a growing trend among the larger multiples to open for Sunday trading.  The point was made then, and is still relevant now, that all the smaller shops in an area where a large multiple opened for Sunday trading would have to follow suit.  There would be a perception that business would be lost if they did not do so.</P>
    <P>There is a growing trend in this country towards large out of town shopping centres where the anchor tenants are, in the main, UK multiples. If people shopping in these centres find that all the smaller traders are closed, it will obviously affect the business of smaller shops later in the week.  Smaller shops are forced into opening and because they are, in the main, family run businesses their entire Sunday has to be sacrificed to staff the shop.</P>
    <P>Statistics prove &mdash; the UK provides us with most of our statistical sources &mdash; that there is no real increase in the overall weekly income of those stores.  Why are they opening if they are not increasing their overall take?  I would suggest they are opening on Sundays in the hope that they will stifle and eventually kill off all the independent retailers, close down the family run retail sector and operate a monopoly in whatever market they decide to enter.  That, in my view, is the hidden agenda of multinationals such as Marks and Spencer, Debenhams, Boots, Dixons and all the other multiples which have arrived in Ireland in recent years.  They are seeking to shut down the corner shops and the family owned business and achieve a dominant position in the marketplace. It is at that point the consumer will start to feel the pain.  People may feel they are getting great value for money at the moment but once multiples achieve a dominant position in the retail market consumers should be wary.</P>
    <P>No Government will be in a position to do anything about this problem once the tiger of crass commercialism has been released.  I keep referring to Marks and Spencer as they are the people who initiated this phenomenon.  There was no planned Sunday opening until they arrived on the scene.  Subsequent UK multiples coming into this country operated in the same way.  Marks and Spencer's decision went against the trend in every <Col N="465" /> other European country, a fact which has been pointed out by other Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Sunday trading has been a source of controversy in the UK in recent years.  It is interesting to note that the decision by Marks and Spencer to open on Sunday came about as a result of legislation passed in the UK in 1994 which deregulated Sunday trading there.  The decision to open on a Sunday came from British based headquarters and did not take account of the cultural differences between Britain and Ireland in relation to Sunday trading.  Why should they care?</P>
    <P>Dunnes Stores had no option but to follow suit and they cannot be criticised on purely commercial grounds for doing so.  Dunnes Stores could not have been expected to stand in splendid isolation. However, their corporate decision not to open on Easter Sunday should be commended.  In spite of any other difficulties, real or imagined, which Dunnes Stores may have the public should acknowledge that their decision not to open on Easter Sunday was positive, pro-consumer and pro-Irish.</P>
    <P>We are seen to be good Europeans in our dealings with the EU at various levels and we have taken our lead from Europe in many areas over the past 25 years.  However, in spite of the fact that there is already existing legislation in practically all other member states in relation to this issue, we have failed to take the European initiative. We have not initiated legislation to outlaw, restrict or reduce Sunday trading.  Who asked the major multinational companies to open on Sunday on a regular basis?  Nobody did.</P>
    <P>If the truth were known, the vast majority of Irish people, even at this advanced stage of Sunday trading, would probably reject the option to have Sunday trading.  However, in proposing a referendum I am not prejudging its result.  I could be surprised.  It is possible, after three years of regular Sunday trading and the growth of out of town shopping centres, particularly in Dublin &mdash; in Blanchardstown, the Jervis Centre, the Square in Tallaght and the new Quarryvale centre &mdash; that we have developed a culture of Sunday shopping. Perhaps this culture is now the leisure pursuit that was traditionally followed in other areas, as Senator Farrelly said.  Perhaps this is how society has developed but, ultimately, the people should be asked their opinion in the absence of specific legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said this area is difficult because there cannot be separate legislation for big and small stores and one cannot stop corner shops opening if the multinationals are pursued. However, several suggestions were put forward today and in the debate in the other House.  Many options are open to the Government in framing legislation on Sunday trading.  For example, decisions could be made on the square footage of each retail sector or the opening hours.  All the multinationals open between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. on a Sunday but most people who avail of small <Col N="466" /> shops on a Sunday do so after Mass or Services. Alternatively, they go to the pub at midday and buy bacon, eggs, bread and tea on their way home.  Such shops could open between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m.  They could also open between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. when people, if they are short of something for the morning, tend to go to the local shop.  This does not give <i>carte blanche</i> to the multinationals.  They would not bother opening on a Sunday if the opening times were restricted to an hour in the morning and two hours in the evening.</P>
    <P>There are many options but none of them have been pursued.  This issue will not go away. Although I acknowledge the Government's good faith in accepting Deputy Kitt's initiative in the absence of its own, it does not go far enough.  I am nailing my colours to the mast on this matter by saying it should be put to the people and they should be allowed to decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  I do not intend to repeat Senator Mooney's comments but I fully concur with them.  The State is trying to create employment and other countries, such as the United States of America, have reduced the working week to 25 hours to create extra jobs in specific areas.  Has one extra job been created as a result of Sunday trading here?</P>
      <P>My objection to trading on a Sunday is that all religions consider it a day of rest.  It is a day of leisure when one can pursue sporting, cultural and other activities.  However, these are left aside now in favour of shopping in one of the major stores.  This appears to have become the Sunday outing.  I do not agree with it because it is to the detriment of our culture, heritage and sporting activities.  It does nothing for the well being of our people.</P>
      <P>Forty years ago my father worked six days a week but Sunday was a day of rest.  The working week was first reduced to five and a half days &mdash; people had a half day on a Saturday &mdash; and then to five days.  However, people now work seven days a week.  I disagree with that because it is wrong.  We are showing a bad example by allowing the major stores to operate to the detriment of small shops.  I have no problem with local shops opening after Mass on a Sunday to provide essentials.  If there is a difficulty in terms of who should trade on a Sunday, it could be confined to food stores which provide necessities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Mooney's argument.  Who asked the people if they wanted Sunday trading? This good amendment should be accepted because, if this is a democracy, we should not dictate to people.  They should be asked their opinion.  A referendum on this matter would be carried by a huge majority.  We are here to serve the people and it is wrong that the big stores are opening on a Sunday.  We should not copy everything Europe does.  There are new EU directives every day but European and Irish cultures are different.  Ireland has recognised Sunday to a much greater extent than our European partners <Col N="467" /> over the years.  Sunday was considered a day of rest when one could participate in sporting activities or family outings.</P>
    <P>If families are to be kept together we must respect the wishes of the people that the family comes first.  The purpose of Sunday is not to bring families into shopping centres to spend money which they probably cannot afford.  If people browse in shops, they generally buy something they do not need.  This often happens to me.  I go into a shop which has a sale and I end up buying something that I do not want.  If I passed the door I would have more money in my pocket.</P>
    <P>I oppose Sunday trading because it harms our culture and families.  Weekends should be days of rest.  Politicians get no rest at weekends.  I wonder how the Bill will apply to them.  I support the amendment and I hope the Minister of State will accept its sentiments.</P>

      <P>I do not understand what the amendment has to do with the Bill.  It states that section 14 shall not come into operation until the matter of Sunday work has been decided by the people in a referendum.  To what specific work does it relate?  I travelled through my town last Sunday when major work was being undertaken. People must work in the sugar factory between October and February because it cannot close down on a Saturday evening.</P>
      <P>Much necessary work must be done on a Sunday. Is the purpose of the amendment to ensure that a referendum is held to ban all Sunday work? I do not know who could draft such a constitutional amendment.  I have many observations on the Bill but putting such a measure into effect is not one of them.  Perhaps the position could be clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Senators Mooney and Fitzgerald are trying to effect by this amendment but I do not think it achieves that.  It is not possible to put down an amendment to a Bill calling for a referendum to stop big shops from opening on a Sunday, which is what the Senators want to achieve.  The Minister has tried at various times to see if there is any way of exempting small corner shops, garden centres and places suitable for a family outing on a Sunday from legislation which would have the effect of preventing large supermarket stores from opening. There is no easy way of achieving this and this amendment does not achieve it.  The effect of the amendment would be to prevent implementation of the positive elements of section 14, namely, the protection of workers who work on a Sunday and the provision of extra pay, etc., for them.  I fear the amendment would displace section 14, which would result in not having the desired protection.  Also, it would be difficult to find wording for the type of referendum proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share what the Senators wish to achieve by referendum.  I think the only way we can stop <Col N="468" /> large supermarket chains from opening on Sundays is by the power of cultural change or social pressure rather than legislation.  If people do not go to them they will not open.  The culture Senator Fitzgerald referred to, namely, going to matches and Mass on a Sunday and enjoying time with the family, is very much an Irish tradition.  It is also a northern European tradition in places like Germany.  However, I do not know how this can be addressed by legislation or referendum.  It is more likely to be done by some popular campaign to encourage people not to go to these shops on a Sunday and to enjoy the day with their family instead.</P>
    <P>While I support what the Senators are trying to achieve, I do not believe the amendment will achieve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, which has much merit.  Having listened to Senator O'Sullivan practically agreeing with it, the Minister should take cognisance of it and accept it. There are six days a week for trading and it is pure greed on behalf of the chain supermarkets that results in trading on Sundays.</P>
      <P>We had a wide ranging discussion among the 3,000 units of the Fianna Fáil organisation and 90 per cent of people expressed the opinion that Sunday trading was not acceptable.  Sunday is a day of recreation, a day for the family and for going to church.  When the Lord created the earth he clearly stated that Sunday was to be a free day for everybody to go to church and to be with the family.</P>
      <P>If we are to follow European trends then we should note that there are only two countries in Europe with Sunday trading.  We should be the last country in Europe advocating it.  I commend Senator Mooney for putting down this amendment and I know he will be calling for a vote on it so strongly do we feel.</P>
      <P>Multinationals are very welcome to Ireland and we appreciate their business and investment. However, under no circumstances do we appreciate the suggestion that they are going to interfere with or change our culture.  We have something precious that is envied by most other countries in the world.  Being Irish and acting Irish are the same thing.  As somebody deeply involved in business, I do not welcome Sunday trading under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister got a massive first preference vote in the last election.  In her area people and resident's associations are totally opposed to trading on a Sunday.  I do not see anybody clamouring for Sunday trading.  I do not know of anybody looking for it except the multinationals.  Are the multinationals going to be running Government and the affairs of our country as we see at the present time?  Will the Minister say who is looking for Sunday trading?</P>

      <P>The Government should legislate not to have Sunday trading.  The Senator is correct, we are talking about work.  I work six days a week and I know the Senator works six days a week.  However, Sunday has been a day when everything has been honoured in relation to our culture, history and heritage.  If we are going to follow EU trends then we should note that there are only two countries which have Sunday trading.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with what Senator Mooney is trying to achieve.  However, as Senators O'Sullivan and Howard have pointed out, the effect of the amendment would mean that people would not be entitled to a Sunday premium pending a referendum on the matter.  I am sure Senator Mooney would not like this to happen.  We want to see section 14 enacted quickly.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney asked if there was legislation on Sunday trading.  The 1938 shop sales hours of work legislation, introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government, concerns this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That legislation was not enacted a wet week before a legal challenge was made against it and it has remained suspended since 1938.  We took legal advice and there is no possibility of using that legislation.  The legal advice I received is that it is not possible, constitutionally speaking, to ban Sunday trading on the basis of square footage or different rules for large and small shops.  I think this is acknowledged in the amendment.  The Senator made an interesting suggestion on hours of opening which I think would be legally possible, but I do not know how popular it would be.  It would require a lot of consultation.</P>
      <P>We should consult people to find out how well section 14 prohibitions operate in practice, if they make Sunday work more expensive for shops.  We could also see if a voluntary agreement is possible &mdash; after public pressure, Dunnes Stores decided on a voluntary basis not to trade on Sundays, while Marks and Spencer has conducted an agreement with its unions and workforce on Sunday opening.  We should examine the voluntary possibilities and the operation of section 14.  For example, would the public accept different opening hours?  RGDATA might say it did not suit its members to adopt such hours as they make a lot of money selling milk, etc., on Sundays.</P>
      <P>Such consultation should take place before we consider holding a referendum.  There has been much agonising over various referenda in recent years but it is important to get the wording right, which is not a simple matter.  If it is decided to do this on a policy basis, one cannot do so without consultation, particularly where people's livelihoods are at stake.  If we do something and get it wrong there will undoubtedly be challenges because a lot of money is involved, not only for big businesses but corner shops also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the sabbatarian instincts expressed.  I am one of the few politicians who refuses to do <Col N="471" /> public duties on a Sunday because I feel if I do not have my day of rest I am unable to work the other six days of the week.  I also need time with my family.  I appreciate the case made for Sunday as a special day and I have legislated for it in a number of sections, such as section 14, which provides for a Sunday premium and the provision that the days of rest shall include a Sunday unless it is specifically written into the contract of employment that Sunday working is being made voluntary under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think I have gone as far as I can go legally in my sphere of influence, which is workers' rights. There may be other issues concerning trading which could be explored but we must operate within constitutional constraints.  The Office of the Attorney General does not approve a Bill unless every provision is in conformity with the Constitution and it is not open to us to legislate in a way which, we are legally advised, is constitutionally suspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister and my colleagues.  I realise that accepting the amendment would create difficulties with elements of section 14, but this debate has not yet finished and should continue.  To a large extent the Minister endorsed the reasons for putting down the amendment.  Will she consider a request, made by Deputy Kitt in the other House, that her Department would publish a White paper on Sunday trading and Sunday work, narrowly focused on the new phenomenon of multinationals locating in Ireland?  This document should look at the legal implications, the question of trading hours and the square footage of larger stores.  This would put the debate in the public domain and help us find out what is happening.</P>
      <P>MANDATE has led the charge on behalf of the workers but it is on the horns of a dilemma. On one hand, it is concerned with workers' rights, pay and conditions; on the other, its members do not want to work on Sundays and they would not do so if there were laws to that effect.</P>
      <P>RGDATA represents small &mdash; to medium-sized retailers; its members are mostly family owned businesses and if they trade on Sundays they do not use outside staff, in the main.  They realise that Sunday trading by multiple stores, especially in large urban areas, is having an adverse effect on the rest of the week's trading. People are doing their main grocery shopping on Sunday &mdash; the &ldquo;shop till you drop&rdquo; syndrome &mdash; and are going to local shops for small items only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The multinationals have a secret agenda.  Ultimately they want to end small &mdash; to medium-sized competition, so it suits their purpose to stay open on Sunday, no matter what cost is involved.  They will make as many agreements with their workers as they like because they have enough money to stay open.  This phenomenon first started in Britain.  In Europe large stores do not open on Sundays and in Germany they close at lunchtime on Saturday.  Why do the multinationals want to <Col N="472" /> stay open on Sundays if, as the statistics show, they are not making much money and their take for the week is not increasing?  There must be another agenda &mdash; to remove the competition.</P>
    <P>As to workers' rights, the Minister spoke about voluntary regulations, but these department stores will not regulate themselves and over 90 per cent of the retail sector would welcome the Government taking an initiative in this regard. Apart from the obvious extension of the working week in the period under discussion, which keeps a significant number of workers away from their home involuntarily, there are examples of alleged worker exploitation by a major Dublin department store.  The company insisted that all its parttime staff should report for work on St. Stephen's Day in 1994 in order to prepare stock for a sale beginning on the following day.  These workers were paid low wages but, given the unemployment figures, they had little choice but to comply with their employer's request, as a refusal would almost certainly result in their being let go.  Such cases are continuing in the undergrowth, while some shops are claiming it is wonderful that they have concluded agreements with their workers.</P>
    <P>Things may have moved slightly, but there is much to debate.  If the Minister gave serious consideration to a White Paper, her initiative would be welcomed by the various lobby groups mentioned and the public.  We could then nail the matter once and for all.  We cannot roll back what has happened in the last three years.  If, however, we can regulate it and the regulation is acceptable, that would be much better than the current <i>status quo.</i></P>

      <P>I find common ground with two points in Senator Mooney's contribution.  First, I encourage the Minister to look favourably on examining the circumstances surrounding the developments the Senator has outlined.  Second, I agree that there may be a hidden agenda, namely, the elimination of small operators after a certain period.  Those points are well worth examination. I do not ask the Minister to prepare a White Paper but she should look at the matter so that we could examine in due course the best method for implementing it.  One can do so without holding up this legislation and I therefore support Senator Mooney.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section covers matters in which I have a personal interest.  The section refers to &ldquo;a person engaged in sea fishing&rdquo;.  I suggest the Minister of State and her officials read the safety at sea review which was published recently.  I accept the section should remain as it is in that regard because it is also covered by subsection (4).  I want to choose my words very carefully: it is almost impossible for me to see how two boats could collide in the middle of the day without somebody being negligent.  Boats can be put on automatic pilot but, unfortunately, the automatic pilot does not warn about obstructions. Where the radar is working properly, it will bleep several times to indicate here is an obstruction. The only reason nobody would be on deck and the automatic pilot would be switched on is that the crew was tired because of the long hours they worked.  That should be looked at.</P>
      <P>The section also refers to &ldquo;other work at sea&rdquo;. Could lifeboat crews be specified in that subsection because they work very awkward hours? They often work for 24 or 36 hours on a mission of mercy.  I hope that subsection covers life saving activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third category is &ldquo;the activities of a doctor in training&rdquo; to which Senator Mooney referred. Why should there be any difference between a doctor in training and a fully qualified doctor?  I have heard complaints from trainee doctors about their long hours and low pay.  Why should <Col N="474" /> they be exempt from the provisions of this Bill? Fully fledged doctors need only work certain hours while doctors in training can be abused, to a certain extent, by having to work very long hours.  I am opposed to that part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also exempts a person &ldquo;who is employed by a relative&rdquo;.  Does that mean first, second or even sixth cousins?  Should that not be specified?</P>

      <P>I do not have time to go into it but this is a very weak section.  It is contradictory as far as sea fishing and the recommendations of the safety review are concerned.  It is ridiculous that young doctors have to work very long hours while qualified doctors do not.  Perhaps I am reading the Bill wrong.

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this at length in my reply on Second Stage.  Since the EU is drawing up a separate series of working time rules in relation to doctors so we have not included them in this Bill.  When those rules are made we can bring them in by regulation under section 3 (4). Subsection (6) defines exactly what is meant by &ldquo;relative&rdquo;.  It is not a loose definition but is very tied down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All work at sea is covered by the Health and Safety Act, 1989, and the regulations made under that Act in relation to safety.  There could be practical difficulties with the Senator's suggestion. For example, is one still at work when one is stuck on a boat at sea?  That is why they are excluded.  However, the safety regulations apply and we have made a particular effort in that regard which has paid off.  Nineteen ninety five was a very black year for deaths at sea but in 1996, after a major safety effort in conjunction <Col N="475" /> with the fishing industry, matters improved greatly.</P>

      <P>That goes back to the question raised by Senator Fitzgerald under section 3. The definition of &ldquo;family member&rdquo; is set out in section 3(6).  It includes lineal descendants, brothers and sisters and step versions of the same. For example, it could include one's grandfather's father, oneself, one's sons or daughter, grandfather, grandmother, brothers or sisters or step versions of them.</P>

      <P>The mechanism will permit 60 hour working weeks in the first year and 55 hour weeks in the following year, which will provide some relief in those years.  Has further consideration been given to a situation where shift work was a regular feature of a person's income over a number of years?  There are some industries, especially the dairy industry, where the implementation of the regulations would result in a substantial reduction in take home pay.  Are there are any exemptions for those involved?</P>

      <P>Existing law provides for a ceiling of 53 hours in the working week.  Those limits were set in the 1930s.  Reference has been made to the six day week being reduced to the five day week.  This provision seeks to bring down the maximum working week on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. Existing rules are in force until the Bill is passed. I do not see us endorsing people working a 70, 80 or 90 hour week.  There is a two year phase-in. Nobody should be forced to work excessive hours to earn a decent wage to support themselves and their families and employers should be able to organise their businesses accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Labour Force Survey definition, there are 180,000 out of work at a time when some people are working excessive hours of overtime. The 48 hour rule gives employers seasonal flexibility to organise their businesses.  They also have a two year lead-in.  What they organise after that in terms of compensation for loss of earnings is their business.  They would be expected to have <Col N="478" /> staff ready if they need to employ them.  Indeed, some employees may already be in breach of the 1930s legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1)  An employee may waive his statutory right to a 48 hour maximum working week by either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a written agreement with his employer, or</P>
      <P>(b)  pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement as approved by the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>(2)  An employee who refuses to give his or her consent to the waiver shall not be subjected to any detriment by his or her employer.</P>
      <P>(3)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where such a waiver has been agreed, an employer shall not permit an employee to work in each 7 days more than an average of 60 hours calculated over a period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>(4)  The employer shall take the necessary steps to ensure that health surveillance is made available to the employee in question within the meaning of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>(5)  An employee to whom this section applies may, at any stage, withdraw his or her consent by giving to his or her employer one month's notice in writing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister of State debated this amendment in the other House with my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, when the arguments were well aired.  The amendment is concerned with flexibility, the implementation of the 48 hour rule and the opt out clause.  Why is she opposed to an opt out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to get this into perspective. Some 94 per cent of Irish business carry on without asking their workers to work more than a 48 hour average working week.  The UK is the odd man out in Europe.  When this was agreed in Brussels, five of the countries signed a statement in the minutes that they would not accept an opt-out.  That opt-out was originally going to be for the UK on the basis that they might agree to the directive.  In the event they voted against the directive and took it to the <Col N="479" /> European Court, where they lost comprehensively. It was part of the ideological opposition of the outgoing Tory Government to social legislation and to the Social Charter.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about this, but there is a reason we have a ceiling on the working week, although we have built flexibility into it.  We do not want people to work excessive hours that would put their health or the health of their fellow workers at risk.  My responsibility, as Minister of State for Labour Affairs with reference to health and safety at work, is to oversee that situation and to see that people are not being unduly pushed in that regard.</P>
      <P>Second, if there is a voluntary opt-out, how voluntary is it?  This is particularly true of unorganised workers or where there may be one or two workers in a business.  If there is a threat that one may lose one's job, how voluntary is the situation? Undue pressure could be put on those people, and workers could be picked off one by one in bargaining.  That is contrary to our collective tradition and our way of doing business.  The interests of solid social partnership, which have served us well in establishing Ireland as the &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo;, will not make us suffer a competitive disadvantage but will still allow us to set ground rules for everybody in relation to maximum hours and good working conditions. Those are ground rules that good employers are comfortable with because they are complying with them already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little difficulty with what the Minister of State said and I am grateful that she has outlined her policy on this matter.  I sympathise with her views on the small business where there may be one or two employees who could be put under undue pressure.  I can envisage the scenario where an employee wants to leave, only to be told by the employer that he or she has to work.  If the worker points out that the law states he or she can work only 48 hours, the employer may point out that there is an opt-out and ask the employee to sign it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also said that the main point of her argument related to the health and safety elements.  I sympathise with this, because for too long we have relegated the health and safety element in work to a lower level on the agenda than was proper.  The Minister of State is to be commended for improving that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an earlier section of the Bill, however, there are exemptions for a group of State employees, such as gardaí and prison officers.  Presumably they are equally concerned about health and safety, and on Committee Stage in the Dáil Deputy Harney raised the question of prison officers' overtime earnings.  She described overtime earnings in the prison service as being quite substantial.  I was taken aback by the figures she mentioned.  Although it was not stated, I wondered if a lobby was operating to ensure that the gardaí and the prison officers were not affected <Col N="480" /> as a lot of money was being made on overtime due to security situations such as the BSE scare. Perhaps there were reasons of State security for their exemption, or perhaps it is not practical for those we trust to protect society to work 48 hours a week and no more.</P>
    <P>Because of this, there is a dichotomy between these State employees and the private sector. Yesterday the Minister of State and I were at the plenary session of the National Economic and Social Forum, where economic growth in the service sector was repeatedly mentioned.  That sector by its nature operates successfully in a flexible working environment.  It is comprised of entrepreneurial people who have a skill I sometimes wish I had: that of taking an idea and making money out of it.  We only hear of the success stories like Senator Quinn, and not the failures, but one has to admire them because of the environment in which they must work.</P>
    <P>They are also a significant part of the wealth generation of the economy.  I and others have doubts about the inflexibility of the Government's proposals in relation to the opt-out.  I can understand that it is probably easier to take a rigid view and state that 48 hours is the figure, within certain parameters.  That offers a lot of valuable protection and improves the health and safety environment.  However, taking the entrepreneurial view, I remain to be convinced that the implementation of this directive in such a rigid fashion is good business for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am also surprised at the Government's rigidity on the 48 hour rule when Europe gave an opt-out. Their interpretation was not as rigid and it is to be reviewed after seven years.  The Government intend to phase this in over two years, and we could have had a derogation if we wished.  The countries that signed this statement were, presumably, Germany, France and Luxembourg.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <P>These countries are having a lot of difficulty in solving their unemployment problems. Our unemployment problems tend to be different to the general European trend, as we have a significant young population entering the labour market on a yearly basis, while the demographics in Europe are totally different.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that Siemens was but one swallow in a bountiful summer for our inward investment programme, but I have doubts.  The Minister of State met members of the American Chamber of Commerce, who felt that we are creating an international perception that business here is overregulated.  Those in the service sector made it clear at the National Social and Economic Forum yesterday that small businesses are overwhelmed with bureaucracy.  That must be addressed by the Government, as it is the context of my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mooney's amendment.  A great deal of this has been debated already, the Minister of State has heard all the possible arguments and Senator Mooney has made many of the points I wished to raise. On the perception of Ireland as over-regulated, I was jolted by this when introduced to a table of businesspeople as being from Ireland.  I was made welcome by one individual who spoke of how great Ireland was.  He said Ireland was a great country with marvellous sporting facilities and places of interest.  As he continued, my head got bigger and I became more proud of this country. He then told them not to open a factory here.  He said he was on the board of a company which opened a factory here and he could get over the difficulty it faced in terms of regulations when the company decided to close one of its two factories. He said it was not only the regulations but the perception of regulations at all levels of society. He was talking about the Oireachtas, senior civil servants, the public and trade unions who believed that to protect jobs, they must regulate. He said he was on the board of a number of international organisations and he swore that he would fight against opening a factory here.  The Minister of State will understand why I battled and fought but did not win the argument.</P>
      <P>I told that story because Senator Mooney spoke about over-regulation and the perception of over-regulation.  There is no doubt that the Minister of State made a strong case for this Bill and health and safety are clearly identifiable reasons.  I am concerned that we are not giving individuals the opt out which we are giving to State employees.  For example, the State is making an exception in the case of prison officers which it is not extending to others.  That is the reason I support Senator Mooney's impassioned plea for future jobs, the economy and the wealth of our nation.</P>
      <P>If we are to achieve what we and the Minister of State have set out to accomplish, we must be aware that we are in a competitive market and that other nations have not enforced these regulations as strictly and as rigidly.  I am concerned that we are not giving the individual the freedom to opt out.  The Minister of State has listened to this case being by others much better than I but I urge her to take note of it and to consider the long-term competitive objectives of this nation and the economy and to consider the freedom of the individual to work hard, which we encourage young people to do.</P>
      <P>We are enforcing regulations which will not allow exceptions.  Exceptions will be made by the self-employed, so it will be impossible to enforce these regulations in relation to those who set up their own businesses.  Senator Mooney's amendment would cover the problems the Minister of State is trying to overcome and I urge her to accept it.  In doing so, she will have achieved what she set out to accomplish and will enable the economy to compete in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is deregulating legislation which replaces 137 pages of primarly legislation, registered agreements, orders and regulations and allows flexibility.  Senator Quinn will be pleased that he will no longer have to come to me if he changes the shift pattern of his workers. He will no longer need piece work placards on the wall and to hand piece work dockets to people in Irish and English on which one is legally forbidden to have a picture.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a major simplification of the law. We have built in a provision so that variations can be achieved from the minimum provisions in the Bill, which a good employer like Senator Quinn would well exceed in terms of the agreements he has negotiated with his workforce.  In most cases variations can be achieved from the set terms of the Bill through collective agreement with the workforce and appropriate compensatory rest.  It is a very flexible instrument and we should not buy the propaganda that the Bill is about regulation.  It may surprise Members that it is, to a large extent, about deregulation and that the procedures are fairly simple.</P>
      <P>If we were to run with the individual opt out and go with the terms of the directive on Article 18, there would be a great deal more paperwork involved in the policing of this because we would have to satisfy everybody that it was above board and that the terms of the directive had been met. Opting for the 48 hour rule is more simple than what we are talking about.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney asked which countries opted out.  Belgium, Spain, France, Italy and Luxembourg stated that they would not make use of the option provided for in this provision given that an agreement between an employer and a worker would be totally inadequate in a matter as important as that referred to in Article 6, the 48 hour week, which must be governed by stringent and uniform provisions.  The reason for the opt out was to try to get Britain's vote for the directive as a whole but it was unsuccessful in that regard.  It was originally devised as something which would apply to the UK only and the other countries in the EU have not subscribed to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn spoke about a man he met in the United States who thought this was a bad place to do business.  I understand his feelings in this regard and how he would stoutly defend Ireland as a good place to do business while maintaining his critical viewpoint.  I will not go into today's ESRI report but since the Bill was published, approximately 12,000 jobs have been announced in companies which, in the face of this legislation, have decided to invest.  I am sorry that businessman did not find this a good place to do business but he is in a minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read much economic literature on regulation and perhaps the most significant regulatory factor found in countries is universal minimum wage legislation which is in place in the United States but not in this country where it applies only in 20 per cent of particularly vulnerable employments.  We allow the market to determine <Col N="483" /> wage settings but that is not the case in the United States or in a number of continental countries.</P>
    <P>There is much propaganda about regulation. We should continue to simplify paperwork ranging from PAYE to PRSI forms and so on.  Our health and safety rules have been greatly simplified from the old prescriptive system to one which places responsibility on employers, in conjunction with the workforce, to have a health and safety statement appropriate to their business.  Those in the Department working in the small business area are looking at how they can make paperwork simpler for employers and how they can encourage business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the amendment and the sentiments expressed by Senator Quinn. It appears the Minister of State will not accept the amendment.  It is sad that she is introducing legislation which the EU and other countries want.  I would like to see legislation introduced which would satisfy our workers, our employers and our working conditions and not other countries and, as the Minister of State said, to entice the British to agree to this.  It might have nothing to do with the Bill, but we are dictated to in such a manner by the EU and it has such influence over us, that we introduce legislation to suit it.  I would rather we introduced legislation suitable to workers, to Senators Quinn's and Mooney's views and those of others rather than abiding by EU directives and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in general support of the thrust of what the Minister said.  My concern centres around the individual's choice in a free society, and that is what the amendment attempts to address.  What is so wrong with an employee having a written agreement with his or her employer?  The Minister made a virtue of the fact that other EU countries opted out and that it was primarily a political device to get the British on side.  The United Kingdom, our largest neighbour and one of our major trading partners, is the main beneficiary of inward investment in Europe by third countries, such as the United States and the Pacific Rim, especially the latter.  We do not have as many Japanese or Far Eastern companies operating in this country in proportion to the UK and part of the reason relates to flexible working conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My approach is not just bound up in the emotional ties I have to the Minister's lucid argument about why we should stick rigidly to a 48 hour limit, and I understand it precisely.  I support workers' rights and I can see how loopholes would allow exploitation and intimidation resulting in possible loss of employment.  I look at the situation in a global sense.  As Senator Quinn, a successful businessman working in a service industry, correctly put it, this amendment addressed the dilemma facing those of us who, on the one hand, want to go all the way with the <Col N="484" /> Minister on this, but on the other want to stop short of the granny state syndrome where the State decides what is good for the individual as distinct from the individual deciding within a specific framework what is best for them and their family.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I tabled the amendment, rather than just as a cursory exercise.  I will not withdraw it.  However, I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying a number of the points, apart from the fact she did not refer to my earlier question about exemptions, the various State employees and the overtime money they earn as well as other points raised, but I will not press her on those.</P>

      <P>I am aware that this is a new section added on Report Stage in the Dáil.  It increases fines under health and safety legislation from £1,000 to £1,500.  That the Minister acceded to a request for an increase suggests it is modest and I wonder whether it is the type of sanction she would be happy with.  Would she clarify briefly under what circumstances fines are imposed for breaches under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to District Court prosecutions and is something I inserted myself rather than in response to requests.  The maximum fine which can be imposed by the District Court is £1,500.  The Minister for Justice is examining an increase in the general limit from £1,500, but nothing has come of it as of yet as there is so much Justice legislation to be dealt with.  It is not open to us to exceed £1,500. However, there are no limits if someone takes a Circuit Court prosecution.  One of the most effective sanctions the Health and Safety Authority has is the injunction to stop work, a cease work notice, which has been used in the building area where there have been scaffolding accidents.  It allows work to be closed down on a building site until matters are put in order.  The lost production is a more effective sanction.  It is a question of prosecuting in the District Court or the Circuit Court, where there are no limits, and it depends on the seriousness of the offence concerned.  If an inspection finds no toe boards on scaffolding, a District Court prosecution may be proceeded with.  If a serious accident occurs, a more open-ended prosecution without limits on fines may be opted for.  If there are serious deficiencies on the site or premises, an order may be served to close it down until matters are put right.</P>

      <P>There has been a spate of construction industry accidents, especially in this city, as a result of a boom in the industry.  It is something Irish emigrants in the UK have lived with for a long time because of cowboy operators who do not adhere to the law.  Is the Minister suggesting there is a problem with this, or is she content the section now addresses any potential difficulty in this area &mdash; for example, the construction industry, where safety seems to be the main problem but not the only one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I launched a scaffolding safety programme devised in conjunction with the Construction Industry Federation, the building trade unions, the Health and Safety Authority and FÁS.  The carrot and stick approach &mdash; education and training of workers and spreading consciousness and putting the boot in with more inspections and closure notices &mdash; will suffice in the building trade where we are worried about the level of accidents, which in some cases have grown more than in proportion to the growth in business and work in the sector.  I felt it unacceptable to have a limit of only £1,000 when a limit of £1,500 could be imposed.  We should use the maximum fines as part of the armoury available, because health and safety are important.  It is appropriate we do it in this legislation, which is fundamentally a health and safety measure.</P>

      <P>The other area of concern is the food chain.  Do the regulations cover situations where employees may be exposed to health hazards as a result of contaminated food or because of environmental standards not being adhered to?  I am referring to recent studies which indicated that a lot of food, such as quiches and lasagne, sold for human consumption and available in an increasing number of small retail outlets, is possibly prone to unacceptably high levels of contamination.  There is a possibility of employees being contaminated from eating such food which they might have purchased in their work canteen.  Do these regulations cover this area of the food chain?</P>

I would be glad to brief the Senator some other time, perhaps under the Health and Safety at Work legislation.</P>

Perhaps there should be some feedback.  On occasions Bills which were introduced turned out to be in error and we had to start all over again, and that is not easy to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In congratulating the Minister and her team for the work that went into this, I also issue a word of advice.  If the Bills we have debated have not achieved the very worthy objectives set by the <Col N="487" /> Minister there should be a mechanism to allow us to look at it again in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister and her staff on this Bill.  It had a relatively quick passage through the Seanad compared to the Dáil.  As Senator Quinn said, there was no point in reiterating all the arguments made in the Dáil, so the Minister will appreciate that too much time was not spent going over previous arguments. Important consultations took place, not just in this House but outside the House, particularly with the social partners, IBEC and the Congress of Trade Unions, which enabled the Minister to strike the right balance.</P>
      <P>It is important that issues such as zero hours and so on be addressed because they could be subject to strike action.  These are difficult issues for many workers and I am glad they have been tackled.  I hope issues such as those concerning non-consultant hospital doctors and sea fishing, excluded in the EU and here, will be dealt with relatively soon.  Overall, I think it is a very good legislation and I welcome its passing.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on the constructive and searching contributions from the Opposition, which are always welcome.  Contributions here are always made from a genuine and constructive viewpoint.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to my criticism of section 3 and explain that my hearing is not great at times.  I apologise, as subsection (6) gives a clear explanation of matters.  The Minister made a great case for staff of this House, for Senators and Deputies.  A great deal of legislation has gone through this House today and we all endeavoured to contribute by way of constructive criticism.  It is not because the Minister introduced the legislation that we put forward different views.  The problem is that we are becoming tired and overworked. Unlike the Minister, we do not have staff to do research or go through the legislation in order to improve it.  I would say to the Minister, the leader of the Opposition and the Whips that Senators should have staff to enable them to make a better contribution to legislation which is debated in this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The questions asked by Senators were normal questions, and again my apologies for my misunderstanding.</P>

    <Title>Expansion of the Probation Service: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Justice to expand the probation service and encourage its potential particularly in view of the increased needs in the family courts and within the prisons, and to use the probation service to the utmost effect to keep young offenders out of prison.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a very difficult brief regarding the sanctions to be imposed on sentenced persons. There is great enthusiasm among the media, the general public and many politicians for increasing the number of prison spaces and conferring jail sentences on most of those convicted. The prison population has doubled since the early seventies but no one is suggesting that the crime rate has halved.</P>
      <P>I applaud the Minister's efforts to improve the conditions within our prisons and particularly the building programme on which she has embarked to provide more modern prisons rather than Victorian monuments.  I am delighted she signed the contract for the women's prison.  This is long overdue.  I remember the appalling interior of the women's prison previous to the one currently being used.  I also look forward to the Minister signing the contract to commence work on the Clondalkin site.  However, I urge her to look at a most neglected area &mdash; the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
      <P>The origins of probation go back to the latter part of the 19th century when police court missionaries, without official status, were appointed by some voluntary societies to help offenders who had been conditionally discharged by the courts under the terms of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, and the Probation of First Offenders Act, 1887, on their giving assurances to be of good behaviour and to appear for sentence if called upon.</P>
      <P>This informal system of supervision was given legal force by the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907.  That Act provided that probation could be imposed in the case of all offences punishable by a magistrates court and any offence punishable with imprisonment by a superior court.  The Act also empowered magistrates to appoint probation officers and required the courts to pay the officers so appointed.  This was extended in the seventies into the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Service's main emphasis is on turning offenders away from committing further offences through a system of intervention, including supervision, monitoring, counselling, treatment, training and therapeutic and education programmes.  Increasingly programmes are embodying an element of retribution to society, such as community service, as <Col N="489" /> well as challenging the offender to look at and change his or her behaviour.</P>
    <P>Given the choice, most offenders would wish the approval of society rather than its rejection. The work of the Probation and Welfare Service falls broadly into the following categories.  First, the preparation of pre-sanction reports for the courts; second, the supervision of offenders in the community, probation, intensive probation, community service orders, deferred supervision and temporary release; third, provision of welfare services to offenders in prisons and places of detention; fourth, the provision of services to a range of special projects such as hostels, workshops and special schools and, fifth, non-criminal work such as Family Law Court assessments and adoption reports.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the service is grossly understaffed and underfunded.  Despite the fact that the Law Reform Commission report on sentencing, published last year, recommended that the probation service should be the primary target for additional resources in the area of sentencing, the whole emphasis regarding sentencing appears to be custodial.</P>
    <P>Probation, particularly intensive probation, is not a soft option for offenders.  It is difficult and painful to change life patterns and the service has been informed by certain offenders that they would prefer to go to prison than partake in a particular programme of intensive probation.</P>
    <P>Probation is most suitable for people who have problems and who wish to bring about some change in their offending behaviour.  A person is usually placed on probation subsequent to a social inquiry report prepared for the courts.  In the light this report, probation officers make an assessment of the offender's willingness to change and, therefore, his or her suitability for probation. This is particularly important in the case of offenders involved with illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>While no research has been carried out, the Law Reform Commission has stated that, in the experience of officers working in the courts, the effectiveness of probation is shown by the fact that a significant number of those involved do not make further court appearances.</P>
    <P>The intensive probation scheme was established in the early nineties.  The majority of its referrals are from Circuit Court orders.  Others who avail of the service are prisoners on temporary release.  This is a problem as temporary release is often granted on an unstructured basis. There may be no probation officer available to undertake work immediately a prisoner is released.  However, this scheme tries to concentrate on serious, persistent offenders.</P>
    <P>Phase one of the scheme involves a detailed assessment period and phase two is a four month, group work programme.  While on the programme, participants are encouraged to explore, identify and change their patterns of offending behaviour.  They are also encouraged to accept responsibility for their behaviour and thereby begin to exercise more control over their lives so <Col N="490" /> that they also consider the consequences of their offending on the victims of crime.  Participants get an opportunity to deal with their personal problems, undertake work training courses and to follow through on job opportunities.  While the main focus of the programme is to challenge offenders to look at their offending behaviour, it also provides a broad rehabilitative and social education programme.  It is most intensive and requires many man hours.</P>
    <P>The scheme operates in Dublin and Cork only and it should be expanded.  If, as it appears, intensive probation provides an effective means of encouraging offenders to desist from offending, the necessary resources should be allocated to it, at least an amount equal to the estimated savings from not having to keep offenders in custody. The estimated cost of keeping somebody in custody is £45,000 per year.  When one thinks of the difference between that and having somebody on an intensive probation order, the expense is enormous. The scheme combines rehabilitation with the incapacitation provided by the intensity of the supervision.  Whereas rehabilitation or incapacitation do not constitute satisfactory objects of sentencing in isolation, the combination works well.  The Law Reform Commission is satisfied that even the most rudimentary cost-benefit analysis would indicate that the probation service &ldquo;should be a primary target for additional resources in the area of sentencing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The hard, cynical &ldquo;professional&rdquo; criminal is not the most common customer before the courts.  On 17 April 1997, a graph in <i>The Irish Times</i> compared the prison populations in this jurisdiction with those in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Nearly 28 per cent of our prison population is less than 21 years of age while in Northern Ireland it is 19 per cent and only 12 per cent in Scotland. This is despite the fact that the rate of imprisonment in the Republic is significantly lower than in either Northern Ireland or Scotland.  In the Republic the rate of imprisonment is 58 per 100,000 inhabitants, in Scotland it is 109 and in Northern Ireland it is 117.  This situation should be addressed urgently and is an important reason for expanding and better financing the probation service.  Many young people in prison have already been through the probation service but, without being unkind, what kind of service was it?  The resources of the probation service at present are such that the service is unable to undertake its tasks.</P>
    <P>The management of offenders plan, launched by the previous Minister for Justice in 1994, highlights the problem of lack of aftercare for offenders.  It states:</P>
    <P>One of the greatest difficulties facing offenders, and especially those who have served long prison sentences, is that of coping in the community when released from custody. Very often they have no option but to return to the social scene which contributed to their wrong doing in the first place with very little prospect of gaining employment.  Many may <Col N="491" /> also be facing debts and other pressures unavoidably brought about by dependants during their absence.  Although the prison system has no &ldquo;hold&rdquo; on an offender, once released, and no authority to direct his or her behaviour in any way, there is no doubt but that a proportion of offenders would welcome the guidance and assistance of the Probation and Welfare Service in helping them to resettle in the community.  The Department considers that formalised aftercare arrangements for offenders should therefore be put in place.</P>
    <P>Successive recommendations of the Department of Justice seek a better probation service.</P>
    <P>The victims of crime, when asked their opinion, frequently stress they do not seek retribution but that an offender should reform and not behave in such an anti-social way again.  Victim impact statements are being given more weight by the courts and their views on the probation service should be sought by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The Garda juvenile liaison scheme has been a great success.  Nearly 90 per cent of those involved do not reoffend before they are 18 years of age.  The Minister has decided to put the scheme on a statutory basis.  A properly resourced Probation and Welfare Service could do just as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and Senator Henry's impassioned plea for consideration of the Probation and Welfare Service.  Her words must strike all Members because they give the Minister an important option.  With limited funds the Minister must aim to overcome the crime problem in the best possible manner and the Probation and Welfare Service offers the best hope of achieving that.  Senator Henry has made the case that the underfunding of that service means an opportunity to achieve a higher level of success in this area is being lost.</P>
      <P>The Minister can use technology to help the Probation and Welfare Service.  If we are to aim at success in this area, we must look at the best means of achieving it.  A win, win situation is possible if money is invested in preventing future crimes rather than just being used to protect society and for retribution and punishment.  The Minister has put a great deal of effort into preventing crime.  However, probation can provide a win, win solution.  Senator Henry spoke about training and education.  If it is possible to find the best way to train and educate a person who is on probation, that individual can achieve success and confidence.  If somebody is able to achieve success rather than always being put down, they begin to blossom and believe in themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to one development in technology which might help the Minister &mdash; electronic tagging.  It is a development we discussed previously and it has been most successful in the United States.  Electronic tagging could free many prison places.  Our prisons are grossly overcrowded <Col N="492" /> which renders them inhumane and a breeding ground for future crime.  However, many prisoners could safely be released if we could devise a suitable means of monitoring their movements.  That means, electronic tagging, now exists and has proven successful in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>By using electronic tagging, a released prisoner and his or her probation officer can stay in contact. The tagging is a significant restriction of the released prisoner's freedom and fulfils the needs of the penal system.  However, it does not involve the expense and the other huge disadvantages which result from incarceration in unsuitable circumstances. A great deal has been written about electronic tagging, and the Department of Justice and Garda headquarters must have a great deal of information about it.  We discussed it a couple of years ago with regard to bail, but it was regarded as unsuitable for use in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>However, electronic tagging is suitable for use within the Probation and Welfare Service.  It would mean that somebody who is released on probation can remain in their own home.  The person can be tagged to travel only to where they work and they can be tagged for the day, time and area to which they may travel.  They can, for example, go to church on Sunday and to work on weekdays.  They are restricted in a manner which is in their own hands.  They can stay at home and enjoy the protection of the family environment, which will perhaps lead them away from bad company.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to conduct an urgent examination of the possibilities created by this modern technology.  It is time we brought our penal institutions into the 21st century.  I understand the information is available in the Department of Justice and Garda headquarters and that as every month goes by this technology is improved in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore Senator Henry's emphasis on the need for probation and welfare.  Sending someone who is not a first time criminal but is on the road to criminality to jail will push them further.  Some prisons have a bigger drug problem than others.  I am not sure why.  The availability of drugs in Mountjoy Prison is a huge problem compared to that in Cork Prison.  There should be an examination of how drugs get in, what causes it and whose responsibility it is.</P>
    <P>We are trying to highlight Senator Henry's concerns about our inability to use the best means available to solve the problems of criminality in the future.  More emphasis should be placed on keeping people out of prison and away from the dangers it presents &mdash; particularly Mountjoy as compared to Cork.  I am sure there are reasons for this which deserve attention and critical analysis.</P>
    <P>I second Senator Henry's urgent plea and her impassioned words in trying to draw attention to the benefits to be gained from probation and welfare rather than incarceration.</P>
    <Col N="493" />
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion and congratulate Senator Henry for tabling it.  I am aware of the Senator's concern about this issue, which we have discussed in the past, and her caring approach to prisons, prison officers, prisoners and offenders.  I congratulate the probation service for the work it has done, often with limited resources. It has maximised its work with the resources available to it.  There was an increase of ten probation officers and 12 staff in all in the Minister's crime plan.  This is an important start, but is not a completion of what is required to ensure the probation service provides a full and professional service to its clients.</P>
      <P>The probation service is involved in many areas.  We often concentrate on the work it does for early offenders or those who receive probation. However, it is also involved in background work in the criminal courts where it produces many reports on those who commit crime.  In recent years the number of reports produced has been around 6,000 annually.  This is quite a volume of work which the probation service carries out to inform the courts of the background of offenders to ensure they take all aspects of the offender's position into account. This is an important service as it ensures that justice is fully done.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we query the inadequacy of sentencing and in certain cases we are correct. However, we must always temper our views on the basis that the probation service has completed its report to the court.  Sometimes we may be too quick on the draw in airing our views without full knowledge of what the service has informed the court.</P>
      <P>The service has acquired many professional skills in dealing with the delicate area of family law in recent years.  As my party's spokesperson on law reform, I have been involved with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform in bringing many Bills through this House.  I am aware of how sensitive an area this is and how important is the work the service in ensuring the sensitivities of the offenders, especially younger offenders, and that the difficulties experienced by their families are fully and professionally examined.  The service assists in every way to ensure that justice and the best result for the family and children is achieved.</P>
      <P>We have fallen down in the rehabilitation of prisoners.  Recidivism is over 80 per cent, which is an indictment of our prison system.  This Minister or the previous Minister are not to blame because this is a major problem which should have been dealt with over the years.  All western countries fail in this area, but we should not give up on it.  The rehabilitation of prisoners must be a key issue in our prison service and we must place more emphasis on it.  The Minister is making more prison spaces available but a further programme should be implemented once this is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Space should be allowed for proper activities in prison which give prisoners the maximum <Col N="494" /> opportunity to be rehabilitated, obtain education and develop skills.  I know prisons have different levels of training and education.  There is a high level of training opportunities in Limerick Prison, while in places like Mountjoy there is a lower level of such opportunities because of overcrowding. This is a key area in which the probation service must become more involved.  It is doing the job as well as it can under present circumstances. Prison should be a place of confinement and punishment, but it should also be a place of rehabilitation.  It is vital that young people do not enter universities of crime but universities of hope where they have an opportunity to secure their future and contribute positively to society rather than coming out of prison and destroying the quality of life of their fellow man.</P>
    <P>The State and the Government must play a key role in ensuring our prison service is put on a proper basis by providing spaces.  However, there should be confinement for those who commit serious crime.  They should serve their sentences fully and receive every opportunity for rehabilitation in order to contribute positively to society.</P>
    <P>The work done by the probation service in liaising with young offenders and their families is of vital importance.  It is vitally important that young offenders in special schools return to families who are aware of their problem and who are sensitive and trained to handle their return.  This is necessary to ensure that the offender will have a positive rather than a negative outlook.  I agree with Senator Henry that we must endeavour to reduce our reliance on prison as a form of sanction. Prisons should be there for those who commit serious offences but we should continue to expand the use of community service as a sanction. The Probation and Welfare Service must seek to ensure that community service is a proper sanction in the first instance which is properly managed and that people are trained to be good citizens through participating in the service.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill which is before the other House at the moment will involve the probation service in much more work.  I commend the Minister for extending the service over the past year and a half.  We support Senator Henry's view that this service be developed for the reasons which I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Independent Senators for bringing this motion before us this evening.  We are all aware of the tremendous pressure on our courts and prison system.  In calling on the Minister to expand the probation service because of the increased needs in the Family Courts and within prisons this motion has a very laudable aim, namely, to keep young offenders out of prison.  This is particularly important in the case of young drug offenders.  In some areas of Dublin, and indeed in some of our other cities, over 70 per cent of the probation and welfare officers' workload relates to offenders with significant drug misuse problems.  The scourge of drugs in our society is horrendous.  It is frightening <Col N="495" /> and sickening that so many of our young people are regular drug abusers.  This is not caused merely by peer pressure but also by pressure generated by pop culture and by crazy election candidates in some parts of the country who encourage young people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Candidates such as Senator Mulcahy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to experiment with drugs.  I was thinking of a candidate in the west of Ireland. Many drug abusers slide into a life of petty crime and proceed to more serious crime.  Many are convicted of offences such as robbery, burglary, larceny, mugging, handbag snatching and so on as a means of obtaining the money needed to support their habits.  I recently met an 18 year old girl who was using £200 worth of heroin a day. When I asked her where she got the money to support her habit, she told me that there was nothing she would not do, except kill, to get it.</P>
      <P>Every passing year sees an increase in the difficulties encountered by those who are addicted to drugs.  There is a concomitant increase in the burden of work placed on probation and welfare officers.  That is one very good reason to expand the service, although in a way it seems to be the wrong reason.  We respond to an increase in crime levels with an expanded Probation and Welfare Service.  Surely, we should be looking at prevention rather than cure.  I am aware that the service emphasises the importance of a community approach to tackling offending behaviour.  I am also aware that the service has played a significant role in encouraging local responses to addressing crime.  This approach must be encouraged, particularly in the poorer areas of our cities where young people do not get the breaks and in areas of high unemployment.  High unemployment levels and consequent social exclusion results in young people not being given a fair chance.  Community involvement is needed at a basic level if we are to deal with the social problems associated with criminality.  The Probation and Welfare Service addresses many of these social problems but there is a limit to what it can do, given the limited resources available to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service, as we are aware, is essentially concerned with victims.  I remind the Minister that there are victims all over the country and not just in one or two of our largest conurbations.  Community service orders should be increased; by doing community work young offenders can pay their debt to society in a meaningful way.  Incarceration usually produces hardened criminals; young offenders develop bad habits and learn more about crime.  Community work helps both the community and the offender.  It is a much better alternative to imprisonment, which is essentially a dehumanising experience.  Nobody should be imprisoned unless they pose an actual threat to themselves or to the community at large.  Bad behaviour is reinforced and, as any good psychologist <Col N="496" /> will tell you, reinforced behaviour will continue and inevitably increase or recur.  However, if bad behaviour is ignored and good behaviour &mdash; such as community based work &mdash; is reinforced, good behaviour will result.  Community service gives the offender a chance to prove himself.  Not all will succeed, but many will. Some return to bad home situations in poor areas, but it does not fall to the present Minister for Justice to solve all of these problems.  There are other Ministries such as Health, Education and Employment which also have a responsibility in this area.  I believe the Minister for Justice can make a significant contribution to this problem by agreeing to this motion and by seeking to enhance the Probation and Welfare Service.  By doing so, she could make a significant contribution to helping young offenders in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that by outlining the experience of the Probation and Welfare Service for Senators we might have a more helpful debate.  I thank Senator Henry and the other Independent Senators who signed the motion and I also thank the Senators who have already contributed to the debate.  I have no difficulty whatsoever with the motion.  This debate gives us an opportunity to highlight the work of the Probation and Welfare Service in the wider criminal justice system.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the Probation and Welfare Service is the unsung hero of the Department of Justice.  We do not dwell often enough on the work it does, nor do we give sufficient recognition to its success.  247 people are employed in the Probation and Welfare Service; 181 of these are professional staff and 66 are clerical staff.  Senators will recognise the huge value we get from the professionalism of the Probation and Welfare Service and the huge economic value we get from what each individual officer can achieve in preventing the heavy costs associated with imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The Probation and Welfare Service provides a service to the courts, the prisons, places of detention and special schools.  It operates and supervises the community service scheme and provides alternatives to custody by way of workshops, day centres and hostels for young persons in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that one of the principal tasks of the service is to assist the courts by providing, at their request, detailed background reports on persons appearing before them.  These reports can relate to criminal or civil matters.  In recent years the service has had to respond to increased demand for court reports, in particular from the higher courts.  In excess of 6,000 reports were requested by courts in 1996.  The success in reducing the delays in the courts by increasing the number of judges and staff has also had the effect of increasing the demand for reports from the Probation and Welfare Service and prison places. The upside of improving the courts services is <Col N="497" /> that delays have been reduced, but the other services must catch up with those benefits.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, because of the demand in the area of criminal law, the service is not as yet in a position to provide a service to the Family Law Courts.  The staff of the service are well qualified to carry out this important family law work and have provided a valuable service to the Family Law Courts in the past.  This facility was provided at that time on a non-statutory basis and at the request of these courts.</P>
    <P>The role of the Probation and Welfare Service in relation to providing court reports in family law cases was, however, put on a statutory footing in August 1996 under the Family Law Act, 1995. A further statutory requirement was placed on the service by the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  Again, the service has been unable to meet its obligations under the Act because of the pressure of existing work.  The management of the Probation and Welfare Service is willing to carry out this important family work as soon as staffing resources permit.  My Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Finance about the provision of additional staffing for the service, particularly for the civil law cases where the demands of the courts cannot be met at present.</P>
    <P>I must recognise that the Probation and Welfare Service is subject to Government restrictions on public sector numbers and requests for additional staffing will have to be considered in the light of this role.  I have made a strong case to the Government that the advantage of increasing the resources of the Probation and Welfare Service is huge savings in other areas.  I recognise that the growth of the public service is a matter of great concern with regard to the pay bill, but I secured approval last year in the crime package for ten additional Probation and Welfare Service officers.  Three of these officers have been hired and the remaining seven are currently being selected by the Civil Service Commission.  The interviews have been completed and the panel has been established.  The final stage of their appointment is taking place.  There are a number of vacancies in the service and it should be possible to fill them from the panel.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the service provides a welfare service to prisons and places of detention. Approximately 17.5 per cent of the staff of the service is assigned to this work.  While prisoner welfare matters, including assisting in making suitable resettlement plans on their release, is a major feature of the service's work in this area, it also plays a major role in the various regimes that operate for those in custody.  The service is currently actively involved in the delivery of a special sex offender treatment programme at Arbour Hill as well as in inter-agency programmes for drug users in Mountjoy Prison.  Additional staff to meet the demands of additional work arising from the establishment of the two new prisons at the Curragh and Castlerea will, I assure the <Col N="498" /> House, be considered in the context of the staffing requirements which my Department has indicated to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The service plays a pivotal role in the special schools which operate under the Department of Education by providing a direct liaison role between the young offender and his or her home while the offender is detained in these special schools.  Since becoming Minister for Justice I have become more aware of the importance of the Probation and Welfare Service and how its role could be expanded through the development of more community based sanctions and measures.  In this area the principal objective of the service is to reduce reoffending and to provide the use and recognition of community based sanctions.  The main sanctions at present are probation orders and community service orders, which have both proved particularly effective.</P>
    <P>Since the community service order scheme was set up under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, the number of court orders has risen from under 800 in 1985 to over 1,600 per annum in recent years.  The community service order is a sanction which the courts may use as a direct alternative to imprisonment and was so framed to attempt to restrict the numbers being committed to prison.  A number of Senators mentioned the need to restrict the number of committals by using alternatives.  Offenders, who must be over 16 years in order to comply with international labour guidelines, carry out a range of work which could not otherwise be done, for example, painting community halls, doing work in centres for the elderly and toy making for the benefit of sick and disadvantaged children.  This allows the offender to repay his or her debt to society by carrying out a useful service.</P>
    <P>Apart from the obvious benefits to the community, the community service order scheme is also cost effective, with a cost per offender per week of just over £36 as opposed to almost £900 to keep an offender in custody.  I am satisfied that the existing scheme works well and that the majority of offenders complete their orders. Offenders can be required to work for between 40 to 240 hours and must complete the task over a 12 month period.  I am carefully monitoring this scheme and if it emerges that the scheme could usefully be extended or amended in some way I will do so.  There is scope for an extension of the scheme to make it more usable by the courts.</P>
    <P>However, a community service order cannot be handed down by the court unless the person who is being sentenced agrees to undertake community service instead of a custodial sentence.  It is a voluntary method of sentencing and people cannot be forced to take community service.  I have asked the Probation and Welfare Service to ensure that the maximum use is made of the scheme by advising the Judiciary of its benefits.  I understand that information seminars on the benefits of the scheme have been recently held for judges.  This is most important because a judge ultimately decides in his or her wisdom whether <Col N="499" /> a young offender should be given a chance to stay out of prison by doing community service.</P>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Service is directly and indirectly involved in the provision of workshops, day centres and hostels for young people in the community.  These projects are funded by the Probation and Welfare subheads of my Department's Prisons Vote.  The amount paid by my Department to these projects in 1996 was almost £3 million.  Among the aims of the projects is the reduction of recidivism and the training of young people in a number of skills.  One such project is the intensive probation supervision project, known as the Bridge Project in Dublin and INPRO in Cork.  These projects cater for about 150 serious offenders who may be referred directly to the projects by the courts.  The projects allow young offenders to address their offending behaviour and, at the same time, learn valuable skills, for example, photography, cookery and computer skills which help prepare them for employment.</P>
    <P>The projects are managed by independent management committees which are made up of members of the Judiciary, the Garda, the Probation and Welfare Service and members of the business community.  I particularly welcome the involvement of the business community.  I opened the Bridge Project recently and I met members of the business community, including representatives of banks and other firms in the city.  They are gaining a great deal from their involvement in the projects, and not just through providing expertise.  They are learning about their city and the type of people who need help.  They in turn pass on that message to other businesses not only in terms of assisting the projects but in the context of being more open to employing young people after they have completed the projects. On the opening night all the food was prepared by young offenders who are learning cookery skills.  Others, who were looking after coats, were learning social skills attached to dealing with members of the public.  It is an extremely valuable project in the inner city.</P>
    <P>The projects have been successful in establishing links with employers who are willing to offer employment to offenders and, therefore, offer them a real chance of a life free of crime.  It is fine to undergo training but if they meet brick walls when it is finished, they are more likely to be seduced back into a life of crime.  If they do not have jobs when they complete the project, they get involved in a cycle of more crime and further dealings with the Probation and Welfare Service until perhaps they commit a serious crime and end up receiving life sentences.</P>
    <P>It is generally known that most offenders come from areas of high unemployment and social disadvantage. These people are often further marginalised and excluded from employment because they have a criminal record.  It is difficult enough trying to get a job if one has a certain address <Col N="500" /> but it is much tougher if one also has a criminal record.</P>
    <P>Another successful project undertaken by the Probation and Welfare Service is the Tower Programme, which is also known as the North Clondalkin Probation Project.  In 1996 I approved construction of a new premises for this project in north Clondalkin at a cost of £700,000.  The project will cater for up to 36 young offenders where they will learn a range of skills which will prepare them for employment.  The new premises is due to be completed in early summer.  This is a small price to pay for 36 offenders and significantly cheaper than providing prison places for them.</P>
    <P>The service also works in tandem with a number of voluntary groups which provide facilities or services for offenders &mdash; for example, the Merchant's Quay project for drug misusers in Dublin and the Aiséiri treatment centre in Cahir.  In all the service is involved in over 30 projects.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the great need for more probation facilities based in local communities and I regret that lack of provision of such facilities is often not due solely to a lack of resources but to difficulties with local communities accepting such facilities in their areas.  The Probation and Welfare Service has gone a long way towards reassuring local communities that their fears are mainly unfounded.  I take this opportunity to appeal to public representatives who are aware that a service like this is proposed for a particular area to assist in getting over the fears people may have about such a service and to get message across that without such services they may have more reason to fear.  The Probation and Welfare Service is sensitive to the location of these services but they have to be provided in areas adequate for and available and accessible to the people who will use them.  There is no point in putting them in an isolated place with no bus service or facilities for training.  Of necessity, therefore, they will be based in built-up areas and we have to get the support of the community for them.  They are extremely well run with few complaints.  The service has established good relations with communities in a number of areas and I assure the House that all locally based facilities are well managed and supervised.</P>
    <P>I fully support the view that custodial sentences, particularly for young offenders, should only be used as a last resort.  The Children's Bill, 1996, which has now completed Second Stage in the other House, allows the courts a number of community sanctions.  These sanctions include powers to impose a day centre order on a child offender.  A day centre is a place a child offender will have to attend for up to 90 hours in a six month period and be involved in activities or be given an appropriate occupation while under the supervision of a probation and welfare officer. Activities can also take place outside the day centre.</P>
    <P>Day centres can be operated by the Probation and Welfare Service or any other body with the assistance of the probation service.  The Bill also <Col N="501" /> provides for various types of probation orders &mdash; for example, &ldquo;a training or activities programme order&rdquo; as an intensive supervision order.  This legislation when enacted will give the Probation and Welfare Service a greater role in the criminal justice system and will bring about an increased use of community sanctions and measures.</P>
    <P>One alternative to custody which I have asked my Department to examine is electronic monitoring, an issue raised by Senator Quinn.  I have had reports from pilot schemes in Sweden and the UK analysed and I am awaiting further reports.  When these are to hand I will consider whether or not there is scope for its introduction in this jurisdiction and whether the probation service would have any role in its implementation if it were introduced.  The service is well stretched by what it is doing at present and I do not want to add further responsibilities until I am sure I can get the necessary staffing.  The danger is of embarking upon something which is not done as well as it could be and therefore considered not to be working.  If we introduce electronic tagging it must be allowed work through provision of the necessary back-up services.  There is no point in putting a tag on somebody and allowing them wander where they want.  The tag has to be monitored. Some Members will be aware of how tags work.  It is necessary to have a telephone in the house where the person is living in order to monitor them correctly.  It is not a case of clipping the tag onto the person's arm or ankle.  Back-up services are necessary.</P>
    <P>It is becoming increasingly clear to many people that prison is not always the most appropriate sanction; and while there will always be offenders for whom custodial sanctions are essential, there are many for whom community sanctions are at least as effective.  As well as this, as I mentioned earlier in the case of community service, community sanctions are much less expensive. There have been a number of calls for greater use of community sanctions and the expansion of the role of the Probation and Welfare Service over the years.  In 1985 the Whitaker report recommended the strengthening of probation service resources.  As Senator Henry mentioned, in recent years my Department's policy document, <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan,</i> published in 1994, referred to expanding the service's role in relation to the supervision of offenders on early release and the provision of a formalised aftercare service for offenders on release from custody.  In the Government's anti-crime package which was approved last year I was pleased to secure ten additional probation staff posts plus two clerical posts for the service to assist in the supervision of up to 100 offenders on early release.</P>
    <P>It is now generally accepted among those in the penal field that probation and other community sanctions and measures can be an effective alternative to custody and there is plenty of scope for further developments in this field.  I accept that the Probation and Welfare Service is at present <Col N="502" /> overburdened and the development of new measures is often hindered by lack of resources.  I strongly endorse the view that the Probation and Welfare Service should be expanded and I accept that there is a need for additional resources.  I strongly urge that additional resources be targeted to the Probation and Welfare Service in the future to enable it expand its role in the criminal justice system in an effective manner.  I have pressed and will continue to press for additional resources for the service.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Justice there was so much to be done that I had to prioritise much of the work.  Clearly, one of the major gaps in the system was the provision of prison places for people sentenced for serious crimes.  However, that does not mean that I ignored or neglected other elements in my Department.  We are working towards expanding the service with the additional ten staff.  I will ensure, and I hope future Ministers will ensure, that the Probation and Welfare Service is properly resourced.</P>
    <P>I know Members will join with me in complimenting the service for what they do with a small number of professional staff.  We do not often get a chance to praise the service and we should take this opportunity to commend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  She is doing her utmost to sort out the problem.  It is discouraging that the more she and previous Ministers have done, the worse the problem seems to become.  A previous Government introduced free education and it was said that it would result in everybody being educated and an end to many problems.  However, the more we do, the more problems we seem to have. I accept that our biggest problems today are drugs and drug related.  I do not know what the answer to the problem is.  The probation service is part of the answer.  It is one way of getting people to realise that they should not be doing what they are.  However, I sometimes think we should be addressing the problem from a younger age.  Children of five and six in this city are setting out on the road to criminality.  The Garda knows this.  By the ages of 14 or 15 they are almost beyond redemption.</P>
      <P>Many things done in this country over the years were undertaken on the advice of professionals who examined everything from an economic point of view.  However, what seems cheapest at the time may not be the cheapest in the long run. The closure of small schools in towns, cities and rural areas and the opening of big schools, resulting in an impersonal atmosphere, accounts for some of the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all the laws, I see children as young as five or six years on the streets at 11 and 12 o'clock at night.  Why are these children not being supervised?  This is where the problem starts.  Prison is no place for children and it makes no sense to send them there because, as a previous speaker said, it is a university where they graduate to further crime.  When <Col N="503" /> they meet other prisoners that is all they talk about.  Community service should be extended to take youngsters who commit offences out of the criminal environment for a period.</P>
    <P>The parents of most of these children are not playing their proper role, because they are disadvantaged themselves.  By and large, we imitate the home environment where we grew up &mdash; what we learn when we are young stays with us all our lives.  If children see only crime, what can we expect them to do?  If we are to improve matters, we must take children out of that environment, hard as that may seem, and place them elsewhere until they reach an age when they will realise their home is not the best place for them.</P>
    <P>We are not providing sufficiently for special schools.  Our best schools were the technical schools where young people were able to learn trades, but we got rid of them and set up community colleges.  While that education is good for the vast majority, children who were good with their hands were better off in small technical schools and we should bring them back.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the media is inclined to make celebrities out of young criminals.  Recently a chat show allowed a 14 year old to explain how he could break into any car in less than 20 seconds, hot-wire it and drive away.  That was wrong because it encourages other youngsters to do likewise. Those who produce programmes may think that is good but I do not agree &mdash; it gives young criminals an opportunity to flaunt the wrong sort of knowledge.  Many young people involved in crime may not be educated in the modern sense of the word but they are highly intelligent.  I worked in the motor trade for many years but I would not be able to hot-wire a car in an hour.  It was easier to hot-wire old cars, which had coils and a distributor cap, but much harder to hot-wire cars with electronic ignition.  Children who can break into cars at that young age have brains to burn and we should put them into schools so they can use that ability to gain work.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we can keep young people on projects for £36 per week as against a cost of £900 per week per prison place.  Those schemes are the answer and we should have more of them. We do not know the success rate of those projects as yet but it must be quite good.  Our probation service should do more work in that area.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we will solve the drug problem. If young people are off the streets and taking part in those projects or community work, they would not have the time for drugs.  Community work should not be voluntary.  People should have to work at least five days a week and start at 8 a.m.  I have said many times in this House that the money we put into social welfare, FÁS and voluntary schemes should be put into compulsory schemes and young people should work from 8 a.m. until about 6 p.m.  It does not matter if they only swept rubbish from one spot to another &mdash;&ldquo;they also serve who only stand and <Col N="504" /> wait&rdquo; and if they worked all day they would not commit vandalism or create problems at 4 a.m.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned electronic tagging and she should pursue that issue.  The work of the gardaí would be much easier if there was a way to track people when they were outside the proper area or were not where they should be at a specific time.  I encourage the Minister to do more research in that area.  These people have a problem and we must ensure they realise they are constrained from entering a part of the city where they are not known.  We must be cruel to be kind. We should spend more money on these projects. These children start misbehaving at age five or six but by the time they are 14 they are young criminals.  We should work on them during their tender years because that is when one can control and encourage them.  I congratulate the Minister on her work and hope she will accept the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Independent Senators will permit me to speak about crime prevention as opposed to the probation service, because that is where we should direct our attention. Youth diversion strategies are required and they should be targeted at disadvantaged communities, specifically at young males in those communities, if crime is to be prevented in the long term.  The aim should be to keep young people within the education system for as long as possible by making that system more responsive to their needs and providing alternatives to traditional education services.  I also welcome the moves in the Children Bill towards greater parental responsibility, as mentioned by the Minister, because that is necessary if we are to steer potential offenders away from crime and drugs.  I do not often agree with Senator Farrell but I agree that parents have a role to play.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party policy document on crime advocates community based support for families in disadvantaged areas, especially targeted at parents with low educational achievements.  It also advocates community based, high quality preschool facilities to nip crime in the bud and give children an opportunity to achieve something rather than be doomed to a life of crime.  I also favour the expansion of the &ldquo;Early Start&rdquo; programme and the home-school liaison service, which are vital if we are to ensure crime is prevented in the long term.  We must revamp the school attendance service to make it more like an educational welfare service which would provide not only tracing of children playing truant but a counselling and support service for children who persistently avoid school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased we have moved on from the all too familiar debate on prison places.  While Labour is not opposed to providing more places, we are weary of the argument that it is the panacea for all our problems.  We have to be realistic.  Prison is a place where we can put offenders.  It is a twofold response in that it punishes the offender and keeps dangerous civilians out of society. However, it has not succeeded in terms of <Col N="505" /> rehabilitation.  The argument is made that many offenders imprisoned for petty crimes learn their craft to a greater degree inside prison.  We must look at other ways to prevent crime and ensure that in the long-term some sort of rehabilitation is provided to allow at least some of these people return to a normal life.  That should be one of our aims in tackling crime.</P>
    <P>We should look again at the choice between imprisonment and the payment of fines for crimes.  It is wrong that a person may opt to avoid a large fine by spending a short period of time in prison while others are sent to prison for their inability to pay a relatively small fine.  That system should be made fairer, perhaps by expanding the attachment of earnings system which currently applies in family law to fines for more general crimes.</P>
    <P>In 1969 the Governor of Massachusetts appointed a commissioner to deal specifically with young offenders.  The commissioner's approach was radical in that he basically stopped all custodial sentences for young offenders except those convicted of murder or rape.  In all other cases an intensive non-custodial regime was initiated.  Child offenders who had received a sentence were taken off their sentences and put on an intensive rehabilitation programme which was designed especially for them.  When necessary those programmes could involve direct action within the young person's home and family, which sometimes included sending them on special training or education programmes away from their home background.</P>
    <P>The programme aimed at teaching those young people how to be responsible members of society, how to work effectively with others as a team, how to accept responsibility and how to respect valid authority.  From my brief examination of that system, it seemed to work.  Juvenile recidivism in Massachusetts decreased dramatically in the years following the implementation of that programme.</P>
    <P>I know that system had to be specially adapted and targeted and that it cost money.  However, it proved to be very successful in the long-term. While we in Government may be faulted for operating with an annual budget, which the political system makes necessary, and Ministers wanting to operate their own policies rather than looking to the long term, we should remember that certain aims in society are of necessity long term. This is one of them and it would be money well spent to adopt such a strategy to deal with young offenders.</P>
    <P>From looking at the statistics which the Minister provided for the Probation and Welfare Service, it is quite clear we are getting very good value for money.  The staff totals 247 people with a budget for 1997 totalling £12.5 million.  They provide reports to the courts and thus assist the judge in determining sentencing, they have community based supervision of offenders, they have a welfare service for the prisons and they provide counselling programmes for offenders and their <Col N="506" /> families.  The service is also involved with a number of workshops and day centres.  If we are to properly value their work and their efforts in rehabilitating young offenders and giving offenders an option to prison, we must support them, not with lip service but with financial backup and other services.</P>
    <P>When the Family Law Bill and the divorce legislation are introduced, that will place an extra responsibility on the Probation and Welfare Service. We also have two new prisons in Castlerea and the Curragh which will put a greater strain on the workload of the service.  They deserve our support.  The Independent Members have done us a service by tabling this motion.  I know the Minister has enlisted all her resources in this area and has given her support to the motion.  It is something on which we can all agree to work for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>As was stated by previous speakers, the importance of the motion is that it has focused attention on this matter.  The Minister's response, as was pointed out by Senator Gallagher, is very positive.  We hope that will continue.</P>
      <P>The recent debate on crime has focused on quick fix solutions which make good headlines but do little to address the underlying problem. Unfortunately, there are few reliable statistics available in the criminal justice system.  That is why Democratic Left has long argued for the establishment of a criminalogical statistics unit within the Central Statistics Office.  We do, however, have sufficient information to draw some conclusions about the people in our prisons.</P>
      <P>We know they are likely to be young.  One third of Irish prisoners are aged under 21 years, in comparison with the EU average of one in ten.  A large proportion left school early without any qualifications, which is a terrible indictment of our education system.  According to all available evidence, one in two prisoners will reoffend following their release.  There are some crimes, particularly crimes of violence, for which custodial sentences are the only realistic option. However, we need to start examining the non-custodial alternatives which are geared towards rehabilitation rather than simple containment. We also need to ensure that those offenders who are sent to prison have access to a full range of rehabilitation services, ranging from counselling and drug treatment programmes to adult literacy and vocational training programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion refers primarily to young offenders.  The Government's juvenile justice legislation has a number of innovative provisions, including a statutory diversion programme and other early intervention measures.  These need to be consolidated and expanded.  We also need to look at those young offenders who do not come under the scope of juvenile justice legislation &mdash; the 18 to 21 year old males who are currently clogging our prisons.  Further development and expansion of the Probation and Welfare Service is vital if we are to make increased use of non-custodial <Col N="507" /> sentences, such as community service orders.  We need to develop a new and innovative approach to ensure that offenders' first contact with the criminal justice system is their last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion demands recognition. It specifically refers to &ldquo;the increased needs in the family courts and within the prisons&rdquo; and the need &ldquo;to use the probation service to the utmost effect to keep young offenders out of prison&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The prison system of every country has failed. The Minister pointed out that a huge number of prisoners return to prison after their release.  The system propagates itself.  In the same way that certain hospital patients become hospitalised, some prisoners become accustomed to the prison regime and are unable to deal with the outside world.  They sometimes contrive to return to prison.</P>
      <P>At one time in Australia if one's grandfather or great grandfather had not served a term in prison in Australia, one was deemed not to be Australian. The horrific situation of the women of Botany Bay and the horrors that prisoners endured in the colonies never did anything except make them realise that they never wanted to go to prison again.</P>
      <P>Has even one person been rehabilitated into society in Ireland after a spell in prison?  If so, I would praise the prison system.  In certain circumstances people are moved from one prison to another.  They may end up in Shelton Abbey, one of the best hotels in Ireland, where every facility is available to inmates.  They are there for debt problems, not because they have committed crimes.  Similarly young children from Dublin's inner city are moved to the open prison at Blacklion, County Cavan, where their families are unable to visit them.  Much of the drug problem in Cork has been curbed following the installation of nets over the walls to prevent the hurling of balls which contain drugs into the prison.</P>
      <P>Use of the probation service for its intended purpose would involve an expansion of the juvenile liaison officer schemes in every county.  Such officers are aware of potential trouble makers and of the problems associated with their families. An expansion of the service may facilitate their dealing with them.</P>
      <P>The courts are indiscriminate because they tend to apply sentences appropriate to the cases before them.  However, this criterion is not person, family or community oriented.  This means that people from parts of Cork, Limerick, Dublin and Kilkenny will get harder sentences than those from other areas.  Although judges must have eight years experience as a lawyer and have often belonged to political parties, this does not give them the experience or the right to deal with the people who come before them.  There should be an alternative to the legal system as presently constituted, an alternative where there are stringent limitations on what judges can and cannot do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> If a probation system is to work it must do so from both inside and outside the legal system.  It must also be organised on a family and community basis.  The system works best when those working within it belong to the same community as those it serves.  They must be able to judge what happens within the community and must keep young offenders out of prison, which is a university for crime.  How many people go into Irish prisons drug free and come out drug addicts?  The community service orders should be expanded and everybody should know that a person given such an order has been through a process.</P>
    <P>Listening to the radio earlier this week, I was disgusted to hear a priest in the prison service complain about the transfer of a prisoner from Cork to Arbour Hill.  However, he forgot to mention that the prisoner was a Christian Brother, and while he was frail man of 82 years he was a paedophile convict.  Perhaps he should not be in prison, but the priest did no service to the Church, the prison service and the legal process. I hope he will reflect on the damage that was inflicted by the prisoner on others.</P>
    <P>The probation service must be expanded.  We should, if possible, keep people out of prison, whether young or old.  All prisons do is contain people.  Having been contained, those people emerge to commit a crime after two or three days and return to prison.  We should agree on this motion, because there are huge problems to be addressed by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Social Welfare.  There should be a Minister dealing with those who have committed offences to find out how we can keep them in a system that has not worked in the past.  I see no advantage in putting people in prisons because they have not worked in any civilised society.  I agree with the motion, though it may be going nowhere, and the probation service should be used to the fullest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly heartened not only by the Minister's response to the motion but even more by the contributions from Senators.  I had begun to think that any debate on crime had to involve the provision of more prison places.  If one looked at media reports from recent years, most Oireachtas debates consisted of urging the Minister for Justice to open more prisons. Accordingly, I was heartened to hear such varied views from fellow Senators.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville spoke of the 80 per cent recidivism rate among prisoners.  If one was running any business and there was an 80 per cent failure rate, one would have to ask if something was wrong with that organisation.  Questioning this rate of recidivism is a start and an acknowledgement that this issue must be seen from another point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted Senator Lydon's contribution, because he is a psychologist.  He stressed the importance of reinforcing good behaviour rather than punishing bad behaviour as being psychologically important.  Senator Lanigan referred to this when <Col N="509" /> saying that the failure rate of people going to prison is very high.  Even if prisons are made tougher and less like hotels in County Wicklow, only those of very strong character like the saints are improved by suffering.  Suffering makes most of us more bitter and does us little good, as we tend to be more enthusiastic about behaving badly.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Senators Farrell and Gallagher agree so much on the need for early intervention to prevent crime by dealing with children.  I support their calls for an improvement in schooling in deprived areas and for liaison between homes and schools.  Intensive assistance should be given to dysfunctional families who require it.  Senator Sherlock was enthusiastic about diversionary tactics and that we should try to divert people from becoming so involved with crime that prison becomes inevitable.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of electronic tagging, which he sees as very important in reducing the number of people who go to prison.  All Members would agree that people tend to come out of prisons worse than they were going in.  The Minister is looking into this, although sometimes these schemes can be mocked.  It was discovered that one prisoner put his tag on his dog and left the dog at home.  However, one swallow does not make a summer.  We can examine what happened with the other prisoners, who may not have had dogs to put the tags on.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's point on resistance to local services.  All of us are familiar with the cry of &ldquo;Not in my backyard.&rdquo;  People are enthusiastic about having services set up that may prevent crime so long as those services are not set up near them.  I am fortunate in that the first drug unit was set up almost next door to me.  When people complain to me that a unit should not be set up in their area, I can say that I have one 20 metres down the road and take the wind out of their sails.  It is important that each community tackles the problems.  As Senator Lanigan said, there is no point in shipping people miles away from where they live and hope their families stay in contact with them.  I thank the Minister for her reply and Senators for their constructive attempts to look for alternatives to custodial sentences within this jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 13 and 14, to delete &ldquo;or the person who believes himself to be the father&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because when we deal with the subject of adoption, we refer to the need for confidentiality.  Allowing somebody who believes himself to be the father the right to enter into negotiations with the Adoption Board is not in keeping with what continues to be the experience of those who have been adopted.  It is contradictory that those who are adopted are not allowed access to basic information while in this instance a man who believes himself to be the natural father of a child should be allowed enter into negotiations regarding the welfare of the child and, ultimately, the guardianship of that child.</P>
      <P>Section 4 states &ldquo;The father of a child may, by notice to the Board, advise the Board of his wish to be consulted in relation to&mdash;&rdquo;.  Why do we specify the father and not somebody who believes himself to be the father?  Section 3, however, on rules states that the Principal Act is amended &mdash; to take account of the Keegan case &mdash; and refers to &ldquo;the consultation that is required by this Act to be carried out with the father or the person who believes himself to be the father&rdquo;.  Before consultation is entered into with the Adoption Board, the man concerned should prove he is the parent of the child.  Negotiations should only be entered into with somebody who is legally the child's father.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the introduction of a new statutory procedure for consulting the father of a non-marital child before the child is placed for adoption by an adoption agency so as to afford him an opportunity to exercise his right to apply for guardianship and/or custody of the child, if he so wishes.  The new provisions contained in sections 2 to 9 represent the Government's legislative response to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland.  In that case the European Court ruled that Irish adoption law discriminates against fathers of non-marital children in violation of the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>I will explain the valid reasons for the inclusion in the Bill of the phrase Senator McGennis seeks to have deleted, although I understand what she said and the motivation behind the amendments. This phrase is designed to ensure a father whose paternity has not been formally established in a court or otherwise is not excluded from being consulted in relation to a proposed adoption.  I consider that it would be unfair to disentitle a person who believes he is the father of the child being proposed for adoption from being consulted simply because he might not be in a position to prove he is the father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such an approach would be unduly restrictive and would not be in conformity with the <Col N="511" /> judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case which the relevant provisions of the Bill are intended to address.  In fact, it would defeat their purpose.  Mr. Keegan's own paternity had not been formally established by the time his child was placed for adoption.  It is essential, therefore, that the new consultation procedures provided for in the Bill are sufficiently flexible in order to avoid a similar case arising in the future.  In the light of what I said, I ask Senator McGennis to consider withdrawing her amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I are at cross purposes.  I fully acknowledge the European Court decision on the Keegan case.  I have much to say on the rights of fathers <i>vis-á-vis</i> their responsibilities, particularly non-marital fathers. Unfortunately, I did not get the opportunity to make that point on Second Stage.  I have no problem consulting &ldquo;non-marital fathers&rdquo; as long as they are non-marital fathers.  The Minister of State said that in the Keegan case paternity was not established prior to the child being placed for adoption.  What I propose would not interfere with that.</P>
      <P>There is an onus in this legislation to ensure, where possible, that the consent of the father is established.  Because this issue is treated in a particular way for probably sound reasons, the only people who should be considered &mdash; the 1952 Adoption Act was specific in this regard &mdash; are the mother, the non-marital father and the adopting parents.  Somebody who claims to be the non-marital father of a child being given up for adoption should have to prove paternity prior to the Adoption Board discussing the case or any matter pertaining to it.  That is in keeping with the present position in relation to adult adoptees.</P>
      <P>If the birth mother who gives up a child for adoption has the right to confidentiality and if the adult adoptee has the right to privacy, unless he or she states otherwise, that confidentiality should be extended to take on board the European Court's decision in the Keegan case.  The only other party who should be involved in discussions is the non-marital father, which is how the Minister of State referred to him.  He did not say somebody who claims to be the father.  There must be continuity or fairness.  The man must prove he is the non-marital father.</P>
      <P>If my amendment was accepted, the paragraph would read: &ldquo;governing the consultation required by this Act to be carried out with the father of the child.&rdquo;  This respects the judgment in the Keegan case and is not in conflict with right of the non-marital father to have a say in whether his child is adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation takes account of the Keegan case.  The Senator's proposal does not conform with it, which is why we must retain the wording because, in the Keegan case, paternity was not proven.  If the phrase is deleted, it could <Col N="512" /> lead to an agency refusing to consult with a father because he cannot prove he is the father. Paternity is normally established during court proceedings which follow consultation.  If I delete the wording, I would be in conflict with the judgment in the Keegan case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is putting the cart before the horse.  Much time, effort and money would be saved by enshrining in law the need for a father to prove paternity prior to embarking on court proceedings. If a case is taken and it is discovered the man is not the non-marital father, much time and effort has been wasted and someone has probably been put through considerable agony.  I suggest it should be done the other way.  When a man wants to stop the adoption of a child of whom he claims to be the non-marital father, the board should first arrange for his paternity to be proven.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 30 to 34, and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) the adoption has, for so long as it is in force, substantially transferred, under the <Col N="513" /> law of the place where it was effected, to the adopters, the rights and duties of guardianship, or parental authority over the child,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment to allow for the case of Paraguayan adoptions, which has been brought to the Minister's attention.  Its wording might achieve the objective of those people who have adopted children in Paraguay to have those adoptions recognised as foreign adoptions.  The section allows for revocation and this might be one of the problems the Minister mentioned to those families who have adopted Paraguayan children. However, I would be willing to withdraw my amendment, although I believe the wording might be better, if the Minister guaranteed that his wording in this section recognised the position of Paraguayan children and ensured they were entered in the register of foreign adoptions.  The wording of my amendment probably achieves that, although I do not have the benefit of the Minister's support and legal expertise.  However, if the Minister is willing to state the wording in section 10(2)(b) guarantees Paraguayan adoptions will be recognised and entered in the register of foreign adoptions, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment on behalf of Senator O'Toole who is not here tonight.  This amendment was not previously discussed during the Bill's passage through the Dáil.  It is new and needs serious consideration.  The parents of adopted Paraguayan children have been told by their legal adviser there is no constitutional or legal obstacle to compel the Minister to refuse to accept this amendment.  If the will is there, it provides a viable way forward.  I am sympathetic to the Minister's wish to do something to solve this problem and that was made clear on Second Stage.  This amendment may solve it.  It may not be the ideal solution and the Minister may well have a better one.  The families of adopted Paraguayan children are deeply concerned about this. The objective is to ensure Paraguayan simple adoptions are entered in the register of foreign adoptions.</P>
      <P>Given what we know of the nature of Paraguayan adoption law from the expert opinion obtained by the Department of Health, can the matter not be disposed of by legislation?  What specific issues are involved which require a decision by the High Court?  What procedures will be followed if the case is taken to the High Court because that is something about which people are concerned?  What provision does the Minister propose to make for legal representation during proceedings in the High Court?  What impact will that legal representation have on the preparation of a presentation case to the High Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the deep concern of the parents and I am anxious to ensure their case receives all the attention it needs.  This may not be the ideal amendment but it is tabled in an effort to solve <Col N="514" /> the problem.  I look forward to the Minister's response to this to see if there is any other answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Both these amendments seek to provide for the recognition of a form of adoption known as simple or ordinary adoption.  It is important to understand that such adoptions are fundamentally different in nature and legal effect from that of a full or plenary adoption.  Our statutory system for the recognition of foreign adoptions is confined to adoptions effected abroad which have a broadly similar legal effect to that of an Irish adoption order.  On the making of such an order, the birth parent loses all legal rights and is freed from all legal duties with respect to the child.  These rights and duties are transferred permanently to the adoptive parents and the adopted child is regarded in law as their child, as if born to them within marriage.</P>
      <P>The effect of the recognition of a foreign adoption under Irish law is to accord it the same legal status as an Irish adoption order.  It follows that an adoption granted outside the State must have a similar legal effect as an Irish adoption under the law of the foreign country concerned in terms of permanently severing the legal relationship between the birth parents and the child in order to qualify for recognition here.</P>
      <P>However, simple or ordinary adoptions are more limited in their legal effect than full or plenary adoptions in that the pre-existing legal relationship between the child and the birth parents is not completely severed.  In countries such as Paraguay, where dual systems of simple and full adoption are operated, it is for the relevant adoption authority to decide which type of adoption decree is the appropriate one to make by reference to the provisions of its internal adoption laws.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that we must respect that distinction and not seek to accord a simple adoption a legal status beyond that which it has under the law of the country where it was granted.  I reiterate that our adoption laws have evolved on the basis that they protect the interests of the child and protect the rights of the birth parents as set out in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>In the case of inter-country adoptions, it is right and proper that our laws give the same respect to the rights of birth parents abroad as they give to Irish parents.  I have been advised that the amendments of the existing definition of a foreign adoption contained in section 10 are as far as we can go in extending our statutory system for the recognition of adoptions effected abroad.  From a public policy point of view, it is not possible to modify the system further without completely undermining our credibility at international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will recall that at the commencement of Second Stage on 19 February, I mentioned that I had received legal opinion from a lawyer in Paraguay on certain aspects of Paraguayan adoption law and that I had sought clarification from the lawyer on a number of matters.  This clarification <Col N="515" /> has come to hand and, in accordance with the undertaking I gave to Senator Quinn, a copy of the entire opinion has been made available to the group representing the adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>I have also consulted with the Attorney General on the legal opinion.  While the opinion sheds new light on our understanding of the legal effect of an ordinary Paraguayan adoption, the Attorney General is of the view that such an adoption is unlikely to comply with the terms of the substitute paragraph (b) of the definition of a foreign adoption contained in section 10 of the Bill because the legal relationship between the birth parents and the child is not completely severed.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the parents claim to have received legal advice which supports the contention that their adoptions would qualify for recognition under the revised definition of a foreign adoption provided for in section 10.  I am sympathetic to the position of these children.  I ask Senators not to press their amendments on the understanding that I will look again at the matter before Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I did not hear you say that both amendments were being discussed together.  I thank the Minister.  I do not claim to be an expert on foreign adoptions, but I can imagine that if I was the mother of a foreign adoptee I would be praying that the Minister and his advisers can come up with a solution to this problem.  I know the Minister is sympathetic and I do not wish to be obstructive.  However, there is a contradiction in what the Minister said.  He said that foreign adoptions must have the same legal effect as Irish adoptions.  However, subparagraph (b) gives the lie to that statement.  It states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;by the substitution of the following paragraph (b):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the adoption has, for as long as it is in force, substantially the same legal effect as respects the guardianship of the child in the place where it was effected as an adoption effected by an adoption order,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to foreign adoptions, we are acknowledging in law that they are not the same but substantially the same.  The parents of the adopted Paraguayan children have pointed out that there are plenary and simple adoptions.  However, they have told me that the effect of simple adoptions is the same except for minor differences.  Revocation is not the problem.  However, the only legal tie which remains between the birth parents and the child are limited inheritance rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an attempt to ascertain whether the adoption is equivalent or equal to the effect of an Irish adoption, the Minister arranged to have various questions answered.  The Department of Health asked: &ldquo;On the granting of an ordinary adoption decree, are the adopters regarded as the legal guardians of the child?  If so, is this to the exclusion of the natural parents?&rdquo;  The Paraguayan <Col N="516" /> expert replied: &ldquo;After the adoption decree is granted, the adopters become legal guardians of the child.  This excludes natural parents.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is not equal to the Irish situation it is equivalent to it.  The inheritance rights issue is the only issue which differentiates these adoptions from Irish adoptions.  I do not wish to put this to a vote.  I would be delighted if the Minister can come up with a solution.  The parents are seeking assurances from the wording of subparagraph (b) which guarantees that Paraguayan adoptions will be recognised and entered in the register of foreign adoptions.  If that is the case then we have no difficulties.  I do not wish to change the wording of this section and cause more problems than are necessary.</P>
    <P>My amendment to section 11 recognises revocation and limited inheritance rights.  This was drafted by an experienced, learned legal expert. We need to set a precedent which will solve the problem for future foreign adoptions.  People have a right to be protected by such a precedent. If one is excluded legally, one feels threatened and that one's child is not protected.</P>
    <P>The parents want the Minister to come up with a solution.  He has stated that there is a difference between plenary and simple adoptions.  However, where there is a will there is a way.  The Minister fulfilled commitments he gave on Second Stage. He has obtained legal advice.  I am not always swayed by such advice, regardless of the Attorney General.  If one seeks a legal opinion and one pays a lawyer, one can be represented on a charge of murder.  The advice means little and, to paraphrase the Taoiseach, it depends on the questions one asks.</P>
    <P>If there is the will to do so, this problem can be addressed.  The parents have been given a good hearing by the Minister of State and they are optimistic.  I ask him to go a step further than he did on Second Stage.  I would hate to be in the position of the people in the Public Gallery or those at home who are giving homes and love to their adopted children but who do not have protection or rights under Irish law.  There are difficulties, but I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment that, in so far as he can, he will arrive at a solution to this problem by Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State appears to hold out a degree of hope.  I agree with Senator McGennis' comments and I believe the Minister of State is struggling to achieve the same objective as the parents of the adopted Paraguayan children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that Paraguayan adoptions must have substantially the same legal effects as regards the guardianship of the child in Paraguay as an Irish adoption has in this country.  That is the aim.  However, the expert consulted by the parents stated that &ldquo;after the simple adoption decree is granted, the adopters become legal guardians of the child.  This excludes natural parents&rdquo;. That statement appears to destroy the legal <Col N="517" /> objection of incomplete transfer of rights on which the Department of Health has based its opposition to extending that recognition.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said he will continue to examine the matter between now and Report Stage.  By not pressing the matter tonight, we will enable him to achieve what is being sought.  It will be pressed on Report Stage, but the Minister of State will try to find a solution to this dilemma in the meantime.  As Senator McGennis said, lawyers differ.  The parents of the adopted Paraguayan children are confident their legal advice will stand up to challenge.  Let us seek a way of solving this huge problem.  It is possible to find a way, the problem is finding it.  Senator McGennis has articulated the point we are making very well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem can be stated in a few sentences.  The legal relationship between the parent and the child must be completely severed. It is in the interests of the child and of the parents that this position be clear.  Adoption requires permanence. If there is any doubt about an adoption, it could cause untold damage in the future.  I must be satisfied that the legal relationship between the child and the parents is severed.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis said she did not pay much attention to the advice of Attorneys General.  I am not in the same position.  I cannot ignore the advice I am given by the Attorney General as easily as Senator McGennis, although when one considers some past Attorneys General it is understandable why she has difficulty in that regard.</P>

We will not press the amendment tonight but we reserve the right to bring it before the House on Report Stage when we will have more legal advice.  In the meantime, I ask the Minister of State to solve the problem.  I am aware his legal advisers are doing <Col N="518" /> their best in this regard.  A solution might be found if we dig deep enough.  Perhaps the Government's legal advisers and those of the parents could meet to try to find it.  The case has been well argued by Senator McGennis and Senator Quinn.  The Minister of State obviously wants to find a solution and I am grateful for his disposition.

      <P>As I understand it, yes.  I am definite about the opinion given by the Attorney General.  I have made his advice clear.  Senator McGennis referred to a glimmer of hope.  I hope there is one.  I have looked at all possibilities, including testing the matter legally.  I cannot say any more about that because it is ongoing.  I do not want to raise hopes too much.  Hopes raised and then dashed can make a situation worse than it was at the beginning.  I will continue to look at this matter in the hope of finding a satisfactory solution.  That does not mean we will find one.  At the end of the day, the main interest must be that of the children involved.  I am responsible not only for adoption but the whole child care area and the interest of the child must be of paramount importance to me.</P>
      <P>I am advised that I may have given the Senator wrong information.  The Attorney General has not advised on the specific amendment being discussed. I cannot go any further than what I have already stated in relation to the Attorney General's advice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.  &mdash;The Adoption Board shall establish an active contact register to facilitate contact between mothers and adult adoptees.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have proposed these amendments out of absolute frustration and an inability to achieve an objective which I set in train in this House several years ago.  I am not sure if this is the correct place in the Bill to insert these amendments.  I looked at the Adoption Act, 1952, and wondered if that needed to be amended.  If the Minister says the wording of any of these amendments is wrong or does not achieve the desired objective, I am willing for the Minister to substitute amendments.</P>
      <P>My primary concern in the area of adoption and family law legislation is that of the children. I have stated on the record that if all legislation started from the premise of what is good for a child we would have a better society and legislation.</P>
      <P>I have written to the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and any Minister who comes into the House to deal with legislation relating to the registration of births.  The Minister, Deputy Taylor, has helpfully but in utter frustration, told me on a hundred different occasions that I am trying to amend the wrong laws and achieve the objective in the wrong legislation.  I think the Minister knows what I am trying to achieve in these amendments to section 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> Amendment No. 3 seeks the establishment of a contact register.  I presume the Minister receives the same level of daily correspondence as I do because it is a matter of public record that I am an adoptee.  I receive heartrending and horrendous correspondence from people attempting to contact their birth parents and <i>vice versa.</i>  The level of success in doing this through normal means such as the Adoption Board and the Adoption Society is very limited.</P>
    <P>The route I took was not approved.  It was not illegal but would not be recommended.  People do the wrong thing out of absolute frustration.  It is wrong for either an adult adoptee or a birth mother to arrive at someone's door.  The Minister and I agree on that.  This can cause untold psychological and practical problems for both sides. However, that is what happens, as it did in my case, and it will continue to happen.</P>
    <P>There is a need for confidentiality.  We all agree with and respect that.  I took a cursory look at the Adoption Act, 1952, and I did not see any provision for this.  I saw the procedures, regulations, the means by which adoptions are dealt with and legalised, and the establishment of adoption societies etc.  Perhaps the Minister's advisers can correct me.  I saw nothing which copperfastened the sacrosanct right to confidentiality.  While the Minister and I respect this, unless we do something practical to facilitate those who wish to make contact, either adult adoptees or birth parents, this crazy state of affairs will persist.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes that the Adoption Board shall establish an active contact register to facilitate contact between mothers and adoptees. I know Barnardo's has stated it does not agree that the Adoption Board is the proper agency to do this.  I am proposing the Adoption Board because if I stated Barnardo's, it will be legally incorrect.  There is a need for a register.  This evening I received a telephone call from someone who claims he or she has been given misinformation and has not been helped.</P>
    <P>There is a need for an active contact register, not one which is announced overnight and claims to solve all our needs.  The Minister gave a commitment to this House and to me in writing over a year ago that a contact register would be established on a pilot basis.  He has done nothing since that day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be corrected.  I plead with the Minister, in the interests of fairness for all concerned, not to announce the establishment of a pilot scheme contact register here tonight or until such time as it actually exists.  In the most recent letter I sent to the Minister I asked him not to reply saying that it was a matter to be considered in the context of a contact register.  I want the Minister to address the problems being faced by the people who write to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I speak of an active contact register I mean one which would include all the information <Col N="522" /> which the Adoption Board holds about mothers who gave up their children and about children who were adopted.  That information should be on file in the Adoption Board.  I am suggesting that the Adoption Board would contact those people individually, inform them of the establishment of a contact register and ask them if they would like to be included on it.  I have also learned that there is a non-contact register in some other countries whereby people specifically state that they do not want to be contacted.  I would welcome the establishment of such a register as it would solve many of the problems.  Adoptees and birth mothers always feel they are prevented from getting information but perhaps there is an absolute determination by one or other of the parties not to be found.  A contact register could be augmented by a non-contact register.</P>
    <P>Minister Taylor introduced the Registration of Births Bill and I attempted to achieve my objectives in that Bill also.  I was informed by the Minister at that time that anyone could walk in to the Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths and obtain their natural birth certificate.  That is not true; if a person does not know their mother's name, they cannot do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">

      <P>The Minister could get a copy of my birth certificate if he had the necessary information.  However, many of the hundreds of thousands of adult adoptees in Ireland have not got that most vital piece of information, the name of their birth mother, and nobody is going to hand such a person a copy of their birth certificate. I was able to obtain a copy but only because of an occurrence on my marriage certificate which provided me with information I did not have.  That is another day's work.  It is a person's fundamental right to have access to their original birth record.  I am aware there is a concern that the confidentiality of the mother, which we spoke about throughout this Bill, would be put at risk because she might have put down her home address on the birth certificate.  I know that happens and has happened in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Northern Ireland and the UK, adoptees have the right of access to records and the right to be given copies of their original birth certificates. I do not know why the Republic of Ireland should be any different from its near neighbours. The Minister has a vast amount of experience as a legislator in Northern Ireland and I ask him to bring that experience to bear on this legislation. <Col N="523" /> I have tried to achieve some of the objectives outlined in amendments Nos. 3 and 4 through other legislation including the Freedom of Information Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 is more pressing.  I will be happy to attend any press conference the Minister holds when this matter is cast in stone.  I am very concerned about the records held by adoption societies.  Senator Doyle, as a member of a health board, may be able to support me in some of these amendments.  In recent years records turned up in the national archives, or some such place where they should not have been, in relation to American adoptions.  Were it not for the vigilance of the archivist we would never have found those records.  At the time, the Tánaiste gave a commitment that these records would be collated and that some 2,000 families would be facilitated in making contact.  I received a letter this morning from a woman in America telling me that nothing has happened and that no contact has been made.  I wondered at the time how contact could be made particularly as it could not be made if the people were adopted in Carlow.  It was not consistent.  A public announcement was made on this issue and there was a public expectation that something would be done about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he did not want to raise hopes in relation to the adoption of Paraguayan children.  Irish adult adoptees and birth mothers have had their expectations raised very time politicians open their mouths and give them hope. Nothing has happened in the 42 years I have lived here.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not tempt me.  The data which is currently being held by adoption societies is at risk of being lost, destroyed or altered.  That is extremely dangerous and it is something the Government and politicians should not allow to happen.  There are other things which I would like to see happen in the area of adoption but I have not tabled amendments on them.  It is grossly unfair to people whose details have been and could be lost.  I know <Col N="524" /> files have been lost, even through natural occurrences such as fire and so on.  We should seek to ensure that the Adoption Board collates the information and makes it available on a central database.  I am not talking about names, addresses and dates of birth; I am talking about the pieces of ordinary information which are of huge importance to adult adoptees.  Such information might include details of medical history and the family size of the birth mother.  This information means a lot to adult adoptees in their search.  They do not always want to make contact but they crave information.</P>
      <P>Some adoption societies are extremely helpful and work overtime and after hours to try to help those seeking information.  However, the unhelpful ones receive all of the coverage.  That is grossly unfair to people who are doing, and who did, a job that no politician or Government wanted to do.  Voluntary agencies, and particularly the religious, did this work.  Those of us who were fortunate enough to be placed in good homes with good families owe them a debt of gratitude as do politicians and legislators.  I hope the Minister can see his way to taking these amendments on board and I sincerely hope he does something during his period as Minister with particular responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>There was a great hope that when a Minister was established with a specific portfolio in Health, Justice and Education these obstacles would be overcome and something would happen.  I do not want to be critical of the Minister but announcements have been made and nothing has happened. In this Bill, the Minister had the opportunity to make a name for himself and go down in history as someone who made one of the most important amendments to adoption law since the original Bill was published in 1952.  I hope that, in his last days in office, even if the Government continues until November, he will do something about this matter.  I have made this case repeatedly in writing and personally to the Minister of State and I ask him to do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The second amendment relates to copies of birth certificates.  When mothers gave birth, their children were registered through a church on a baptismal registry before they were entered on the civil registry.  The mothers were just asked for their legal name and address.  The child was registered in whatever name and address was given, but factual information was not always provided.  This difficulty arises in relation to birth certificates of adopted children.  All the information that was registered, even if it was available to them, may be of no assistance because it is may be incorrect. However, if the information is correct, all adopted children should have access to the first baptismal or civil certificates on which their names were registered.  Progress has been made in this area, because this was frowned upon years ago.  However, there is a different view now in society that adopted children should have access to that information if possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious matter and I share the Senator's frustrations.  I hope those frustrations will not last much longer.  I recognise the necessity <Col N="526" /> for establishing a new and comprehensive legal framework for post adoption contact between parents and adopted persons and access to birth records.  As I stated previously, the establishment of such a framework is a Government priority.</P>
    <P>There has been a sea change in attitudes to adoption in recent years.  First, there has been a huge decrease in the number of children put up for adoption as an increasing number of mothers choose to raise their babies themselves.  Second, there has been a recognition that adoption is a life long process and that the bonds binding natural mothers to their children and the desire of adopted persons to trace their roots in order to complete that aspect of their identities cannot be extinguished by a legal adoption process.  These factors have led to a position where adoption societies have become increasingly involved in tracing and support work with people whose adoptions they arranged many years previously and birth mothers who gave children up for adoption. A more open climate prevails with regard to adoption nowadays than existed heretofore.  This openness is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>However, we must also be aware that it brings with it an element of fear for many mothers who gave children up for adoption in a less understanding age.  Many of these mothers are now married with other children and have never revealed the secret in their past.  Senator McGennis referred to telephone calls and letters she received.  As she suggested, I also receive similar letters and telephone calls.  However, it is not all one way traffic because I receive letters and telephone calls from women who are very concerned about this matter.  They plead with me not to enable their children to get in touch with them because their husbands and other children do not know about them.  If the children turned up on their doorsteps, they do not know what they would do.  One woman told me that in those circumstances she would take her own life.  I said I hoped she was exaggerating and I tried to talk her out of that feeling.</P>
    <P>There is emotion on both sides of this argument. We should think carefully before putting through such trauma again mothers who gave up their children in such circumstances many years ago and who took a long time to come to terms with that experience.  I have thought carefully about this matter and I have the greatest sympathy for people on both sides of the argument.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the necessary enabling legislation to establish a comprehensive post adoption framework which will take account of the issues I outlined will be brought forward as quickly as possible after a number of legal and constitutional issues have been clarified.  The Circuit Court has stated a consultative case to the Supreme Court, dealing with the right of children who were informally adopted in this country prior to the enactment of adoption legislation to know the identity of their natural parents.  The judge in the case has referred a number of questions to <Col N="527" /> the Supreme Court for decision.  These include whether a child has a constitutional or legal right to know the identity of his or her natural parents and whether a natural mother has a constitutional or legal right to confidentiality.  If both these rights exist, which right should prevail in the circumstances of the case?</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews appeared on a recent edition of &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; where this issue arose.  It was interesting to note that he was of the opinion that the right of the natural mother should prevail.  However, the legal and constitutional issues, which will be addressed by the Supreme Court, will have a direct bearing on the nature and scope of the framework which will be put in place.  These are real issues in the context of Senator McGennis's suggestion of an active contact register.  I hope Senators will appreciate that it would be prudent to await clarification of the constitutional and other legal issues surrounding the question of access to birth records before proceeding with legislation in this sensitive area of human relationships.  To introduce legislation at this juncture would be to anticipate the findings of the Supreme Court.  I understand that on 9 May a date will be set for the hearing of the case by the court.  I therefore ask the Senator not to press her amendments and I will consider the matter further on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised the American situation.  My Department was contacted by the Department of Foreign Affairs this week to say that the approximately 1,500 files relating to passports for children sent to America and other countries have been indexed and put on a data base.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has offered its full co-operation in regard to establishing a contact register.  I hope this clarifies the situation referred to by the Senator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his lengthy and indepth reply.  I am very worried about the health of this Government when nothing has been done about a priority referred to several times by the Minister, namely, the establishment of a contact register.  It is a priority of the Government since the first time I raised the matter with the Minister and nothing has happened. If this is the way priorities of Government are dealt with, and I hope it is not, it is very unhealthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding tracing, the Minister is correct in saying that there has been a sea change in the way in which adoption is treated now in comparison with the forties, fifties and to a certain extent the sixties.  Societies are spending much more time on tracing.  I had a very positive reply from the Acting Chairman's health board in relation to a constituent in Donegal who was attempting to make such a trace.  The reply, which I thought was excellent, was that the social workers would get to his case within six months.  From my experience in other cases I thought this was record time. They were apologetic for the fact that due to a <Col N="528" /> lack of social workers they were no longer in a position to undertake the exact type of work referred to by the Minister in his reply.  Now that there are no children to be adopted they are spending the bulk of their time picking up the pieces of post-adoption situations.  However, they do not have the resources, facilities or social workers to do this.  While we can be critical of the agencies, which I have been, those which have the will power, motivation and humanity do not have the staff.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister was not trying to suggest in any way that I would put any woman to the brink of suicide because of my desire or that of an adoptee to make a contact.  That is not what I said.</P>

      <P>I am ensuring the record of the House does not imply otherwise.  I am entitled to my say in this House.  I am willing to be helpful in any possible way to achieve the objective of many people, but I am not willing to accept rubbish.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle quite rightly questioned me on my amendment and asked if I was allowing for cases where contact was not wanted.  I thought I made it clear that I was allowing for this.</P>
      <P>While the priority of this Government achieves nothing and while there are no structures in place, women throughout rural Ireland are on a daily basis sitting in their homes waiting for a knock on the door, which eventually comes.  It comes by way of people who set out, find their birth certificate, find a townland and then arrive at the door.  The Minister was critical of me for my suggestion to establish an active contact register. However, his inaction puts those women in fear and leaves them open to the dangers he spoke about.  They are sitting and waiting in fear because everyday a knock comes on somebody's door.  If the Minister has contact with the Adult Adoptees Association, the Adoptive Parents Association and the various other groups active in this area he will be aware that this happens every day because there is no structure in place. Those who do not wish to be found are being found on a daily basis.  While women may be ringing the Minister on a daily basis saying they are living in fear, that fear becomes a reality because he has done nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to those who took the Keegan case, the various other cases and the private citizens <Col N="529" /> who have forced changes in adoption law. Any changes which have occurred in adoption law have, by and large, been forced on the State by private citizens.  I take my hat off to those who at great personal cost have taken cases for basic human rights.  I wish the person taking the Keegan case well and I hope the right outcome is achieved, striking a balance between the rights of birth mothers and adult adoptees.</P>
    <P>This Supreme Court case was not in the pipeline when the Minister took over responsibility for this area nor when he made announcements about contact registers.  There was no Supreme Court case tying his hands in any manner.  He had the flexibility and ability to make changes in the law if he had wished to do so.  I presume the Minister knows the ins and outs of the requirements of both sides of the adoption debate.  He knows what birth mothers know in terms of protection and contact and what adoptees want in these areas and by way of information.  If he really wanted to do something in the morning he could introduce a Bill and test the constitutionality of any part of legislation he wanted to bring forward. That would be a very heroic and brave thing to do.</P>

      <P>There are members of Fine Gael in Government who are not silly but who have brought extremely important and good legislation before this House, legislation which had been left open to constitutional challenge because they believed it was better to have it challenged than do nothing.  I am surprised that a Government Minister in a three-party Coalition can make that kind of comment about other Ministers who have had the courage to bring legislation before both Houses of the Oireachtas and have seen them challenged.  I am amazed at the Minister's arrogance.</P>
      <P>Regarding the US files, I am glad that they have been indexed.  However, nothing else has been indexed in relation to the files of Irish adoptees. I commend the Tánaiste for arranging the indexing.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister means when he says the Tánaiste will facilitate the establishment of a contact register for US adoptees and passport holders.  What does that mean?  We do not have a contact register.  Is the Minister saying that because somebody was lucky enough to be adopted by an American citizen that they will get preferential treatment to those of us who stayed in Ireland?  I would like this matter clarified.</P>
      <P>I sincerely asked the Minister not to play politics with this issue and not to give commitments but to say something was going to be done.  He has said and done nothing and that is his record in this Department.</P>

      <P>It would be very difficult.  There are two fears regarding adoption.  Firstly, there is the fear raised by those who rang the Minister.  I understand that they are now happily married and want the past to remain in the past.  That is their own personal business and, whether we agree with it or not, it is what they want and it has to be respected.</P>
      <P>Another issue nobody thinks about concerns cases where people have adopted children and have treated them as their natural children without informing them that they are adopted.  At First Communion they are anxious in case the children get the birth certificate with the name of the natural parents.  They are more anxious when it comes to marriage.  I dealt with these cases and these parents have real fears.  These are the two fears with which we are dealing.  We must protect the interests of the natural parents, the adoptive parents and, most importantly, the children.</P>

      <P>Obviously it is Senator McGennis who cannot take it.  Progress has been made on what is an extremely emotive issue.  I have indicated that there are strong emotions on both sides and Senator Doyle has mentioned another dimension.  I have had to take these matters into consideration.</P>
      <P>I could have been called arrogant if I had proceeded without consultation, so I consulted extensively with adoption organisations as to how to progress the establishment of a passive contact register and the wider issue of post-adoption contact and access to birth records.  I have had detailed discussions with the Adoption Board, Treoir, the Council of Irish Adoption Agencies, Barnardos, the Adoptive Parents' Association and the Adult Adoptees' Association.  Even yesterday I had informal discussions with Barnardos on this matter.  That was the way I had to proceed. If I had not held the necessary consultation process and had not taken into consideration both sides of the argument, I would have done something which would be quite hurtful to many people who are unfortunately in this position.  I was determined to approach this in the right way and that is what I have done.  Progress has been made.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Supreme Court will not consider the case until after 9 May but, arrogant as I may be, I am not arrogant enough to dictate to the Supreme Court or to assume it will listen to what I say.  Whether we like it or not, the Supreme Court is part of our Constitution, it decides issues of constitutionality and I must wait until it makes its decision.  Given that the Supreme Court decision is so near, it would be silly of me to follow the route suggested by the Senator.  I share her frustration but I hope it is near to the end for both of us.  I await with great anticipation the court's ruling on the case; I have no alternative but to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a time for consultation.  Before the Minister, Deputy Taylor, introduced a Bill last week he consulted 80 groups, but then he took action.  The difference is between doing something and talking about it. After one consults one should do something but the Minister has done nothing and I have no hope that he will.  Had the Minister an active interest in this area he would have brought a Bill before the House and had it tested.  He would not have done so a week before other people were awaiting the outcome of a case.  The Bill before us has nothing to do with the Minister's work or any initiatives he took.  It simply acts, interprets and abides by decisions handed down by the court because private citizens took cases, such as the Keegan case and the foreign adoption case. The Minister has done nothing.  He is not responsible for wonderful, reforming legislation &mdash; the Bill comes as a result of private citizens obtaining a court decision, which legislators are bound to implement.  The Minister should not fool himself or anyone else that he had introduced a ground <Col N="532" /> breaking Bill &mdash; he introduced it because he had to.</P>
      <P>Nothing will happen while this Minister is in charge.  I will not be so arrogant as to say nothing will happen while this Government is in office because there are people in this Government who would have attacked the matter with great vigour and might have introduced reforming legislation. All consultation and no action sums up the plight of adult adoptees and women who gave up their children for adoption.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Appointment of Remedial Teacher.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  It concerns the need to appoint a remedial teacher to the primary schools in Bodyke, Broadford, O'Callaghan's Mills, Ogonnolloe, Kilbane and Tuamgraney.  These are all rural schools with two or three teachers and, as is the case in every primary school, a number of their pupils require remedial teaching.  That proportion <Col N="533" /> could be as high as 23 per cent but the average is 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>The schools submitted an application to the Department of Education for the provision of a remedial teacher.  They are not being very demanding in their request as they would appreciate the provision of one teacher for the six schools.  These are rural, isolated schools which are within a reasonable distance of each other. Their pupils have no access to any remedial services in the surrounding area and they need some in-house help in the schools.  I appeal to the Minister of State to recognise the needs of these children in rural areas, many of whom have limited means.  Some parents are in a position to pay for after school remedial teaching, which costs about £10 an hour.  However, most parents cannot afford to provide such a service on an extensive basis.</P>
      <P>In view of the circumstances, particularly the rural isolation of these children, there is a very strong case for the provision of such a teacher. I implore the Minister of State to recognise the circumstances and to assess the application very positively with a view to appointing a teacher in the near future.  The six schools are within a reasonable distance of each other and a teacher could commute between them.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will agree that children who do not get a proper primary education have very little chance of succeeding at second level, never mind proceeding to third level education. The least we owe our children, particularly those with special needs, is to provide the services which give them extra assistance so that they can proceed through their lives without any great difficulties. Unless corrective action is introduced at primary level by the provision of a remedial teacher to take care of the special needs which only become apparent at that stage, such children will have great difficulties at second level.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister appreciates that, but while much great work has been done at first, second and third levels, we must never lose sight of the fact that every citizen is entitled to be taught the three Rs &mdash; reading, writing and arithmetic.  We will not meet that target unless we provide special services for pupils who require such assistance in the form of a remedial teacher.  I appeal to the Minister, in view of the circumstances of this application and the relatively minor demand which is being made, to seriously consider the provision of a remedial teacher for those schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education is currently considering the possibility of making additional remedial teacher posts available to primary schools for the forthcoming school year.  I can assure the Senator that the needs of the schools to which she referred will be taken into account as part of this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers. <Col N="534" /> The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of underachievement in primary schools.</P>
    <P>Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1995 an additional 55 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 223 schools benefited from this allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,188.  Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,285 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.</P>
    <P>At this stage 87 per cent of the pupils in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher.  This is a big improvement on the position when the Minister for Education took office in 1993, when 77 per cent of pupils had the possibility of such access.  It is a matter of regret to the Minister that it is not possible at present to meet the needs of all pupils for remedial teaching as, unfortunately, she does not have unlimited resources.</P>
    <P>There are 122 ordinary national schools in County Clare.  Some 63 of these schools, with an enrolment of 8,941 pupils on 30 September 1995, have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis, available to them.  This includes five schools allocated a remedial service with effect from the commencement of the 1995-6 school year as part of the distribution of the 55 posts to which I referred earlier.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need, following the collection and analysis of information from the schools by the Department's primary inspectorate and also having consideration for data submitted by schools.  This means that 73 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Clare currently enjoy access to a remedial service.</P>
    <P>It is important that such a substantial resource should be used to best effect and deployed in line with evolving need.  The Minister considers it is now appropriate to carry out a review of all these posts to ensure they are being used in the most efficient and effective manner.  Remedial teachers are allocated to schools to enable them to reduce the number of pupils who might have difficulties in learning literacy and mathematical skills and to support schools in teaching those who experience serious problems in acquiring these skills.</P>
    <P>Research &mdash; for example, the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) English reading survey in 1993 &mdash; indicates that between 6.5 per cent and 9 per cent of pupils at 11 years of age, or fifth class, and at 14 years of age have serious learning problems in those areas.  The focus of the remedial teachers' work should be on those pupils who have the greatest needs, both in terms of prevention and remediation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> An initial survey carried out by the Department's inspectorate in 1995 has raised concerns that some pupils may be receiving remedial teaching who do not need it.  This suggests there needs to be a much sharper focus on ensuring the service is targeted on those who need it most.  The key target group would be the lowest functioning 10 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>The survey has demonstrated there is a serious need to ensure the existing provision is correctly targeted.  There is a need to place a much greater emphasis on preventative strategies in schools. There is a need to focus on early identification strategies and differentiated teaching.</P>
    <P>The Department has commenced, in consultation with the education partners, a comprehensive remedial education study in 1997.  The study will survey principal teachers and remedial teachers and will focus on the numbers of pupils attending remedial classes, the criteria for inclusion in and withdrawal from remedial classes, the organisation of remedial teaching in schools, the development and implementation of policy on remedial teaching in schools and record keeping and reporting.  It will also review the instructional programmes of pupils in remedial classes, examine the progress made by pupils receiving remedial teaching and will analyse data on remedial education participation.</P>
    <P>The Minister regards this study, which it is hoped to complete by the end of 1997, as an important step in basing future advances in the remedial service on up to date research, knowledge of how the current remedial provision operates and of what progress has been made by pupils.  This research, to be conducted by the Education Research Centre in co-operation with the partners in education, will inform further advances in remedial provision in our schools.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the Minister for Education is currently considering the possibility of making additional remedial teacher posts available to primary schools in the 1997-8 school year. The needs of the schools referred to by the Senator will receive every consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that it would be more appropriate for the Minister for Education to take a firm decision to make additional remedial teacher posts available rather than considering the possibility of making them available in the school year 1997-8? Does he agree that these schools are a deserving case?</P>

      <P>The postal service has reverted to the bad old days.  The Wells Fargo system has now returned.  There is a four day delivery service to parts of the country, including County Donegal, which is unacceptable.  It is not an efficient service and it will not help to keep small business people in business.</P>
      <P>There is an increasing tendency to use facsimile machines.  Medium and large size businesses no longer depend on the postal service.  The banks have replaced it with their own system.  Many of the major operators who have a large volume of mail are making alternative arrangements.</P>
      <P>A very important service, one that could have been depended upon down the years, has now reached the point of collapse.  It is sad.  I do not criticise the workers.  I strongly supported them and met Mr. Beggs who represented them. However, the service is nearly non existent and is unacceptable to many people in my county.  A four day service is not on.</P>
      <P>The future of the postal service is bleak.  The Leader of the House has promised to bring this matter to the notice of An Post.

The Order of Business, which is so important to the running of the business of the House, is received on Thursdays and, as it is my responsibility, I dispatch it to the 23 members of my party.  I always post a copy to myself to ensure that other party members have received it. Delivery should be made to my home on Friday morning.  However, by the time I leave my home on Monday evenings to partake in Tuesday sittings of the House it has still not arrived.  By the time I get home this weekend I will have approximately ten letters dealing with the business of this House and the Dáil for this week.  Only recently I missed a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>I do not blame anybody who sends out this mail because these delays also occur with post sent from my office.  I would never post a letter on Thursdays to constituents regarding weekend meetings because they would not receive them on time.</P>
      <P>If these delays are happening to this House they must be happening elsewhere.  On Fridays our secretaries would be finished work by 4.30 p.m. so all letters are posted from the office earlier than that time.  Many Senators on the other side of the House have the same problem.</P>
