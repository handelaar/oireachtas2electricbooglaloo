      <P>I have notice from Senator Naughten that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to curb the spiralling cost of car insurance, especially for young drivers.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding to Leitrim County Council for the development of the County Library Headquarters, Ballinamore, County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Manning of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The refusal of the Minister for Education to recognise, for incremental purposes, the teaching years of B.Ed. national school teachers at St. Michael's junior school, Ailesbury Road, Dublin 4.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funding to the Midland Health Board to ensure the continuation of Our Lady of Consolation Nursing Home, Tullamore, County Offaly, as a home for the elderly.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Naughten's and Reynolds's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is item 1 until 1 p.m. and item 2 from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. with a sos <Col N="1370" /> from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  With the permission of the House, I intend to circulate a Supplementary Order Paper later regarding the Freedom of Information Bill, which was initiated in the Seanad.  There are a number of technical amendments from the Lower House which I hope could be dealt with at 5 p.m. if the House agrees.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader outline next week the programme of sittings and the legislation it is intended to take between now and the summer recess?  Will he ensure, through the Minister for Health, that the Government does everything possible to resolve the threatened strike by ambulance personnel?  If the strike takes place, services to cover emergencies must be in place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement yesterday that Aer Lingus is showing a profit.  This is a result of the commitment and dedication of the workforce. The Taoiseach and the Minister Transport, Energy and Communications have suggested that a sell off or alliances with other companies could be part and parcel of future policy.  If such proposals are made, I ask the Leader to ensure that the House has an opportunity to discuss them in the context of the overall plan for Aer Lingus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the return of the Freedom of Information Bill to the House where it was extensively discussed.  Several requests for a debate on European Monetary Union have been made.  Yesterday, before Second Stage of the Public Service Management Bill, the Minister for Finance said he would welcome a debate on European Monetary Union at an early date. Given that the pace is hotting up, such a debate would be timely.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business was unusually long yesterday and this demonstrated the arbitrary nature of the arrangements for Ministers waiting in the ante room for the commencement of legislative business.  The Minister for Finance was kept waiting for almost an hour yesterday.  I can envisage cases where civil servants and perhaps Ministers might welcome the opportunity to rehearse their lines.  However, the Minister for Finance does not need time to rehearse his lines, whatever one may think of them.  Given that the House often tells the rest of the country how it ought to organise its business, we should consider how the Order of Business is conducted, because Ministers are often kept waiting.  Is this the most efficient use of their time, which ought to be valuable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a time when some of us are no longer Members of the Seanad. However, perhaps the House could consider whether there is a more efficient way to organise the Order of Business.  Perhaps a time could be set before which it would not be necessary for a Minister to arrive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree fundamentally with Senator Lee.  I envisage circumstances where it would be highly desirable to keep a Minister waiting all day outside and to have a totally unlimited Order of Business.  The Committee on Procedures and Privileges could examine this.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I raised the need for an urgent debate on the difficulties in agriculture, particularly the beef and dairy sectors.  I sought to raise this matter under Standing Order 29 and was ruled out of order.  I do not challenge that ruling, but this is a matter of considerable difficulty that should be dealt with by the House.  European Monetary Union is a related matter in that the strong currency and revaluations are partly responsible for these difficulties.  There should be a debate on this matter as a matter of urgency, preferably with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry present, but perhaps also with the Minister for Finance present, to deal with matters arising from European Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty in dealing with the Freedom of Information Bill today but yesterday it was decided to take Committee Stage of the Litter Pollution Bill and we need to be aware of the pressure those decisions place on the staff in the Clerk's office.  Recently a Bill went from Committee Stage to Report Stage and it was a miracle that the staff got the amendments tabled and put in order in time.  Arrangements will have to be made so that the procedure is not an <i>ad hoc one.</i></P>
      <P>There are reports that new gardaí cannot be provided with whistles.  I suggest the Leader ask the Minister for Justice to contact the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Football Association of Ireland.  I am sure they will be able to supply the gardaí with the whistles they require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Leader aware of a problem with nursing students who are completing their diploma in nursing studies?  This is the first group of students to complete this course and they are looking to get their degree in nursing with a one-year degree course.  The Department of Health has paid for the diploma course but will not pay for their degree course.  The Department of Education feels the Department of Health should pay for the degree course, so they are falling between two stools.  They are the only undergraduate students in the country who have to pay <Col N="1372" /> college fees.  The Leader should ask the Departments of Health and Education to look into this matter so that one of them can decide to pay these fees.  This matter is turning into a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader when the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will come into this House to debate the serious decline in beef and milk prices.  Yesterday the Minister was quoted as being concerned at factories not passing the proper price for beef on to farmers.  The Minister should clarify to the House what he is doing to ensure that the price of beef is not allowed to continue falling and do the same in relation to milk prices.  There is no use in the Minister being quoted as being concerned about the factory prices.  Farmers have to kill their cattle and it is now coming to the end of the season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very serious.  Farmers have to kill their cattle and are rushing them out now as we reach the end of the season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I am going on too long, a Chathaoirligh, but it is a serious issue.  I appeal to the Leader to ask the Minister and the Taoiseach to deal with the problem immediately. Matters have continued to slide in the last five weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>As Whip of my group and a Member of Committee on Procedure and Privileges I am loathe to change the procedures for asking questions in the Seanad.  It is our only way of raising issues&mdash;we do not have Question Time as in the other place, so it is an important part of our Order of Business.  If Ministers have to wait, so be it.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the whistles, but he is in the best position of all; he only uses his whistle once a year at the international rugby match between the Oireachtas and Westminster. If the Progressive Democrats were interested in justice and containing crime, he would lend his whistle to the gardaí.</P>

      <P>I express appreciation to the leader of the IFA, Mr. John Donnelly, for his effective and apparently successful lobbying of the Commission in the interests of the farming community in the absence of effective action by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who does not seem to be know where the Commission is.  It would be helpful to be told where the Minister is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a good idea if the information section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry educated the urban population about the complex problems facing farmers at present.  City dwellers do not know the meaning of the green £ or export subsidies as applied to agriculture.  The Minister should submit to the newspapers easily read and understood accounts of what lies behind these problems.</P>
      <P>I am concerned and disappointed at the decision taken last night at Bushmills by County Antrim Orangemen, as it will have serious repercussions. As these troubles have continued the Orangemen have seen fit to take one disastrous step after another on the marching question. They are now close to bringing about another Drumcree &mdash; a spokesman for the Spirit of Drumcree group said that should it come to that they are willing to face it.  The Orange Order has not yet been taken over by this faction but it might well be.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should recall that the real piece of sand in the oyster is Sinn Féin, particularly its behaviour in infiltrating the concerned citizens' and residents' committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the irritant that results in so many other problems.  Will the Leader ask <Col N="1374" /> the Minister for Foreign Affairs to concentrate as hard as possible on reassuring Unionists about the principle of consent, that there is no hidden agenda behind the principle and that there is no intention to trick the one million Protestants in Northern Ireland into an open-ended united Ireland?  I know this is the situation but it cannot be said often enough because reiterating it will take the weapons away from Sinn Féin, which is the irritant at the heart of the troubles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Naughten's concern over student nurses and members of the nursing profession.  For several years the Mid Western Health Board have sponsored nurses to pursue courses in public health nursing.  There is a huge demand for public health nurses and it is unfortunate that this year the Mid Western Health Board has decided not to sponsor anybody on the public health nursing course because of lack of Finance.  This issue needs urgent attention and discussion and I ask the Leader to seek clarification from the Minister for Health on the matter.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the plight of small dairy farmers.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Agriculture, who appears to be missing, that a sizeable number of small dairy farmers in the west, particularly in Clare, are getting out of the dairy industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Limerick too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The weekly newspapers contained a huge number of clearance sales of dairy herds which is unprecedented and which will create major long-term problems in the dairy industry. A message must be sent to the Minister that urgent action is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the plight of beef and dairy farmers.  Beef farmers have seen a virtual elimination of their income over the past few weeks.  If this happened in any other section of society immediate action would be taken and concern would be expressed from all quarters.  I support Senator Dardis's request for a full debate on the issue in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support statements by my colleagues regarding public health nurses and student nurses who have received their diplomas and wish to undertake a degree course.  A huge vacuum exists and the Department of Education must play a role in the matter.  The Departments of Health and Education seem to be sending out different messages.  The guidance given to students is confused because those advising them do not know what to say to them, whether they can get the maintenance free extension to university, whether there are places, who provides them and who pays the fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like a debate on mildly mentally handicapped children.  This issue has been raised in the House over the past five years.  It concerns children <Col N="1375" /> aged between 14 to 16 who can be brought in and contained within the education system but who, on reaching 16, have nowhere to go.  The system becomes bogged down between the Departments of Health and Education.  Many families are in great distress because they have young children who cannot be contained at home and who cannot get a place in any centre because they are too young for adult centres and too old to be left in school.  This is a huge dilemma for families.  I raised this issue three years ago and am still unable to give solace to families.  We need a full debate and statement on the matter.  There is no point waiting until after the election.  The problem will not go away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome yesterday's decision by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, to remind the North Western Health Board of their duty to provide proper family planning services, including vasectomy services, in the North Western Health Board area.  Fundamentalists should not be able to pressurise politicians and members of the health board to suspend a service which it is a person's civil right to avail of.  This service is very helpful to the poor who would not be able to pay for it elsewhere.  The service has been provided in Derry for the past 30 years without harming the Catholic community there.  When the standing committee of the North Western Health Board meet tomorrow they should have the courage to stand up and say that the service is legal and they will continue to provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of the falling prices in agriculture, I ask the Leader, in any consideration of or debate on falling prices in beef and particularly milk, to get an explanation for the House as to why there is no corresponding fall in price to the consumer.  Milk prices have been low for some time but there has been no change in price to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader give the House any indication as to when he will be taking the remainder of the Universities Bill as there is a very large number of amendments?  I assume that the original date of the 22 and 23 April will be reserved to take these amendments.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Maloney's comments.  It is important that legal medical services are made available to those who in conscience are in a position to avail of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the debate we had in this House on adoption and adoption legislation, can the Leader give us any indication when further legislation will be introduced with the intention of giving people access to information about their backgrounds?  There has been a great deal of additional controversy since the matter was debated in this House.  Over the past few days it has emerged that birth mothers, as well as adopted children, were seeking to make contact with their families.  In some circumstances both <Col N="1376" /> parties wished to make contact but this wish was being frustrated by the agencies involved.  This should not be tolerated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wright raised a number of questions on the Order of Business.  It is proposed that the House sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of next week.  I hope to be a position on the conclusion of the Order of Business to circulate the outline of legislation which we will be taking over the coming weeks to Senator Wright and other group leaders.  The list is a substantial and extensive one.</P>
      <P>I believe there are grounds to be hopeful with regard to the ambulance dispute and, in so far as I have any say in the matter, any developments in Aer Lingus will be debated in this House.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee raised a slightly strange question about the Order of Business being, in some way truncated so as not to inconvenience Ministers.  I agree with Senator Dardis on this occasion; I have no difficulty in inconveniencing Ministers. Having to wait and listen to the Order of Business goes with a ministerial portfolio.  I am a bit puzzled that the request came from the independent Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It came from one independent Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder which, if any, of the Senators will take this vow of verbal continence which would be required by Senator Lee's proposal. I accept his comment in the spirit in which it was made, but to my mind the Order of Business is one of the most important aspects of the business of this House.  Neither my predecessor nor myself have made any attempt to curtail the Order of Business.  Obviously, the ultimate decision rests with our revered Cathaoirleach. The Order of Business is the one occasion on which Members can air their grievances in the absence of a question time.  I do not envisage any change there.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis also spoke about the procedures of the House.  I am conscious that on occasion business will perhaps be taken in a way which was not intended.  As is the custom in this House, I have always attempted to obtain agreement for what we do.  Unlike the other House, there is never an attempt to steamroll issues. Although there is a majority in this House, the guillotine is rarely, if ever, used.  I hope that will continue.  Agreement is at the centre of the way we run our business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to the Minister for Agriculture, Food, and Forestry, and was interested to hear Senator O'Kennedy's comments on him.  Last year the Minister was voted agricultural personality of the year and the person most effective in agriculture by farmers in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal.</i> I am not aware of any other Minister, including Senator O'Kennedy, receiving that accolade from farmers, a group which is not easy to please.  I know <Col N="1377" /> there is a crisis in farming and I cannot think of a person better equipped and with more energy, dynamism and determination to handle it than the present Minister.  I spoke to the Minister who is happy to come to the House, so I will try to arrange a date.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten raised the question of student nurses.  I defer to his superior knowledge on the subject but he and Senator Daly raised interesting and important topics which I will refer to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education.  Senator McAughtry made a lot of sense when spoke about intransigence in Northern Ireland and was even-handed in attributing blame.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde raised an important topic and if she tables a motion, I would be happy to make a few hours available to discuss it.  Senator Maloney made a point with which I agree. Senator Sherlock's point about the failure of consumer prices to fall was noted.  I expect Committee Stage of the Universities Bill, 1996, to continue on 22 and 23 April but I will provide Senator Norris with definite information on that.</P>
    <P>The Adoption (No. 2) Bill is on Committee Stage, although there is a problem in that a court case is pending which centres on the Paraguayan babies.  Until the Supreme Court case is resolved, the Minister believes it would not be wise to complete Committee Stage, but it is a priority.  On the wider question, I am not aware of pending legislation to meet the questions raised.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are consequential on amendment No. 3, which contains the substantive amendments I propose to section 4.  The purpose of section 4 is to replace the present common law powers of arrest without warrant in respect of felonies. This section provides for powers of arrest in respect of arrestable offences.  Under section 4(1) a person may arrest anyone who is or whom he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects to be in the act of committing an arrestable offence. Under section 4 (2) where an arrestable offence has been committed a person may arrest anyone who is or whom he or she reasonably suspects to <Col N="1378" /> be guilty of the offence.  These powers correspond to the existing common law rules that apply in the case of felonies.</P>
      <P>I listened intently to concerns raised in the Dáil that under the current text of section 4 the powers of arrest for private citizens are too broad and could give rise to problems.  While I was not in favour of overloading the section with the elaborate and impractical provisions suggested by some Deputies, I recognised that the increase in the range of offences, for which powers of arrest can be exercised by persons other than the gardaí, could lead to certain problems.  In that context I propose these amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 inserts a new subsection (4) which would limit the non-Garda power of arrest to cases where it is suspected, with reasonable cause, that the person to be arrested will attempt to avoid arrest by the Garda Síochána.  I was not satisfied that it was necessary to introduce a significant modification of a private person's powers of arrest.  Store detectives and other private persons should not be constrained by impractical provisions regarding arrest.  The law guards against wrongful arrest by a private person and the power of arrest on suspicion is only exercisable by a private citizen if an arrestable offence has been committed.  While there is authority in common law for the private person to hand over the arrested person to the Garda as soon as possible, it was prudent to make explicit provision for this.  The new subsection (5) provides that persons who are arrested by a non-garda must be transferred into Garda custody as soon as practicable.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the citizen's powers of arrest, set out in section 4, should not be significantly diluted.  Existing sanctions regarding wrongful arrest on the part of a private person are adequate to ensure these powers will not be used irresponsibly.  However, the amendments to modify these powers, having regard to concerns expressed by Deputies, improve the section.</P>

      <P>I accept the logic of the Minister's amendments.  On Second Stage I queried the concept of the arrestable offence.  Under this Bill an arrestable offence is an offence which carries a term of imprisonment of five years or more. The section essentially provides, therefore, that a citizen's arrest cannot take place for an offence which carries a term of imprisonment that is less than five years.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the law provides for a sentence of five years or more, the offender might only be sentenced to two years by the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the law provides for a term of imprisonment of less than five years there is no arrestable offence provision for a citizen's arrest.  Is that a good idea?  There are several petty but serious crimes which carry a sentence of less that five years where it would be appropriate to provide for a citizen's arrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> I am not aware of the Minister's attitude to zero tolerance.  The British Labour Party, in its general election manifesto, has shown it is prepared to embrace the zero tolerance campaign.  If that policy were adopted in this country it should not be impossible for a citizen to arrest another citizen for an offence which carries a term of imprisonment that is less than five years.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of this legislation is to change the old concept of misdemeanours and felonies into arrestable and non-arrestable offences.  Arrestable offences are those for which the law provides a sentence of five years imprisonment or more.  This does not mean the judge always gives a five year sentence.  The Senator has not given an example of the issue he has in mind. I assume he is not talking about someone being arrested for crossing the white line on the road. Countless arrests would be made if that were the case.  I assume he is referring to drug related issues, car thefts, etc., which would be liable to sentences of five years or more.  The power of arrest for felonies which existed in common law should not be extended for every petty action.  If someone is speeding, it is up to the Garda to apprehend that person and convict them.  Caution is necessary and I am surprised at what the Senator, who is a lawyer, said.  Did he say it to show he is strong on the issue of crime and that he wants to ensure everyone guilty of a crime will be arrested?</P>
      <P>The power of citizen's arrest is seldom used. No one I know has ever made a citizen's arrest. The most common use is by store detectives where someone is suspected of shoplifting.  Usually, the store detective detains the person, gardaí are called and the person handed over to them. It is not a case of someone grabbing a person on the street, taking them back to their home and locking them up for a few days until they call the Garda.  I am putting into this new legislation the common law right of citizen's arrest and installing safeguards to ensure it is not abused and that a citizen inclined to carry out an arrest will be protected. They can face penalties if they arrest someone who has not been involved in an arrestable offence or if it can be shown they arrested the person because they did not like them.  We must be careful not to overplay the extent to which the power of citizen's arrest is used.  It is not used in the way Senator Mulcahy might think.  I am trying to get the tone right in this amendment.  I listened to the debate in the Dáil and I believe the concerns expressed have now been addressed.</P>

      <P>The Minister has struck a fair balance in trying to ensure this area is handled in a proper fashion.  I appreciate Senator Mulcahy's position that it is important people who commit crime are brought to justice as quickly as possible. Citizens play a key role in ensuring the Garda has <Col N="1380" /> information and that evidence is available.  The Bill also extends to the power of arrest to ensure criminals are brought to justice.  However, a distinction must be made between an offence which warrants a citizen's arrest and one which does not.  The Minister had to make a distinction somewhere. She decided on crimes which warranted a sentence of five years or more which is a reasonable balance.  I fully appreciate what Senator Mulcahy said about ensuring citizens are fully involved at all stages in assisting the Garda and the State in bringing criminals to justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with subsection (5).  It is logical that a person arrested by a citizen pursuant to the subsection should be transferred to Garda custody as soon as practicable. That is common sense and should have been in the first draft of the Bill.  Whenever anyone makes a citizen's arrest, for whatever reason, it is the Garda who should process the matter as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I have not trawled through all the offences under subsection (4).  I am not suggesting that there should be a right of citizen's arrest for every petty offence.  Nothing would be more ludicrous than someone arresting an individual for throwing a cigarette packet on the ground or exceeding the speed limit by one mile per hour.  We do not wish to live in a country where everyone behaves like members of the <i>Stasi</i> checking up on fellow citizens and holding themselves up as more righteous than the next person.  However, I hope the Minister is satisfied that there are no moderately serious crimes which still have a term of imprisonment of less than five years which are not covered by this section.  There may be old statutes which have not been updated dealing with matters serious enough to warrant a citizen's arrest.  A through examination should be completed by Report Stage to ensure that there are no loopholes. I have no difficulty with five years being the cut-off point.</P>
      <P>Section 4(4) of amendment No. 3 states that a citizen's arrest &ldquo;may only be affected by a person under subsection (1) or (2) where he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects that the person to be arrested by him or her would otherwise attempt to avoid, or is avoiding, arrest by a member of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;  I presume that the phrase &ldquo;with reasonable cause&rdquo; invokes an objective as opposed to a subjective test on the part of the individual effecting the arrest.  If the arrest is subsequently examined by a court it will be a matter of an objective test as to whether the citizen had reasonable grounds to make the arrest.  It must be an objective test as there are many cranks who could satisfy themselves that they had reasonable cause to effect a citizen's arrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried by the wording of the second part of this subsection which allows an arrest to take place if an individual suspects that the person to be arrested &ldquo;would otherwise attempt to avoid, or is avoiding, arrest by a member of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;  This places a heavy onus on the citizen <Col N="1381" /> effecting the arrest.  It introduces a two stage test for the citizen.  The first stage is that an individual must be satisfied that the person they are about to arrest has committed, or is attempting to commit, an arrestable offence.  The second test is that, on an objective basis, that person is avoiding, or would try to avoid, arrest by a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I accept the first test.  Is the second test essential? Is it placing too high a burden on the average citizen to objectively contemplate whether the person who is allegedly committing an arrestable offence is trying to avoid detection by the Garda?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are reiterating the same powers in relation to felonies which have existed since the foundation of this State.  We are not breaking new ground.  There has always been a power of citizen's arrest for felonies.  This Bill turns some issues which were heretofore listed as misdemeanours into felonies, which carry a sentence of five years or more.  We are upgrading a number of offences which were considered misdemeanours by the old Legislature.  That is as it should be because some serious acts of crime were considered misdemeanours.</P>
      <P>This Bill also corresponds with section 19(1) of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, so we are not breaking new ground.  The phrase &ldquo;with reasonable cause&rdquo; is a well-tested condition and has been subjected to thorough examination in the courts.  I am not concerned about that.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the power of arrest on suspicion is only exercisable by a private citizen if an arrestable offence has been committed, whereby the citizen is immune from a civil action if he arrests the wrong person, provided the arrest is in good faith.  It is important that someone does not go out and arrest people because he or she does not like them.</P>
      <P>Whether or not a mistaken arrest was in good faith, the citizen is liable for damages if the alleged arrestable offence never happened.  Whatever about arresting the right person, the citizen has to be absolutely sure there has been an offence.  It is important in a democracy that a citizen's powers are well protected both from the point of view of the person who might be arrested and that of the citizen who can be liable for damages if they arrest the wrong person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 proposes the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;...otherwise attempt to avoid, or is avoiding, arrest by a member of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo; For example, if a serious incident occur, the gardaí are in the vicinity trying to arrest someone who has just broken into a shop or held someone up at gunpoint and that person tries to escape, it is possible for a citizen to gráb hold of that person and wait for the gardaí to catch them. Without this clause in amendment No. 3, it is possible that someone could say in their defence that they were first arrested by the person who grabbed them as they were trying to escape, not by the gardaí.  Perhaps a good lawyer would contend <Col N="1382" /> that was not a valid arrest.  This amendment protects someone who may assist the gardaá at the committal of a crime.  If someone tries to escape and the gardaí chase them, it is valid for a good citizen to assist the gardaí, which happens occasionally.</P>
    <P>Senators may think this power is suddenly being introduced for the first time and we will see a plethora of such incidences.  This power has existed as long as felonies have been a crime.  It is a little used power.  We are trying to ensure, both for the person who may be arrested unlawfully and for someone who may think they are carrying out a lawful arrest, that safeguards are included in this legislation.  Statute provides for a general power of arrest.  There may be widespread abuse of this provision in the future or some non-arrestable offences carrying sentences of under five years may result in a huge demand for citizen's arrests but it is open to the Legislature to bring in new legislation for that. However, I do not think that will happen.</P>

    <P>6.&mdash;(1)  For the purpose of arresting a person on foot of a warrant of arrest or an order of committal, a member of the Garda Síochána <Col N="1383" /> may enter (if need be, by use of reasonable force) and search any premises (including a dwelling) where the person is or where the member, with reasonable cause, suspects that person to be, and such warrant or order may be executed in accordance with section 5.</P>

      <P>The acceptance of this amendment will involve the deletion of section 6.  Section 6 deals with the Garda's powers of entry and search for the purpose of arresting persons suspected of arrestable offences.  Senators will be aware this provision was the subject of a thorough and constructive debate in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The main concern which has been expressed about section 6 relates to the question of entry into dwellings without a warrant.  The point has been made that the general nature of the provision in the Bill could be open to challenge on constitutional grounds.  There was quite a serious debate on this in the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I listened carefully to the concerns expressed.  It was suggested that dwellings should be completely excluded, but I felt that was unnecessary.  However, since the passage of the Bill through the Dáil and the Second Stage debate in the Seanad &mdash; my colleague, <Col N="1384" /> the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, was present for some of that debate in my place &mdash; I have consulted further with the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>I have concluded it would be better to specify the circumstances under which the Garda could enter a dwelling to effect an arrest, having regard to the constitutional guarantee of the inviolability of the dwelling and the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. While the existing common law as to entry on dwellings to effect an arrest is somewhat complicated and uncertain, the amendment is designed, nevertheless, to ensure the powers the Garda currently enjoys in the case of felonies will be available in respect of arrestable offences and that the principle underlying section 6 &mdash; that of ensuring the Garda has an effective and proportionate power of arrest in these circumstances &mdash; remains intact.</P>
      <P>The amendment provides that for the purpose of arresting a person without a warrant for an arrestable offence, a garda can enter a dwelling to effect an arrest, if need be by use of reasonable force, only in the circumstances specified in the amendment.  An important difference between the amendment and the current text of section 6 is that, other than in the circumstances mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (2), the power of entry will apply only in the suspect's home, that is, where the person ordinarily resides.</P>
      <P>The conditions set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) reflect circumstances of urgency.  The powers of entry in these circumstances would not have to be confined to a dwelling where a suspect ordinarily resides.  These are, first, where a member of the Garda has observed the person within or entering the dwelling; second, where a member, with reasonable cause, suspects that before a warrant of arrest could be obtained the person will either abscond for the purpose of avoiding justice or will obstruct the course of justice; and third, where a member, with reasonable cause, suspects that before a warrant of arrest could be obtained the person would commit an arrestable offence.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that specifying the grounds for entry on dwellings in this way rather than providing for it in a general way, while not in anyway diminishing the principal underlying the section, is a preferable and more certain approach to this difficult area of law.  I know gardaí themselves want to have absolute certainty about their powers in regard to entering a suspect's dwelling house, or that of a suspect's relative, because the Constitution protects one's right to privacy in one's home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Members of this and the other House for the discussion on this section.  We have tightened up the Bill and made it much more effective than the general clause which it previously contained.  The principle has not changed. There will be powers of arrest without warrant for an arrestable offence.  It would be unforgivable if we failed to give the gardaí powers of <Col N="1385" /> arrest of people who commit appalling crimes, leave victims behind and believe they can escape from justice behind their own doors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult and sensitive area because a citizen's dwellinghouse is protected and respected both by the Constitution and tradition.  We must proceed cautiously when allowing the gardaí to enter the dwelling of any citizen without warrant.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this amendment.  Perhaps the Attorney General advised her that section 6 as drafted may have been successfully challenged with regard to its constitutionality.  Has she received advice from him that the section as drafted will now survive such a challenge?</P>
      <P>The amendment does not appear to provide sanction for a garda who acts wrongly.  Unlawful entry into a household is a common law trespass for which the remedy of damages is ordinarily available.  What will be the position if a garda misreads or misunderstands the section and enters a citizen's dwellinghouse in violation of his or her constitutional rights?  The Bill does not provide any penalty in this regard.  Will it again be a matter of common law damages?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister sure the section is constitutional? The power it grants to an official to enter a dwellinghouse should be used sparingly. However, times have changed and criminals, especially hardened, professional criminals, should not be able to use the Constitution to cloak their murderous and dangerous activities. The Constitution is primarily meant to protect good people; it is not meant to protect bad people.  However, the criminal justice system deals with the balance of proof.  The general principle is that it is better that a few criminals should escape justice than that a few innocent people should be wrongly convicted.  That is why there is such a high burden of proof in criminal cases.  The Minister should be as certain as possible that the drafting of this section will not lead to abuse of this power.  It would be undesirable if the section was used in situations that did not merit its application or if it was abused by a small minority of those involved in law enforcement.</P>
      <P>We have a long tradition of the inviolability of the dwellinghouse.  Where we move to reduce it we must do so sparingly.  It has been done under the Road Traffic Act, 1996, which provides that where a suspected intoxicated driver flees to his or her house to seek protection, the gardaí have lawful authority to enter within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse to effect an arrest.  However, this section does not equate with that provision, which is very specific.  While I have no difficulty supporting the section, in principle, to ensure that hardened and professional criminals cannot escape justice, I hope the Minister is satisfied from the legal advice she has received that the section will not lend itself to possible abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment; it links to our previous discussion on the powers of arrest.  It is important that the gardaí have all means available to them to ensure that criminals are brought to justice.  However, it is important that the rights of innocent people are protected, including the right to live peacefully in their homes.</P>
      <P>We must have confidence that the gardaí will use their powers not only to the letter but to the spirit of the law.  We must also ensure that hardened, professional criminals do not misuse the situation to escape justice.  Under no circumstances should a dwelling be used as a shield to abscond for the purpose of avoiding justice or to obstruct the course of justice.  The Minister has endeavoured, within the Constitution, to ensure that the necessary powers are given to the gardaí while protecting the right to privacy in one's home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution provides that the dwelling place is inviolable, save in accordance with the law and we are providing the circumstances in which the constitutional right to inviolability is changed in accordance with the law.  The existing common law regarding entry to effect an arrest is complicated and uncertain.  Senator Mulcahy is right to be concerned about this matter. The law was so uncertain that this area always came into question in the terms of whether the Garda can enter a person's home or somebody else's home to arrest that person with a warrant. The Bill provides an opportunity to tighten this area and ensure that protection exists for people's homes and the Garda.  At present it depends on whether the offence is a felony and on certain surrounding circumstances.  The power of entry is much in need of clarification because this area is unclear.</P>
      <P>I assure the Senator, in so far as it is humanly possible for me and the Attorney General as mere fallible, mortal beings &mdash; although I do not diminish his great powers&mdash;to provide, that the legislation was drafted to the best of our ability to ensure it met the constitutional requirements. It would be unheard of for an Attorney General and his office to sign off legislation knowing that it was unconstitutional.  I assure the Senator that, in so far as it was humanly possible for myself and the Attorney General, the legislation meets the constitutional requirements.  However, this does not mean somebody will not challenge it in the future or that a court will not find something wrong with it.  I cannot guarantee that will not be the case but I am as certain as I can be at present that it will not happen.  The Senator as a lawyer is aware that many things are challenged because somebody decides that is what they want to do as a delaying tactic or for valid reasons.  In so far as we can provide that the Bill is constitutional, we have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator asked what will happen if a member of the Garda Síochána gets it wrong.  The section covers cases where a person is arrested on foot of a warrant and also cases where a garda <Col N="1387" /> does not have a warrant.  However, the power does not extend to private citizens arresting somebody.  They are not allowed enter a dwelling house unless they are accompanied by a garda.  A private citizen must obtain the assistance of a garda if he is not in a position to carry out an arrest within his powers under this section without entering the place in question.  If a person must get a garda, he or she rather than the private citizen can arrest the individual involved.</P>
    <P>If a garda in good faith gets it wrong, no fault exists.  If in the course of a trial proof emerges that the garda did it for malicious reasons, he or she may, like anybody else, have to pay damages and the case may be thrown out because of his or her mistake.  I do not envisage that a garda would knowingly and wrongly enter a dwelling to make an arrest.  It is probably fine if he or she has a warrant, but if they enter a dwelling for an arrestable offence without a warrant they must be certain they are acting properly.  If it was found that they did not act properly, the garda would be subject to the usual disciplinary procedures and common law damages.  In addition, they would have to explain their actions to the court.  There are plenty of opportunities for redress if a garda does something wrong.  The Garda Síochána disciplinary code also exists in that regard.  I am as confident as I can be that the provision is correctly worded and constitutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand part of the Minister's reply.  She said that if a garda in good faith gets it wrong, there will be no remedy against him or her.  However, if a garda makes a bona fide mistake and enters a premises without meeting the section's requirements, there should be a remedy because the section transgresses an established constitutional principle and right. Accordingly, a garda who gets it wrong, innocently or otherwise, should be sanctioned because it is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the structure of paragraphs (a) to (d) in the amendment because the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is used between each paragraph.  Paragraph (a) states that a member of the Garda Síochána shall not, unless acting with consent, enter a dwelling unless &ldquo;he or she or another such member has observed the person within or entering the dwelling, or&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>I support that principle but the first onus on gardaí in all cases should be, if possible and practical, to obtain a warrant for arrest.  By including <Col N="1388" /> the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; before paragraph (b), it appears it is not essential.  The Minister will agree that, as a general principle, it is much more satisfactory if a warrant can be obtained in the first place in all cases without affecting the administration of justice or enabling a person to abscond.  That would be a much more healthy and constitutional position. I would prefer if compliance with paragraph (b) was essential before somebody could enter a person's dwelling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>I am confused by Senator Mulcahy's point.  The Bill enshrines in law something which already exists but is unclear.  I would not have introduced the Bill unless it was evident that some people escape conviction of serious crimes by hiding behind the inviolability of their residences. Sadly, we have reached the stage where we must make our laws appropriate to what is happening today.</P>
      <P>Perhaps my confusion arises from some of Senator Mulcahy's earlier comments about zero tolerance.  Everybody favours zero crime, drug abuse, speeding on the roads and over drinking. However, the Senator cannot have it both ways. Does he want the law to give the Garda the power to stop the small number of criminals who know the law probably better than most and use it to escape justice?  The Bill covers certain circumstances and we must be practical.  The Senator said he would prefer that compliance with paragraph (b) was necessary before the use of paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) was considered. However, a garda who is chasing somebody who has just held up a bank or committed murder and fled into their house, or somebody else's residence, may not have time to stop and seek a warrant. I agree with the Senator that it would be better if there was time for a warrant, but that is not always the case.  If a garda is chasing someone with a gun into a house, he may feel that if he stops at the door of a house and goes back to the station for a warrant, the person might abscond from the house or hold someone hostage with the gun.  The Garda should have the power to follow the person into that house and prevent him or her from obstructing the course of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person is observed entering the dwelling, having been followed from the scene of a crime, it is also right that Garda should have the power to go in.  They should have that power if they suspect that before the arrest warrant could be obtained, a person could commit an arrestable offence, perhaps a second one after committing an offence already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dealing with people's dwellings one can get very virtuous and say the dwelling is absolutely sacrosanct.  That does not hold water.  If a man is beating his wife in his house, there has to be a way in which some sanction can be brought against him so that crime can be stopped.  Beating a woman, inside or outside a house, is a crime. <Col N="1389" /> Some of the virtuousness we have when the word &ldquo;constitutional&rdquo; is used will have to be cast aside, as life is tough.  I am satisfied that the &ldquo;or&rdquo; is correct and that these are four reasons why the Garda might have the right to go into a dwelling.</P>
    <P>The Garda may do something wrong under section 6, although I hope not.  They may come upon three or four people fleeing a crime scene and might follow one person to a house who might have run because he or she did not want to get caught for something else.  The Garda might arrest that person when others committed the crime.  It could happen, but should be seen as happening in good faith.  If the matter did not arise in good faith, the normal recourse to legal action for damages would apply.  A case of mistaken identity seems to have occurred in the last 24 hours, for example, but I do not have all the details so I will not comment on it.  There is no reason to make a specific provision in the Bill for covering a mistake as that will automatically happen if it is proven that someone has made a mistake. The person affected would have the right to claim damages.</P>

      <P>Let us return to the Minister's example of someone committing a robbery and returning to their house.  I have no problem with (b) as it applies to that situation and the case of a garda who has not time to get a warrant or who is fearful the person may abscond or obstruct justice.  I support that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  In that case there is no urgency or danger of the person absconding or obstructing the course of justice.  I suspect that most people would agree that in such a case a garda would still have to go through the process of getting a warrant when there is no urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Revenue offences are arrestable offences.  Can the Garda now enter a dwelling without a search warrant, where there is no <Col N="1390" /> urgency or fear of absconding or the obstruction of justice, when a search warrant could be obtained?  I do not support that.  I support (b), where there is urgency, but do we want gardaí arriving at doors without warrants in circumstances where a warrant could be obtained?  That is why it would be more appropriate if there was an onus in non-urgent situations to obtain a warrant. Gardaí could get lazy.  It is easier to arrest someone without a warrant than to get a warrant for that arrest.</P>
    <P>I support the rolling back of constitutional protection of the dwelling for the reasons given by the Minister.  However, I have a difficulty with trampling on the Constitution when it is not necessary and (d) is not necessary.  It should be fully explained why we are to allow arrest without warrant in non-urgent situations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The amended provision is much narrower than was the case with the original Bill because some of Senator Mulcahy's concerns were raised.  Paragraph (d) is based on common law powers that exist for felonies.  We have not broken any new ground here to allow for entry into a dwelling where a person ordinarily resides. The circumstances in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) cover the matter of urgency.  Obviously, where possible, the Garda will get an arrest warrant as they do now.  However, there will be times when a warrant is inappropriate, such as those covered by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).</P>
      <P>Paragraph (d) is qualified by subsection (2), which states:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of arresting a person ... a member of the Garda Síochána may enter ... and search any premises ... where that person is or where the member, with reasonable cause, suspects that person to be ...</P>
      <P>The garda must suspect that the person has taken part in an arrestable offence.  It is not the case that a garda can decide to enter a house and arrest someone.  He or she must know or have reasonable suspicion that the person has committed an offence.  The power is reasonably wide but the section is much tighter than it was in the original Bill.  This is already allowed under common law and we are now putting it into legislative form.  The Senator is right to be concerned that we do not go too far but this is an appropriate measure in today's Ireland.  I do not believe it will be abused and I doubt the gardaí will often use paragraph (d).  The main reason they would arrest someone without a warrant would be a suspicion that the person would try to obstruct the course of justice.  If they observe in a house a person wanted for an arrestable offence they can use this power, which protects the gardaí as well as people in their dwelling.  I will not amend the provision, if that is what the Senator wants, because I am satisfied this is allowable under common law.  I am now providing more protection by including it in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I respect the Minister's remarks but she has not convinced me.  I have no problem with paragraphs (a) to (c) because they pertain to urgent cases.  It is implicit in the Minister's last intervention that she accepts and wishes to underpin the principle that, in non-urgent cases, a member of the Garda Síochána will be allowed by statute, not common law, to enter the dwelling of a citizen and arrest him without warrant.

      <P>They may by common law but we are trying to devise good law.  We should make the distinction between urgent and non-urgent cases and, in the latter case, it is nonsensical that a garda should not have to obtain an arrest warrant before entering a dwelling.  If a person robs a bank or commits a mugging and enters a house the gardaí should have the power to arrest without warrant, but if a person commits, for example, a Revenue offence or breaches company law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a garda knows where he normally resides, is it right that the garda need not get a search warrant but may short circuit the system and arrest him even though he is in his dwelling?  The Minister can give no logically compelling reason for allowing a garda, in non-urgent cases, to enter a person's dwelling and arrest him. I cannot support a rolling-back of the constitutional protection of the dwelling in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister accepts my position.  I support paragraphs (a) to (c) and accept that the constitutional provision of inviolability of one's dwelling should be amended to deal with urgent circumstances, for example where a person may abscond or obstruct the course of justice.  I predict that this section will be challenged in the courts because it is wrong.</P>
      <P>As the Minister says, this is in the common law but we do not have to follow blindly where that leads.  Common law is made by judges and courts. Our job is to make the statute law good as we see it.  I uphold the general principle that, where there is no significant difference or risk to the administration of justice, the onus should be on the gardaí in the first instance to obtain a search warrant to enter a citizen's dwelling; and if one is to allow that, there should be compelling and urgent reasons.  The Minister has failed intellectually to convince that a garda should not ordinarily obtain a search warrant to enter a citizen's dwelling.  For that reason I must consider opposing the section and perhaps putting down an amendment on Report Stage.  I ask her to consider the matter before we proceed further.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Senator Mulcahy is trying to do.  His party colleagues in the other House were not as concerned as he seems to be to diminish existing powers.  Where stands the zero tolerance policy?  This is quite extraordinary &mdash; the Senator wants the power to exist but he also wants to portray himself as a mighty intellectual giant by opposing this provision.  Gardaí are currently allowed to enter a place where a person ordinarily resides and I do not believe it would be a good day's work to diminish that power.  I have included in this Bill areas where it may be urgent, practical and desirable that the gardaí obtain a warrant for an arrest and that is what happens.  Nonetheless there are occasions they need legal protection to arrest someone without a warrant.  If Senator Mulcahy is saying it is Fianna Fáil policy to erode the powers already available to rid this society of criminals who hide behind certain provisions of the Constitution and who think they can hire a clever lawyer to argue their rights are being infringed, I for one am on the side of their victims.  I urge him to think again about opposing something which has existed for years &mdash; all we are doing is putting it into legislative form.</P>
      <P>I like to think my intellectual capacity is not far below his but I am humble enough to accept that it might be.  I do not follow his logic.  This provision exists in common law and we are including it in the Bill.  I do not know what his party colleagues will think about him trying to diminish the powers of the Garda, which exist to protect law abiding citizens.  His remarks conflict with statements made by Fianna Fáil in recent weeks. However, I will not question the intellectual capacity of the Senator, which is obviously superior to my own.  I do not understand the logic of what the Senator is saying.  This amendment deals with arresting a person whom the Garda suspect, within reason, of having committed an arrestable offence.  This concerns major offences such as major robberies, burglaries, rape, murder, mayhem and sexual assault.  Is the Senator asking me to turn back the clock by diminishing the power of the Garda to follow people suspected of committing such crimes?  It would be a bad day's work to do this and I hope the Seanad would not support such a move.</P>

      <P>I agree with section 6(2) (a), (b) and (c) of the amendment.  However, this section does not embody the philosophy outlined by the Minister that &ldquo;it would be more desirable that the gardaí get a warrant for arrest&rdquo;.  The Minister also used the word &ldquo;preferable&rdquo;.  However, under this section the garda has a choice.  There is nothing which says it would be preferable for a garda to get a warrant in non-urgent situations where there was no obstruction and no fear of the person absconding.  When there is no obstruction of the course of justice and no danger of a person absconding, the Garda should seek a warrant. The new section gives <i>carte blanche</i> to the Garda to choose between (a), (b), (c) and (d) at their own discretion.  This conflicts with the Minister's philosophy as stated in her last intervention that &ldquo;it would be more desirable that the gardaí get a warrant for arrest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot give an assurance, and will not try to give an assurance, that (d) will not be abused or that certain members of the Garda will not try to short circuit the system by using (d) rather than (a), (b) or (c).  I am not trying to turn back the clock.</P>

Unless the type of situation envisaged under section 6 (2) (b) or (c) arises, there should be an onus on a garda to get a warrant for the arrest of the person concerned.

Section 6 (2) (b) and (c) are well drafted and set out situations where it would be expeditious for a garda to arrest without warrant. We are as anxious as the Minister to assist in the fight against crime and that is the reason we consented to rolling back the constitutional protection.

      <P>The Senator's amendment seeks to refine the paragraphs set out in the section 6 to circumstances of urgency only, that is, circumstances dealt with in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the new section. He has done so by making paragraph (d) conditional on paragraphs (b) or (c).  While existing common law on entry into dwellings to effect an arrest is somewhat complicated and uncertain, the amendment, including paragraph (d), is designed to ensure the powers the Garda currently enjoy in the case of felonies will be available in the case of arrestable offences.  I am putting into law what the Garda already has by way of powers.  The principle underlying section 6, that is, ensuring the Garda has an effective and proportionate power of arrest in these circumstances, remains intact.</P>
      <P>I am putting into law what has heretofore been in common law and which has been backed by the courts.  The courts made it clear that it is necessary for the Garda to enter a person's dwelling without a warrant to carry out an arrest.  I am not putting anything new into law but something which has been common law.</P>
      <P>I consulted with the Attorney General, the Garda and others on this section.  I am satisfied this provision is proportionate, necessary and balanced. It would be a serious retrograde step to roll back existing powers of the Garda.  It is incomprehensible for a Fianna Fáil Senator to suggest removing a power from the Garda to arrest somebody suspected of being involved in a crime serious enough to warrant a five to 15 year sentence.  It is difficult to understand the reason Senator Mulcahy tabled such an amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy said I did not explain my proposal, but he has not explained to me or Senators on this side of the House what he is doing in trying to diminish the powers of the Garda.  Unfortunately, we reached a stage where we had to change our drug trafficking laws to give the Garda extra powers because people coming from other jurisdictions needed to be questioned for more than 24 or 48 hours and to increase the powers of the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act to deal with serious offenders.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong for Senators and me, as Minister, to accept a diminution in the powers of the Garda.  I urge Senator Mulcahy to think carefully before calling a vote on this amendment and leaving himself open to criticism that one half of Fianna Fáil do not understand what the other half said.  I urge the Senator not to press his amendment.  I hope he is satisfied that I am putting into law a power available to the Garda and which the courts have backed.  I hope the advice of the Attorney General, the courts and that which I have given as Minister will bring greater pressure to bear on Senator Mulcahy than his own thoughts.</P>

      <P>I object to any diminution in the powers of the Garda at a time when citizens are concerned about the level of crime and when the Minister is increasing the powers of the Garda to try to tackle crime.  We should not roll back the powers of the Garda in fighting crime and arresting people who have committed crimes.  It would be a retrograde step to decrease the power of the Garda to fight crime and to arrest people who have committed crime.  The Seanad should not accept a measure which would decrease that power. Indeed, it should seriously examine the possibility of giving the Garda more powers to fight crime and to ensure our citizens are protected.</P>

They should not be used on a day to day basis because there is constitutional protection of a person's dwelling. We are not opposing the power but we are seeking to provide that it be used sparingly and only in limited cases.  If the Minister cannot understand that point there is a problem in how she and I use language.  The Garda should have the power where the person ordinarily resides in that dwelling but only where either paragraph (b) or (c) arises.  We will press the amendment.</P>

The latter was passed when the Senator's party was in Government in a happy union that did not last with the Progressive Democrats.  The Senator is wrong to say I am doing something revolutionary.  I am not.  I am giving a statutory basis to the powers the Garda currently have.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 32, after &ldquo;made&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, after consultation with the existing governing bodies of the universities referred to in section 4,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment relates to the consultation which should take place before the Bill comes into effect.  A similar amendment was tabled in the Dáil by Deputy Keogh.  Such consultation would be consistent with the Minister's remarks and the spirit in which the Bill has been brought forward.</P>

      <P>Is it normal to have this kind of consultation?  Once the Bill is passed by the Oireachtas the universities will be aware that it will come into effect within a certain period. Whatever about giving advance notice, consultation would be awkward and unnecessary at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not tabled specific ministerial amendments to the Bill.  Given the direct representation of the universities in this House it is important that we debate this issue carefully as happened on Second Stage.  I am willing to consider the issues as they arise.  The Oireachtas and the universities are committed to producing a balanced Bill.  Those institutions would welcome the enactment of the Bill in this session as it would prepare them for the next millennium.</P>
      <P>Section 2 allows flexibility.  This amendment calls for consultations with the universities before the Minister makes an order providing for the commencement of the Bill.  I do not support this. Having enacted a Bill, it would be inappropriate for the Oireachtas to depend on consultations with other bodies before effect could be given to its will.  For example, the next meeting of a governing body may be in February.  This could lead to uncertainty and litigation if we started defining who and what should be included in the consultative process.  This would not be in the best interests of the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are ensuring that the universities are ready to implement the provisions of the Bill and contacts will continue between the Minister, the <Col N="1400" /> Department and the universities.  However, the will of the Oireachtas that this Bill should pass must supersede any need to reopen consultations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing in amendments Nos. 1 or 2 would subvert the Bill.  Neither amendment intends to subvert the will of the Oireachtas. There has been a long process of consultation and this is a matter of courtesy.  I do not wish to make an issue of this but this amendment does not diminish the Bill.  The opposite is the case &mdash; it would be of considerable assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  I understand the Minister's point that the will of the Oireachtas should remain supreme.  However, this is not lessened by including consultation.  It does not give a veto to the universities but it will ensure that the Bill is enacted in consultation with them.  This is a matter of courtesy.</P>
      <P>However, this is not sufficiently significant to delay the House.  We should not force this to a vote but that is a matter for Senator Dardis.  I am certain of the Minister's good intentions and I would prefer to progress to the more substantial sections so that the Bill can pass as rapidly as possible.  It will be necessary to amend it in this House and I hope this can be done efficiently and quickly and in a spirit of good humour.  The amended Bill will then be enacted.  It would be a pity of it was delayed too long and fell as a result. We should not give any party an excuse to ensure the Bill is not enacted.  It is our duty to amend it in those areas we are concerned about and then pass it into law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think implementing a consultation process would prevent the enactment of the legislation or stymie it going through the Houses.  There should be openness in relation to any changes to the governing body before or after this legislation is enacted.  The universities feel they are part of the process.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis and Senator Norris that this Bill should pass in amended form as rapidly as possible.  There will be no vexatious procrastination on my part on any of the issues arising.  There are principles still to be resolved as well as matters of practical implementation towards which this House may have some contribution to make.</P>
      <P>I hope that in co-operation with the Minister &mdash; and we will hold her to her word about being anxious to co-operate &mdash; we pass this Bill as quickly as possible in the confidence that it is the best Bill possible at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On consultation it would be a matter of courtesy if there was a phraseology which indicated it would not simply be a decree.  It is not a matter I would want to see pushed to a vote.  There have been reservations expressed on this and other Bills about the substance of the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;. I dislike seeing it used in a way which might be regarded as the equivalent of a courtesy. <Col N="1401" /> Consultation should mean that.  Once the Bill becomes law, I do not see why the Minister should be obliged to engage in real consultation. From that point of view, I hesitate about pressing this further.</P>

      <P>I cannot guarantee that all this discussion will be good humoured but we will try.  The wording of the amendments impose a timescale on the introduction of this legislation. Senator Dardis' amendment states &ldquo;after consultation with the existing governing bodies of the universities referred to...&rdquo;  This applies to at least seven universities.  Senator Ormonde's amendment states &ldquo;&ldquo;Any such order or orders shall be made by the Minister only after consultation with the existing governing authorities, boards or bodies of the universities cited in section 4.&rdquo;.  I am not accepting these amendments because once this Bill is enacted, we have expressed our intention to introduce the legislation. I ask that this be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dublin Institute of Technology&rsquo; means the Institute established by Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These related amendments cover the Dublin Institute of Technology.  If one amendment is accepted, the related amendments must also be accepted.  The Dublin Institute of Technology must be incorporated into this Bill.  It is a fine institution which covers a large number of colleges and has 25,000 students.  It is a degree awarding institution which does ongoing postgraduate work.  The report of the international review team suggested the legislation should be broadened to incorporate the Dublin Institute of Technology into the framework of this Bill.  The White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> also stated that the Dublin Institute of Technology should be included in the Bill and funding should be brought under the HEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> The Dublin Institute of Technology is the largest third level institution in the country.  I worked there before I decided to follow a different route. There is a fine body of people working there.  It has a good record, a well thought through curriculum and the courses are well researched.  It has all the ingredients to be part of the university framework.  This should be done now rather than later.  I do not see why we should have to wait until the next millennium to amend this legislation. We should do it now so that at the appropriate time it will be easy to implement it.</P>
    <P>I support the widening of this Bill and the inclusion of the Dublin Institute of Technology in the university framework.  I will oppose this section if this is not done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments the intention of which is to confer university status on the Dublin Institute of Technology.  We gave some of the reasons for that on Second Stage. The fundamental point is that academically and functionally, the Dublin Institute of Technology fulfils the criteria required of a university in every respect.  If this is so, it seems to be eminently sensible that it should join the University of Limerick and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  I do not see any qualitative difference between the Dublin Institute of Technology and those other august bodies of learning.</P>
      <P>The colleges within the Dublin Institute of Technology &mdash; which are now faculties within the institute &mdash; have a very distinguished history and go back for over a century.  The school of architecture in Bolton Street is internationally regarded as one of the premier schools of architecture in these islands.  Cathal Brugha Street has a very distinguished history in its area.  I cannot think of any coherent argument why the institute should not be included in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Degree awarding status is not the same as being a university.  There are plenty of places of learning which are not universities where degrees are awarded by a variety of bodies.  The international review team's report stated that &ldquo;the relevant authorities should consider whether the key features of the proposed legislation should be extended to the Dublin Institute of Technology and its legislation amended in the light of such analysis&rdquo;.  There is a degree of support across the international spectrum which accepts the Dublin Institute of Technology is a university in everything but name.  If that is the case, it is perfectly sensible to include it now rather than having to amend the Bill at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taking eight amendments together but I propose to concentrate on the one which I tabled.  I am flattered that my colleagues also chose to concentrate on that one, which suggests we have all decided it is the most significant. Some of the ancillary amendments propose details and flourishes which are consequent upon a decision to create a university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> We are all anxious to have the best possible legislation.  It should not come down to a battle between the Minister and the House.  We want to be co-operative.  As I said earlier, the other side of that is that we should not get into a situation where the Government does not want to lose face by being made to do something &mdash; the sense of which it eventually acknowledges itself &mdash; by a vote of the Oireachtas.  A vote should not be seen as a confrontational issue.  I will press this amendment unless I hear something very solid, clear, convincing and tangible from the Minister which will persuade me not to.  Of course, other Members can also call a vote on this amendment.</P>
    <P>Most of the arguments have already been made here and on Second Stage.  It is clear the Dublin Institute of Technology has achieved the intellectual status of a university.  We are looking for the recognition in law of something which is nationally and internationally recognised.  My colleague, Senator Dardis, quoted, as I had intended doing, from the international review, which makes it quite clear the Dublin Institute of Technology has achieved that status.</P>
    <P>The University of Dublin has been the conferring body for the degrees of Dublin Institute of Technology graduates for years.  As a former employee of the University of Dublin, which is, as are the other universities, a very fine university &mdash; we can be proud of the university tradition in this country &mdash; my attitude is that if it is prepared to stand over the academic standards of the Dublin Institute of Technology and award it degrees over a significant period of years, coupled with the belief of international bodies charged with the monitoring of the development of third level institutions that the Dublin Institute of Technology has arrived at a position where it should be recognised as a university, it is time we, as legislators, took on board and acted on those recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am slightly saddened by the fact that this represents a kind of separation of the University of Dublin and the Dublin Institute of Technology. When I began to examine this issue I thought the most appropriate solution would be to fulfil, after 400 years, the original intentions of her gracious majesty, Queen Elizabeth I, of establishing a University of Dublin with several constituent colleges, and that the Dublin Institute of Technology might be happy to be a college within the University of Dublin with a sister college called Trinity College, Dublin.  Apparently, this is not the wish of either body, although there are no feelings of difficulty or awkwardness between them.  Having ironed out that hesitation, I can see no reason for not accepting this amendment.</P>
    <P>It might be a matter of timing.  However, unless I hear something very convincing to the contrary, it seems to me that this legislation is the appropriate place to make this move.  I look forward to a positive answer from the Minister.</P>
    <P>People might be made to hesitate by the thought that if this amendment is included the <Col N="1404" /> Bill might fall, due to the parliamentary scheduling and the looming election.  I do not believe that; it is not beyond the capacity of the Government managers of business to ensure this does not happen.  In any case, some amendments will have to be accepted for technical legal reasons.  Therefore, the objection that inserting any amendments at this stage will ensure the collapse of the Bill has no validity.  We have been threatened with that in this House before, which seems an unwarrantable intrusion into the authority of the Seanad.  We are charged with and paid for the review and amendment of legislation.  If the Government orders its business in such a way that it is incapable of securing the passage of a Bill if this House lives up to its responsibility, that is a problem for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Norris pointed out, at present students of the Dublin Institute of Technology obtain their degrees from Dublin University. It must dearly desire to be a university if it is prepared to give up that privilege, so one must take its wishes very seriously.  The timing might be a difficulty.  It is important to point out that Senators Norris and Dardis are quite right in saying that becoming a degree awarding authority is not the same as becoming a university.  It was pointed out on Second Stage that while there are many degree awarding institutes in Dublin, a university is a totally different legal entity.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister addresses this issue in a sensible manner.  The fact that Dublin University has guaranteed the academic prowess of the Dublin Institute of Technology is very strong evidence of the fact that its courses, degrees and postgraduate work are held in very high esteem internationally. I hope to see it develop as a different kind of university.  Senator Norris said that he had thought the wishes of Queen Elizabeth I could be fulfilled by instituting another college of Dublin University.  When I began discussions with the Dublin Institute of Technology I pointed out that the French polytechnics take great pride in their different role within France.  I thought it might consider having a similar role in Ireland, but that is not its wish.</P>
      <P>We know from the <i>imprimatur</i> given to the Dublin Institute of Technology by Dublin University, and the investigation by the international body, that it is worthy of being given degree awarding and university status.  That would make it totally autonomous rather than having to constantly revert to the Minister for basic decisions regarding the employment of clerical staff.  I feel very strongly about this amendment and I look forward to hearing the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept many of the points which have been made on amendment No. 3.  The majority of people accept the Dublin Institute of Technology is a fine institution with an excellent reputation.  However, it might be somewhat presumptuous to imply that we accept the Dublin Institute of Technology should be given university <Col N="1405" /> status today.  Section 9 makes provision for the establishment of additional universities. Section 9(1) provides that the Government may appoint a body the membership of which will include international educational experts and such employees of universities to which the Bill applies to advise the Government on whether an educational institution should be established as a university.  This subsection is very important and, as from today, it should be adhered to with regard to the promotion of institutions.</P>
      <P>There was a recent misunderstanding regarding the upgrading of a third level institution to the effect that a political decision could be made. This is not the case.  If the House decided that the Dublin Institute of Technology was to be included under the terms of the Bill there would be a presumption that, in our view, it qualifies as a university.  However, in this instance our view is superfluous.  The issue must be examined by a body using the proper academic criteria.  While we could forecast the advice of the body, we should await it.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, section 9 covers what everybody seeks to be included.  I hope, therefore, that amendment No. 3 will not be pressed. It will take a simple amendment to this legislation if and when the Dublin Institute of Technology becomes a university.  This will provide Members of this House and the other House with a further opportunity to consider the operation of the universities legislation and perhaps make amendments.</P>

      <P>This issue was raised on Second Stage when it was pointed out that there is a need for due recognition of the work of the Dublin Institute of Technology and to grant it the status it deserves.  The amendments in our names indicate our view of the best way forward to ensure that the institution gets due control over its destiny and all that goes with that.  We are committed to them unless another course of action is indicated.</P>
      <P>We are aware of ongoing talks between the Department and the colleges.  Any results from these talks must have a legislative basis.  What is the Minister's position on this issue?  We appear to be approaching it from different points of view. There is a need for clarity.</P>

      <P>Individual colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology have rendered an indispensable service, in many cases for over a century.  This debate is very important, both for the Dublin Institute of Technology and other institutions.  We are now advised that degree awarding is not a defining mark of a university and the University of Dublin and the Dublin Institute of Technology do not wish to constitute a single university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Minister's understanding of the criteria that constitute a university?  Her reply will be influential in determining my attitude on this. This is an important question not only for the <Col N="1406" /> Dublin Institute of Technology but this House, the country and any other institutions which may have legitimate university aspirations and may need to know how to set about fulfilling the criteria.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I indicated that, for the first time, a mechanism was included in section 9 for the recognition of a third level institution as a university.  I envisage that it will be used following applications.</P>
      <P>The discussion on the Dublin Institute of Technology raised awareness, including those in and outside the different interest groups concerned about the development of third level education. The matter was raised in the White Paper.  A university does not have to resemble the oldest or the newest.</P>
      <P>With regard to the criteria to be used for the establishment of a university, the international review committee made a number of recommendations in its report.  I established the review group and asked it to look at the status of the Dublin Institute of Technology which was seeking to grant its own degrees.  The model we used to decide on degree awarding status was derived from the group which contained national and international opinion and expertise.</P>
      <P>I presume we had the Dublin Institute of Technology in mind when considering how an institution may become a university under section 9. The review group was asked to consider the future of Dublin Institute of Technology and recommended that it be granted authority to award its own degrees for its undergraduates with effect from the academic year 1998-9.  I have accepted this recommendation and have indicated that we will prepare the necessary order.</P>
      <P>The review group also recommended that the funding and oversight of the Dublin Institute of Technology be transferred from the Department to the Higher Education Authority as soon as possible.  That will entail amending the Higher Education Authority legislation and I have signalled my intention to introduce legislation which will bring the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical college sectors under the aegis of a reconstituted HEA.  This was indicated in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The relevant authorities were asked to consider whether the key features of the university legislation should be extended to the Dublin Institute of Technology and its legislation be amended in the light of such an analysis.  This was not a recommendation for university status but a request for an analysis of the criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group also referred to a system of quality assurance and recommended that the institute should be subject to periodic review.  The institute and the Department have been in close contact about the mechanisms and the review group's proposals to ensure that can happen.  The review group recommended that the Dublin Institute of Technology should ensure that its organisational structures and processes are firmly <Col N="1407" /> in place and operating effectively.  Progress on this recommendation is being made by the Department and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>The process was detailed and time consuming. Some of the group's recommendations were taken on board and the Department indicated that others are acceptable.  These will be considered during the analysis of the universities legislation.  Given the recommendation of the group, it was appropriate to include a statutory mechanism in section 9 which will allow this institution and others to seek university status. However, I cannot answer Senator Lee's query about the criteria which will be set down.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the case made by the institution for inclusion in the Bill.  I have its interests at heart and I can give the House chapter and verse about investments and developments there.  Its arguments were cogently made but, following the enactment of the Bill, there will be a mechanism under which I can respond in a measured way.  Senator Norris raised a solemn, clear, convincing and tangible case but it is up to him to decide whether that is sufficient.  That is the Senator's prerogative.  I was careful not to mention time limits but I will make myself available for dialogue with the Senator.  However, the Dublin Institute of Technology will welcome this move today.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Bill, I will immediately request the Government to appoint a body pursuant to section 9 to advise it on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university, the Dublin Institute of Technology should be established as a university.  This will be the practical outcome of section 9 for the institution which was subject to a favourable review by an international body.  However, it is necessary to put in place a mechanism to establish the criteria.  This will allow the Dublin Institute of Technology to seek establishment as a university.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to accept the amendments and my reply was lengthy because this is a most important area.  I listened carefully to the debate and I quoted the recommendations of the international review group.  I undertake to request the Government to appoint a body following the enactment of the Bill with regard to the statutory mechanism in section 9 and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  This move will be welcomed.</P>

      <P>I have great difficulty with the Minister's response.  She had plenty of time to draw conclusions before this debate commenced. For example, Senator Lee asked her to define a university.  The Minister granted degree awarding status to the Dublin Institute of Technology and she should give it university status.  If it has degree awarding status, the Minister should go the whole way and call it a university.  It cannot have degree awarding status without some recognition of that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> The Minister intends to establish another body to decide whether it should be called a university. I do not accept that proposal because it has not been fully thought out.  The Minister is introducing legislation to transfer funding to the Higher Education Authority and she gave the Dublin Institute of Technology degree awarding status. She also introduced section 9 to deal with this matter.  However, these moves point to doubts in this area.  The provision has not been fully thought out.  Unless a decision is made now to give the Dublin Institute of Technology university status, it will be put on the long finger.  The Minister said the Dublin Institute of Technology will have independent degree awarding status in the 1998 academic year.  If that is the case, it should have full university status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has shown movement but I am not sure it is sufficient.  It appears that, immediately following the passage of the Bill, she will establish a mechanism which will allow the Dublin Institute of Technology to make an application to become a university.  Could I tease the Minister into a more advanced position?  The Minister is recommending a mechanism but I am not sure from her comments that she will recommend the recognition of the Dublin Institute of Technology as a university.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is already a university in everything but name.  However, the lack of that status affects students in terms of their desirability in the jobs market and it impedes the ability of the Dublin Institute of Technology to be recognised and compete internationally, particularly at research level.  It also affects its capacity to attract visiting professors. In that context it is important that the Dublin Institute of Technology is recognised as a university.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline some technical reasons that is important.  At present it operates under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act.  If one compares the legislation, the differences between the current position and what would occur if the Minister had a change of heart during the debate and decided to accept the amendments are obvious. Under section 12(1)(a) of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, the appointment of staff is subject to the approval of the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Under section 24 of the Universities Bill, a university may appoint staff as it thinks fit, provided it is within the budget and future budgets and within guidelines issued by the Higher Education Authority following consultation with the chief officers of the university.  Under section 12(1)(b) of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, selection procedures are determined by the Minister. However, there is no comparable restriction under the Universities Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12(4) of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act states that the appointment of research fellows, research assistants and other support staff, even part-timers, is subject to conditions <Col N="1409" /> laid down by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  However, there is no comparable restriction under the Universities Bill.  Section 18 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act states that the institute may charge fees for courses, lectures, examinations, exhibitions, research, consultancy and development subject to such conditions as may be specified by the Minister.  Section 38 of the Universities Bill leaves universities free to determine these except in relation to undergraduate programmes.</P>
    <P>Section 5(1)(j) of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act states that the institute may acquire land subject to approval by the Minister.  This aspect is most important in view of the desire and the opportunities which exist at present for the Dublin Institute of Technology to acquire land. However, the Universities Bill states that a university may purchase or otherwise acquire and dispose of land.  The approval of the Minister must be sought and obtained under the current arrangements for the Dublin Institute of Technology. Section 3 of that Act states that if the office of president becomes vacant, the Minister may appoint a person to be president temporarily. However, there is no comparable provision in the Universities Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act states that the Minister may by order appoint a commission to carry out the functions of the governing body, the chairman and president if the Minister is satisfied following a report by an inspector that the affairs of the institute are not being managed effectively.  Section 20 of the Universities Bill states that the Government may suspend the governing body by having an appropriate order passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That provision will have a tough passage through the House in terms of the difference between the Dublin Institute of Technology Act and the Bill.  It may be substantially different by the time the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>There are other examples of the differences between the legislation, such as section 5(2)(a) of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act which states that the permission of the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance is required before the institute can begin to confer honorary awards.  Universities have reserved this power to themselves.  Those specific instances clarify the practical differences and disadvantages of the Dublin Institute of Technology compared to a university.  It might be indiscreet for the Minister to indicate if her formula is satisfactory to the Dublin Institute of Technology but I would like her to be as indiscreet as possible.  Can she tell us if this is what they want and can I hold her to that?  I am reluctant to push this issue because it may not entirely be in accordance with the wishes of the governing body.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she will put a mechanism in place under which the Dublin Institute of Technology may apply for university status.  That by no means guarantees such status will be accorded <Col N="1410" /> to it and there is no indication that her Department supports this view.  It would be political idiocy from us to be fobbed off, and we are not idiots.</P>

It would be foolish to be fobbed off with permission to apply &mdash; a cat may look at a king &mdash; but it does not guarantee much to allow someone to apply.  The Minister might also put the substance of her discussions with Dublin Institute of Technology on the record to show what they want.  She can then say that my proposals are against the wishes of the Dublin Institute of Technology if that is the case.  Perhaps there is more support and commitment for the proposal to establish the Dublin Institute of Technology as a university in the Department of Education.  If so, and this is a political face saving gesture so that the Department is not being forced to do something it is going to do anyway, then I would be far less aggressive in pursuing the case. I do not wish to push amendments for political appearance but I would like to know if this process is seriously under way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered opposing this amendment until the Minister spoke.  We need to cut through the camouflage.  The Minister appears to be saying that when the Bill is passed, the Dublin Institute of Technology can apply under section 9 in what will then be the normal way.  Section 9 is totally unsatisfactory and needs radical amendment. It leaves the setting up and establishment of a university in the power of the Government, and to the Minister for Education in particular. The Minister can correct me, but she seems to be suggesting that the Dublin Institute of Technology may apply as a compromise.  If the Minister sets up these bodies, which have no statutory powers but have consultative powers, considers their reports and then decides whether to make the Dublin Institute of Technology a university, we are back to square one.</P>
      <P>I oppose section 9 so I cannot support the Minister in her opposition to this amendment. However, I reiterate what Senator Lee said.  It might help if the Minister defined the key criteria for university status here.  It is not good enough to set up a politically chosen group of so-called international experts and to make a recommendation which will be decided upon politically.  This is not what Senator Norris termed it, a political compromise.  It is a political fudge and I cannot see how we can accept the Minister's explanation unless she tells us her attitude to section 9 and the procedures that will be used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a small movement but all she is proposing is that a body will be established pursuant to section 9 of the Bill.  That is nothing new.  Section 9 does not say <Col N="1411" /> the Minister, but the Government.  It will not be a matter just for the Minister to decide, although the Government will act on her recommendation. Section 9(3) says that the Government shall not make an order under subsection (2) unless it has first caused to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a draft of the proposed order and a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by both Houses.</P>
      <P>I would not anticipate any difficulty in the Houses approving the matter but it is my experience with orders laid before the Oireachtas that it takes a considerable length of time to get them through the system.  They may go through without debate but it can take time to get them on the floor.</P>
      <P>The central issue here is that if, on the basis of what has already been studied, the Dublin Institute of Technology fulfils the criteria, as it appears to do, why is it necessary to constitute another body to establish something already established?  Why is that procedure necessary?  In the Bill, St. Patrick's College, the University of Limerick and the colleges of the National University of Ireland are all constituted as universities.  If one other institute of learning is similar in every respect to those bodies, why is it necessary to leave that institute out of the Bill?  Far be it from me to suggest the reality is that the degree of movement in the Seanad relative to the immovability in the Dáil relates to the mathematics in the Upper House, which is reflected by the full Independent benches.</P>
      <P>Another matter is quality assurance.  If the Dublin Institute of Technology is included under the ambit of the Bill, I would take it as read that the quality assurance aspect referred to by the Minister would be dealt with without difficulty.</P>
      <P>What we have here is something Eric Elwood would be very proud of on a good day in Lansdowne Road: a kick from well inside his own 22 that found touch on the opposing 22.  I want to see more movement and there is no reason the amendments before the House should not be voted on.</P>

      <P>The theme running through the Opposition contributions seems to be that the Minister should recommend the recognition of the Dublin Institute of Technology as a university today.  I worry about that because it should not be for politicians to decide whether the Dublin Institute of Technology achieves university status.  Senator Norris asked whether the Minister was willing to recommend that it be so recognised.  I do not think the Minister should do that.  There should be a clear division.  A university as an institution is created on the basis of clinical criteria which should be examined, not by politicians but by those qualified to do so.  If section 9 is imperfect let us examine it in detail and change it if necessary, but let us not create the spurious position that a politician's recommendation is satisfactory. <Col N="1412" /> The Minister should run a mile from that proposal. Regardless of how the debate stands between her Department and the Dublin Institute of Technology, she should not recommend the institute's recognition.  The position should be reversed; she should grant the status on the basis of advice that the institute is capable of gaining international recognition as a university. It would be wrong if politicians were allowed recommend the recognition of an institution regardless of its status, because different agendas applying at different times would dictate certain recommendations.  It is superfluous to include Dublin Institute of Technology among the definitions in section 3 because it is not a university now.</P>

      <P>Unlike Senator Norris, Senator Ross did not ask the Minister to recommend the recognition of any institution; he was speaking about section 9, which is entirely different.  I take issue with those who want the Minister to recommend that the Dublin Institute of Technology be changed from what it is today, because politicians should be kept out of it.  Changing the Dublin Institute of Technology to another form should be done on a clinical basis in a similar manner to that suggested in section 9.  When we come to that section we can discuss whether that is appropriate or if it should be changed, but it keeps politicians out of the discussion as much as possible.  The body which will be set up will advise the Government whether, based on current circumstances, the Dublin Institute of Technology deserves that status.  The Government would be foolish not to accept such a recommendation.  I am not in favour of amendment No. 3 and the Opposition should consider that it might be dangerous for the future.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris mentioned that he was an employee of Dublin University and I must declare an interest in that I lectured in both Dublin University and the Dublin Institute of Technology. <Col N="1413" /> It is because of my great appreciation of Dublin Institute of Technology Kevin Street, where I had the privilege of working, that I am not happy to see the Dublin Institute of Technology become a university by way of amendment. I would much prefer it to happen through an examination by the type of body suggested in section 9.  It will readily stand up to scrutiny by the experts suggested in section 9(1) whom the Government will appoint to the body which will determine whether an institution is worthy of becoming a university.</P>
      <P>The Minister has promised that on the enactment of the Bill she will propose to the Government that a body should immediately be set up under section 9 to examine whether Dublin Institute of Technology should be granted university status.  The Dublin Institute of Technology has in the past been made promises which were not honoured and people are naturally anxious that the same might happen again.  The Department has been in consultation with the institute and perhaps she could inform us about that.  The feelings of those within the Dublin Institute of Technology make a big difference to both Senator Norris and me in regard to how we should pursue this amendment.  I do not share Senator Dardis's worries about placing an order before the House, because such Orders do not seem to be debated, they simply are accepted.  In the period beginning from the passage of the Act or the establishment of the institute as a degree awarding body, is there a faint chance that it will be under the aegis of Teastas or will it be kept under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act on its own while waiting to come under the auspices of the Higher Education Authority when it acquires university status?</P>

      <P>The discussion has become complicated and it is hard to see how to progress it. The thinking behind the amendments is that this institution, which has operated at degree level for some time, is not getting a fair deal in the Bill. At the same time, Senator Henry is correct; no one would want a university to come into being by way of an amendment.  I agree with Senator Ross about section 9.  The Minister has proposed that under that provision she would set in train the procedure by which the body would get recognition and receive the appropriate status. The problem is that we have many reservations about the section as it stands.  I do not feel competent to decide what is or is not a university &mdash; even I feel inadequate sometimes.</P>

I agree with <Col N="1414" /> Senator Ross and others that it is not the business of politicians to decide what is a university and to determine university status, and that is one reason I share his and Senator Lee's reservations about section 9.  Having listened to the Minister, I feel this matter needs to be developed further. We need to know whether this is the policy of the Department of Education and the Government. If the Minister is prepared to put in train a certain course of events with the agreement of the college authorities, then that can be sorted out for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The final content of section 9 following Committee Stage will also be important.  If the proper commitments are given, if the college authorities are reassured and if confidence can be placed in section 9, the most appropriate way of giving the Dublin Institute of Technology what it is seeking would be through the procedures established under section 9.  This should not happen at the wish of politicians, even Independents, but through the proper and preferred procedure.  The Minister should state that this is the position of the Government, the Department and her own, and that it is not simply something to get us through today's debate.  Will the Minister give an indication of her thinking on section 9 and whether the Dublin Institute of Technology is in agreement with what she is suggesting?  It should be possible to deal with this matter on Report Stage if we are not completely satisfied with the present content of section 9.</P>

      <P>I support the call by the Dublin Institute of Technology for university status.  <i>Festina lente</i> should be our motto.  In Britain there was a move to give university status to similar institutions without the type of indepth study recommended in section 9 with the result that employers lost faith in some of the so-called universities and did not recognise some of their degrees.  I would not like to see a fine institution such as the Dublin Institute of Technology to suffer the same fate.  We should take time, even a month or two, to ensure we proceed properly.</P>

      <P>A month or two is a very modest period for making the type of decisions Senator Kelly spoke of.  If there is real anxiety about the status of the university more than a month would be appropriate.  Senator O'Toole has acknowledged his inadequacy in establishing what is a university.  One will not proceed far within a month if one is to seriously examine the status of the university.  Let us not fudge the issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cotter seemed either very naive or very sophisticated, or perhaps a combination of both.  He managed to get away with making an extremely fine speech on Second Stage which constituted a devastating critique of the ethos of the Bill.  He should have been speaking from this <Col N="1415" /> side of the House.  He spoke about political and ministerial interference, the core reasons for the trouble with the Bill.  Perhaps he was unaware of this.  We object to the Minister taking swingeing powers to abolish boards, get rid of provosts, place people on boards, etc.  The Minister is taking these powers.</P>

The Dublin Institute of Technology has already gone a long way in getting international accreditation and validation as a result of a series of processes which acknowledge the quality of its degrees. What is lacking is a political decision.  We must be frank and realistic.  A change in status will require a political decision.  International review groups can report and make recommendations until they are blue in the face, but a political decision will have to be made.  I am interested in the Minister's and the Department's attitude to this process and whether the change in status will be supported.  This is a perfectly legitimate political interest.  I am not inviting Government or political interference; it is already present.  I want to find out what the quality of response by the Government will be to the request for university status.</P>

He made the point that concerns some of us, namely, how one can most effectively keep politicians out of decision making about the quality of educational services while at the same time ensuring decisions are taken.  This is why section 9 is of considerable concern and I am anxious to know the Minister's response before making up my mind on how to vote.</P>
      <P>At least one amendment on section 9 is geared towards introducing due educational process by establishing An tÚdarás as the body to progress inquiries rather than the Government.  It may amount to the same thing but in terms of the self-esteem of universities and of national and international reputation, there is a fundamental difference between the present content of section 9 and what is suggested in the amendment.  I would prefer not to have a vote on the issues regarding the Dublin Institute of Technology until Report Stage until the Minister lets us know her attitude to section 9.</P>

      <P>Section 9 says &ldquo;the Government may, at any time, appoint a body, the membership of which shall be recommended by An tÚdarás and shall include international educational experts&rdquo;.  What will be the composition <Col N="1416" /> of the international review team and of the suggested body in section 9?  What were the criteria in deciding to grant it a degree status institution? What would be the criteria for making it a university? I do not see why we cannot go the whole way &mdash; all the arguments put forward suggest we have already gone two thirds of the way.  The legislation should be expanded to include the concept of university status which the institution already has in terms of degrees.  Students will not know whether they are attending an institution or a university.  A bad image is created by saying it is not a university, that another body needs to be established to decide whether it can rise to university status, but that it is an institution that can award degrees.  That is crazy.  I do not know what the thinking behind it is or why the Minister could not go the whole way.  Does the Minister want to keep the Dublin Institute of Technology under the control of the Department of Education? Everything about the Dublin Institute of Technology seems to suggest that it is completely under the control of the Department.  Section 9 is irrelevant in my view when we already have information coming through.  I would like to know what would be different about what that review body would say as against the body of knowledge we have had until now?</P>

      <P>I shall try to answer the queries raised.  I repeat what I said in the opening debate on this amendment.  I will immediately request the Government to appoint a body, pursuant to section 9, to advise the Government on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university, the Dublin Institute of Technology should be established as a university.  This move has been welcomed by the Dublin Institute of Technology today.  It might be useful if I remind the House what section 9 proposes.  If Members will bear with me, we could wait to have a debate on section 9 until we reach that section, we are still on section 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9(1) states:</P>
      <P>The Government may, at any time, appoint a body, the membership of which shall be recommended by An tÚdarás and shall include international educational experts and such employees of universities to which this Act applies as it thinks fit, to advise the Government on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university under sections 12 and 13, an educational institution should be established as a university.</P>
      <P>That is a statutory mechanism which has been put in place for two reasons.  I was aware of the outcome of the review committee which was set up in response to a request from Dublin Institute of Technology to award its own degrees.  Dublin Institute of Technology had been receiving its degrees from Trinity College.  I did not think it was prudent to respond overnight or in a pressurised way to this request irrespective of how reasonable, solemn, clear, convincing or tangible it was.  There was an onus on the Government to ensure that in developing this exciting sector of third level education we proceeded slowly and carefully, as Senator Kelly advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review body was put in place and at the same time as it made its recommendations, among them recommendations about Dublin Institute of Technology, doors were being knocked on in this city and people on other continents were being approached about opening universities there.  If one visits the capital cities of continental Europe one will see the words &ldquo;University of...&rdquo; even in the shadiest areas.  These universities are up and running and are awarding degrees.  Though some are highly reputable, others are totally questionable.  There was much discussion about the effects of this in Greece <Col N="1418" /> where there was no monitoring carried out.  I participated in some of that discussion at the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>We had two things &mdash; a venerable institution which had a very good, though not very long, tradition seeking to obtain university status, then we have this international interest in opening third level institutions which could award degrees in Europe and other countries.  In view of the recognition which we in this country give to third level qualifications, I thought it very important that the Department of Education should work towards a situation where we would be conscious of the development of third level education.  The White Paper signposted development in the Dublin Institute of Technology, regional technical colleges, new universities and changes in the HEA. How would we proceed with this development in a way that would add to the reputation of the institution and would never call into question that the changing of a name was just change for form's sake but followed a tangible examination of the institution?  The experience of the review body of degree awarding status was very helpful in drafting section 9.</P>
    <P>I have never failed in my time as Minister to deliver on a promise to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The statement I have made has, I believe, been welcomed today by them.  The wording of that statement is available.  Section 9 is a mechanism which seeks to ensure that people would not respond with a knee-jerk reaction to change but that there would be a mechanism in place for the setting up of a review body which would ensure that the quality of the forthcoming opinion was one to which a Government could respond confidently.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Lee who spoke about the difference between the Dublin Institute of Technology and university legislation, that there was not a great difference between the new universities in 1981.  What happened in 1989 came about as a result of a change of name but a change of name which followed a similar type of review as that which has taken place about the awarding of degrees.  None of this happened overnight.  It was examined to the satisfaction of the institutions and those institutions will now come under the same family of rules and regulations which pertain to all universities under this legislation. There has been progression.  The mechanism which is in place in section 9 is one that is not particularly new but which is now being put on a statutory basis to ensure further development. We are all concerned with the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I have shown real commitment to Dublin Institute of Technology, particularly in terms of investment, since becoming Minister.  I am also conscious of the need for quality controls and that questions are not asked about the quality of degrees awarded.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross amazed me because he suggested it was disgusting for a Government to set up an institution.  I am sorry I am not Queen Elizabeth I, but even she represented a state; at times I feel <Col N="1419" /> as old as Queen Elizabeth I.  All universities were set up by the State.  The Oireachtas passed legislation in this regard and before the foundation of the State, the Universities Act, 1908, was by Royal Charter.  Trinity College was established by a sovereign by charter as was the custom at the time.  The State, as the body setting up institutions, has served us well.  Given the quality of debate in the House, the State will not be found wanting.  Senator O'Toole, who has not been found wanting today, asked about the best way forward.  The best way forward is to use and include the statutory mechanism in section 9.  I, as somebody from the university of life, was asked to define a university.  The Bill sets out the functions and objectives of a university.</P>
    <P>The review body was not asked to recommend university status for the Dublin Institute of Technology and comprised five members &mdash; two international members, two national members and an independent chair.  It was set up by the Higher Education Authority and made recommendations.  I put on record my Department's and the Government's positive response to the recommendations.  The words I used were carefully chosen and my speech was made available to the Dublin Institute of Technology. The Government's willingness to move forward and my commitment to the mechanism in section 9 has been welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the Minister's reply unsatisfactory. She outlined the functions and purposes of a university but I asked for a definition.  There is a considerable difference between those words. We need a definition and the criteria for a university. The Minister did not tell us her attitude to section 9.  I must assume from what she said she is not prepared to accept an amendment to section 9, which is relevant to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  If she is prepared to amend section 9, it will make much difference to the purpose and the course of this amendment.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Dublin Institute of Technology welcomes so fulsomely the assurances given about the Minister's statement.  What is happening is that it is being referred to a future political control, whether we like it or not.  The decision will be made by Government, by politicians who have different agendas to academics. They do not have academic criteria as their primary objectives when setting up universities.</P>

      <P>Senator Magner rightly said he had no intention of addressing the Bill when he spoke and he fulfilled his promise as a politician.  Politicians have a different agenda and when they set up a university, they have a political rather than an academic agenda and set it up for different criteria.  It is unfair to ask the Dublin Institute of Technology to accept its subjection to political control and party political decisions in the future. <Col N="1420" /> I do not accept the Minister's assurances on this and I want to hear a definite response to the amendments to section 9.  If she wants to adopt a rigid stance on the section, then her attitude is totally unacceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I was astounded by Senator Magner's comments.  I was not sure from which political party he came.  I thought he would have found a sense of resonance in points made on this side of the House.  They were not about any politician but about the competency of people to do certain things.  I remind the Senator of a recent strong and vehement debate which took place in his party about the recognition of membership of particular courts.  His party determined it was beyond the competence of politicians to take on that onerous duty and that a new structure should set up between the Government and the decision making process.  Nothing other than that is being proposed in the amendments to section 9.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a comprehensive reply to questions raised and I was heartened by her comments. Points she made about the process of recognition for a university are important and I agree with them in the context of an amended section 9.  I will not press my amendments to a vote today but if section 9 is not duly amended, I will press them on Report Stage.  A balance has been struck between the points the Minister made and commitments she gave and its operation under an amended section 9.  I refer to amendments in the names of Senator Ross and Senator Lee which do not take the authority away from the Government.  I agree the Government, which is responsible for taxpayers' money, makes the decision and must reach the final conclusion.</P>

After it goes through the process, it is on its advice the Government acts and it is not a political gift.  It is done on the basis of a proper procedure in which we can have confidence.  If the Dublin Institute of Technology is content to do business with the Government and if section 9 is tightened up in the manner I described, I will put my amendments on hold until Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I also have a problem with section 9 but will hold my fire until we deal with this section which does not make sense.  The Minister has already granted the Dublin Institute of Technology degree awarding status and I do not understand why cannot go all the way as has been suggested.  It is hard to believe Dublin Institute of Technology representatives are happy with the Minister's proposals because I spoke to them a short time ago and did not receive that message.  However, I will wait until we reach section 9 when we will have another full discussion. <Col N="1421" /> We have discussed this at length but we appear to be going around in circles.  It should be a straightforward formula for putting forward a new concept.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole has expressed my views.  It pains me to differ from Senator Ross, but the Minister has dealt with this fairly. Had she been political, in the derogatory sense of the term, she would have taken the soft option and conceded this without the conditions she is striving to apply.  I will wait until we discuss section 9.  My proposed amendment to that section is meant to be constructive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better to arrive at a resolution of this matter by consensus rather than by vote.  It should be possible for the Minister to go further than she has thus far.  I support Senator Ormonde's observation that the Dublin Institute of Technology is a university in all but name.  The issue is formalising that and the method and speed with which it can be done.  We will need concrete answers on Report Stage.  Otherwise the matter will require a vote.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been most constructive. If the institute had sought a review in order to become a university rather than a degree awarding body, it might have achieved that.  We have the interests of the institute at heart and we are anxious that it is seen to go forward in a proper manner and not just by amendment.  The examination of the institute was so good that perhaps there could be a timeframe within which one could hope it would progress.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I did not mean to infer that the Minister had broken promises to the institute.  Its representatives told me they had had minor problems in the past and perhaps they were promises that could not be kept.  I accept what we appear to be deciding today.</P>

      <P>With regard to section 9, two types of amendment are proposed.  I refrained from tabling amendments because I thought it would be useful to listen to the debate since all amendments do not emanate from the same fountain of opinion.</P>
      <P>My history has shown that I have moved forward. Sometimes I wonder why I did not take the easier option.  It is probably due to my respect for the education system.  I wish to ensure that nothing I do questions the respect my generation holds for our educational institutions.  I am confident that, in accepting Senator Lee's amendment to section 9, we will be able to move forward. People should be confident that a review body would be independent but clear in its recommendations. This will not be our last time to debate this matter and I have taken on board the aspiration that we can move forward without resorting to a vote on it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), lines 22 to 24, to delete the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;employees&rsquo; in relation to a University include any person employed by the university who is not an officer,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that an employee, in relation to a university, means &ldquo;a person employed by the university in any capacity&rdquo; and includes an officer of the university.  There is a significant difference between employees, which include everybody in the university, and an officer.  An officer is a statutory professor and is distinct from an employee.  Perhaps the Minister would outline her views on the distinction between an employee and an officer.  I have reservations about the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; being applied to all employees of the university including the officers.</P>

      <P>I have received representations, particularly from the University of Limerick, about the division between officers and employees of a university.  Like Senator Ormonde, I seek clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this is a serious amendment.  It appears to relate to status and the feeling that somebody's status might be upset by being called an &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  Senator Norris is a stalwart of this House and he said earlier that he was proud to be a former employee of the University of Dublin.  On hearing that I thought Senator Ormonde would withdraw this amendment. If Senator Norris is of that view, it must reflect everybody's view of their status.  It is superfluous to split hairs.</P>
      <P>The Senator said an officer would be a professor of the university.  That is not true.  An officer would include any member of the full-time academic staff.  The amendment would create complications and I cannot see any point in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was also approached by members of the staff of the University of Limerick who are concerned about the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  Up to now there were only employees in that university.  Creating an officer <Col N="1423" /> rank suggests a division will be created among the employees.  This goes against the ethos of the university where all members of staff are treated as equals.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde's amendment would copperfasten a division which is not appropriate at a time when society treats its members as equals. Introducing two classes of employee reminds me of the signs one saw at one time in railway stations which referred to &ldquo;the board and its servants&rdquo;. At local authority level employees are still divided into categories of officers and servants. In this day and age harking back to a more hierarchical time is anachronistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have received such representations which arise out of a concern that a two tier system of definition of employees could be created.  My approach would be the opposite of Senator Ormonde's, which would create greater division between academic and other permanent staff.  The definition of an officer contained later in the section was not in the Bill as originally published.  It was added by Dáil amendment, of which there were two &mdash; the Minister's and that of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  Hence, it was an objective of both sides.</P>
      <P>However, it has created problems, especially in the University of Limerick and DCU, where there is no definition of an officer.  They feel strongly that a distinction should not be created between academic and other permanent staff of the university.  The definition of an officer includes other staff, such as the chief officer, and allows colleges to designate other people as officers.  However, I ask the Minister to examine this again before Report Stage to see if a solution can be found to the problem which will not create a distinction between two kinds of staff in a university. If Senator Ormonde's amendment were accepted it would further exacerbate a difference between academic and non-academic staff, something which is undesirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be two schools of thought on this.  Some universities state that all staff should be employees, something with which I have no difficulty as everyone is an employee. However, there is nothing wrong with the old <i>status quo</i> where it was felt in some universities that the position of lecturers and professors had status.  They should be allowed to retain their title.  It is a question of one school of thought against another.  It should be left as it was where the title of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; included all staff and the title of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; was for lecturers.  That is what I am trying to achieve in my amendment, but it seems I will not receive any support for it.  While many who made representations to me expressed my view, it seems others expressed a different one.</P>

      <P>In the Bill as published the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; was used to refer to academic and other staff in universities.  I received representations from university staff that the term and status of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; be retained.  Those who are officers consider this status to confer greater protection on them in the exercise of their functions. Recognising the case they put forward, I tabled amendments to the Bill in Dáil Éireann so that the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; included an officer.  The term &ldquo;officer&rdquo; now includes all permanent and full-time academic staff, the chief officer, whoever is an officer at present and whatever other employees the governing authority determines should be officers.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde proposes in amendment No. 4 to amend the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in the Bill so that it no longer includes an officer and to add a reference to officers in all subsequent references to employees in the Bill.  This is the purpose of amendments Nos. 72, 105, 108, 112 and 113.  I do not support these amendments as they would have the effect of officers not being defined as employees of a university when they should be included within the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo;. Furthermore, acceptance of amendment No. 4 would mean a significant number of further amendments would be necessary to ensure that all the references referred to officers.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan spoke about tenure.  I understand amendments may be motivated by a concern to maintain academic tenure.  Senators have tabled amendments dealing specifically with this issue which we will discuss later and we will address the concerns about tenure then.  I do not accept Senator Ormonde's amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 25 to 28, and substitute the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;students' union&rsquo; is a representative body, the majority of the officers of which are elected and which promotes the general interests of its members as students and represents the students, in general and individually, in academic, disciplinary and other matters relating to the governance of the university;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with the argument in favour of this amendment, which is that there should be an inclusion to the effect that officers of students' unions are elected people because no such provision is made in the Bill.  If it is to be consistent with the definition of student in the Bill, which refers to people being elected or appointed, it is reasonable to indicate the fact that these bodies are representative.  It would mean a system exists whereby officers are elected and it would remove any ambiguity about their being appointed rather than elected.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis proposes that the definition of students' union in section 3 be replaced.  Not all such unions are set up and operate under the same rules and I am aware of that through interaction with the student body.  I have sought to be flexible with existing practices. While the Senator's definition would not exclude any existing students' unions or lead to excessive inflexibility, I have at all times defended my position on this.</P>
      <P>The amendment could result in inflexibility, and the best example is one outside the student movement where a residents' association committee is elected by a community at an annual general meeting.  Different residents' associations have different constitutions.  Some associations may elect a group of people to elect officers. Others may allow all members of the body to elect officers.  These two examples are reflected in the student body.</P>
      <P>There has been no approach or pressure from students to change this, so I am still satisfied that the flexibility of my wording will not straitjacket existing students' union bodies which operate in universities and are very lively.  I do not accept the amendment because it would be inflexible or would show slight ministerial interference, which I am not aware the student body has sought from the Minister in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister in terms of the flexibility required and there is no question of interference.  It is up to student bodies as to how they regulate themselves and conduct their affairs.  Surely the Minister agrees it is preferable that people are elected rather than alternative systems whereby representation is acquired? Whether the officers are elected by the union body or by an elected group is irrelevant, but there must be some democratic system whereby the students' unions are representative, as are other bodies.  I accept the Minister's point about flexibility.  There is more than one way to skin a cat.  Nevertheless, I would prefer if representation was decided by election.</P>

      <P>This is not a new idea.  We had a long debate on this point on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  I favour the Bill in its present form and the student bodies have not called for any change.  I wish to ensure that the legislation does not exclude student unions.  It may be the case that fewer than half the student union officers are elected.  The remainder are chosen by the elected representatives of the students.</P>
      <P>We need to give each institution the flexibility to elect its own body.  As an elected politician I do not have to voice my support for the principle of electing representatives. There are different models under which student unions represent their student bodies.  This Bill should not interfere with the structures which have served students well.  I acknowledge the interest that student bodies have shown in student affairs.</P>

      <P>There are potential problems with the Senators' amendment which need to be resolved. Trinity College received legal advice on this matter. I asked the college for clarification on a number of issues concerning the precise title to be given to its founder.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> This is a technical matter relating to numbers. There are provisions for visitors in the University of Dublin.  This amendment seeks to prevent the Bill restricting the number to a single visitor.  This will ensure the continuance of the current situation. It is important to reassure the college that the function of the visitor will continue.  This may be expanded but we would like to see it continue.</P>
    <P>The institution of visitor is important.  It constitutes an appeal mechanism between an under graduate and a staff member relating to examination results or similar serious matters which may be of legal consequence.  This is an uncontentious amendment and I would welcome its acceptance. It is important to stress the function of the visitor. There is a feeling that the introduction of a departmental visitor or visitors may be seen as similar to an inspector.  This is not the role occupied by the visitor in Trinity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>A number of Senators have tabled amendments Nos. 9, 81 to 89, inclusive, 103, 104 and 128 which propose a standing board of visitors in universities where there is none at present and that there should be three members on this board, including at least one senior present or retired judge.</P>
      <P>The Government can appoint a visitor under section 18 of this Bill, as the occasion requires. However, it can only do so where the university does not have a visitor.  I reassure Senator Norris and Senator Henry that in the case of Trinity College where there is a standing board of visitors in place, it will not be necessary for the Government to appoint a visitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the visitor has a long tradition in our chartered university institutions, who appreciate and have confidence in it.  The provisions <Col N="1428" /> in the Bill are modelled on the NUI visitor. The concept of visitor, with the functions outlined in this Bill, can be usefully be extended to those universities which do not have one.  The visitor of the NUI is provided for under clause four of the charter of the NUI, is appointed by the Government and has the following functions acting through a board of visitors.  He or she can inspect buildings, laboratories, the equipment of the NUI and its constituent colleges, examinations, teaching and other work of the NUI and its constituent colleges.  He or she can also hear an appeal from any president, professor or lecturer who is removed from office.  His or her functions are not interfered with under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have proposed a widened role for the visitor to allow for a standing board of visitors with right of appeal laid down in university statutes.  I do not support the proposed amendments.  There has been a great deal of employment legislation in recent years which has protected the rights of employees and given them channels to ensure them.  To introduce a standing visitorial system would create another layer of protection which is not necessary in a modern world.</P>
    <P>The visitorial system has operated well in Trinity College and this has been used as an example of how it could be official in other institutions. However, in the case of that college, the system has a long history dating from its foundation.  It is therefore deeply embedded in and part of the operational fabric and life of the college.  It would be a mistake that such a system could be easily transplanted to other universities who have no such tradition.  This view is supported by the Senate of the NUI, which in a submission of July last year stated that &ldquo;it is the unanimous view of the NUI Senate and the NUI colleges that the legislative provisions for visitation in relation to the NUI constituent universities should be similar to the existing provisions for visitation in the NUI constituent colleges&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not support the amendments but I assure Senators that the board of visitors which has existed in Trinity College for many centuries will not be interfered with through the passing of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on Second Stage that the matter of the visitor was not one of principle and I would not be pushing it to a vote on Second Stage.  The more I have thought about the matter, the more concerned I have become.  I do not want to cast this matter in an adversarial way.  I look at it purely from the point of view of operational efficiency of the universities, particularly of those I am most familiar with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the charter of the NUI providing protection of presidents, professors or lecturers.  This still excludes the vast majority of teaching staff in universities, many of whom are part-time or temporary.  As I understand it, there is no provision where the type of personal <Col N="1429" /> relationship that can damage the functioning of a department, the quality of service provided to students and fester for years can be dealt with in a procedurally normal manner.</P>
    <P>As our universities grow in size and as it becomes more difficult to manage them as before, the main impediments to the effective functioning of universities at grass roots level are poor personal relationships and the sense of harassment. I am not talking about sexual harassment, which is covered by legislation, but daily psychological harassment in circumstances where appointments have been made, people do not get on and are in authority over others.  These cases cannot be remedied by industrial tribunals and is not a labour legislation case.  This happens daily and can seriously affect the job satisfaction and effectiveness of many people.</P>
    <P>Sometimes these cases surge to the surface and there are rows and crises.  These can be damaging, especially if they are at senior level, to the institution as a whole.  As matters stand, there is virtually no way for the institution to deal with them internally.  One can call for a visitor and there will often be a threat of this from an early stage. Inevitably, even if a visitor is appointed, it becomes a retrospective attempt to sort out an issue which ought never to have developed to that level and should have been dealt with at an early stage of conflict.  Whether at senior or junior level, this can only be dealt with by a standing board which is familiar with the normal workings of a university, not by a legal authority who comes in from outside on a one-off basis and tries to do his or her best to catch up with an <i>ad hoc</i> problem.</P>
    <P>I do not want to linger on this matter but it is far more serious in terms of operational effectiveness, to say nothing about ordinary fairness, than many matters which appear to have a higher public profile.  I know the Minister's position but I urge her to reconsider this on Report Stage.  I do not say this lightly but on the basis of personal observation of situations.  If we are to have the most effective functioning of our institutions possible in both managerial and human senses, it is important to devise a mechanism for this.  Perhaps there are better mechanisms than boards of visitors, but this is the traditional manner in which universities sort out internal problems.  We need to find ways of dealing at an early stage with situations which, once they begin to fester, corrode the effectiveness of the institution and result in individuals and students suffering.</P>
    <P>On the composition of membership of the NUI constituent universities, the new Senate of the NUI is shorn of many of its existing responsibilities; the chancellor is shorn of many existing responsibilities <i>de facto.</i>  The chancellor would be the ideal person to have an overview of the functioning of the universities.  I am completely in the Minister's hands in regard to whether there should be one board for all the constituent universities or whether each university should have its own board.  However, the chancellor would <Col N="1430" /> have an overview of the functioning of them all. Without lingering unduly over the composition at this moment, I hope the Minister's position on the principle is not written in stone.  There is scope here to significantly improve the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Lee's observations on this matter, particularly in regard to amendments Nos. 82 and 83 which relate to section 18, to which the Minister referred.  Section 18 states that the Government &ldquo;shall from time to time as the occasion requires&rdquo; appoint a visitor. This is, as was discussed on Second Stage, a very cumbersome procedure requiring a Government decision.  The nature of some of the difficulties require a much more expeditious approach than that which is possible under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the view expressed by Senator Lee that it would be far preferable to deal with many of these matters internally rather than having to go to the Government or have recourse under the statute.  I take the point made by the Minister that there is an increasing body of legislation, such as the Employment Equality Bill, to which individuals can have recourse. However, that is a very adversarial and confrontational system.  A more user friendly system would lead to less acrimony.  What is required is a university ombudsman &mdash; although one must be politically correct now and call them an ombudsperson &mdash; or referee.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the visitor to the National University of Ireland and the question of the constituent colleges.  However, because there are now separate universities within the NUI, I am not clear on whether the NUI visitor would look after all the new universities constituted under the Bill.  Should there not be a visitor for each university?</P>
      <P>The Minister made an extraordinary statement where she alluded to the long history of Trinity College, Dublin, and the fact there was no need to change the system.  The fundamental argument on Second Stage was that because the college had operated successfully for 400 years there was no need to interfere with it.  The statement which the Minister has just made seems to contradict her argument on Second Stage, which I find surprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in hearing the Minister's response.  I may have been badly advised; if so, I have been badly advised by the university itself.  The fear was probably that by neglecting to include the words &ldquo;visitor or visitors&rdquo;, the function and number of visitors in the University of Dublin might be restricted.  The Minister has very interestingly said the situation will remain exactly as it is with regard to Trinity College, Dublin. Does that mean the Minister will not take to herself &mdash; or her successors &mdash; the power to impose a visitation under section 19 in the case of the University of Dublin?  If that is what she means, that is fine and I would greatly welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> I do not care for the kind of visitation included under section 19.  Under section 19(3) such a visitation would be no less than a departmental snoop, which is a classic case of intrusion.  Perhaps my distinguished colleague, Senator Cotter, could advise us of his opinion in this regard.  It states:</P>
    <P>A visitor shall, for the purposes of this section, be entitled at all reasonable times to enter a university to inquire into the academic or other affairs of the university or to conduct an inspection of the university and its buildings, equipment and records where the inspection is, in the opinion of the Visitor, relevant to his or her inquiries.</P>
    <P>That has never been the function of the visitor in the University of Dublin.  The function has always been to assist in the resolution of a conflict, often between an undergraduate and a department or a member of the professorial staff, such as a very serious conflict about the conduct of examinations or examination results, or the employment of personnel.  I cannot recall an instance in which the powers of the visitor were invoked to conduct an inspection of the university or its buildings, equipment and records.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm her very interesting observation, which I am happy to accept, that section 18 is intended to institute this kind of process only in universities where there is not a visitor, that section 19 is a consequence of that, and that the existing situation in the University of Dublin, where there is provision for not just one visitor and where the functions of that visitor are already laid down, will be left intact?</P>
    <P>I also found it quite interesting that the Minister seemed to be saying she is acceding to the wishes of the different universities in her differing response to the notion of what a visitor is.  She quoted from the convocation of the National University of Ireland and said what it wanted, although I would not be terribly happy with what it wants.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee has made a very fine critique of the reasons that a board of visitors would be a most desirable step, whatever the convocation of the National University of Ireland has to say about it.  If I were an employee or undergraduate of the National University of Ireland I would feel that Senator Lee was speaking for me and clearly articulating the most democratic and decent principles.  I am amazed the convocation of the National University of Ireland should take this rather hard line attitude. However, I do not want to intrude other than to strongly support what a distinguished member of the professorial staff of the National University of Ireland has said.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the views of the convocation of the National University of Ireland, which might be regarded as an intrusion and an impertinence.</P>
    <P>I am most interested in the Minister's response to the situation in the University of Dublin.  She <Col N="1432" /> seems to have clearly said that, in regard to the question of the visitor, she is responding to what is perceived as the different ethos of the different universities and that in the case of the University of Dublin she is leaving intact the function, role and establishment of the visitor or visitors.  I assure her that if an attempt is made to impose such a snoop on the University of Dublin, it will meet with a very vigorous response from me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support my colleagues. I have proposed in amendment No. 81 that there should be a standing board of visitors established in each of the constituent universities of the NUI, Dublin City University and the University of Limerick.  Such a board could be used as an appeal mechanism for complaints by students on examination results or where a breakdown in communication occurs between a student and a lecturer.  There is no such mechanism at present.  I was approached before Christmas by a student who was not happy with examination results.  This student got no satisfaction on an appeal to the hierarchy of the university because there appeared to be no formal system for discussing an examination result.</P>
      <P>A board of visitors would create a mechanism for students and lecturers to discuss problems as they arise.  It is not concerned with labour law but only with aspects of courses, or problems such as breakdowns in communications.  It would facilitate the resolution of disputes, especially if an ombudsman was part of the board.  It would also mean that many staff problems could be resolved by the board of visitors rather than having recourse to labour law.  It is important therefore that there be a board of visitors rather than one visitor.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Many would agree with Senator Lee's comments on the difficulties that can arise from internal conflicts within departments, including personality clashes, which could significantly disrupt the life of a university.  How are these matters handled at present?  Would it be a function of the chief executive officer?  If this failed could they be addressed by the board?  If the board failed would it be appropriate to refer it to the Minister, who could appoint a visitor to investigate?  Senator Lee may envisage that some conflicts could not be resolved in the ordinary course of events.  What are the Minister's views on this important issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris appears to have read section 19(3) without reference to the remainder of the section.  Reading it thus, one could construe the activities prescribed as snooping.  However subsection (1) provides that the Minister may &ldquo;... request the Visitor to inquire into any matter giving rise to the Minister's opinion.&rdquo;.  Subsection (2) provides that the visitor must satisfy him or herself that there are reasonable grounds for the Minister's opinion and, if so, shall make relevant inquiries.  Subsection (3) provides that, in the execution of that duty, the visitor would be able <Col N="1433" /> to inquire into a range of matters.  I do not see this as snooping, but rather that the Bill gives power to the visitor to gather as much information as possible to finalise his or her opinion on the Minister's concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for his kind comments.  There is a body within the NUI called convocation, which is the graduates body and which, I understand, supports the concept of the visitor.</P>
      <P>Senator Cotter raised valid points.  Where cases of unreasonable behaviour by superiors occur, which can come down to psychological intimidation in a sustained way, there is no legal mechanism by which it can be addressed at present. Powerful internal figures may engage in such behaviour; it is open to anybody in big institutions to so behave because probably none of us is entirely reasonable in the way we deal with all matters.</P>
      <P>It becomes very difficult within the internal politics of an institution for the chief officer or a governing authority to deal with cases of that kind in a way that is possible for an outside body which is not involved in internal politics and does not have to confront on a daily basis that same person, and who will preserve his or her rights in the institution.  The knowledge of the existence of a standing board of visitors would go some way towards reducing this type of behaviour, or the intensity that it can reach.</P>
      <P>I am a strong believer in academic freedom, as I hope we all are.  However, this does not entail the freedom to behave in an unreasonable manner towards colleagues or subordinates.  This can, and does, happen at any level.  It does not have to occur at university &mdash; Senator Cotter spoke from his knowledge as a teacher.</P>
      <P>Educational institutions are peculiarly inappropriate for applying a full legal approach to such problems.  I feel strongly about this matter on the basis of personal observation and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider her thinking on it.</P>
      <P>Under the amendments in my name, the board of visitors is linked with the role of governing authorities, etc.  There may be power implications in terms of the role of the Minister in that context. Irrespective of the conclusion we may make about the role of the board of visitors <i>vis-á-vis</i> governing authorities, the role of standing boards of visitors <i>vis-á-vis</i> the harmonious, internal functioning of the institution, and therefore its fairer and more efficient functioning, is something we should take on board in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I am confused about what a board of visitors would do.  The vision of the board as outlined by Senator Lee is different from that outlined by Senator Ormonde.  Although universities have been in existence for many years, they have not developed good internal mechanisms for resolving conflict between peers, professors and other academic staff.  It appears that academic bullying occasionally occurs.  Surely it is incumbent <Col N="1434" /> on the universities themselves to put mechanisms in place to resolve such difficulties.</P>
      <P>I have two daughters at university and they are following my example in that they are both class representatives.  They occasionally tell me about the problems they are asked to solve.  A mechanism appears to exist in University College Cork to deal with student and staff relations and problems which arise over the content of courses and whether lecturers are going too fast or too slow.</P>

      <P>There would have been an outcry if the Minister had included such a provision in the Bill initially.  She would have been lambasted for being heavy handed.  I can imagine the <i>Sunday Independent</i> article which would have been written as a result.  Since universities have failed to put mechanisms in place themselves, they want the legislation to establish a super inspector who will be half many and half ombudsman to sort out problems between staff.  I thought the universities would prefer the Minister's minimalist approach in having just one visitor who will be called on to intervene in major problems.  This would allow them to sort out their own problems rather than having a permanent board of visitors on stand by to intervene at any sign of conflict.</P>
      <P>I do not understand how a board of visitors, which would be familiar with the problems, could not be influenced by the difficulties as they arise. It would not have the same impartial view as a person who comes in and examines the case.  That person would be in a much better position to cut through the woods and see the trees.  I do not understand how a board of visitors would assist the universities; rather it would be counterproductive.</P>

I hope she will be in a position to reassure me that it will continue and I anticipate that she may be able to do so.  If that is the case, I will heartily welcome it.</P>
      <P>I wish to amplify the points I made about the role of the visitors in the University of Dublin as I experienced it.  This machinery is not called into operation frequently but it is in existence.  The Hon. Mr. Justice Kingsmill-Moore operated as one of the visitors for TCD for a long time.  He was a man of great seniority and he was regarded with immense respect by the university body and the public generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>He was a good egg.  I consulted with my colleague, Senator Ross, to confirm the identity of the current visitors.  They include the Chancellor, Dr. Frank O'Reilly, and Mr. Justice Henry Barron.  In the context of the earlier debate, it <Col N="1435" /> is interesting that a former Member of the other House was appointed.  We are not as suspicious of politicians as Senator Magner thought we might have been.</P>
      <P>The reason such people are chosen is that they are able to take a dispassionate and disinterested view.  In the case of the University of Dublin, the visitors constitute a last court of appeal, which is similar to the entitlement of a Roman citizen to appeal over the heads of a local governor to the central authority in Rome.  If a decision is taken by a departmental head which is viewed as disadvantageous to a student, the individual, having exhausted all other remedies, has the opportunity to appeal to the visitor.</P>
      <P>Regarding the points made by Senator Kelly, it is not the case that the University of Dublin has failed to establish this machinery.  That may be true of certain other universities but I am not being narrowly chauvinistic is saying that Trinity College, Dublin, added this element to the university system.  It is good and it should be retained.  It is valuable to have a standing body rather than it being necessary to call it into operation through some cumbersome machinery when an emergency arises.  The body may be inert for several years but it can be called on if necessary. This is a good and efficient method.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Cotter's points, I did not misinterpret the Bill.  I read it as a whole and that is precisely what worries me.  Phraseology such as where the Minister is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for contending contains much conditionality.  There may be a Minister who is so opinionated that his or her opinions come close to whimsy.  If a Minister was subject to whimsy, he or she might persuade himself or herself that there were reasonable grounds for contending certain matters.  On the basis of that type of miasma of suspicion, the Minister could send an intrusive beast into the university. Senator Kelly said the provision was minimalist because it only involved one visitor.  However, one could do huge damage with the swingeing powers contained in the measure.</P>
      <P>We have radically different perspectives on this issue in terms of the tradition of the university from which I come and the intention of the Minister. The purpose of the visitor is to facilitate the resolution of disputes, personal conflict which might arise in universities and cases involving oppression.  However, the section as it stands envisages that the visitor will be somebody who snoops and who has very wide powers to invade universities and conduct inspections of buildings, equipment and records on the basis of the opinion of a Minister.  I do not accuse the Minister of being subject to whimsy but that could happen under the legislation.  I do not regard that as minimalist but rather as Stalinist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister can reassure me that the situation regarding the visitor will remain as it is in Trinity College.  Trinity appears to have been excluded from the malign operation of the other <Col N="1436" /> type of visitor, which is not a visitor in any terminology with which I am familiar.  Their functions traditionally operate, as I have specified, to the great benefit of the undergraduates, graduates and staff of the university.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kelly mentioned my own institution.  University College Cork has a very good ombudsman system and the two ombudsmen there have worked extremely well. Because I have seen the potential and limits of that system, I am very concerned about the potential role of a board of visitors.</P>
      <P>As envisaged in the Bill, the visitor will be called into existence as the Government decides from time to time following consultation with the President of the High Court.  It is obviously envisaged as a very rare development and Governments have been notoriously reluctant to become involved.  On one hand it might be said that Governments should become involved more often and, on the other, that they should become involved less, but that is not the point.</P>
      <P>There is a class of relationships in universities which are crucial to the effective functioning of universities.  These cannot be coped with by the existing visitor system because it has broken down completely and they are not dealt with by ombudsmen, who deal very well with student problems and lower level issues but cannot deal with sustained difficulty in a department arising out of the behaviour of particular individuals in authority.  A visitor would not be called in to deal with that problem and the Government will not set up a visitor to deal with a local departmental problem, though that may be of crucial importance to that department and its students.</P>
      <P>I have explained that, within the authority and political structures of an institution, it is very difficult to get decisions to address this problem.  If there was a standing board of visitors, many of these problems would be dealt with early.  That is not being intrusive or showing a heavy hand, and if there is a heavy hand it is not the Minister's. Furthermore, it cannot be called into operation unless there is an appeal from a member of staff. The mechanism is not intrusive; it is waiting for appeals.  The mechanism I propose may not be the most effective, but there is an urgent need for the establishment of a standing board of visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my amendments the visitors would play a buffer role between the Minister and the university. Section 19 states that the Minister is to be of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds, which was the point Senator Norris made.  My amendment proposes that where the board of visitors is of the view that there are reasonable grounds, it shall so advise the Minister.  As matters stand, where does the Minister get her opinion?  If there is a board of visitors in place that has a reasonable knowledge of the functioning of the institution the Minister can be informed of various matters but she may not be informed by responsible people.  While there is a board of visitors which is familiar with the functioning <Col N="1437" /> of that institution, its views would have to be taken very seriously by the Minister and it could not be accused of vexatious rumour mongering. I propose that the board would deal with potential internal difficulties.  This would mean there would be a much more structured and less adversarial relationship between the universities and the Minister if the type of doomsday situations envisaged in sections 19 and 20 were to arise.</P>

      <P>I find the language in this section particularly difficult to understand.  It is the language of the visitors and implies that they are welcomed and invited by the university.  The university is not inviting the visitors but the Minister is dispatching them to the university.  If we changed the language and called these people &ldquo;ministerial envoys&rdquo; or &ldquo;inspectors&rdquo; it would be more accurate. If we call them inspectors they would not be so welcome.  Calling them visitors suggests that the university wants them to come in and do a job.  If the Minister forms an opinion that something is going on in a university which he or she does not like, he or she can then dispatch an inspector to that university to inquire about something that, in the Minister's subjective opinion, should not be going on under the terms of the Bill.  This is a particularly objectionable and insidious form of pressure which the Minister can unjustifiably bring to bear against the wishes of a university.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the amendment relating to visitors.  I reassured the Senators from Trinity College that what has been in existence in their college will stay.  I repeat that I am not trying to have every university look the same.  We will fashion legislation that will reflect the traditions, young or old, of all institutions.  Senator Norris's concerns arise out of section 19 where the visitor is sent on visitation.  He mentioned two people on the board of visitors &mdash; Chancellor O'Reilly and Mr. Justice Barron of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Things are bad when the Minister has to send in visitors, but if such a catastrophe were to happen <Col N="1438" /> at Trinity College, then the visitor would have to be satisfied there are reasonable grounds to do so.  Then the two gentlemen mentioned by the Senator would be party to agreeing that the visitor is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for this inspection.  Rushing through this legislation is not a reflection on the seriousness of questions that were raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to return to the Seanad with a Bill which emanated from here.  Most of the amendments are technical in character.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to section 2 are technical.  Amendments No. 3 to 7, inclusive, are minor drafting amendments.  Amendment No. 8 requires that where there are voluminous requests the body will give reasons for the refusal.  Amendment No. 9 is consequential to that provision.  Amendment No. 10 is a minor drafting amendment.  Amendment No. 11 ensures that the records will be preserved and the Director of the National Archives will be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 requires a report to be made to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the measures taken by public bodies to comply with the Act, improve record keeping, manage <Col N="1439" /> records, etc.  This can be referred to a committee of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 is a tidying up provision which applies where information is incomplete, incorrect or misleading.  The effect of the two amendments to section 17, amendments Nos. 13 and 14, is that a person can seek to have a record amended even where it was not used for administrative purposes.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 is a minor technical amendment.  Amendment No. 16 tightens up the provisions on Cabinet disclosures.  It provides that the only information to be excluded is that excluded by the Hamilton judgment.  Amendment No. 17 is technical.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 is included on advice.  It removes the information commissioner from involvement in confidential agreements as we feel it would prejudice his or her subsequent role as adjudicator &mdash; it may bind him or her to such an agreement.  There is provision for review by the information commissioner of what is involved.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 19 to 21, inclusive, are technical. Amendment No. 22 concerns information given in confidence.  Amendment No. 23 to section 34 prevents people adjudicating among themselves.  It is another technical amendment. Amendment No. 24 covers the same point. Amendment No. 25 is technical.  Amendment No. 26 to section 46 is included in response to a point made by Senator Roche.  It tightens up the exemption for courts, tribunals, etc. and narrows the scope of what is included in the exemption.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 to the First Schedule add An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency to the list of public bodies to which the Act will apply from the date of commencement.  The National Sports Council was wrongly included in that list, the correct name is the Irish Sports Council &mdash; this change is made by amendments Nos. 29 and 30.  Amendment No. 31 ensures that we can include among the public bodies those which are indirectly as well as directly funded by the public purse.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendments to the House.  We had a constructive debate here and I was happy to be able to accept many amendments proposed by Senators.  I hope they agree we have further strengthened the Bill with a number of technical and other amendments as it proceeded through the Dáil.</P>

Of the amendments made by the Dáil, I welcome in particular the inclusion of An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Perhaps the Dáil discovered something we missed, although <Col N="1440" /> this House made important amendments also, especially those to apply the Bill to local authorities and health boards at an earlier stage than originally envisaged.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of work has gone into the legislation and it is now both strong and workable.

It ensures, in line with the wishes of all parties, that citizens can see what public bodies are doing in their name and that they have access to information.  I particularly welcome the all-party consensus which was forged in this Chamber.  It is fitting to finalise the legislation in the Chamber which saw the first freedom of information legislation introduced by Senator Brendan Ryan in 1985.  Senator Roche put much effort into his own Bill and we had a very good debate on it.  Senators Dardis, Lee, O'Sullivan and McGennis all contributed to the Bill in a positive manner.</P>
      <P>The most significant changes made to the Bill were made in this House in relation to bringing in the local authorities, for example.  With great attention to detail the House looked at how the mechanisms of the Bill would work.  Senators, particularly those with experience in local authorities, understood that unless those details and mechanisms were correct, people's access could be blocked by those less enthusiastic then politicians.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank my officials &mdash; Gerry Carney, Áine Stapleton, Noreen Egan &mdash; and others who worked on the legislation, including Finbarr O'Malley, our legal adviser, Julie O'Neill, Therese Cummin and Pat Kinealy.

Maurice Frankel of the campaign for freedom of information in the UK was very helpful, as was the Minister with responsibility for freedom of information, the deputy Minister for Justice, in Sweden.  I wish to thank in particular the people we met in Australia and New Zealand, <Col N="1442" /> including Madeline Campbell of the Attorney General's department in Australia who was of enormous support.  We faxed Madeline with various queries from Departments and individuals to get practical advice.  She provided endless advice and support throughout the preparation and progress of the Bill on its technical and practical application.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this Adjournment matter.  Anyone who drives a car knows that insurance is outlandishly expensive here.  Compared with the UK or other European countries, our insurance costs are much higher.  One report has shown that the average premiums per vehicle for comprehensive cover were 50 per cent more expensive here than in the UK and 123 per cent more expensive for non-comprehensive cover.</P>
      <P>In an article in <i>The Examiner</i> some weeks ago, a second 5 per cent hike in car insurance was being predicted before the end of the year.  This would come on top of a 5 per cent rise in car insurance a couple of months ago.  This would add £25 to the average £500 policy.</P>
      <P>The ideal would be to try to reduce the number of road accidents which, in turn, would reduce the frequency of personal injury claims but this is easier said than done.  To date, the introduction of non-jury courts for personal injury cases, the road safety and drink driving campaigns have all failed to produce substantial dividends for the motorist. The case for cheaper car insurance can be made not just in the interest of the consumer; it can also serve the wider needs of society.  The existing situation, in which an estimated one in six Irish drivers have difficulty securing affordable insurance cover, is extremely disturbing.  The cost of insurance for younger drivers in particular remains at prohibitive levels and must help to explain the worrying number of uninsured drivers on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> Motor insurance premiums are, on average, 10 per cent more expensive because of the high level of uninsured drivers.  This level could be reduced through greater control of uninsured drivers.  A new and radical approach is necessary to tackle the high cost and flagrant abuse of the law caused by uninsured drivers who are estimated to represent 6 per cent of Irish motorists.  A high percentage of these uninsured drivers are young drivers who find the cost of insurance extremely off-putting. On average, a young driver will have to pay between £1,500 and £2,000 for car insurance. I am paying £1,300, having driven for seven years and having had a full licence for five.  I have not had any claims on my insurance during that time. I would not have bought a car if it were not necessary for this job.</P>
    <P>This Government is trying to curb the problem of rural depopulation, yet young people are unable to live at home and travel to work due to the cost of car insurance as they are financially better off moving into urban centres.  One of the main reasons for the high cost of insurance for young drivers is the fierce competition in the insurance sector which has led to widespread, below cost selling of car insurance in the premium 35-55 age group.  These companies are taking the cream of the market &mdash; the low risk group &mdash; and are not quoting younger or older drivers.</P>
    <P>The Equality Bill which states that a person may not be discriminated against on age grounds has been passed in both Houses, yet successive Governments have allowed the insurance industry to openly discriminate against young people by allowing the principle of community rating in the health sector but not in the motor sector.  I am seeking a level playing pitch.  We have community rating in the health sector where young people are a low risk group but not in the motor sector where they are a high risk.  This is blatant inequality on the grounds of age.  We should have community rating on the motor insurance market. I ask the Minister to set up an interdepartmental committee from the areas of Justice, Environment and Enterprise and Employment to tackle the broader issue of car insurance.  This committee would look into the driving test system, road safety legislation enforcement and the issue which I have already highlighted relating to below cost selling of insurance within the industry. Such a committee would be an effective way of tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>It is not all doom and gloom.  This Government has started to tackle the problem through recent road safety legislation.  The new 25 hour driving course for provisional drivers, which gives them between a 10 to 20 per cent discount on their first year's policy, and the report on insurance costs published by Minister Rabbitte are to be welcomed. I compliment the Minister and the Government on the work it is doing in this area but a lot more must be done to make motor insurance more acceptable to the general public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Naughten for giving me the opportunity to deal with this important question.  With regard to specific recent increases in motor premium rates I will give the following information for purposes of clarification.</P>
      <P>In October 1996 the Guardian PMPA Group, which is the largest insurer in terms of premium income, announced average increases of 5 per cent in their motor rates.  These increases took effect from the 1 November 1996 following overall reductions of 10 per cent in Guardian PMPA's motor insurance rates which had been implemented by them in 1995.  Church and General, which underwrites 6 per cent of motor insurance business, also increased their motor rates by 3 per cent with effect from 1 January 1997 and, on the 15 January 1997, the Hibernian Group, Guardian PMPA's closest competitor, announced an average increase of 4.8 per cent in their basic rates.  Hibernian also announced other adjustments into their schedule of motor rates, the most significant being a reassessment of young drivers' insurance risk profile resulting in a new insurance scheme which will take into account a young motorist's claims-free experience as a named driver on his/her parents' motor insurance policy and a no-claims bonus incentive to reward such claims free driving.  This latter development was a welcome trend and, while I hope to return to the general issue of insurance costs for young Irish motorists in due course, I stress that the format and structure of Hibernian's increases were such that in certain instances, policy holders' motor premiums were, in fact, reduced.</P>
      <P>The Hibernian Group has cited a 12 per cent rise in the number of claims arising from motor accidents as necessitating an increase in premiums and has made reference to the fact that in its experience, the young driver continues to pose a bigger risk than those of a more mature age. Road accident statistics for the ten month period up to October 1996 and the Christmas period of 1996 indicate that, in comparison with the same period in 1995, road fatalities in the first ten months of 1996 increased by 23, or 6.4 per cent; the number of injuries on the roads over this period increased by 542, or 6.6 per cent, a more telling statistic in its effect on claims costs and over the 1996 Christmas period alone, in comparison with the same period in 1995, injuries increased by 50 per cent from 120 to 181.  These disappointing statistics have led some insurers to readjust their claims provisioning in anticipation of the inevitable increase in claims which will result.  It is the nature of insurance that those drivers who are at fault, and the categories of drivers which accident statistics indicate are a higher risk, will pay more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of insurance premium levels for young drivers on a worldwide basis, insurers tend to classify young/inexperienced drivers as a high <Col N="1445" /> insurance risk category relative to the more mature/experienced driver.  The degree of risk tends to decrease with age and maturity and the level of premiums charged to young drivers reflect the insurers' claims experience of such drivers as a higher risk category.  Accordingly, as a general rule, they will pay more for insurance cover although there may be exceptions depending on the circumstances of each individual case.</P>
    <P>It seems that high motor insurance costs are a shared burden for all young European motorists. In its analysis on young motorists' risks profile the Deloitte and Touche report confirmed that in a European context young drivers as a group and individuals with poor safety records will have limited choice of insurers and face high premium costs throughout the EU.  Indeed, the report found in its survey of motor insurance premium levels that for the 21 year old age group, UK premium rates for comprehensive insurance cover exceeded Irish rates.</P>
    <P>Looking at the problem in its strictly Irish dimension, I understand a survey carried out by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in 1993 found that in the age groups examined, 17 to 24, 25 to 30 and 30 plus, under both comprehensive and non comprehensive cover, the frequency and average cost of claims in the 17 to 24 age group was significantly higher than in the other age categories. The Deloitte and Touche report provides further evidence of the high cost of claims associated with the young driver.  The consultants found that the average cost of an insurance claim for the 17 to 24 year old driver is over twice that for a 36 to 40 year old driver and that motorists in the younger age group are responsible for over three and a half times the claims costs of motorist in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte and Touche report concluded that the inculcation of safer driving standards among young drivers, to which Senator Naughten referred, and education in driving skills is the key to reducing their higher accident rate and to obtaining lower premium quotations.  In this regard, I draw the Senator's attention to the specific recommendations by Deloitte and Touche in relation to the possible introduction of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers similar to a model in force in Ontario.  My colleague, the Minister for Environment, has agreed to undertake an examination of the Ontario model in the context of current law and practice in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten referred to the recently threatened increase of 5 per cent later this year. I met the Irish Insurance Federation last week and we had an exchange of views on why such a threatened increase should be extant at a time of uniquely low inflation.  Its argument was that the inflation environment does not matter if the anticipated claims level reflects the pattern of accidents to which I referred.  Nonetheless, I made it clear to the industry that I do not believe an increase is warranted this year, given the profit <Col N="1446" /> performance in recent years.  It has undertaken to consider our exchanges and to come back to me in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of Leitrim County Library headquarters.  I have a personal interest in this matter because at a meeting of Leitrim Council in 1927, my grandfather proposed that the headquarters be sited in Ballinamore, where they have been located since.  They are the only county headquarters located in the town.  Much development has taken place in the library, but unfortunately there has been no development on the construction of the building.</P>
      <P>The development of a library headquarters project in County Leitrim has been ongoing for over ten years.  In August 1992 the Department of the Environment gave approval in principle to proposals which had been submitted earlier. However, this project did not proceed due to difficulties with the court.  A suitable arrangement has been worked out with the Department of Justice to build a new courthouse with a shared area which would be jointly funded by both Departments. This project is of considerable importance to Leitrim library service.</P>
      <P>Good branch libraries have been developed in towns such as Mohill, Carrick on Shannon and Drumshanbo.  Ballinamore, however, is in bad condition.  Numerous projects have been undertaken by the county library service, including archives, museums, a genealogy service, an extensive local studies section, indexing newspapers and interviews with elderly people.  The library has been very innovative and the operation is significant in a town the size of Ballinamore. However, working conditions for staff and the public are extremely poor.  This is a most important project in library terms as it is a county library headquarters and a branch library combined, yet its project costs are quite low even in relation to branch library development elsewhere.</P>
      <P>While realising funding available to the Department of the Environment is limited this year, I stress that the Ballinamore project has been under discussion and the subject of various submissions to the Department for many years. Although these delays were not the fault of the Department of the Environment, it should be borne in mind that this project is of long standing and should be given priority.  I call on the Minister to give serious consideration to providing the much needed funds for this service in Ballinamore. I compliment our county librarian, Seán Ó Súilleabháin, and his staff who have done excellent work in poor conditions.  They have been very innovative and forward thinking.  If given proper facilities, the library service in County Leitrim would go from strength to strength.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to set out the position in relation to the proposed branch library and library headquarters at Ballinamore.  I am sorry that the Minister for the Environment is not here this evening but he is in the US on Government business.</P>
      <P>While the core service of libraries continues to be the supply of books, the library service has developed way beyond its traditional role and now fulfils an increasingly broad role in the life of communities generally.  The local authority library service now employs over 1,300 people in more than 300 branches throughout the country. It is a service with a long and respected tradition.</P>
      <P>Expenditure in 1996 on the public library service by local authorities is estimated to have been in excess of £32 million.  For 1997, the Department of Environment has a capital allocation of £2.3 million to grant-aid library and archive developments this year.  As with so many other areas of desirable public expenditure, the demand for library infrastructure far exceeds the funds available.  The total estimated cost of projects on hand in the Department is in excess of £30 million.</P>
      <P>The Ballinamore proposal is for the refurbishment of the existing courthouse building and the addition of an extension to house both court and library facilities.  This proposal was approved in principle in August 1992, subject to a maximum construction cost of £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A feasibility study was then commissioned by Leitrim County Council and the Department of <Col N="1448" /> Justice to determine how the needs of the library service and the courts service could best be met in the refurbished building, which is of considerable architectural merit.  Sketch design and cost plans have been submitted to the Department of Environment for consideration but the Department's technical advisers expressed some reservations about the plans.  Revised sketch design and cost plans for the project were submitted in November 1996 and further drawings and details of costs were received last February.  These show that the estimated cost of the library element has now risen to £486,000.</P>
    <P>The latest sketch design and cost plans are under active consideration in the Department and an architectural adviser from the Department will visit Ballinamore next week.  With a complex proposal such as this, involving diverse elements and different users, it is understandable that the project has to be progressed carefully.  It is also clear that an agreement must be reached which satisfies Leitrim County Council, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Justice and also optimises the potential of the building. I am hopeful that the current proposals will enable an agreement of this kind to be reached.</P>
    <P>As regards funding, the Department of Environment's capital allocation for the local authority library programme this year is almost totally committed to existing projects and it is likely that much of the 1998 allocation will be absorbed by projects already at an advanced stage.  Funding of the Ballinamore project will have to be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 April 1997.</P>
