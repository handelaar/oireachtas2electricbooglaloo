      <P>The Order of Business is agreed to.  With the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach, I wish to seek information pertaining to the presidential election.  It is my understanding that the count will take place in the various constituencies around the country and the results will be relayed to a count centre in Dublin Castle for the final count.  It is also my understanding that only two or three persons per candidate will be allowed to attend the final count.  The final count on any occasion is a great political event and candidates like to have supporters present in good numbers on such an occasion.  There is excitement associated with a final count.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain as a matter of urgency if my understanding is correct and that only a few persons per candidate will be allowed to attend the final count?  If that were the case, Members would agree that it would not be satisfactory. Candidates should be allowed to be accompanied by a significant number of supporters at the final count.  It should not be conducted in an antiseptic bubble, so to speak, in Dublin Castle at a remove from the people.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to the Independent Senators.  Will the Leader ascertain if the Minister for Health and Children is aware that many members of my profession are anxious about shortages of junior staff that may soon be experienced in hospitals due to the changes made by the Medical Council to the regulations for non-nationals working here? These changes had to be made but there also appears to be problems with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in getting work permits for these people.  There seems to be no urgency on the part of the Minister for Health <Col N="510" /> and Children to address the issue and I would be glad if the Leader would bring the matter to his attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo Senator Manning's point on the numbers of people allowed at the election count.  I understand the number is ten per Deputy or Senator.</P>
      <P>Considering this House has seldom, if ever, sat on the Friday before the Hallowe'en Bank Holiday week-end, it would be timely for us to remind people this is the long week-end and to drive carefully to avoid carnage on the roads.  I was glad to see the numbers of Garda checkpoints around Dublin last night.  Presumably this will be happening in the run up to Christmas. Hopefully this will result in a reduction in the number of road deaths which has increased to an alarming degree in recent weeks and months.</P>
      <P>As this is the Hallowe'en week-end, many youngsters consider this a time for thrillseeking and setting bonfires alight.  The bangers used can be quite deadly; they maim and injure young people who are left unsupervised where there are large bonfires made from tyres and so on.  Parents should be aware of the illegal sale of bangers.</P>
      <P>In light of worrying developments in the Far East and the Hong Kong stock market and given the debate on EMU last week, it is amazing from what unexpected directions financial fluctuations can flow.  Perhaps it would be useful to have a debate on the budget before rather than after the event which is usually the case.  Other organisations make their submissions in advance of the budget.  We have a post-budget debate which can be intellectually thrilling but it does not have much impact on what happens in the budget.  It might be valuable for the Minister to have the benefit of the Upper House's views on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's point and will have the matter clarified immediately with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  Senator Henry raised the question of a debate on health.  This was also raised by Senator Finneran yesterday.  I will make time available for this debate at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Costello's point, I welcome the actions of the Garda Síochána and their efforts over the last couple of days.  It was noticeable this morning on the way to the House from our various constituencies that, in the midlands, the gardaí were out in force on the roads.  I congratulate those who have highlighted the difficulties experienced on the roads over the past number of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello also requested a debate on financial matters before the budget.  I must remind him that this House does not deal with financial legislation in the same way as the other <Col N="511" /> House.  However, a debate can be arranged on the Celtic Tiger, the buoyancy in the economy and how it started and the economic outlook over the next four to five years.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When we last debated this section I expressed disappointment that the Minister did not accept many of the amendments we tabled.  I am especially disappointed that those amendments which took consideration of the international agreement were not favourably considered by him.  I hope he will introduce an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is the essence of the Bill.  It gives powers to the Commissioners of Irish Lights. There is widespread concern regarding the powers which will enable them to build a Loran C mast.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment was accepted by the House.  Unfortunately it does nothing to relieve the concerns of the people of west County Clare regarding Loran C. The Minister indicated that any developments in this area would have to be debated by both Houses of the Oireachtas and he went on to outline the way in which parliamentary business is ordered and conducted, how parliamentary party meetings are ordered and how members of parliamentary parties are notified of the business of the Houses.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister should reflect on the fate of legislation which was enacted speedily and in an unsatisfactory manner, such as the rod licensing legislation in 1988.  This international agreement was agreed before most people realised its full implications.  Cognisance must be taken of these factors.  The reality of proceedings in the Houses of the Oireachtas has meant that legislation has been enacted before the majority of Members in either House was aware of its implications.  I hope this slipshod, smart manoeuvring tactic will not be used by any Minister or official in the Department in the future in relation to this section.  If that happens, it will be the sword on which they fall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill, I wish to say that I am very distressed and upset about the terrible tragedy which occurred in Counanna Harbour in Cahirciveen.  I have been informed this morning by the marine emergency services that the bodies of both people have been recovered. I extend my sincere sympathy to the family, friends and relatives of the couple and to the people of the area.  Mr. and Mrs. O'Donoghue were particularly well known and their deaths are a tragedy.  It is particularly upsetting that it occurred at a time when the fishing industry in the area appears to be doing well.</P>
      <P>I thank the Irish Marine Emergency Service, and the rescue services under my Department's overall direction.  This came into operation immediately and we are aware from reports that they were on hand within minutes.  The Irish Marine Emergency Service, which co-ordinated the search, rescue and recovery of the bodies, deployed the marine emergency service at Shannon, the Dingle coastal unit lifeboat, personnel from the local coastal unit and the Valentia RNLI lifeboat and the naval vessel, the <i>LE Eimear.</i> Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the emergency services which involved the deployment of considerable resources it was not possible to rescue the two people involved.</P>
      <P>I extend my sympathy to those so recently bereaved by the tragedy.  I was not far from the area at the time and it was a great shock to everybody there.  I am sure the House also extends its sympathy.  The personnel of the rescue services do a tremendous job but some of the people in the coastal units of the IMES are less well known. They are all local volunteers who were members of the former coast and cliff rescue service.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Taylor-Quinn's points, we dealt with this issue in considerable depth previously. Although the provisions are strong, the Senator is concerned there may be a parallel between this matter and past issues such as the rod licence dispute and that some measure might be forced through.  If the Government wanted to force a measure through, it could do so today.  If a future Administration wants to introduce legislation, it is free to do so at any time if it has a majority and can vote it through the Houses.  The previous Government put this Bill through the Lower House without amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Senator that provisions can be rushed through.  People will know they are before the House and a major row would be caused if a Government decided to force them through without giving Members an opportunity to express their concerns.  We have made substantial amendments.  Senators understand what we are doing and the way in which we are doing it. They realise nothing will happen without a full and open debate in both Houses.  If a future Minister decides to bring forward an order under this <Col N="513" /> arrangement &mdash; we discussed this at length &mdash; such an order must come before both Houses for debate.  The procedure is open.  It will depend on how people feel about this issue at the time. There is no question of such an order being pushed through.  That could happen with another type of order but with this arrangement, there is no way it could happen.  I agree with the Senator that this is the substantive issue in the section and we have covered it adequately.  On that basis, I ask Senators to agree to the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 4 between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Co-operation under subsection (1) shall not be provided for the purpose of providing maritime navigational assistance to the military vessels or aircraft of another state, unless the assent of Dáil Éireann has been first obtained.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will not press this amendment, although I have tabled another on Report Stage which will cover what we are trying to achieve here.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate to join with the Minister in extending our sympathy to the O'Donoghue family following the tragic accident in Dingle.  It is sad that this elderly couple who set out on a nice autumn afternoon should return in their coffins.  Those involved in the rescue must be complimented on their fine work and on acting so quickly.  The groups involved, including the Shannon rescue service, the local Dingle peninsula service and the RNLI successfully managed to recover the bodies.</P>
      <P>It is also appropriate to convey our appreciation to the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the search and rescue services throughout the country on their tremendous work over the years in carrying out so many rescues in extremely difficult situations, including inclement weather conditions. Many foreign registered boats as well as the RAF have been involved in rescues.  Nobody would dare suggest the commissioners do not have the powers to co-operate with the relevant authorities and agencies concerned with rescues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Government Members, I express my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in County Kerry yesterday.  It brings to mind quite poignantly the <Col N="514" /> situation we have faced on many occasions in County Donegal and the hardship and distress caused to families when they lose loved ones. When we look at the sea and think of tranquil and pleasant experiences we fail to realise its power and it is only on occasions such as this we realise how inhospitable it can be.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the rescue services which took part in the search and, fortunately, bodies were found.  While we have State services and co-operation between ourselves and Great Britain in sea rescues, such events highlight the great efforts of the voluntary organisations and the local cliff and sea rescue teams on behalf of all seafaring people.</P>
      <P>I have been invited to a dance by a voluntary group in Donegal.  I congratulate such voluntary groups and stress the importance of these people. Once again, I offer my condolences and thank the rescue services for what they have done over the past few days.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 29, after &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided that, where the contribution has been made pursuant to an international agreement, such agreement has been approved by Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Before addressing the amendment, the Labour group in the Seanad and I extend sympathy to the family and friends of Mr. and Mrs. O'Donoghue who tragically died.  It is ironic the glut of fish in our seas were in some way responsible for this tragedy.  These were two elderly people who caught fish and sold them for a living.  May they rest in peace.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure the legislation is constitutional.  Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;The State shall not be bound by an international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.&rdquo; This is not reflected in the Bill and this amendment ensures it is in line with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Reference is made in this section to the Minister and the Minister for Finance and, as far as I am concerned, it is not satisfactory or constitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised that, in accordance with the Constitution, any international agreement involving a charge on public funds has to be approved by Dáil Éireann.  The commissioners' involvement in an international agreement under sections 4 and 6 requires the consent of the Minister <Col N="515" /> for the Marine and Natural Resources and such an agreement would be likely to involve funding from the Exchequer.  This amendment is, therefore, not considered necessary or appropriate in that the point is already covered and the requirement is there.  Senators will be aware that the international agreement on Loran C was approved by Dáil Éireann on 8 October 1992. Therefore, I do not accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Senator Ryan and his colleagues because it is an important one which makes the Dáil and Seanad central to these matters.  The Minister referred to Loran C. How much money has been paid by the Department or the Department of Finance towards securing the Loran C system?  How much has been paid towards storing a mast somewhere in Paris?  Are these moneys coming from the Minister's Department or the Department of Finance?  There is need for vigilance in this section and I understand the motivation of Senator Ryan in tabling this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's view that my amendment is not required in the context of this section.  The section states: &ldquo;The Commissioners shall have, and be deemed always to have had, power to make monetary contributions, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, towards the funding of international organisations or bodies concerned with maritime navigational assistance&rdquo;.  How can we be sure the funding of such agreements is in accordance with the wishes of the people?  It is not sufficient in the context of this section that it is left to the Minister and the Minister for Finance to approve, possibly retrospectively, the recommendations of the commissioners. That is not satisfactory.  It is not the commissioners, the Minister or the Minister for Finance who will be answerable but Dáil Éireann. This section deals with international agreements and, on that alone, it should incorporate this simple amendment whose only purpose is to protect the constitutionality of the Bill, thus protecting what is its envisaged purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand why this amendment has been tabled, the Minister has already assured us that, where funding needs to be made available, it must be approved by the Dáil.  The legislation already deals with that so we are only prolonging the situation.  The amendment is superfluous and only amends something which already exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister and other Members in extending our sympathy and condolences to the bereaved families of the couple who tragically lost their lives off the coast of Kerry.  I have many friends in the Caherciveen area and know that the shock of a tragedy at sea <Col N="516" /> is something we often face.  For decades Irish and Anglo-Irish writers, in poetry and prose, have tried to capture the sense of tragedy, loss and shock of these unfortunate and, sometimes, inexplicable accidents.  Despite this, they are a source of great shock and deep grief for all concerned. Déanaim comhbhrón leis na comhaltaí eile agus ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha.</P>
      <P>Normally I would be sympathetic to the sentiments and concerns articulated by Senator Ryan in his efforts to provide a safeguard for the Houses of the Oireachtas, the taxpayer and the people in terms of the spending of money to promote international agreements.  That is a commendable and laudable aspiration.  However, it is clear from the Minister's comments that there is a distinct obligation on a Minister to come back to the Dáil and Seanad where additional funding is sought to support such an agreement.  That obligation negates the need for this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The storage to date is of the order of £50,000 and the cost to the Exchequer is slightly over £955,000.  In accordance with the Constitution, any international agreement involving a charge on public funds has to be approved by Dáil Éireann.  Therefore, this is covered by these provisions.  Under sections 4 and 6 of the Bill, the commissioners' involvement in an international agreement would require the consent of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and such an agreement, if it involved any expenditure, would have to come before Dáil Éireann.  The expenditures involved in the Loran C system came before Dáil Éireann on 8 October 1992 and were approved at that time.</P>

      <P>I agree with this section. However, I hope that very serious consideration will be given by the Minister, the Department and the Commissioners of Irish Lights before any lighthouse is removed.  Lighthouses are very much a part of local tradition and heritage and are landmarks.  They have always been a source of interest to local communities and an attraction for visitors.  Lighthouses are a unique feature of <Col N="517" /> the Irish landscape but no more will be built.  As part of our history, they are all the more important and significant.  If any consideration is given to removing or selling lighthouses, the local community should be consulted.  If possible lighthouses should be used as heritage or interpretative centres.  Lighthouses are a national treasure which should not be disposed of, removed, transported elsewhere or knocked down.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights and their staff are to be complimented for the meticulous manner in which they have maintained Irish lighthouses; they were an example to every other section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Taylor-Quinn's comments.  As someone who comes from a seafaring constituency, one of my earliest childhood memories is of visiting lighthouses and being enthralled by them and by the men who worked there.  I would not like to see lighthouses being closed down completely or made defunct.  I am sure the Minister and his Department would make funding available to assist fishing communities to establish maritime museums which would protect our heritage for future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 states that the commissioners shall have power to enter into agreements and to identify wreck locations.  Will the Minister outline for me the powers of the commissioners in relation to the removal of these wrecks?  A number of wrecks are located along the Irish coastline and these are a matter of concern particularly in relation to shipping.  In the past, the owners of these wrecks could not be located.  I am aware that the commissioners have the power and responsibility to identify the wrecks but I would like to know who has the power and responsibility to remove them.  This should be done in the interests of safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The receivers of wrecks are responsible for their removal.  The Department often becomes involved because some wrecks are part of our national heritage.  However, wrecks located in shipping lanes can cause problems and we must find means of disposing of them.  A famous wreck, the <i>Bardini Reefer,</i> is referred to in the Lower House from time to time, particularly by the west Cork Deputies.  It has been a source of nuisance and yet is considered to be part of the area's heritage.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor Quinn asked us to ensure that lighthouses are not removed; I could not help laughing at that.  Perhaps if masts were built in the form of lighthouses there might be less trouble about them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the comments of Senator Taylor-Quinn on how well lighthouses have been maintained over the years.  I have a personal interest in this because my grandfather was a lighthouse keeper who kept his lighthouses very well.  We should record the manner in which they have been kept.  The commissioners have kept the lighthouses particularly well.  They have also made arrangements to turn defunct lighthouses into, for example, local heritage centres.  I will convey to the commissioners the views expressed in the House, with which I agree.  They are relevant and it is particularly important that they be kept and maintained as part of our heritage.</P>
      <P>I accept and will keep in mind the comments of Senators Taylor-Quinn and S. Ryan on this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14a:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The provisions of this section shall not apply in the case of the LORAN C navigation system.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment as I assumed the Minister's amendment to section 3 would be accepted. Section 3 is now an extensive section which conveys major powers to the commissioners.  The conferral of additional powers or functions to the commissioners is necessary.  Inherent in this section is a danger of its use to supersede section 3.  Section 7 could allow for something to happen which would not be allowed under section 3.  The amendment ensures that the provisions of section 7 shall not apply to the Loran C navigation system in an effort to confine all matters relevant to Loran C to section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like a case to arise where some bright genius in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources or the Attorney General's Office might propose a way of legally manipulating the system.  This amendment is specifically aimed at copperfastening the legislation to ensure there are no loopholes, apart from that in section 3, through which Loran C can be forced ahead.  I hope the Minister is aware of the motivation behind this amendment and that if he brings an order before the Houses in the future to enable Loran C go ahead he will be able to amend the <Col N="519" /> legislation.  Many of the concerns and fears of people in west Clare would be allayed if this amendment were accepted.  Development of the Loran C system is definite as almost £1 million has already been spent on it, otherwise that amount of Exchequer money would not have been spent.</P>

      <P>The steps we have taken earlier in section 3 ensure that nothing can go ahead unless and until it is decided by debate in both Houses.  We are effectively back to the same point.  My amendment to section 3 makes more than adequate provision for this.  I understand what Senator Taylor-Quinn is doing.  She is just trying to add that the provisions of this section shall not apply in the case of the Loran C navigation system.  I am advised by the Attorney General that it is not necessary or appropriate to insert this amendment into section 7 in view of my amendment to section 3.</P>
      <P>As amended, section 3 deals comprehensively with the Loran C issue and, because it is primary legislation, it would override any order purported to be made under section 7, even if, as is most unlikely, a future Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources were to contemplate such a course of action.  I assure the House that I will not do so.</P>
      <P>For that reason, the matter is comprehensively covered by my amendment to section 3.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>There is a motion on the Order Paper in connection with the effects of microwave transmitters. Unfortunately I was not here in 1989 when the MMDS franchises were granted by the Oireachtas but I am sure Senator Taylor-Quinn was a Member of the Dáil on that occasion.

      <P>The 1894 Act is British legislation. The previous Government gave a commitment to repeal all such legislation and I believe that should be done.  Given that we are in breach of various conventions and human rights legislation, will the Minister indicate the stage we have reached in respect of updating the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894?  Commitments were given to the Council of Europe that the legislation would be updated.  However, as a maritime country, Ireland remains dependent on outdated legislation from 1894.  That is completely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 has been ruled out of order.  However, if the Minister considers the provisions in sections 221 and 225 of the 1894 Act he will see that the legislation is Victorian.  I intend no disrespect to the officials of the Department. It is the Minister's responsibility to ensure the legislation required to meet current maritime conditions is put in place.  After all, it is not as if a large volume of legislation has passed through the Department of the Marine over the years.  It is time legislation to update the position was forthcoming.</P>
      <P>A commitment was made to the Council of Europe which took issue with the Government that new legislation in this area would come before the Houses before the end of 1996.  Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe which is still governed by this outdated legislation.  A commitment must be given to our fishing and maritime industries to update the 1894 Act, because that is what is required.  There is no point in dealing with outdated legislation.  Will the Minister provide a specific timescale for the introduction of proper and long overdue legislation in this area?</P>

That Bill is being drafted in the parliamentary draftsman's office and it should be published later this year or early next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.  The Commissioners shall not have power under this Act to provide maritime navigational assistance to the military vessels or aircraft of a state, or an organisation of states, which is participating in a war or engaged in any other form of armed aggression unless the assent of Dáil Éireann has first been obtained.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Given people's concerns about neutrality and the context of this Bill, it is important that we differentiate between those States participating in a war and those engaged in other forms of armed aggression.  I withdrew other amendments because I agreed with the Minister about the responsibilities of the Commissioners of Irish Lights or anyone involved in search and rescue operations during peacetime.  All our facilities should be made available to anyone in difficulty. We are differentiating between that aspect of the Bill and inclusion of a specific reference to those engaged in war.</P>
      <P>In the Gulf War, after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, a United Nations mission stopped over in Shannon but the Houses of the Oireachtas had to be brought back to give sanction to that operation, which it did by an overwhelming majority.  However, people are still concerned about our neutrality, especially during war, which is why this amendment is now proposed. Our people cherish neutrality and they should be able to have confidence in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Senators may argue that the amendment puts ordinary seafarers at risk but it does not.  In normal times when there is no war, the facilities of the State are available to save people.  The amendment refers to countries participating in war and it would go against the wishes of the <Col N="523" /> people to make the facilities of the State available in such cases, unless the consent of Dáil Éireann is granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Ryan's amendment which keeps our Constitution to the forefront.  Any action taken must be constitutional and no legislation should provide otherwise. This amendment is important because, as the Senator said, the Houses of the Oireachtas have had to meet in the past to allow war materials to travel through this country and war planes to stop over in Shannon.  The amendment should refer to armed manoeuvres as well as armed conflict.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we mentioned the ability of technology to pick up signals.  Planes are easy to spot because there are very few airports.  If planes land they are obvious and become a source of public discussion.  Sea going vessels are much less obvious because fewer people can see them, particularly in the case of submarines.  That, however, is no justification for not legislating prudently to protect the Constitution and ensure it is adhered to at all times.  Our neutrality should not be altered until a referendum is held.  Any legislation which may empower a Department or its agent to take unconstitutional action is unacceptable.  This amendment is wise and prudent in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Ireland is supposed to be a nuclear-free zone and nuclear powered submarines should not be assisted by the Commissioners of Irish Lights or by any navigational aid system they supply outside our waters.  While military manoeuvres take place in the north Atlantic, we should not provide assistance to it while publicly appearing to be a nuclear-free zone.  If we are nuclear free, we should not provide navigational aid to nuclear powered submarines.  The amendment is highly commendable and I hope the Minister can accept it.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights are subject to the general supervision of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources in this jurisdiction in regard to all matters which come within their sphere of operation. The funding system under which they operate would not allow them to undertake any new projects in relation to radio navigation aids without the express approval of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources subject to specific funds being made available.  They are not free agents operating within our jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn spoke of stopping over and refuelling at Shannon.  That is a totally separate matter for the Government of the day.  The Government decides on that.  One may disagree with the Government of the day but it comes <Col N="524" /> within the competence of the Government and the Department concerned.</P>
    <P>We are discussing navigational aids broadcasting on the air waves.  Anyone can pick up readings of their bearings.  We are back to this discussion of the GPS system.  The system is there and anybody with the proper equipment can use it.  The United States can restrict the system's use if they desire.</P>

If we wanted to switch it off we could, but we would have to ensure people would be able to calculate their positions by other means.  In normal circumstances the navigational aids are there whether they are buoys, beacons or signals on the air waves.</P>
      <P>There is no question here that relates to neutrality. That is an issue for the Government of the day to decide on.  There is the question of humanitarian rescue.  If people are lost at sea from a passing vessel, no matter what type of vessel it is, the standard humanitarian tradition of sea rescue would come into operation, as it did in wartime.</P>

If it happens that those people have to be held as prisoners of war that is the procedure.  I see no need for this amendment. It is unnecessary.  That issue is well covered in the Bill.  I understand what Senator Seán Ryan is getting at: it is a residual of the Loran C issue which was dealt with in section 3, as to who controls the output of the system's signals.  We discussed this at some length earlier and I see no need to be concerned about it.

      <P>We are not talking about a normal operation. In a normal case we would endeavour to save those in distress at sea.  Those are normal operations which are carried out to international standards and long may our nation apply them.  We have applied them in various other areas including peacekeeping, where we put ourselves at risk to save people.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that, in war, we can switch off the appliances that may be required, but if a submarine sets off to attack another country I assure the Minister it will not depend on the Loran C system to get it from point A to B because it will have its own navigational mechanisms on board.</P>
      <P>The commissioners will not have control over all the activities taking place either in our airspace or territorial waters, or even underwater.  A specific request to use our navigational facilities in pursuance of war is not in line with the Constitution or the aspirations of the people.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party wants this amendment incorporated into the Bill, while at the same time acknowledging that even though it is inserted, the commissioners may not have much control over it.  At least it puts down a marker that this country will not be engaged in such activities.  I ask the Minister to take the amendment on board and incorporate it in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate this Bill has gone so far through the Houses of the Oireachtas and that it has now reached its Final Stage in the Seanad.  It first came about because of High Court and Supreme Court cases taken by the people of west Clare.  The Supreme Court ruled on one point only which was that the Loran C mast was not a beacon under the 1894 Act and, thus, the Commissioners of Irish Lights were acting <i>ultra vires</i> their powers under that Act.  The court said nothing about any other functions of the Commissioners of Irish Lights, with which the Bill deals.</P>
      <P>All the Minister had to say was that one could imply from the Supreme Court judgment that the commissioners did not have powers in a variety of other functions and hence this Bill.  However, the Bill was brought forward because of implication or supposition from a judgment of the Supreme Court.  If the Minister and his Department were sincere in their concern about the implications of the court decision they simply had to introduce a short Bill to amend the 1894 Act stating that all systems in effect in Irish waters as of the date of passing of the Bill should be deemed to be validly operated by the commissioners. Instead of that we have had a substantial Bill presented.</P>
      <P>The underlying, hidden agenda is the Loran C issue.  We must remember that in 1985 a memo on that issue was sent from a member of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to the Department of the Marine.</P>

      <P>There is a memo dated 12 April 1985 sent by the chief executive officer of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to Mr. Richard Ryan, a commissioner in the Department of the Marine, clearly specifying that the commissioners lacked powers under the 1894 Act to operate Loran C and that new legislation was necessary.

Why, when they were beaten in the High Court, did they get permission to proceed to lodge an appeal to the Supreme Court?  I would like to know the real reason someone in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is pushing this legislation.  The reality is that either the Department or CIL is haphazard and does not have a lot of care how it spends public money.  It is clear from what the Minister said today that almost £1 million has been spent for the promotion and establishment of Loran C, that these agencies and the Department allowed this money to be spent although they did not have the statutory power to do so; they will only have the statutory power when this Bill is passed.  Yet they exercised powers two and three years in advance of being given such powers.  I find that extraordinary and I hope we get an explanation which has not been forthcoming today or in the debate in either House up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation has one purpose only &mdash; to get a Loran C mast erected on Loop Head.  In excess of £500,000 has been spent in the purchase of land, £50,000 has been spent to store the mast outside Paris and almost another £500,000 has been spent on what we do not know.  All this has <Col N="528" /> been done without the legal and statutory powers to do so.  It has been authorised by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Commissioners of Irish Lights and probably by the Department of Finance.  However, it is only when this Bill is passed that these agencies will have the power to take these steps.  Since this question has not been answered the legislation before us is flawed.</P>

      <P>I was out of order using that formula of words so I withdraw my remarks.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Committee Stage debate, I find some of the views conveyed by Senator Taylor-Quinn strange.  I believe Senator Taylor-Quinn believes her views are valid; there seems to be a degree of paranoia about the motives of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources in relation to the purposes of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Looking at the reasons given for the various sections in the Bill &mdash; I am sure the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Barrett, did some work on it &mdash; and examining the Minister's decision to take the Loran C dimension out of the Bill, although it is being asserted that it is still centre stage, I cannot accept that as being logical.  Having listened to views about the potential collusion, military exercises or wartime military activities, even if one were to go along with the view that we refuse to provide maritime navigation assistance to the military vessels or aircraft of a State engaged in war &mdash; because that seemed to be a fairly central part of the Opposition's concerns about the Bill &mdash; there are many cases at sea and in the air where vessels involved in military manoeuvres or wartime activities find themselves in peril.  They may call upon the assistance of navigational aids.  Is the Opposition suggesting that elements of the Bill should not be enacted because they would enable help to be provided to such vessels?  It is contradictory to suggest that a vessel of destruction in distress, with a potential huge loss of life, should be denied all forms of navigational aid by the State.</P>

      <P>I refute the comments made by Senator Liam Fitzgerald which typically misrepresented the amendment we proposed and which Fianna Fáil Members, acting against their principles on neutrality, voted against.  We put much thought into making this a better Bill but the Minister was not prepared to accept the amendments we considered necessary to ensure the constitutionality of the legislation.</P>
      <P>In view of the strength of our position in the House we have had to accept the Minister's position. He made a number of commitments regarding the purposes of the Bill and his intentions for the legislation. Given the spirit of the debate, I have no doubt he will honour those commitments.  I will monitor the issue.</P>
      <P>I wish the commissioners well in implementing the provisions of this legislation.  They have done a good job on behalf of the State.  I also wish well those involved in research and safety around our coastlines.  I hope the State will give them all the support they need as far as possible.  I welcome the commitment by the Minister to introduce maritime legislation, which is long overdue.</P>

      <P>Serious allegations have been made to the effect that civil servants in my Department have had information available to them all the time but did not act on it.  This is based on a memo supplied on 12 April 1985 to Mr. Richie Ryan for transmission to Deputy Jim Mitchell, the then Minister for Communications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing sinister or hidden about this matter.  The memo was dealt with when Fine Gael was in Government in 1985.  It shows how a document can be taken out of context and misrepresented.  It is yet another example of misrepresentation. I am surprised this issue has been mentioned again.  I thought Fifth Stage was an opportunity for Members to pass general comments, not to deal again with issues already covered comprehensively on other Stages.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, in 1985 when Deputy Jim Mitchell was the Minister for Communications and Mr. Richie Ryan was the Chairman of the Commissioners of Irish Lights, a view was expressed regarding doubts that might arise in the future about beacons.  This was in terms of legislation generally because the Commissioners of Irish Lights operated radio and radar beacons which were deemed to be covered by the Act.  It was suggested, in case any limitations were imposed, that it might be desirable to examine the possibility of introducing legislation to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> The matter was then referred to the Attorney General.  He examined it and his response was that they were all marks and signs.  The Department of the Marine and the Commissioners of Irish Lights had legal advice to the effect that radio stations for the Decca navigation system came within the commissioners' powers to provide beacons even though such radio systems were not contemplated in 1894.  On the basis of this broad legal interpretation, it was considered that Loran C, which is a similar radio system to Decca, was within the remit of the commissioners' existing powers.  This was the legal interpretation at that time.  Nothing was hidden; there was no uisce faoi thalamh.  The matter was discussed and that was the considered view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Senator's view but it was not the view of the Attorney General at that time.  His views are taken before those of Members of this or the Lower House.  The courts have since adopted a narrower view of the commissioners' powers.  This aspect was dealt with in considerable detail during the debate because it raises many other issues.  For example, if a narrow view is taken and we stick to the type of beacons in use in 1894, which were fires lit on hills to warn ships, we are accepting that we cannot move forward and only communication of that nature was intended.</P>
      <P>The view taken by the courts was much narrower and this led to the need to introduce amending legislation.  There was nothing hidden, secret or underhand about this matter.  Different Ministers held office during this time and officials were in communication.  Nothing untoward was involved and I do not want people to have a different impression.  If that was the case, the next thing would be headlines in the newspapers about another sinister document.  I want to be clear about this matter to avoid such circumstances.  I have only been in the Department and involved in this issue a short time but that is the background to it.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I received advice from the Attorney General on amendments tabled by Senators and was assured the points about which they are concerned are covered by the legislation.  For that reason, I did not accept some of the amendments, although I accepted one of Senator Ryan's at an early stage. This is good legislation which will clarify the powers of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  We have ensured the Loran C project will not proceed unless new legislation is passed by both Houses which should please those concerned with this issue, who I understand, are happy with the way it is being handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> I thank Senators on both sides for their contribution to an interesting debate.  I assured Senator Ryan we are proceeding as urgently as possible with the new legislation.  I will follow up the point raised about lighthouses generally and their future use and preservation.</P>
