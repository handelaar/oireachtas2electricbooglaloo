      <P>I have notice from Senator Roche that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to clarify the current situation with County Wicklow vocational education committee regarding urgent repair work and a PE hall for Arklow community college.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2, 3 and 4 plus one additional item.  The additional item is in response to a request from Senator Henry and Senator Lanigan for a discussion on the turmoil in the Great Lakes area of Africa. This item will be taken for 30 minutes from 1 p.m. to 1.30 p.m.  The Minister will speak for ten minutes and other speakers will have five minutes, if that is agreed.  Item 1 will be taken from the conclusion of the Order of Business until 4 p.m.  Item 2 will be taken immediately after item 1.  Item 3 will be taken immediately after item 2 and item 4 immediately after item 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  I discussed the additional item with our spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Senator Lanigan, and he is happy with the Leader's decision. The Leader indicated that we will have a long, hard week next week.  The House will probably sit for four days discussing a variety of legislation. In view of this, is it possible for the Leader to give us an outline of what legislation will be before the House?  All legislation is important and it would be beneficial to have advance notice.  We have cooperated <Col N="718" /> well in the past and that co-operation should continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I previously raised the issue of reports reaching the newspapers before reaching Senators.  I know this is not the Leader's fault. Last night I mentioned to Deputy Gilmore a newspaper article entitled &ldquo;Marine to Devolve Some Tasks to Other Agencies&rdquo;.  This article states that a statement was issued last Monday or Tuesday by the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett.  Other people involved in marine affairs, including the Dingle harbour authority, received this statement last Monday.  It is hard to swallow that Members first read about these matters in the newspapers.  I disagree with the content of the report and that is why it should be published as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is a good Department which has grown over the last number of years.  It is now devolving many of its duties to other bodies while maintaining control.  This is not a good development.  We should debate these matters before the recess.  I have asked for a debate on fisheries.  However, both Houses of the Oireachtas should receive reports before the newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the extra item which has been added to today's business following a request from Senator Henry.  Can the Leader clarify what legislation will be taken in the coming weeks?  Whatever happens in the Dáil, the Seanad will continue to sit.  Time should be taken to ensure that Bills are passed.  For example, the Leader might clarify when the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, is to be taken.  It may impact on a small number of families, but it has an important impact on those families.  This Bill should have a particular priority despite delays elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader have an opinion on the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today which states that there is a possibility that the Minister for Finance may bring in another budget before the election?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the circulation of reports, which has been mentioned before.  We expressed our dissatisfaction when we were expected to debate issues without seeing relevant reports.  That matter was raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I understood that action was to be taken on it.  It would have been desirable for us to see the two most recent reports of the Economic and Social Research Institute, although I understand there would be no obligation to circulate them. However, reports from Government Departments should be available to Members.  It might be argued that these can be found in the Library, but the more popular ones can be difficult to <Col N="719" /> obtain and there may be a delay before one gets to read the report.  The Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution's report comments on Seanad reform.  It says that the consultative aspect of the Seanad should be improved and enhanced.  For that to happen, we should have these reports available to us.  The Leader should look at this issue.</P>
      <P>I echo earlier calls for the Leader to tell us what legislation we will be dealing with next week.  I am also concerned that Private Members' time seems to have been abandoned.  It is one of the most central parts of our work and allows the Opposition in particular to bring forward proposals to be debated.  I raised the crisis in agricultural incomes several weeks ago and suggested that, if necessary, the Government could allocate Private Members' time to deal with this matter.  I am worried that we may lose Private Members' time.</P>
      <P>Regarding the MRBI poll results, I wondered if it would allow us more time to complete the Government's legislative programme and I echo Senator O'Toole's sentiments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to inquire of the Minister for Health when the report of the National Task Force on Suicide will be published. This was due to be published at the end of last year and there were some delays, but most of the work has been completed.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter because of reports this morning that on 5 March a man hung himself after trying to have himself admitted to a psychiatric clinic and hospital some days prior to that.  He was refused admittance.  There is an urgent need to ensure that there are suicide prevention programmes introduced.  Our hospitals and clinics must understand the signs of people who are in danger of taking their own lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business I requested that a task force be set up to deal with the problems of those who have been abused while in care, and who then go on to get into trouble after their release.  I did not realise how many people would contact me over the past 12 hours in connection with this.  It is of major concern, not only for our parliamentary work but in relation to the abuse of people's civil rights, and must be looked at carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are taken into care because of problems with their upbringing, the atmosphere in which they live or the abuse they have suffered.  They are thrown out of care at a certain age and nobody keeps a register of where they go or of what problems they have after that.  This should be treated as a matter of urgency because the courts are clogged up with people who should not be there but who should have been looked after. A register should be kept of everyone who has <Col N="720" /> gone into care and State agencies should follow up on these people's progress to determine if they will continue to get into difficulty.  The calls I have received indicate that there is huge concern about this.</P>
    <P>I have asked for a debate on the National Roads Authority on many occasions.  I am frustrated, because if one travels the N9 or N10 between Dublin and Waterford, there is total gridlock between Kilkenny and Waterford and the National Roads Authority will do nothing about the entrance to and exit from Waterford. That creates huge problems because the major hospital in the south-east is on the wrong side of the river for access.  That creates huge problems in south Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny and Wexford.</P>

      <P>Will the Merchants Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997, be introduced before the end of the session?  It is of concern to people on the west coast.  Also, can the Leader confirm 6 June as the date for dealing with the Shannon River Council Bill?</P>

      <P>I renew my request for a debate on agriculture.  There is a crisis in that area. Incomes are falling in the dairy and beef sectors and the Leader indicated that he would allow time for a debate on this item before the recess. Private Members' Time was mentioned but this is so important that it should be dealt with in Government time if possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be contentious but yesterday, in the course of heated exchanges, the Leader made some suggestions about a childcare case.  Has he acquainted himself with the facts and would he like to make a statement to remove from the record the suggestion that intemperate words of mine caused a judge to remove himself from a case and caused that case to collapse? That is not what happened.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Rory Kiely in calling for a debate on agriculture, which is a very important industry.  It would allow Members an opportunity to welcome the achievement of the <Col N="721" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in having the live export of cattle resumed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped for general acclaim but at the least the IFA and farmers are happy with the Minister's achievements.</P>
      <P>Yesterday an important decision was made by the Court of Humans Rights in the trial of Dusan Tadic.  It is the first time since World War II that somebody was convicted of crimes against humanity.  People in Europe and elsewhere will recognise the importance of convictions against people who have committed such war crimes.  It was a historic ruling by a democratic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This decision is welcome and I hope more such decisions will be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot to mention there will be sos today from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.  Senator Fitzgerald and others raised the question of future business.  I remind colleagues that this House will remain in session even when the other House is not sitting.  If Senators wish to meet over the coming weeks to discuss the many reports on which debates have been requested, I will have no difficulty calling Senator Dardis and others up from the plains of County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader is very generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions can be open ended and Senators may have as much time as they wish <Col N="722" /> and come to whatever conclusions they believe may be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The legislation we hope to present to the House over the coming weeks includes the Youth Work Bill, 1997.  On the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, to which Senator O'Toole alluded, attempts are being made to try to resolve some of the problems which arose.  It is at Report State and will be presented in the coming week.  I will have a specific time for colleagues later today.  There are some local difficulties with the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997.  I understand strenous attempts are being made to reconcile these differences and to please all parties.  If that is possible, the Bill will be brought before the House.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1997, should give Senator Lanigan an opportunity to discuss the funding of roads, but not in the way he wishes.  That Bill will be taken today. We hope to deal with the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Bill, 1997, which is a short and important Bill.  I will furnish colleagues with the full list later.</P>
      <P>The Electoral Bill, 1994, will also be taken as will the Prompt Payment of Accounts Bill, 1997, for which there will be general agreement as it will oblige State boards and bodies to pay on time suppliers and those who provide services.  Small suppliers of services are often left waiting months for payment.  The ICC Bank Bill and the Bill to establish the hepatitis C tribunal on a statutory basis will also be taken.  That is the legislation I hope to present to the House over the coming weeks.  If other matters arise, the Opposition Whips and I will do everything to try to facilitate colleagues who may be involved elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Dardis raised the question of reports not being furnished to Members, which is disgraceful.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges investigated the matter and discovered that the decision on what reports would be circulated was at the discretion of staff in the Department of Finance.  We made a strong protest on behalf of the House about this practice and asked the Minister to ensure all reports are furnished to Members of both Houses as a matter of course.  It should not be left to the discretion of a well meaning civil servant who decides what is and what is not good for us and what we should or should not be allowed to read. I hope that protest will bring some positive results.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, who will be in the House shortly, will be able to give Senator O'Toole the details of his next budget.  I have no doubt the next budget will be presented by this Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> Senator Dardis made a valid point on Private Members' time.  There will be Private Members' time next week, although last week the Labour Party voluntarily gave up its time to allow for other business.  It is Fianna Fáil's Private Members' time next week and I will talk to Senator Rory Kiely after the Order of Business about his motion on agriculture to see if we could combine his Private Members' time so that we could have a longer discussion. I will issue a list of dates for Private Members' time for the rest of the session.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville raised the question of the report of the National Task Force on Suicide.  I pay tribute to the work he has done on presenting information on the reality of suicide and the suffering of families of suicide victims.  This report should be debated in the House.  I compliment Senator Lanigan on raising the question of victims of abuse.  He struck a chord in that there is a considerable problem.  If there is time, it is worth spending even an hour debating the issue. Senator Henry mentioned the debate on the Great Lakes region.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche raised a matter arising from yesterday's Order of Business.  From my point of view, things said in the heat of the moment are often better unsaid.  I put on record that I have not re-read the correspondence and I do not imply any question mark over Senator Roche's integrity.  I would hate a contrary impression to be given.  We have known each other a long time. We can discuss this matter afterwards if there is a need for further discussion.  Senator Enright raised a number of issues.  I concur with the points he made on the successes of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the confidence of all sides in the Minister.  I also commend Senator Enright for raising the issue of war crimes.  It is important that at least a small number of those who committed horrific crimes under the guise of political cover during the awful war in Bosnia should be brought to justice and that the civilised world should state that such behaviour is unacceptable.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 provides for an allowance of £4,600 for people aged between 65 and 75 years.  I bring to the Minister's attention the fact that people over 65 years and widowed who are at the exemption level of £4,600 would benefit more if they did not avail of it.  Taking the personal, age and PAYE allowances the amounts are <Col N="724" /> equivalent to £4,600 and if they were availing of the exemption of £4,600 they would pay tax at 40 per cent whereas they would only pay 26 per cent if they took the other option.  Some people in the bracket may not be aware of this and the Revenue Commissioners should let them know.  I have already come across two or three cases where people would benefit more on the 26 per cent tax rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been brought to my attention and is one of the anomalies when people move from the exemption level to the standard rate of tax.  We can arrange for the Revenue Commissioners to draw it to the attention of those affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>While I recognise the Minister has made progress in the area of income tax, tax reliefs and the changing of tax bands, I and my party are concerned about imprudent political decisions in the area of public expenditure. Notwithstanding the excellent economic conditions, there is a need for prudent management of the economy to give real and long-term tax reliefs and make real and radical changes to the tax system.</P>

      <P>Section 2 agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the substantial increases in personal allowances made by the Minister to benefit both those paying the standard rate of tax and those paying the higher rate. I also welcome the increase in the age allowance from £200 to £400.  It should be increased further because many people over 65 who are paid small pensions &mdash; for example, from county councils &mdash; are penalised for paying into a pension scheme. If this allowance can be increased in future, it will benefit our elderly citizens.  We should also examine a similar increase for people under 66 on long-term pensions, such as invalidity pension. Many of these people, as well as those on small private pensions, earn less than £100 per week, which is not a large amount of money, and they are paying tax, which is not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The area of personal reliefs is one which depends on how we manage the economy overall and the extent to which the Minister can extend such reliefs.  I endorse the last point made, especially the way pensions are treated.  People make contributions to pension schemes throughout their working lives.  The points made are not partisan or political but are ones we all share and are ones a Finance official should examine.  In fact, it is not just such an official who should examine the area when one considers the negative <Col N="725" /> impact a small professional pension can have on medical card entitlements, for example. People who have made prudent provision for old age should not be punished and there is a case for special arrangements to be made for pensions. I am sure the Minister shares that view but I am aware he has constraints, as have all Ministers for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a substantial improvement in this area as well as a recognition that elderly people have additional concerns on top of their additional costs.  Many elderly people appear to be reasonably well provided for, but that does not stop them from worrying to a point middle-aged people would regard as excessive. Their concern is real.  There is a problem with the interface between entitlement to social welfare benefits and the statutory State pension and these must be examined.  However, bearing in mind Senator Roche's previous comments, these must all be measured against existing constraints.</P>

      <P>(a) (i) by the substitution of '5 consecutive days' for '14 consecutive days' in paragraph (a) of subsection (2),</P>
      <P>(ii) by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (b) of subsection (2):</P>
      <P>`(b) one of which the individual concerned is absent from the State, and present in Northern Ireland for at least eight consecutive hours during the day,',</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(b) by the insertion of the following proviso after paragraph (c) of the proviso to subsection (3):</P>
      <P>`Provided that paragraph (b) (i) shall not apply to an employment which is subject to the provisions of Part III of Schedule 6 to the Income Tax Act, 1967, solely by reason of the employment being situated or exercised solely in Northern Ireland.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the thorny cross-Border issue, which is a difficult one for people who live on the Border. Something must be done, so in this recommendation we seek to avoid the double taxation of workers who work across the Border.  I am surprised the Minister did not make provision for <Col N="726" /> this in the Bill because it is a widely flagged concern shared by all sides of the House.  I recall Senator Maloney specifically referring to it on more than one occasion.  It would be difficult for the Minister to accept the recommendation I have tabled but there should be a commitment in principle to introducing a proposal along these lines to prevent a real problem in the Border area.  If the economies on both sides of the Border improve, especially if peace becomes a reality in the North, we could find ourselves with greater difficulties.  We are supposed to have got rid of borders and to adhere to the principle of free movement of workers and services.  It is necessary to ensure taxation regimes do not impede such free movement.  The taxation regime not only impedes it; it also actively encourages people to operate in the black economy, outside the law and in a manner disadvantageous to both tax administrations in the Republic and in the North. There is a need to resolve this.  I accept it is difficult but it is something towards which I would like to see some commitment in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been considerable debate on this and I am sympathetic to the plight of people who find themselves caught with Thatcherite salaries on the one hand and Republic of Ireland tax bills on the other.</P>
      <P>There are a number of issues involved here.  I am the first Labour Party Minister for Finance. Successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance did nothing about this issue.  The conversion of Fianna Fáil in Opposition to a sense of passion that the issue should be resolved contrasts with the extraordinary silence which characterised the occupancy of Upper Merrion Street by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance for many years, including the well respected Border Deputy, Ray MacSharry, who held the office with a good reputation. That is the first partisan observation I feel obliged to make.</P>
      <P>However, there is a thrust to the argument made by Senators Roche and Maloney and by others in the Dáil.  We should not lose sight of the standard principle in OECD countries and EU member states that taxation is paid on the basis of residence.  The Senator is asking me to upturn that principle.  Where is it to be confined if one starts?  It is not possible to deal with the issue in the context of that principle.</P>
      <P>There are ways in which the aggravation of the problem, caused by Thatcherite politics in Britain, can be reversed.  First, I set up a working party after the budget two years ago and it reported making a number of recommendations on levies which have been implemented.  Second, under Article 18 of the Double Taxation Treaty, Government employees on either side of the Border are taxed by the Government for which they work and are not deemed to be liable for tax in the jurisdiction in which they live, assuming it is different from the jurisdiction of the Government for which they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> Changes in the nature and status of employment in the United Kingdom resulted in people who previously were deemed to have worked for the Government on foot of their employment by a local health board or education board or local authority institution, now being deemed, where these boards were changed in one form or another, no longer to be directly employed by the Government and consequently were not included in the tax exemption to which I referred.  Many people who are directly involved in the cross-Border workers' campaign, some of whom I met as recently as yesterday, are directly affected by this.</P>
    <P>Since there is no loss of revenue to the United Kingdom in respect of this and since the Irish State did not seek to attract this revenue, I propose to raise the matter with my friend the new Chanacellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown.  I was unable to secure success in this regard with his predecessor or with Treasury officials.  There are ongoing negotiations between both sides and it is possible, although it is a matter for the UK authorities to decide how they wish to treat that status.  However, I will press the case with the Chancellor and that is probably the next step through which progress can be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendation, it is not possible to interfere with the principle in this manner.  Many of the arguments made by Deputies in the Dáil, which might be advanced today, referred to the problem of rural depopulation. That problem exists throughout the country and is not peculiar to County Donegal, which has been affected most by this issue and is the source of virtually all the agitation about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the latter part of the Minister's response, although I disagree with his earlier comments.  There is no need to arm wrestle on a partisan basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister recognises that particular circumstances apply in the case of County Donegal where there has been a long tradition of retaining the family home through migrant working.  The difficulty has begun to express itself more profoundly in recent years because of changes which resulted from the application of what the Minister calls Thatcherite policies in Northern Ireland.  I welcome the Minister's intention to hold discussions about this with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  It is true that depopulation is not confined to County Donegal.  However, Donegal and other Border counties have a particular characteristic pattern of living which involves working away from the home.  If we are still awaiting elections in November perhaps the Minister might be able to do something more substantial in October.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="728" /> SECTION 16.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification of this section for the heads of the Irish universities who contacted me about it.  They welcome the provisions of section 16.  From their point of view it represents a positive and constructive response by the Minister for Finance to proposals which were submitted to him last December by the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities for the consolidation of legislation on tax relief on donations to the universities.</P>
      <P>Section 16(1) provides for tax relief on donations for four categories of projects.  The universities are satisfied with the categories except (c), which deals with infrastructural projects. They are concerned that the guidelines referred to in subsection (2) (a) (i) might be constructed in a restrictive way to exclude universities from the third level institutions that will benefit from this concession.  The guidelines do not form part of the Bill and are to be drawn up by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  From the preliminary consultations between the universities and officials about the guidelines, it appears the Department of Finance wishes to exclude universities from benefiting under the tax relief concessions for donations for infrastructural development.  The Department of Education opposes such an exclusion.</P>
      <P>As the universities understand it, the Department of Finance's view is that infrastructural developments in universities would qualify only as part of a project under any or all of the other three categories of equipment, research and skills needs.  This fails to acknowledge the reality of college campus development.  It takes no account of the interlinked and interdependent use by the disparate disciplines and research programmes of a university's services, facilities, equipment and buildings, be they lecture theatres, laboratories, libraries or offices.  In many cases it would make no economic or administrative sense to design projects artificially in order to conform to the infrastructural restrictions the Department of Finance seeks to impose.</P>
      <P>The use of the guidelines to exclude universities would make nonsense of the central provision of this section, relief for gifts made to third level institutions.  The universities have no problem with the application of the subsection on infrastructural development to Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges. However, to find that universities were excluded from benefit would be ironic, if not also embarrassing, as a response to a proposal made in the first place by the universities to the Minister for Finance.  To arbitrarily separate the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology and the universities sectors does not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The universities are seeking a commitment that the guidelines referred to in section 16 (1) (c) and (2) (a) (i) will provide for the inclusion of universities <Col N="729" /> among the third level institutions to benefit from tax relief donations for infrastructural development under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Manning. On 25 March this year I raised the problems universities are currently experiencing with fund raising.  If we are obliged to separate proposals to donors into categories relating to infrastructure, laboratory equipment and so forth, we could end up making applications which might not be truthful. It would be far better if the provision were straightforward and if universities were dealt with in the same manner as regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I have a strong interest in this matter because I am a trustee of the Trinity Trust and I am aware of how difficult it would be to have two specific guidelines relating to the money being raised.  I would greatly appreciate if the Minister accepted Senator Manning's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's suggestion.  It would be perverse if this welcome measures were to discriminate against any part of the third level sector.  The request of the universities is reasonable.  I cannot believe the Minister would countenance the negative impact which the guidelines could conceivably have if they were to be implemented in the manner Senator Manning outlined.  I hope the Minister can comfort us in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the support for this measure.  It was a long time in gestation and was only finalised late in the process.  There is an element of unpredictability about this provision because we do not know how it will work.  We are giving third level institutions taxpayers' money by foregoing, in effect, money that would otherwise go to Revenue.  We are allowing the institutions to campaign for this money and are trying to ensure that third level institutions and not just the universities who are well able, as we have seen in recent days, to articulate their case, will benefit from this.  The guidelines have not been completed but the universities are in a very advantageous position in relation to attracting money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be the last person to suggest that in awarding doctorates, be they honorary or otherwise, universities are motivated by such crass concessions or considerations as contributions.  It is easier to get an honorary doctorate from Trinity College or UCD than it is from Carlow Regional Technical College.  The needs of Carlow Regional Technical College are just as strong and pressing as that of any other third level institution.  I would be more than happy to sit down with the heads of the universities to discuss the guidelines and what way we can use this system over the next couple of years.  We will have to keep it under review.  What would not be fair or reasonable is that by virtue of the status or standing of any one particular institution it would manage to attract enormous amounts of money because of the honour <Col N="730" /> and glory associated with it.  I commend the universities for the manner in which they have moved away from 100 per cent dependence on State funding to raising money on their own. Some of them have been more vigorous than others.  Some of them by virtue of their standing and status and the extent of their network of graduates have been able to access more funds than others.  This mechanism is designed to get taxpayers' money into the third level system in its entirety.</P>
    <P>Our concern in the Departments of Education and Finance is that there be a degree of equity and justice in its allocation.  Because we are into new territory and do not know how this will work there has to be an element of continuous review. With respect to the concerns expressed by Senator Manning, I would be happy to meet the heads of the universities, listen to their concerns &mdash; we are aware of some of them &mdash; undertake to see how this will function and review it.  The reason the guidelines are not in the legislation is to give us flexibility in this area because we do not know what the pattern of donation is likely to be.  It is designed to get additional funding for the third level sector.  Our recent economic performance, and I refer to the last number of years, not just one Administration, clearly testifies to the benefit of what the 1961 OECD document referred to as &ldquo;investment in education&rdquo;.  The more resources we can get into the entire spectrum of third level institutions the better.  How we do that and the way in which they will be allocated is a matter for the guidelines which will have to be kept under continuous review.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Manning's proposal and the response he has received from Senators Roche and Henry, I will be more than happy to meet the heads of universities to discuss this in some detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy with the Minister's response.  This is new territory.  The section is welcomed by everybody in third level education. It has the potential to do a great deal for investment and the continuing development of education.  I am glad the Minister is open-minded and will meet the heads of the universities and perhaps some of the registrars and that the matter will be kept under review.  If there has been a change in universities over the past ten years it is the realisation that they must go out and raise funds and that if we want our third level education to remain at a high level constant injections of funding are needed.  I am not sure about the Minister equating the awarding of honorary doctorates as something akin to simony in the middle ages.  From the point of view of somebody who was involved in fund-raising in universities, the only regret was there were not enough of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for saying the universities are well able to articulate their needs <Col N="731" /> because if they were not it would show that taxpayers' money was going down the drain.</P>
      <P>Universities are not competing against regional technical colleges for funds, they are competing internationally.  That is the problem.  If taxpayers' money, which will be used for tax relief, is not given this way we will have to ask for further money through the HEA and the Department of Education.  If we are to aspire to what the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Education and other Ministers want in the way of helping socioeconomic progress, it is essential that we are not 50 years behind in everything.  It is well recognised that we have good research workers but we need somewhere to put them.  This is an area in which we have great difficulty raising funds.  We have to compete for such funds on an international basis.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Manning, I would not like to think our doctorates were given out on the basis of &ldquo;cash for goods&rdquo; or something like that.  It is an extraordinarily difficult area with which to deal.  As one who has worked to raise funds I assure Members we do not just face competition from the regional technical college in Carlow, which is excellent and will I am sure attract funds for its own courses but, when looking for big money for infrastructural developments, one has to look abroad.  I hope we will have the Minister's support in doing so.</P>

As an ex-board member of Carlow Regional Technical College I accept everything the Minister said, there is need for investment there too.  Senator Henry made the point that the real competition is abroad and that is where we will get significant amounts of money.  I welcome the Minister's commitment.  He has gone as far as he possibly can today.  I would like to put on record that this is a very worthwhile section which I welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in section 20 are worthwhile.  The Fourth Schedule outlines farm buildings and structures for which allowances for the control of pollution apply.  What worries me and many others is the issue of farm safety.  Slurry pits, for example, are extremely dangerous.  A horrific accident occurred recently at a slurry pit in County Wicklow.  Tragedies have taken place all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Schedule, tank fences and covers, which are safety as well as environmental protection devices, are mentioned.  Do safety measures also <Col N="732" /> come into this?  There needs to be more active encouragement of farm safety.  Farm safety measures require investment and that kind of investment should attract the same basic tax breaks as any other kind of investment.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on that.</P>

      <P>The Fourth Schedule to the Bill refers to tanks and fences.  If safety issues are addressed in their funding, finance and construction, the costs will be allowable under this section. Senator Roche is right to raise farm safety.  The Health and Safety Authority has looked at the issue on a number of occasions and there is probably room for improvement.  Many of the activities associated with farming are dangerous.  Many accidents could be prevented if there was greater awareness.  Part-time farmers will also benefit from these measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 26 introduces a number of changes, some of which are welcome.  However, it seems there is a degree of inflexibility in the urban renewal scheme.  The first urban renewal scheme, which applied to Bray, had tremendous benefits because it resulted in the worthwhile development of The Maltings, the upgrading of the Town Hall and the construction of another building, perhaps less fine, on the site of the former International Hotel.  The most recent urban designation effectively supported the interests of CIE and applied to a number of sites.  It seems that Bray is not unique.  A number of areas designated in the last round of the scheme, although worthwhile, have been specific.  It would be positive and beneficial if there was some flexibility in including adjacent areas.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be parochial as it would be unfair to the Minister to mention specific areas. However, he will be familiar with part of the seafront in Bray which is immediately adjacent to an urban designated area.  The urban designation in that area, CIE's backyard effectively, will not take off.  If there was some procedure or mechanism whereby the Department could monitor urban designation areas and extend the area &mdash; in this case, to reach the seafront &mdash; they would become more viable.  The Minister will probably retort that it is up to the local authority to observe the situation early on.  Lobbying for Bray was not efficient.  There are occasions in the urban renewal scheme where the areas designated are so focused that the benefits are limited. Some flexibility is needed to allow reviews by ministerial order.  This would have the undesirable effect of the Minister being subject to direct lobbying.  However, designations need to be varied in order to achieve the overall purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision in this section for a special designated area in Rosslare Harbour, which will be beneficial.  A number of ports could benefit from a similar injection.  I did not press <Col N="734" /> this as a recommendation as it would be opportunistic. An excellent report by Forfás has been submitted to the Government, which argues that we need a new roll-on/roll-off ferry for the east coast.  Logically, Arklow should be designated as the port.  Roadstone operate a huge installation on the periphery of Arklow, which would be the ideal location for the ferry.  The hinterland of that site is subject to major investment on the Arklow by-pass and the N11.  When the Minister and his officials examine what is to be done for Rosslare, an integrated scheme for Arklow could be considered. There has been considerable road development in the area, for which we are grateful. The idea of designating the port and land for a specific port related business park should be considered.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have accepted that Arklow has been devastated over the years.  If a measure similar to those introduced for Rosslare Harbour and Knock Airport could be implemented &mdash; it would take time and should not be introduced in the Seanad by recommendation &mdash; an extraordinary breakthrough would be made in the creation of jobs.  Successive Governments, Forfás and the IDA have tried to create more jobs in Arklow, but we have not reached take-off point.  We need a politically adventurous initiative.  The intitiative regarding Rosslare is good, but I would like to see freeport status granted to the hinterland of Arklow.  There is a huge amount of public investment there and Forfás has already suggested the introduction of a roll-on/roll-off ferry.  Will the Minister consider this?</P>
    <P>There is an unusable piece of industrial land at The Murrough in Wicklow Town, of which I am sure Deputy Kavanagh has spoken to the Minister. This should also be looked at.  I welcome the provision regarding Rosslare Harbour.  As an island nation, we have never looked at our ports in a positive light.  Our island status has been looked at as negative rather than positive and we have never really invested in it.  I ask the Minister to consider an integrated programme around Arklow port.  Perhaps his officials, while implementing the Finance Bill, could look at the two ports in Wicklow which I mentioned.</P>

      <P>Some problems may arise in relation to the stipulation that 15 per cent of the work carried out under the urban renewal scheme must be completed before end July 1997.  Such problems might include ownership disputes, appeals to An Bord Pleanála and planning decisions.  It may not be possible to carry out 15 per cent of the work before this deadline.  I welcome the extension of the scheme into 1998; the Minister is to be congratulated on that initiative. The extension will serve to tidy up and complete the work in the remaining parts of many of the urban renewal districts.  Perhaps the Minister could consider waiving the July deadline stipulated in the Schedule.</P>

      <Col N="735" /> I compliment the Minister and the Government on the announcement made regarding the designation of airports.  This is particularly welcome in the western region, which has four airports &mdash; Knock, Sligo, Galway and Donegal. There has been much media attention over the past ten days in relation to Knock International Airport.  Over the past years the population in the western region has been declining, but thankfully that decline has stopped and this measure will reverse it.  We have observed the great pressure placed on services such as sewerage, transport, roads and so on in the eastern region.  No such pressure exists in the western region.  This decision will provide a new impetus to the western region and we can look forward to a new era of investment there.  The people of the west now feel that something is being done for them.</P>

      <P>The Minister should be commended on the progressive nature of section 26.  However, it is disappointing to note that Shannon town was not included in the list which was circulated.  The Shannon Chamber of Commerce made a submission and met a number of Government Ministers some time ago in the hope of getting some kind of tax incentive status for the town.  Members of the chamber of commerce were surprised to note that the extensive list published in the Finance Bill did not include Shannon town.  Many of us were given to understand that there would be no change in the urban renewal scheme until such time as the existing scheme had been completed, although I appreciate that what <Col N="736" /> is included here differs somewhat to the general nature of the urban renewal scheme currently in place.</P>
      <P>Shannon town is a unique young satellite town which does not have the traditional centre and backing a normal town has.  However, the population in the town is ageing and it is beginning to experience an increase in unemployment levels due to redundancies.  The problems traditionally associated with other towns are now being experienced in Shannon.  The Shannon Chamber of Commerce, which is a newly formed and progressive group, presented a specific case for Shannon town.  The town is a very separate entity to the Shannon Free Zone and interaction between the two is limited.  Many of the people operating in the zone live in Limerick and other parts of Clare.  There is a genuine case for the provision of some kind of tax incentive to the town in order that it can bring a new dimension to it which is essential at this time.  I trust the Minister will look favourably on this and will be in a position, when he prepares his October budget, to include Shannon town in some kind of tax incentive scheme which may not necessarily be the urban renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>Kilrush and Lisdoonvarna also made applications for inclusion in the urban renewal scheme. Their applications are currently with the Minister for the Environment.  I realise this is not a matter specifically for the Minister for Finance and that applications are referred to him by the Minister for the Environment.  I ask the Minister to consider the position of these towns, which are located in the extreme west of County Clare in an area of declining population.  There is a real need to provide an incentive to bring life back into these towns.</P>
      <P>We constantly talk about regionalisation, and if we are serious about regionalisation policy we must provide incentives to towns in the west of Ireland to renew industry and commercial activity in these towns.  Providing money to towns which are already buoyant and which have a high level of economic activity defeats the purpose of the scheme.  Infrastructure is under-utilised in some towns while others are bursting at the seams and require new infrastructure to be put in place.  The applications from towns such as Kilrush and Lisdoonvarna must be considered in that light.</P>

      <P>I want to deal comprehensively with the points made by the Senators.  Of the urban renewal schemes introduced in 1986, seven have, by and large, been very successful.  They have also been very expensive.  The schemes directed investment which existed in the market economy into specific locations where it might not otherwise have gone.  The purpose of the scheme was to address issues of urban dereliction which were manifest throughout the country.  We have extended the existing allocation of urban renewal sites for one year.  We gave notice of this in January of this year and the consultants' report was also published at that time.  The report was a <Col N="737" /> comprehensive evaluation carried out on an economic and urban planning and design basis. The consultants made a number of recommendations for the next generation of urban renewal designated areas.  The Department of the Environment is preparing guidelines which will be issued shortly to all local authorities, including those in County Wicklow to which Senator Roche referred.  These guidelines will enable local authorities to prepare substantial and well presented cases for urban renewal.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid local politics and the choices associated with it, the whole of County Leitrim was submitted for urban renewal status.  While that may have been a wonderful decision on behalf of every county councillor in Leitrim, it was a lunatic decision from the point of eliciting a response from the Department of the Environment and there was disappointment when the county was not granted urban renewal status.</P>
      <P>The points made by Senator Roche regarding particular sites and areas can be raised in the course of the evaluation and preparatory work which will now be undertaken.  It is reasonable to assume that the pre-planning process involved in acquiring a site, getting planning permission, etc. can take between four and six months and we are only talking about the existing regime being extended for another year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of cost raised by Senator Burke, 15 per cent must be incurred by July.  This includes professional fees and site acquisition. Developers are aware of this since January and I am aware of a case where an application has only been lodged in the last number of weeks.  This is not necessarily the same case to which the Senator has alluded.  The application has been lodged on foot of an option to purchase the site rather than a specific commitment.  If the option is converted into a purchase and if the purchase in on the margins of 15 per cent, it will be deemed to qualify.  However, changing the legislation because someone has entered the process at a late stage is not acceptable and I am not prepared to do it.  We have debated this issue on Committee Stage in the other House.  People have been given sufficient notice, namely, six months in which to incur the 15 per cent cost &mdash; a reasonable amount &mdash; and that period has not yet elapsed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the tour of Clare raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are a number of existing designated areas in Clare.  I know the Senator was speaking in the context of urban renewal for Shannon but there has been similar designation for other parts of Clare.  While this section does not deal with it, there is also a pilot seaside resort scheme.  I received requests for 69 additional seaside resorts to be added to the existing 15.  In some cases designation has not resulted in significant <Col N="738" /> activity.  The concept of the scheme was to give an extended economic life to traditional seaside resorts whose primary market had been overtaken by package holidays to Spain, etc.  We must allow the pilot scheme run its course before evaluating it.</P>
      <P>A further 12 months is provided for existing designated areas to complete work already in progress or embark upon new work between now and 1 July.  Senators who are members of local authorities or actively involved in their local authority area can ensure that local authorities prepare proper submissions which focus on the way in which these provisions can be taken advantage of.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the consultant's report was that, rather than large swathes of area being designated, the focus should be on specific sites.  My preference is to enhance the value of publicly owned land.  Joint ventures can be undertaken between the statutory body, be it a local authority or State company, and private enterprise to ensure integrated development.  A successful example of this can be seen in Clonmel where the local authority accommodation was upgraded and refurbished in the course of an urban renewal project.</P>
      <P>The points raised regarding regional development in Arklow or Wicklow are, not relevant to this debate.  However, I have listened to what has been said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The process initiated involves local authorities &mdash; Shannon has a town commission which can argue its case &mdash; submitting schemes to the county authority which in turn can submit a proposal for urban designation or renewal or tax incentive status to the Department of the Environment.  The Department of Finance becomes involved when the Department of the Environment has made its evaluation of the various projects and proposals received from local authorities.  We approach it on the basis that there is a certain amount of capacity in our revenue expectations that enables us to forego a certain sum of money which is deemed to represent <Col N="739" /> in terms of construction or tax foregone a square metre of development.  If a total area is proposed for designation, an assessment is made of its capacity, a price is put on it and the area is then pared back to the price and capability in notional budget terms of how much we propose to designate in terms of tax foregone.</P>
      <P>It is up to Shannon to convince Clare County Council and for the council to make a convincing case to the Department of the Environment.  It would not be possible to do this in the context of the October budget and it would be misleading to say otherwise.  Provision could be made in the budget to have a successor to the existing urban renewal scheme when it expires in July 1998 and we will have to examine how this can be done in consultation with the Department of the Environment. In order to allow people plan for that, the sooner local authorities submit their own proposals the better.  The Government, through the Department of the Environment, will shortly be issuing guidelines for the preparation of new proposals.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke's request regarding An Bord Pleanála is reasonable and I will bring it to the attention of the board through the Minister for the Environment.  We do not wish to influence the decisions of the board but to give priority to those schemes whose status could otherwise be in jeopardy.  It is difficult to get building contractors or service professionals in some areas, but this begs the question whether we need tax designation in those instances.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, in the absence of the Minister, I made the point that I welcome these changes.  We lost track somewhat with the changes that were made in the previous Finance Act concerning section 38 funds for the film industry.  I always have doubts about the idea of a cap, even though it goes up to a rather generous £15 million.  Hopefully, that will operate.</P>
      <P>We have the only working film studio in the country in Bray.  I was saddened some time ago that the studio was forced to sell its back lot because it was in difficult times.  It was an imprudent move in my view.  The land was rezoned and is now housing authority land.</P>
      <P>While there are many interesting artefacts in the studios, many more of them, along with the property room, had to be sold off because of cash constraints.  That was a bad mistake.  I wonder if some way could be found through the tax system to encourage film studios to hold onto film artefacts?  In addition to the film itself, sets, props, property and other studio items form an interesting part of the national film heritage.  The only way such a facility film studio can retain any of these things is if there is some incentive or inducement to do so.  I accept it is not an issue the Minister can resolve today, but it may be something that the Minister, coming from an architectural background, will recognise has value.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that they sold off land and the entire property shop a few years ago.  It was a great tragedy because there were some interesting artefacts there that are now decorating pubs.  In one famous case, a torture cage is decorating somebody's front sitting room, which just goes to show that it takes all kinds.  The artefacts were associated with some of the bigger film productions that have been made here over the years, going back to the time the studios opened.  Perhaps at some stage in the future the Minister and his Department could consider ways of protecting film artefacts by way of some form of tax inducement.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes that have been made in this section, which help to put us back on track.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, for the development of the film industry.  Is it necessary to propose capping for investment in films?  After all, films bring a great amount of employment to peripheral rural areas, which are good settings for films. Films such as &ldquo;Broken Harvest&rdquo;, &ldquo;Buttons&rdquo; and &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; were made in West Cork. Another film was made in Crookhaven some years ago.  Such film projects bring tremendous employment and revenue through accommodation and other means to an area where there are few alternatives for employment.  Is such capping necessary?  Because they require a large financial investment, capping may be a hindrance to big budget films.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to what Senator Roche said with respect to Ardmore Studios.  The studios will benefit from the tax provisions in this section because post-production work will now attract a tax incentive and that will reinforce the economic base of Ardmore.  It they wish to look at the possibility of some kind of film archive for sets, that would be a matter they could, in theory, discuss with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cap, which Senator Calnan mentioned, we have doubled the amount of money &mdash; it has gone from £7 million to £15 million, which is a substantial amount.  In effect, we are foregoing this taxpayers' money in order to stimulate activity.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that Deputy Higgins has simply been the best Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht the country has ever had.  He has transformed the film industry, much to the chagrin and annoyance of people who, like Deputy O'Malley, thought he would go mad in Government. As colleagues at our party conference said on another occasion, if this is madness let us have more of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins has not only transformed the whole perception of culture away from the hallowed elitist stance in which it was viewed by many people to a much more accessible one.  In the course of that, as the Senator rightly said, he has introduced an element of economic activity and employment to parts of the country that would not otherwise have benefited from it.</P>
      <P>The cap, at £15 million, is a generous amount of money, and I do not propose to increase it.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 72, before section 52, but in Chapter II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;52.&mdash;(1)  With effect from 5th April, 1997, any person or company making a qualifying donation to a specified charity shall be entitled to a reduction in income tax or corporation tax payable in respect of any year thereafter equivalent to the amount of income lax or corporation tax otherwise payable by such person in respect of the amount of the qualifying donation.</P>
      <P>(2)  In this section, `qualifying donation' means any sum which is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  not less than £250 net,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> (ii)  bona fide paid without any collateral agreement or arrangement of benefit, direct or indirect to the taxpayer,</P>
    <P>(iii)  satisfactorily disclosed in writing to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(3)  In this section `specified charity' means a charitable body or association nominated by the Minister for Finance which complies with such conditions in relation to its charitable activities and in relation to its works as may be specified by the Minister from time to time.</P>
    <P>(4)  The reduction awardable under this section shall not, as regards an individual exceed £5,000, or as regards a company, exceed £50,000 in respect of any given tax year.</P>
    <P>(5)  The provisions of this section are without prejudice to other legal provisions relating to tax reductions in respect of charitable donations by individuals or companies.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the submission that has been made by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  In effect what we want the Minister to do &mdash; it is perhaps more clearly expressed in recommendation No. 5 &mdash; is to give domestic charities the same status which was given some time ago to charities dealing with non-domestic cases.</P>
    <P>The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group has put forward a cogent argument in favour of the proposition that is made in a diverse way in both recommendations Nos. 2 and 5.  It is basically arguing that the cost is not extensive.  In the face of the huge amount of competition for funds that charities need, it argues for the kind of support we are recommending.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not a hard-hearted man.  He is aware of the difficulties that charities find themselves in.  They are being squeezed on so many different sides.  We depend on volunteerism to a degree which is quite unprecedented.  It is one of the great positive aspects of Irish life, but from time to time it needs to be underpinned.  Things have changed in recent years.  For example, the lottery has had a profound impact on charities. The tax concessions being promoted by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group are reforms which should be accepted by the Minister.  In particular, it argues that the cost is not extensive.  It believes the cost would be of the order of £2 million to £3 million per year, but the benefits would extend far beyond that.</P>
    <P>In many cases where charities are starved of funds, if they do not receive the money in the manner outlined in recommendations Nos. 2 and 5, undoubtedly they will have to come back to the State looking for those funds.  The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group has carried out extensive research on the issue and its figures stand up to scrutiny.  One of the problems is that the Finance Bill was well cast before this set of proposals was made.  I know, however, that there have been <Col N="743" /> lengthy discussions between advisers, programme managers and the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  I hope the Minister can respond positively to these propositions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been extensive discussion on this matter.  I initiated it all when I introduced my first budget, which included the tax deduction facility against personal income tax for donations to Third World charities.  When I was told by Department of Finance officials that if I opened the door to the Third World charities I would inevitably generate this kind of demand, I said I would resist it.  I am not disposed to accept this proposal for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>First, from the point of view of regulation, control and guarding against abuse, there is no proper system to register and regulate charities at present and anybody who is familiar with the area would realise this.  There is not even an accurate register of those charities which are still active. We know what constitutes a registered charity but we have limited information beyond that.  In order to open charities to this kind of flow of income, which every registered charity would be eligible to claim, there would need to be some system of supervision and regulation, which does not exist at present.</P>
      <P>Under the present regime there would be nothing to prevent directors availing of a loophole in the Finance Bill such as that which the directors of a particular company used to establish a scholarship from the company's proceeds, the beneficiaries of which &mdash; it will come as no surprise &mdash; were the children of the directors. This occurred after we had eliminated tax relief on covenants, to which a rapidly increasing number of people had availed in a short period.  I am not suggesting that the group of charities which put forward this case had this in mind because it is, as the Senator would readily agree, a highly reputable group.  However, the process of regulation and control is important because we would not be introducing this tax measure just for this particular group of charities, which do excellent work.</P>
      <P>Second, this recommendation is not confined to individual incomes as it seeks to allow relief for corporate donations.  The sums involved could be quite substantial and there would be potential for a massive unquantifiable loss of revenue.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that most domestic charities are in receipt of substantial taxpayers' money through State grants of one kind or another if they operate in the health or caring sectors.  Obviously, different charities receive different sums of money depending on the way in which they complement Government policy in the area of social services; but, by and large, they receive substantial sums of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that some charities, whose income depended on lottery-type revenue, have been squeezed, to use Senator Roche's phrase, and are experiencing difficulties.  I am in the process of <Col N="744" /> looking at the possibility of introducing a charities' fund using some of the proceeds from the lottery reserve fund to facilitate some of the larger charities which have encountered considerable losses or a downturn in revenue.  I would prefer to deal with this issue in that particular way rather than accept a recommendation along these lines.  It simply is not possible to accept this recommendation because of the open-ended nature of the present status in law of these charities and of their regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulties because, as he said, the law has been lax in this regard &mdash; we lack a register of charities.  All the charities which would benefit from this recommendation are well known, active charities which are limited companies.  As a result, they must comply with the requirements of auditors and the Companies' Office.  The fact that we have not established a register of charities would not necessarily mean that the recommendation would open the floodgates to every group of chancers which might form and call itself a charity.</P>
      <P>Second, the charities section of the Revenue Commissioners carries out audits on organisations, so the bona fides of any organisation benefiting from this recommendation would come under the scrutiny of that section, which is located at Nenagh, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Third, an initiative in relation to registered charities is currently on the desk of Minister of State, Ms Burton, who has indicated an intention to introduce legislation on fund-raising arising from the recommendations of an advisory group.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that many of the voluntary organisations receive substantial funding from the State.  They actually take the place of the State in providing many services, particularly in the health and welfare fields, to which the Minister referred.  The problem is that the charities, and not just those who had received money from lotteries or fund-raising activities which have been shut down or curtailed by the national lottery, feel they are being squeezed.  Mr. Brian Harvey's report suggested that lottery support for charities amounts to between only 7 and 11 per cent of the funds raised.  Departments and Government agencies spend 63 per cent of the national lottery funds.  In fact, the national lottery is displacing money which would otherwise have gone to charities.  This is not a recent phenomena. It is something about which we all complain when we move from Government to Opposition, but it is a valid argument.</P>
      <P>The submissions which have been made to the Department deserved a more positive response.  I regret that these recommendations are not being accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 72, before section 52, but in Chapter II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;52.&mdash;The Third Schedule to the Finance Act, 1995, is hereby amended by the addition of the following to the list of qualifying resort areas:</P>
      <P>`Bray Seafront between the seashore and the railway line.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Recommendations Nos. 3 and 4 concern the seaside resorts scheme.  The Minister will forgive me if, in the current climate, I am parochial in this matter.  It is not a parochialism which has arisen recently.  When the seaside resorts scheme was first introduced, I was one of those here who welcomed it, as the Minister will be aware.  I thought it was adventurous, but I was incredulous that both Bray and Arklow, County Wicklow, were excluded from the scheme.  I acknowledge that the Minister generously accepted the case for Arklow and included that town in the renewed and extended scheme.</P>
      <P>The arguments which the Minister put forward last year when I made this recommendation with regard to Bray held a great deal of validity.  The Minister's argument at that time was that to bring a large town the size of Bray into the seaside resort scheme would not have been a practical proposition, and I accepted it.  I re-examined the issue and had my colleagues in the other House table a modest proposition in amendments on Committee and Report Stages this year, that is, that Bray seafront between the seashore and the railway line should be included in the scheme.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give very careful consideration to this recommendation.  He will be aware that the seafront in Bray was once a glorious place.  It has some fine architectural features. It has now fallen into disrepair and the sea front is seriously in need of an injection of life.  My proposition intends to induce a number of specific investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a letter by hand this morning from the Bray Chamber of Commerce.  I am glad it has shown an interest in the issue because there was not a great deal of effective lobbying in the past. The letter states that no hospital, third level institution, Army barracks, Civil Service office, prison or State-sponsored bodies are located at Bray.  In fact, the only office of a State-sponsored body situated at Bray was part of Coillte but it has since been relocated.  Effectively, there is no Government sponsored establishment in Bray. The first urban renewal scheme granted to Bray, which missed out on the local employment schemes, proved beneficial but the second urban renewal scheme has not been successful.  The <Col N="746" /> Government has not decentralised part of any Department to Bray.  With its many advantages, Bray has not managed to attract the right kind of investment.</P>
    <P>The recommendation fulfils all of the requirements which might be set down by the Minister and his Department.  The Minister outlined that in the next phase of urban designation he would like specific targets to be set and intimated that land should not be rezoned in the mere hope that investors might be attracted.  When I pressed the issue of the seaside resorts scheme last year, a particular business group had accumulated £2.5 million for an investment at the southern end of the seafront in Bray.  Unfortunately, that money has been invested in another project.  There is a proposal to demolish one of the less salubrious buildings on the northern end of the esplanade in Bray and build a hotel in its place.  However, this depends on the provision of some sort of inducement.</P>
    <P>I intend to press the recommendation to the full because a bad mistake was made in respect of Bray in last year's extension of the seaside resort scheme.  Bray should have been included.  I believe that if our Dáil representatives had lobbied the Minister more vociferously he would have acceded to including the entire east ward of Bray between the main street and the seafront in the seaside resort scheme.  There can be no cogent argument against extending that scheme to an area of approximately 200 acres which was built in Victorian times and which has now fallen from its former splendour.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the tax-induced investment I propose.  I ask the Minister to give me the benefit of the doubt and allow this project to proceed.  Bray has already lost £2.5 million worth of investment.  People are interested in investing in Bray but they will go elsewhere if action is not taken.  The Minister may make the point that the seaside resort scheme was extended last year but he is aware that while it has been successful in certain areas the take-up in other regions has been disappointing.  I assure him that there will be an immediate take-up in Bray if he accepts the recommendation.  I strongly urge him to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not know why there should be discrimination against Bray.  It appears that during the past number of weeks there are few towns or areas which did not get what they wanted from the Government in the run up to the election.  We have witnessed the extraordinary ease with which regional airports were given special designation and seen the Government's willingness to confer such designation on areas where Members seats are in danger.  If the recommendation is not accepted, it will be the first time that any proposal has been refused by the Government during the past few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently visited Bray and he is aware that it is neglected.  Whereas the proposal to include Bray on the list of qualifying resort <Col N="747" /> areas may or may not have merit when compared with the claims of other seaside towns, it has merit in respect of the criteria used to give designation to special interest groups in recent months. If the recommendation is not accepted, there must be political reasons for not giving Bray the sort of preference given to other areas.  Bray does not have a Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>It has two very active Senators.  I take my hat off to Senator Roche who is a more active local representative than me.  However, I represent Bray on Wicklow County Council.  I believe that, whatever the merits of this case and those of giving money to renewal schemes in various areas at this time, Bray has as much right to receive special designation as Knock Airport.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that an injection of this sort would be particularly beneficial to Bray which is a poor, neglected town and an area of high unemployment.  For reasons which I do not understand, Bray did not benefit when one of the Minister's colleagues in Government recently awarded swimming pools to any town in County Wicklow with political clout.  On this occasion the case for not conferring seaside resort status on Bray is unanswerable because of the benefits it would bring to the people of the town.  It is certainly unanswerable in the present political climate when everyone else has been pushing at an open door.  Special status has been granted to sensitive areas, which will benefit enormously in the next number of weeks, where the Government hopes to win seats and votes in the general election.  A decision against Bray would discriminate against the town in a way it does not deserve.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the points made in respect of Bray.  I appeal to the Minister that if further urban renewal or seaside resort schemes are granted, consideration should be given to small, family run businesses in preference to larger concerns.  There has been a recent trend whereby large hotels and retail businesses have taken over seaside resorts and urban renewal areas to the detriment of small family run businesses. I refer to businesses operated by husbands, wives and their families which employ one to two additional staff.  These should receive concessions <Col N="748" /> over and above those given to larger business concerns.</P>

      <P>I welcome the incentive schemes for resorts, one of which has been quite successful in Ballybunion.  However, some people use these schemes for the purpose of obtaining tax writeoffs. I agree with Senator Burke that the concessions granted to traditional family businesses should be enhanced.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche and I tabled a recommendation in respect of the Inishowen peninsula and I ask the Minister to investigate the case of this deserving cause.  Serious consideration should be given to the entire programme, particularly in connection with traditional resorts such as Ballyheigue in County Kerry.  Package holidays have interfered with these resorts over the years and they need an injection to regenerate them.  More facilities must be provided and I ask that the Inishowen Peninsula be included.</P>

      <P>Will this initiative be reviewed? Bundoran, which is on the border with County Leitrim, has been designated for special tax status.  The nearest village, which is less than two miles away, is Kinlough in County Leitrim.  It has suffered a severe drop in population, primarily because of a lack of economic activity.  This initiative will hopefully generate more economic activity in Bundoran; but, unfortunately, a byproduct of it will be that it will take even more away from the economic regeneration of that area of north Leitrim.  Having identified the qualifying areas, will the Minister examine this anomaly in the initiative?  One community will benefit while another one nearby will be adversely affected by it.  The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the area is covered by two local authorities.  Leitrim is a maritime county and has the shortest stretch of shoreline in Ireland. There are approximately two miles of it at Tullaghan. Will the scenario I have outlined be addressed?</P>

However, I hope other areas along the west Cork coast will receive similar treatment to Clonakilty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme originated when Deputy McCreevy was Minister for Tourism and Trade and Mr. Padraig Ó hUiginn was chairman of Bord Fáilte.  A number of traditional seaside resorts depended on seasonal trade, which effectively lasted no more than about ten weeks.  They <Col N="749" /> had a capital infrastructure of existing buildings, albeit run down and depleted, and Bord Fáilte suggested they needed a boost to enhance them because of the changing pattern in holiday making with the emergence of package holidays to sun resorts.</P>
      <P>The scheme began with seven resorts, primarily on the west coast, in areas that were indisputably associated with the criteria I outlined.  It was like the film, &ldquo;The Magnificent Seven&rdquo;.  When details of the scheme were published numerous proposals were received and we achieved equity or compromise by increasing the number of resorts from seven to 15.  As I said when I replied to the earlier debate on the urban renewal section, I received representations from 69 other groups which wished to be included in the scheme.  This would simply be the equivalent of watering the jam and destroying the slice of bread because there is a fixed amount of available investment capital and to scatter it in that way would be counter productive.  It is a pilot scheme and I do not propose to extend it to include any other location.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the seafront in Bray.  There is a good argument for co-ordinated renewal of the town because, contrary to appearances, there is considerable poverty and unemployment in Bray, notwithstanding the fact that it is serviced by the DART and has seen a massive increase in population. One would presume that would have brought about a substantial increase in domestic demand in the hinterland of the town; but because it is part of the greater Dublin system, a great deal of the money that comes into Bray is not necessarily spent there.  How do we respond? Given the location of the seafront and the amount of capital allowances that exist, for example, in the hotel industry &mdash; a large number of hotels are currently being planned or are under construction in the Dublin region &mdash; and given the shift in tourist numbers and the fact that Dublin has now got an extensive tourist season, there is no reason why market forces alone would not drive redevelopment into the Bray area.  It may well be the case that site assembly is a difficulty in the seafront and there is not enough land to generate such development.</P>
      <P>A better approach to using State instruments to achieve the co-ordinated development which the town undoubtedly needs is for the local authority to form a joint venture with a group of investors.  The site should be assembled in a manner that would enable a viable economic development to go ahead and enable the local authority as part and parcel of a renewal of the area to make a cogent case for it to be given urban renewal status when the existing scheme expires in July 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bray is not a seaside resort.  It may have been traditionally, but so was Strand Road in Sandymount. When upper middle class people lived in Mountjoy Square and Henrietta Street, the villas along Strand Road, in one of which I live, were their summer homes.  People moved for the summer <Col N="750" /> in the same way people move to parts of the Wicklow coast, including Brittas Bay, today.  Bray is effectively a suburb of the greater Dublin system, albeit a town with its own local authority, and, therefore, cannot be confused with Ballybunion or Tramore.  They are in a different category. I do not doubt that Bray needs some degree of urban renewal and this is why it received urban renewal status.  There are areas designated for urban renewal in the town.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment comes from Bray and the guidelines that will be published soon will no doubt give direction to the local authority and other interest groups to do what Senators Roche and Ross have advocated.  While it would achieve a result by stimulating investment if it were included in the seaside resort scheme, it would be nonsense in the context of the resort proposals.  I suspect site assembly is a problem; but, if it is not, the local authority and other groups involved should prepare an integrated plan for submission to the Department of the Environment with a view to having it designated under the urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>Senators Mooney and Kiely referred to other areas.  The argument for Bundoran originated from the genesis of the proposition put forward by Deputy McCreevy and Mr. Ó hUiginn.  Mr. Ó hUiginn introduced tax driven development in 1982.  In the first Haughey Administration what became known as section 23 housing development was actively proposed by him against all the conventional wisdom that resided at that time in Upper Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>The situation in Bundoran should not be confused with the problem of village renewal or the problem faced countrywide as a result of the rebalancing of the population between urban and rural.  When we joined the European Union on I January 1973, 27 per cent of our workforce was engaged in primary agriculture.  That figure is now 12 per cent and will fall further.  This has implications for the provision of services for rural Ireland and the fabric of small towns.</P>
    <P>In his book <i>The Irish Town,</i> published in the late 1960s, Patrick Shaffrey pointed out that many buildings would be in serious physical disrepair within 15 to 20 years unless some policy initiative was introduced.  An integrated rural plan for the whole of Ireland is probably required.  That will involve difficult choices.  The rebalancing of our population will result in the growth of some areas and the decline of others.</P>
    <P>I referred to the manner in which Leitrim County Council avoided making choices when it submitted the whole county for urban renewal status thereby&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry for delaying the House.  My concern centred on the statement made by the Minister.  For many years Leitrim County Council has been seeking tax designated status for counties such as Leitrim which would encourage inward investment when competing with larger entities.</P>
      <P>The council and authorities within the county, including the Carrick-on-Shannon Chamber of Commerce, have been calling unsuccessfully since 1987 for Carrick-on-Shannon to be designated for urban renewal status.  Successive Ministers for the Environment have failed to respond to what is a genuine and meritorious application.  Carrick-on-Shannon is the only county town which does not have such status.  It suffers from its small population.</P>
      <P>The symbolic consequences of this failure have created an impression that Governments in Dublin do not give a damn about County Leitrim.  The Minister's recent visit to the chamber of commerce fuelled the view that if a submission was endorsed by Leitrim County Council he would give it serious attention.  The interpretation of the Minister's visit and his remarks was that all that had to be done was for Leitrim County Council to pass a resolution and that he would include Carrick-on-Shannon in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> Whoever made that interpretation was disingenuous, but the Minister left people in Carrick-on-Shannon with that impression.  It raised my ire when he said that Leitrim County Council, because it was seeking tax status for the entire county, was inimical to the ongoing discussions for Carrick-on-Shannon to be granted urban renewal status.  I am grateful for your silence, Acting Chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify the position, as I understand it, with regard to urban renewal status for Leitrim and Carrick-on-Shannon.  Leitrim County Council has been seeking special tax incentives for the whole county for many years.  Following discussions with various Ministers, including Deputy Quinn, over recent months a resolution was forwarded by Leitrim County Council seeking urban renewal status for Carrick-on-Shannon. The council was of the impression that this was being seriously considered.  There is disappointment that this status was not granted in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The view was always held that Carrick-on-Shannon was the only county town without such status.  However, Monaghan town is in the same situation, so we are not as unique as we believed. The granting of this status is a symbolic gesture and there are a number of projects which would be assisted if Carrick-on-Shannon was given urban renewal status.  If the Minister is still Minister for Finance for the next budget I hope he will give serious and favourable consideration to this request.</P>

      <P>Tax designation has to be targeted if it is to be effective.  The least of County Leitrim's problems is its ability to articulate its views despite having a population of only 28,000 or 29,000 people.  The effectiveness of tax designation depends on it being focused and confined to particular areas.  The approaches made proposed to treat the whole county on the same basis.  That is inimical to the basis on which tax designation operates.</P>
      <P>The existing regime will expire in just over 12 months time; we are extending it for another year from July 1997.  As has been mentioned, the gestation period of pre-planning is between three and nine months, depending on the complexities of sites and other issues.  A year of designation, while welcome, would not be what is normally required &mdash; it would be three to five years.</P>
      <P>The Government took a decision, notwithstanding that well-structured representations were received from Leitrim on behalf of Carrick-on-Shannon, that it would not add to the existing urban renewal cluster of designated towns. However, Leitrim's application could, and probably will be, sympathetically considered by the Minister for the Environment.  That Department makes the site selection and my Department merely gives assent to that.  My remarks on tax-specific designation apply equally to the suggestion that the entire Inishowen peninsula should be so designated for the same reasons.</P>
      <P>I regret therefore that I cannot accept the recommendation.  However, with regard to Carrick-on-Shannon and Leitrim, I encourage them to make a submission on the basis that a general application had been made.  I would be reasonably optimistic that the Department of the Environment would be well disposed to including it on a list, but that is a decision for that Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the current situation in the Great Lakes region of central Africa and, in particular, the recent debate regarding the engagement of Irish aid in Rwanda.  I categorically state that no Irish aid money is or ever has been used to fund the purchase of arms or used for any military purposes in Rwanda or elsewhere. Suggestions to the contrary are completely without foundation.  Aid to Rwanda is governed by the same fundamental principles which apply to Irish aid elsewhere in the world, that is, it is used to address the relief, rehabilitation and development needs of the poorest and most vulnerable members of society and to help bring about a peaceful and just society.</P>
      <P>The Government has given £12.5 million to support emergency relief and rehabilitation in the Great Lakes region since 1994.  This is the largest commitment ever made by any Government in response to an emergency in a region.  This level of commitment is mirrored by our EU partners and by the international community as a whole. Just over £2 million of these funds have been dispersed through the Government of Rwanda. Impressions that this £2 million has been handed over unconditionally are ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Irish aid funding dispersed through the Government of Rwanda has gone to specific projects in the areas of primary health care, the construction of houses both for genocide survivors and for returning refugees, support for women's groups and, in particular, support for the justice system through the training of magistrates, the provision of food and medical supplies in the prisons and the re-equipping of courthouses.  The projects are in common with all Irish aid projects carefully planned in advance, systematically monitored during implementation and consistently evaluated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials in the development co-operation division of my Department have visited Rwanda on numerous occasions in the past three years.  I have been to Rwanda on four occasions, twice accompanying President Robinson, and have <Col N="756" /> seen the enormous difference Irish aid money has made to the lives of people there.</P>
    <P>I am in daily touch with Irish agencies working in Rwanda and have the benefit of their advice about circumstances there.  I have been privileged to work closely with the Irish aid agencies which are fully engaged in efforts to rebuild Rwandan society.  Agencies such as Concern, Trócaire and Christian Aid have been consistently and constructively engaged in Rwanda since the appalling genocide in 1994.  My officials and myself are in constant contact with these agencies on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the invaluable contribution of the staff of the agencies concerned.  Their work is often done under very difficult circumstances. This debate should support and not undermine their excellent work.  I value highly the support which agencies such as Concern and Trócaire have expressed for Irish aid policy of committed and constructive engagement in Rwanda.  I am sure Senators heard Dominic McSorley saying yesterday on the telephone from the forests in Kisangani that it would be a tragedy if Ireland were to discontinue its engagement in the region, for the sake of the refugees and those who have suffered genocide.</P>
    <P>Aid is an essential element in the rebuilding of shattered societies and economies.  Rwanda is a traumatised society which has experienced genocide on a scale seldom witnessed.  It is irresponsible to suggest Irish aid should be abruptly withdrawn from rebuilding Rwandan society and from genuine capacity building with Rwandan people.  That is not to say Rwanda is a trouble-free country or that it is perfect.  It is a deeply traumatised society suffering a scale of disaster similar to the Famine in Ireland, the Nazis in Germany and the Pol Pot regime.</P>
    <P>The situation in eastern Zaire remains of grave concern.  Since the voluntary and dignified return to Rwanda of 1.2 million refugees from Zaire and Tanzania in November and December 1996, attention has focused on the plight of the refugees and internally displaced people remaining in the Kivu region of eastern Zaire.  These refugees, the majority of whom are now in the region around Kisangani in central Zaire, have been almost constantly on the move since last December.  The influence of the militias, the Interhamwe and the ex-FAR, which perpetrated the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, continues to be a negative factor in the equation.  This was recently acknowledged by Mrs. Ogata in her presentation to the UN Security Council.  It has become abundantly clear in recent weeks that the humanitarian situation of these refugees is extremely serious and that many of them have been wounded in attacks or fighting.</P>
    <P>Due to the rapidly changing scene aid agencies have been unable to provide a continuous supply of emergency food and medical relief to these refugees.  It is vital that access be given by the ADFL forces in eastern Zaire to the international agencies and NGOs providing relief to these refufre <Col N="757" /> gees.  This message has been conveyed in the strongest terms to the ADFL and to those Governments in the region which may have an influence on Mr. Kabila as well as through the US State Department.  Ireland, together with its EU partners and the United States, is today making a further <i>démarche</i> on these lines to countries neighbouring Zaire.  Ireland has also made strenuous bilateral representations and I have made some on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>The recent human rights abuses against these refugees are of grave concern.  I strongly reiterate the Government's categorical condemnation of any human rights violations.  The facts of these abuses have yet to be ascertained and the perpetrators brought to justice.  To this end, I welcome the decision of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to send a team of human rights monitors to eastern aire to investigate these allegations.  The Government has approved an initial grant of £25,000 for this team and will continue to support human rights initiatives in the Great Lakes region.  About a month ago, we released £500,000 to the UNHCR specifically for the relief of refugees in the Kisangani area before their plight became an item in terms of media coverage and interest.</P>
    <P>The Government's overall approach to the various issues and problems in the Great Lakes region must be seen in its broad political context. Recent developments in Zaire suggest Mr. Mobutu's 30 year rule is finally coming to an end. Mr. Kabila and his ADFL forces have serious responsibilities for the protection of the human rights of all citizens and refugees in Zaire.  This has been made clear both by bilateral contacts and through our EU partners.  We have also issued a <i>démarche</i> today through the European Union to the neighbouring countries in the region which are seen to support the end of Mr. Mobutu's reign and the prospect of democratic government in Zaire.  We want the transition to be peaceful, including a commitment to elections and an avoidance as far as possible of widescale fighting, especially around Kinshasa.  This has been referred to as a &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; for Mr. Kabila.</P>
    <P>Some fighting took place yesterday around Kinshasa where the soldiers of Jonas Savimbi and UNITA seems to have allied with Mr. Mobutu's forces.  We do not yet know the extent of the casualties.  Kinshasa, which I have had the privilege of visiting, is a large but poor city of five million people and the retreating Zairean soldiers have unfortunately looted, pillaged and raped in every place from which they have retreated.  It is important that there is a peaceful transition and handover and a cessation of hostilities as quickly as possible, not only for the sake of the people in Kisangani who face grave difficulties but also for the sake of hundreds of thousands of displaced Zaireans.  The prospect of fighting in such a large city as Kinshasa would be fraught with the possibility of a very large number of casualities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for allowing this short debate and the Minister for coming to the House.  Words fail me when I attempt to discuss the problems in the Great Lakes region, especially given the horrific scenes of death and torture in the area which we have witnessed over the past few years.  The problem in Zaire is the most recent one we have had to face.  John O'Shea's request that we stop sending aid to Rwanda was overstated but was said for the right reasons.  However, I do not agree with what he is trying to do.  This Government and previous ones have been even-handed in their approach to aid for the region.  Whereas I prefer to see aid going directly to people rather than through Governments, seed money had to be spent on various necessary projects in Rwanda. Unfortunately, the fact that they assist the Rwandan Government means they might not be seen as even-handed.  Nonetheless, it was the right thing to do.  I am glad the Minister and the Government are maintaining aid to non-governmental agencies and to the Rwandan people because that is the only way the full benefit will be received.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed President Mobutu has not resigned and handed over the reigns of Government to whoever takes power, most likely Mr. Kabila.  The latter's forces cannot be exonerated from blame for what they have done in eastern Zaire.  There is no point pretending they are separating those who have committed genocide from the remaining refugees because it is nonsense.  We have seen the pictures of women and children who have been killed indiscriminately.  Mr. Kabila cannot exonerate himself from blame by suggesting that those committing the crimes are not under his control.  They are and there is no point in his saying otherwise.</P>
      <P>I am equally disappointed to hear the Minister say that UNITA and Jonas Savimbi support President Mobutu.  It goes against all common sense for a country returning to democracy by attempting to form a government of unification between UNITA and Government elements.  If that is true, we should do something immediately. I have long been a supporter of UNITA and its objectives but if it intends to get involved in Zaire we must cry stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how we will deal with the crimes against humanity that have been committed in the area.  There is no easy way of doing so.  In addition to the money we send for relief and rehabilitation, we should examine the possibility of training a corps of African humanitarian workers so that when problems arise in Africa, native workers can become more involved.  The staff of the UNHCR comprises too many people from the western world and too few from Africa. That problem must be examined carefully in the future, particularly when changes are made in the structure of the United Nations.  The same problem applies to Irish aid groups.  Rather than always sending out Irish aid workers, they should <Col N="759" /> also train a corps of African humanitarian workers to work with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on record the approval of the vast majority of Irish people of the Minister of State's efforts in this area.  We should also put on record our thanks to Concern, Trócaire, Christian Aid and other voluntary organisations for their efforts in focusing public attention on what is happening in the Great Lakes region.  Public awareness of these events is most important.</P>
      <P>Daily we watch television coverage or read newspaper reports of events which resemble what happened during the Famine in Ireland, during the Second World War and under the Pol Pot regime.  To this day the Irish still blame the British Government for its failure to act during the Famine.  We believe it must assume 99 per cent of the blame for that disaster.  However, at least at that time the British Government did not have television and the type of information we now have about what is happening in Africa.  During the Second World War there were no television cameras to focus on what was happening and there was not the same amount of reporting.  We, however, are fully informed about what is happening in Zaire and Rwanda.  The western world and other nations in Africa are also aware and we must hang our heads in shame for allowing such events to occur.  The crimes fly in the face of God.  It is horrific that they should happen.</P>
      <P>The United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague reached an important decision yesterday. I endorse Senator Lanigan's remarks about Kabila. He is aware of the excesses being perpetrated by his troops.  The message must be conveyed to the troops and leaders of armies who are responsible for such atrocities that tribunals will be established to deal with such crimes.  They must be made aware that if they conduct themselves in that manner and allow such atrocities to take place they will pay the penalty before a system of justice which will entitle them to a fair trial but which, if they are found guilty, will ensure they spend the remainder of their lives in prison.  That message must be conveyed.  However, that is a long-term objective.</P>
      <P>In the short term we must ensure that Irish aid continues to go to Rwanda.  I have seen the levels of starvation and deprivation at first hand.  I visited many camps where refugees are living in circumstances which would not measure up to the standards expected by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  If that society discovered animals kept in similar conditions it would correctly seek to prosecute the people responsible.  I have seen people dying in such conditions and a continued effort must be made to improve those surroundings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Saddam Hussein was causing trouble in Iraq we saw the might that could be mounted by the European and American Governments to oppose him.  If a tenth of that effort were made <Col N="760" /> in Rwanda it would help to resolve what is a crying shame and a sin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's statement and I hope it is widely publicised. There has been much misinformation about what is happening to Irish aid to that area.</P>
      <P>In the struggle for Africa at the end of the last century and at the beginning of this one, the division of Africa into its constituent countries was made by European powers with little concern for the local inhabitants.  Unfortunately, the African people are now reaping the whirlwind of what is happening on an ethnic and tribal basis.  We have a grave responsibility to continue our efforts in the area.  The fact that we were not involved as an imperial power is no reason for us to wash our hands of it.  While I understand the concerns expressed by John O'Shea of GOAL, I support Senator Lanigan's observation that his case was over-stated.  I hope the Government continues to send aid.</P>
      <P>I am involved in the International Red.  Cross and that organisation insists it is essential that aid continues to be sent into this area where the most appalling violations of human rights are taking place.  There are grave dangers not just for those who live in the area and for refugees but also for aid workers.  The Minister of State must make further efforts to ensure there is not further violation of the Red Cross symbol.  Yesterday, ten Zairean Red Cross workers were killed near the town of Kenge, which is about 200 kilometres east of Kinshasa.  This was not an isolated case and I fear there will be many others.  Irish aid workers are working in the area and it is most important that a firm statement is made about the violation of the Red Cross emblem.  That emblem is the only thing on which aid workers can rely.</P>
      <P>Ireland was an early signatory to the Geneva Convention.  The Government recently published the Geneva Convention (Amendment) Bill which would have given effect to the 1977 additional Protocols regarding the movement of populations as a method of war, which is happening in Zaire. I am sorry we will be unable to ratify those Protocols because of the imminent election.  However, I hope the next Government will ratify them as soon as possible.  The events in Zaire and Rwanda have been the most appalling example of the use of populations as a means of war.  Refugees are moved from place to place and deadlines are given to the UN for such movement.  No consideration is given to where the refugees will go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will support any action the Government might take with regard to the justice system.  This is one of the most problematic aspects of what is happening.  People who have been involved in the genocide of their neighbours are returning to those areas.   We have seen the consequences of that in Bosnia.  There is a feeling of betrayal by the international community because of the lack of action in that regard.  I know one person was convicted yesterday.  There is a tremendous sense of betrayal in Bosnia by the lack of concern for <Col N="761" /> justice for those murdered, raped and who had their possessions taken.  We have to remember that that citizens of Rwanda are as entitled to justice as the citizens of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to see Ireland supporting the proposed international criminal court which is to be set up to deal with war crimes.  Perhaps it might have a deterrent effect in situations such as this. I am glad the Minister made her statement and I support what has been said by Senators Lanigan and Enright.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for taking the initiative in making this public statement in response to the growing concerns expressed by a number of people, not least John O'Shea.  Members are aware &mdash; certainly those of us who serve on the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs are &mdash; of the continuing compassion and humanity she has shown in dealing with this difficult problem in Africa.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat proud that Ireland, the small country that it is, should be such a large player in this area.  Our influence extends far beyond our geographical size, not because of the amount of money we give but because of the lack of baggage with which we come to this problem.</P>
      <P>I would like to take up the theme mentioned by Senator Henry in relation to the judicial process. Has the Minister any indication of whether Kabila will honour any of the agreements he had made?  I ask that because he was somewhat intractable and obfuscating to some degree with the UN monitors before he agreed to allow them into the interior to investigate.  He has set them a time limit which seems questionable.  One does not put a time limit on an investigation into human rights abuses.  It raises very serious questions about his credibility.  He is a mysterious man with a mysterious past which has not been fully documented.  Questionmarks have been raised about his origins and political philosophy.  Indeed, does he have a political philosophy?  He is now leading an army which is a bit of a rag bag army in one regard.  Admittedly, the core of it is a fighting force that has had some spectacular successes in eastern Zaire.  The original intention was primarily to concentrate his attention on the eastern Zairean area which is located close to Rwanda in order to stabilise the situation there from a Rwandan point of view.  He is about to become the leader of a huge country with a population, as the Minister correctly stated &mdash; though I was not aware of it &mdash; of five million people.</P>
      <P>I wonder what contingency plans, if any, the EU or the Irish Government in their discussions have had about what will happen once Mobutu falls and the new administration is put in place. We will be dealing with a man who is effectively a guerrilla fighter.  I am not sure if he has a very developed sense of political ideology or philosophy on what he will do.</P>

      <P>I do not think anybody knows. One can only rely on our experience to date which does not inspire confidence.  Senators Henry and Enright made the valid point that we have already had world experiences in Bosnia and Cambodia etc.  Where despite our technology and our modernity, western Governments have been seen to be somewhat impotent, possibly because of ingrained business and economic interests or because of a real impotence.  With Zaire, Rwanda and the whole Great Lakes area being the melting pot it now is, will it be possible, in the absence of a common foreign policy with the European Union and considering competing interests, particularly France, to have a co-ordinated approach?  Will we be able to go in and make sure from day one that Kabila will not allow the excesses outlined by the Minister to continue.  War cannot be glossed, there is no nice way of saying war is terrible.  Excesses happen even in the most disciplined armies.</P>
      <P>John O'Shea has some real concerns.  We all know John; temperamentally he can overshoot the mark in the way he says things rather than in what he says.  Perhaps he is his own worst enemy to some degree when he comes shooting all cylinders. He has some real concerns in this area.  I and many others have communicated with the Minister in this regard.  I know the Minister has addressed those problems and I am fully supportive of the Government's line on this and of Senator Lanigan's proposal that we continue with the aid.  I wonder how the Minister will address the concerns expressed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the changes in duty on cigarettes the Minister is making in this section.  I also welcome the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, yesterday when he said that crime is being committed on our streets because of illegal trading in cigarettes.  The Minister has made progress in this regard and it would be churlish not to recognise the advent of the excise stamp as a good thing.  However, I was rather startled when a senior Garda officer effectively dismissed the seriousness of the criminality of the sale of cigarettes which have been illegally imported.  The reality is, as we are all aware, that <Col N="764" /> the people who import large numbers of cigarettes are frequently the same people who commit crime.  The Minister is trying to tackle this problem and he has the support of my party in that.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat my Second Stage comments on this section which I welcome.  I was stunned recently at the number of times I was approached by illegal cigarette sellers as I walked down Henry Street.  If this kind of activity is allowed to continue it sends a message to the public that we are tolerant of crime. The debate on zero tolerance has been opened up but unless we take steps to ensure that no crime is acceptable it is likely that this kind of activity will continue.  Does the Minister believe that this measure will be sufficient and will be supported? Does he need to back this up with other legislation to ensure that it meets its desired objectives?</P>

      <P>I welcome the support of the Fianna Fáil party, as articulated by Senator Roche, on this matter.  I also welcome the comments made by Senator Quinn.  I convened a meeting of Revenue officials, the Garda and departmental officials some months ago in relation to this.  I urged the Garda to tell me if they did not have sufficient powers to implement this provision in order that they could be provided for in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that these measures will work.  I had thought of criminalising the possession of illegal cigarettes but I felt that measure might be too draconian.  That option is available, although it is not provided for in this Bill and it has connotations which none of us would particularly like. There is a very clear link between crime, murder and the associated horrors visited on our society by a relatively small group of people, one of whose outlets is undoubtedly the illegal cigarette trade.</P>
      <P>I am not discouraging the smoking of tobacco. There are £600 million worth of reasons I salute cigarette and cigar smokers.  I am a cigar smoker. However, in order to discourage this illegal trade, criminalisation is the next step.  There are issues of civil liberties and market distortion associated with that.  Cigarettes and alcohol are very cheap in Southern Europe and we will have to address that down the line.  We should aim for better coordination on the streets and see how this measure works.  Henry Street is probably the most extreme example but the problem exists elsewhere as Senators are doubtless aware.  If this measure does not work, the next step would be to tackle the buyers of illegal cigarettes as much as the sellers.  At present all the measures in the Bill are directed towards the sellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a society such as ours nothing can be achieved without consensus and I welcome the support of Fianna Fáil and the Independents. This measure will probably be sufficient but if it does not work, we will have to consider other <Col N="765" /> options including the one which I have just outlined.</P>

      <P>The Minister was not in the House when I spoke on Second Stage about the possibility of raising the threshold for registration for VAT purposes.  He should, at some stage, consider making special concessions available to small family businesses such as shops, public houses and so on in rural areas.  By family run businesses I mean businesses run by a husband and wife, their family and one or two staff.  The threshold for registration for VAT purposes should be raised to a level which would allow people earn a reasonable income.  In many rural areas, this would provide much needed stabilisation and would allow local businesses to remain open and provide services in remote areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what Senator Burke is trying to achieve and I have great sympathy with the whole ethos of encouraging indigenous and family run businesses.  My record in that respect, especially with regard to CAT, bears testimony to my commitment.  There are two ways in which this issue could be addressed. One would make it easier for people to trade and be compliant with regulations or one could exempt them altogether.  My preference is for the former.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Revenue Commissioners which of all of the Governments agencies is the one which has come from being the least to the most user-friendly.  Many resources have been pumped into the office and there has been good management and commitment from the staff. There has been a change in the Revenue Commissioners' culture and the office had taken on increased responsibilities including self assessment. It may sound paradoxical that self assessment is an extra responsibility but the office is now far more user-friendly than people realise.</P>
      <P>The Senator and I probably share the same objective in this but I think the path of exemption would be the wrong one to follow.  It would be more desirable to have an easier regime with which people could comply.  Revenue tax forms have become more straighforward and there is a very good support system around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As things stand, Ireland has a very high exemption threshold &mdash; it is one of the highest in Europe in terms of VAT.  The Senator and I share the common objective of facilitating family businesses and a compliment regime in which many people can participate is actually in the interests of small business.  If they are exempted from paying VAT they will be unable to reclaim it; many <Col N="766" /> of the inputs in small businesses have VAT associated with them and these cannot be offset against operating costs.  I would not be disposed to raising the threshold although I would be more than disposed, as would the Revenue Commissioners, to facilitating compliance with the regulations and making it easier for people to adhere to them.</P>

It was a new experience to go to the offices on Grand Canal Street.  I had never been to one of the office hatches before, a place people without accountants are familiar with.

      <P>I have no doubt that Senator Ross, with his typical Protestant generosity, will write extensively about this in the newspaper for which he works and bring it to a wider audience. I say that, of course, in jest &mdash; I respect the tradition which Senator Ross so ably represents in the Seanad.  In that respect he follows in the footsteps of his father.</P>
      <P>When enacted, this Bill will be factored into the existing consolidating legislation published in the form of a White Paper which was the subject of less than helpful and outrageously anto-democratic comments from Senator Ross.  However, it is a free country.  I am confident that when the consolidation legislation is enacted, software assistance will be available in accessible packages for those who want to by-pass accountants and to their own returns.  There will be one document in CD-Rom format with an electronic index which will allow easy access.  Given the nature of the Irish software industry I have no doubt that either accountancy firms or others will develop accessible software for people, particularly sole traders and small business people.  This will enable them do much of the work themselves.  The forms should also become simpler.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was told that consolidation which I requested at the outset of my tenure in the Department of <Col N="768" /> Finance would take five years and that the estimated cost would be millions of pounds.  We achieved our goal in three years in a joint venture between private consultants and the Revenue Commissioners.  Many of those involved are present today and I hope they are taking the tributes from the Seanad in the spirit in which they are offered.  So successful has it been that at the launch of the White Paper, the draught consolidation document, Diarmaid Quigley, the Revenue Commissioner with responsibility for this area, said they now intend to address consolidation in two areas, namely VAT and stamp duty. I hope that by 2000 all tax legislation and related matters will be in CD-Rom format.  I think the market will respond with comperable software packages which will enable people on the supply side to reach a stage where they are tax compliant. This will also help the Revenue Commissioners in their work.  The way forward is in making the tax law more accessible and in bringing more people into the system rather than proceeding down the road of exemptions.</P>

      <P>I approve of extending the registration threshold from £20,000 to £30,000 for small traders.  However, there is a danger associated with inserting thresholds.  The objective is worthy in ensuring that a small business person or farmer does not have to fill in all the paperwork. The danger is that a threshold might inhibit growth, that a message is sent out not to get bigger or take on a new employee or do more business because crossing the threshold means undertaking all the related responsibilities.  I approve of the policy direction but I remind the House of the danger of inserting thresholds.  If we are to create jobs in the future and the type of economy we want, we must never inhibit the enthusiasm of a small business person for enlargement.  Even if the figure was extended to any imultiple of the new threshold, it would still involve a limit which people may be tempted not to pass because of the increased responsibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of stamp duty.  The Minister is aware of the rapid and dramatic increase in house prices.  Very modest houses are being sold for between £80,000 and £100,000.  Stamp duty is a problem, particularly for young people trying to invest in properties they are likely to live in for a period and then sell on.  In the Minister's constituency I was looking at a very small modest house in Ringsend for which a constituent was paying £90,000.  The issue of stamp duty will now be a very real consideration for them.  I am not sure what can be done to relieve this pressure on young people who are buying houses and who have to live somewhere. It seems to me that the mad upward rise of the market is dragging people in who, in other times, would not have expected to bear the burden of stamp duty.  I do not know if the Minister has paid attention to this, although he probably has, and I am not sure what he can do but I am simply putting it down as a marker because I am worried about the impact it will have.  Effectively, people cannot buy into the housing market.  These are people who, under housing policies since the mid-1940s, we would have encouraged to buy their own properties.  In the absence of rented accommodation they will have to live somewhere so they will then look to the State.  The State cannot meet those particular demands, good as the allocation for housing is this year.  It is a problem but I do not pretend to have the solution.  The Minister might let us hear his views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced the stampt duty changes consciously to replace revenue lost with the abolition of residential property tax.  An argument had arisen that because of the upward movement in house prices, people whose income and circumstances had not changed, found themselves with a liability which was not of their own making.  I received a poignant letter from one individual, who generously did not disturb me on holidays, reminding me that he had seen me in Connemara.  He said he lived all his life in Dalkey and was a committed member of that community. To his horror he discovered that some prominent member of a famous Irish-based pop group had bought a house at the end of the terrace with the result that everything else had been changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole equity argument with regard to RPT led ultimately to its abolition.  There was a revenue loss of approximately £15 million and we have replaced it with the stamp duty.  We also brought in the stamp duty quite deliberately to try to dampen down some degree of price escalation at the <Col N="770" /> upper end of the housing market.  Clearly it has had no effect any more than RPT had an effect on people buying houses.  RPT had a horrible effect, however, on those who had been in the same house for ten, 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>We have looked at the housing market.  The Minister for the Environment and I brought an <i>aide memoire</i> to Government on this issue, which is multi-factored in its composition.  Second hand house properties in the Dublin region &mdash; taking one capital city relative to another, and allowing for certain international factors in the comparison &mdash; are undervalued and there is a certain market correction.  However, the headline prices that are being set and which are pronounced every Thursday in <i>The Irish Times'</i> property supplment and on Fridays in the <i>Irish Independent</i> property supplement, are factoring their way right down to new and second hand houses.</P>
    <P>The other reason there is pressure on the housing market is that over 150,000 more people are at work, many of them with very good salaries that will command a mortgage.  They are in the market in a way they were not before.  Our housing supply has fallen behind and there is a time lag in the delivery of a commodity such as a house to a marketplace where the growth in employment has exceeded all our projections.  As to how to deal with it, one possibility may be the rationalisation of stamp duty across the entire spectrum including new and second hand houses.  Stamp duty is a substantial form of revenue which we need.  Subject to correction I think the yield from it is in the order of £260 million, which is considerable. It is not money that we throw away.</P>
    <P>The increase in the supply of serviced building land is one way, plus &mdash; I am reverting now to the time I was a member of Dublin City Council &mdash; an increase in the density.  The three county councils that formerly made up Dublin County Council are still insisting, to the best of my knowledge, on an operational figure of ten houses per acre.  That is simply too low a density to sustain a viable public transport system.  I suspect it is too low a density to sustain catchment areas for all sorts of services, be they schools or shops.  It is a once off opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to increase the density once you have built the first generation of properties on it. Ten to the acre is a notional figure that is hard to visualise.  Let me put it in more concrete terms. Phibsboro, Glasnevin, Ranelagh or Ringsend have a density of 20 or 25 houses per acre.  So, sewer pipes, roads, public lighting, transport and corner shops will have two and a half time the market or service efficiency than a ratio of ten houses per acre.  While it is not an issue for debate today, it is a broader policy issue.  Ultimately, that will be the basis upon which we can resolve this problem. Some efforts are being made to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The total stamp duty yield I gave earlier was incorrect.  The yield from stamp duty on property itself is £194 million while the total yield of all stamp duty in 1996 across the entire spectrum, <Col N="771" /> including cheques, insurance policies, general deeds and penalties, amounted to £332 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his contribution. It is very interesting because it raises the bigger issue of how we should look at our cities and how they will change.  To be fair, I do not think the connection has been made between people who argue for more sylvan settings and those who argue for urban ones, and the impact of that on services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of debate one could speak on any of the sections dealing with stamp duty because they address a similar subject.  I picked this section because it contains a table.  I accept what the Minister said about the property market, which is a variable feast.  It can move up and down and we do not know which way it will go.  Governments should not interfere in it one way or the other because, while the property market may have gone up, nobody can guarantee it will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>The reason the Minister gave for imposing stamp duty is unconvincing.  Apart from damping down the property market, which he admits did not work, the other reason he gave was that there was a revenue loss from the abolition of RPT. However, the Minister is talking about a very small amount.  Revenue losses, such as the £15 million from RPT, are not always made up from somewhere else.</P>
      <P>There is a punitive element in this to which I am strongly opposed.  There was an invidiously punitive element to RPT but this one, particularly because of the 9 per cent stamp duty rate, is utterly irrational.  How can the Minister justify someone going into the market for a house costing £170,000 &mdash; which is now in the high rate and which is not, let us face it, an enormously expensive house in this booming market, although it is expensive &mdash; having to pay an extra £15,300 in stamp duty?  That is an enormous sum for any upwardly mobile person who is stretching themselves to pay the Government.  It cannot be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This discriminates not only against such people but also against those buying second hand houses. I do not understand why people who prefer to have a second hand house should have to pay so much more than those who are buying a new house.  The stamp duty is anti-Dublin and militates against those who choose or are forced to move into an area where housing is expensive.  It <Col N="772" /> will not have such a detrimental effect on those who live in Galway or Cork where the property market is lower.  Those in Dublin, however, will have to pay an extra £15,000 plus for a house which they would not have to pay elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not explain, although he may be able to do so now, why it is necessary to replace the loss of revenue on residential property tax.  I do not know whether he did so on rates but I do not think he did.  Why is it necessary to discriminate between second-hand and new houses?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The traditional structure of tax support within the Irish property system has been biased in favour of the building industry, which still exercises a great deal of influence.  Since the building industry was more labour intensive in the past than it is at present, there was an employment dimension to it.  There was a feeling among those involved in the building industry &mdash; most of whom would describe themselves as a great advocates of private enterprise &mdash; that they were totally dependent on the State to ensure a supply of demand which they would readily meet.  That is why the bias existed in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty was levied on new dwellings until some clever accountant or tax practitioner came up with the proposal in the mid-seventies that if one sold the house before it was built &mdash; a real Irishism &mdash; one could avoid the stamp duty.  This involved signing the contract for the house before either a roof or a substantial amount of the site work was completed.  This anomaly was rationalised on the basis that there was no stamp duty on new houses and it was seen as an aid to the construction industry.</P>
      <P>On the position in other European countries since the advent of the internal market and a degree of harmonisation, according to a schedule compiled by Coopers and Lybrand on 1996 tax summaries, which reflect the law at 31 July 1995, stamp duty on real property was 3.5 per cent in Austria, 12.5 per cent in Belgium, 0.6 per cent on residential and 1.2 per cent on all other property in Denmark, 18.2 per cent in France, 3.5 per cent in Germany, 9, 11 or 13 per cent in Greece, between 6 and 17 per cent in Italy, 6 per cent in Luxembourg, 6 per cent in the Netherlands, 10 per cent on urban and 8 per cent on farmland in Portugal, 6 per cent in Spain and 1.5 or 3 per cent in Sweden.  The rates vary but average between 6 and 9 per cent.</P>
      <P>Ireland's tax base is small.  The population/ dependency ratio is shifting in favour of the taxpayer rather than against, as was the case in the past.  There are three legs to revenue: income tax, sales tax and property tax.  Unlike most other jurisdictions, Ireland does not have a third leg of revenue, that is, property tax.  There are virtually no property taxes in Ireland.  Stamp duty is effectively the only form of property tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The logic of moving from RPT to stamp duty was that there is an element of discretion in the <Col N="773" /> bulk of cases where people trade up in the housing market.  We were not hitting somebody who had not taken action themselves &mdash; this brings me back to the correspondence I received from somebody in Dalkey.  A person who chooses to buy a property must take due account of all the associated costs and, while they will criticise stamp duty at 9 per cent on property sold for £170,000 or more, they will not give out about the cost of refurbishing the kitchen or rewiring the house because these are costs over which they feel there is no discretionary control.  This is a deliberate levy at the point of sale.  If somebody is going to make that purchase, they are liable to stamp duty.</P>
    <P>The question of whether stamp duty should be applied to all property would be a matter which future Governments must consider.  The newspaper for which the Senator writes with such eloquence would frequently castigate this Administration and me for being profligate.  Making the concession with regard to RPT and not finding the substitute revenue would have added to the accusations of profligacy.  It is important to note that we found it in another form from the same pool at the point of contract.  It is a once-off transaction and a much cheaper transfer from the point of view of the purchaser than the residual RPT liability as the actuarial sums show.  The real costs for those who will pay 9 per cent who would have been in the RPT net, assuming they qualified on income grounds, is far cheaper than a residual RPT liability.</P>

Why discriminate against those who are paying £170,000 for a house?

The implications of that measure would create enormous distortion, for the same reasons referred to by Senator Quinn in regard to thresholds of another kind, around the margin of £149,000 and £150,000 where the rate would have changed from 6 to 9 per cent.  This measure involves evening out the curve rather than imposing a sudden threshold.  That is the logic for the phased rates.  That refinement was introduced after the original Government decision, which was made just before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the abolition of residential property tax although many people might be suspicious of the motives for it.  There has been a balancing element to it in the form of extra stamp duty.  When in Opposition all parties acknowledged that this tax should be abolished but did not do so when in power.  The Minister should be congratulated on eventually having the courage to get rid of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always difficult to introduce a new tax as was seen in Britain with the introduction of the poll tax.  It is also brave to abolish a tax which is beginning to bring in income.  I support Senator Ross in congratulating the Minister on the abolition of RPT as it is a challenge to any Minister to find a substitute for such a tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Good riddance to bad tax.  I recognise there will be a difficulty with tax arrears.  In the interest of equity the Minister has made an effort to ensure tax arrears are not avoided by people who were not compliant with the RPT.  As we move further away from the date of abolition, it will be difficult to ensure compliance.  If an individual does not sell his or her house for five years, it will be difficult because of the changing pattern in property valuation to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their compliments. However, I should declare an interest. For the past two years, I paid residential property tax and it was a hard cheque to write.  I availed of the monthly instalment scheme which was painless once I put the signature out of my mind. In terms of equity, the arrears issue will be dealt with.  In effect, it will be a registered charge.  The transaction of a property sale from an existing owner to another <i>inter alia</i> with require a clearance with respect to outstanding tax liability. There are precedents.</P>
      <P>People engaged in buying or selling property will be familiar with obtaining a certificate of clearance with regard to ground rent.  It was so small &mdash; in many cases £2 or £3 &mdash; that people did just not bother paying it.  However, there could be an outstanding sum of £50 or £60.  There was no interest penalty with regard to ground rent but there was an accumulated cost.  In the conveyancing the solicitor for the purchaser would simply ensure the outstanding charges were dealt with and, if not, they were deducted from the agreed sale price.  In this instance, a standard interest rate penalty applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Senator Roche that the Revenue Commissioners are so efficient that they will know exactly what the reference value of the property <Col N="776" /> was the last time it was registered.  If they do not, there are enough records for us to establish what the reference value in market terms of the property could reasonably be and if there were an outstanding sum of £300 or £400, it would be multiplied by the interest indicator.  A prudent purchaser will ensure before taking ownership of the property, including the deeds, that the vendor has discharged that liability as he or she must in respect of any other liability associated with the property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the residential property tax has been removed.  Should a person who may be near the exemption threshold obtain a valuation for his or her house?  Given the rapid appreciation in property values over the past two years, they could further appreciate over the next two to three years and a person selling a house then could find that the Revenue Commissioners value the house above the current threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why waste money paying valuer's fees?  Why not pay the tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What will happen if it does not stay under the threshold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>People can make their own market assessment.  Everybody knows what their property is worth and the Revenue Commissioners are reasonable in this respect.  If an individual is one or two years in arrears, they can establish what their liability is by virtue of their own assessment and can then consult the Revenue Commissioners.  They are customer friendly and will take money in any shape, size or form. If an individual wants to enter an agreement to discharge the arrears over a period of time as distinct from paying a lump sum, they are open to such negotiation.  If there must be an adjustment to take account of interest liability, that can be factored in.  This is similar to farmers spending £500 in accountancy fees to avoid paying a tax liability of £300.  It is much simpler to pay the tax.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 132 to 134, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 125, before section 135, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;135.&mdash;For the purposes of assessment of liability to Inheritance Tax only, a person inheriting from a brother or sister with whom he had resided since the death of their last surviving parent shall be entitled to the same exemption threshold enjoyed by a spouse inheriting from a spouse.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation arises from instances of hardship where individuals have received an <Col N="777" /> inheritance from a brother or sister.  I am not sure what the revenue impact of this would be but I have been told it might be considerable.  In one case a number of brothers lived together and when one died a tax duty was incurred.  There was a second death followed by a series of problems with the distribution of the estate and it was a nightmare.  People live in horrific poverty in some rural areas and it arises in part because of liability to inheritance tax.  Is there a way of resolving this problem?  Two people who live together should be treated as spouses.  This would reduce the residual burden on the surviving brother or sister. One could limit the impact on the Exchequer by ensuring those involved were resident at the time the last surviving parent was alive.  There are ways to limit the revenue impact of this and provide relief in the small number of cases where difficulty arises.  I am not sure whether this recommendation could be considered for future tax reform but a valid case can be made for changing this tax law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been the subject of considerable discussion.  Before the introduction of divorce legislation, I introduced a number of amendments while in Opposition to address the inequity experienced by an unmarried couple sharing the ownership of a house.  If, for example, the house was valued at £100,000, a modest enough sum, on the death of one partner the other would be deemed to have received a gift of £50,000 from a stranger in blood.  This is a deathly phrase but it is the legal phrase, the disponer was a stranger in blood.  The threshold was £10,400 so the surviving member of the couple had a CAT liability on £40,000.</P>
      <P>The response at that stage was that taxation law should not lead social law.  There are different types of cohabiting couples, including gay couples and brothers and sisters.  For example, a niece is living with an aunt or uncle and is providing support, maintenance and contributing the bulk of the revenue to sustain the household, the clear understanding is that when the elderly relative dies that house would be passed on to the niece. Our tax law does not recognise or accommodate such a transfer.</P>
      <P>We had a good debate on Committee Stage in the other House on this issue.  I was disposed to deal with the comprehensive category of different people who are living under the one roof and sharing in the costs without getting into a value judgment about the nature of the relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have enough information to make a decision in this year's Bill as to the loss of revenue. The principles that would inform me in the next budget would be as follows: the recipient of the property must have no other property; they must be living in the house for a considerable period of time &mdash; this would include a brother and sister living together in a house in rural Ireland; they must not recently have arrived when the owner was ill but have been living there for three or five years &mdash; most local authorities use two <Col N="778" /> years as the minimum period for succession of tenancy and they would have to have been living in the house for an acceptable period of time, my preference would be for five years.  One would then have total exemption or they would be treated in the same way as a spouse.</P>
    <P>I am disposed to doing so but have resisted because we do not know the extent of the revenue loss.  A lot of revenue comes from CAT, more than we had anticipated.  This partial amendment raises the threshold from £60,000 to £80,000.  This probably does no more than bring it in line with market values.  We will undertake a study.  One has to go through a sample of the CAT returns to establish a percentage and come to a view on the estimated revenue loss.  If the loss is sustainable my preference would be to address the point made by the Senator and to do so without making valued judgments about different types of living together.  We would treat each case as a house in which someone has lived for five years with another person, they have contributed towards the cost of acquisition and upkeep, and upon the death of the other partner they should not be faced with a tax liability for something they have already enjoyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his humane response which is no less than I expected from him.  He enlarged on my recommendation which dealt with the brother/sister relationship.  I concede that there is a problem and that the Minister has to make a judgment on the cost implications. No matter who fills the office of Minister for Finance I have no doubt that we will see a change.  I will not press this recommendation and I thank the Minister for his worthwhile response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this section which has not drawn a great deal of attention.  It is a recognition on the Minister's part of the competitive nature of Irish industry. Inheritance tax on family businesses in the UK is zero; some years ago it was 40 per cent in Ireland and manufacturing companies in direct competition with UK firms experienced great difficulty.</P>
      <P>Inheritance tax sounds like a one-off tax paid on the death of a family member.  However, most family businesses had to take out insurance to cover themselves for the death of the original owner.  Inheritance tax was an ongoing annual expense to companies which may have been in direct competition with a UK company which did not incur a similar expense.  The Minister has recognised that fact on behalf of farmers and businesses.  He has not received the recognition and appreciation he deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> Many businesses will welcome this change.  It is a step in the right direction which recognises the competitive nature of Irish business.  This is going to continue in the marketplace where other countries have lower tax rates than Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his kind remarks which have nothing to do with a kinship relationship.  In my first budget I enunciated three principles which informed that and subsequent budgets I introduced.  Those principles were to reward work, to promote enterprise and to strengthen social solidarity.</P>
      <P>The neo-colonial nature of our economy means that for the first time we have a generation of Irish businesses moving from the first to the second generation.  One cannot go back much further than the mid-fifties or mid-sixties.  Our present multinationals &mdash; CRH, the Smurfit Group etc.  &mdash; have their origins in the late fifties and early sixties.  It was a wasteland before that for all sorts of reasons.</P>
      <P>Italy has a thriving family business sector. There are many supports, particularly in northern Italy, for the family business ethos and the manner in which it operates.  In 1991 in the Conrad Hotel I participated in a seminar on the family business organised by a Dublin accountancy firm. I was Opposition spokesperson on Finance at the time and I found this seminar very informative. The cashflow of family firms was being devastated on the death of the founder and <i>papa familius,</i> in most cases.  These familes suffered the devastation of the death of an individual and a tax liability.</P>
      <P>However, there is a qualification of which people should be aware.  If a family business is established and there are six siblings in the second generation of whom only two go into the business and if all six siblings are left an equal share of the property, the two running the business need to get on with the job.  If the other four beneficiaries are prepared to defer cashing in their chips for ten years, they only pay 10 per cent tax.  If they cash in their chips immediately they pay a much higher rate.  There is a carrot and stick approach because there has to be tax equity in relation to other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>In some cases we are talking about considerable wealth.  It may be paper wealth but it is tangible relative to the wealth of others, including the workers on the farm who contributed to its creation.  There is an inducement for those who inherit the wealth not to disrupt the cashflow of the business.  That is fair.</P>

      <P>Senators have rightly paid tribute to the Revenue Commissioners for becoming far more user friendly and customer oriented than they were in the past.  Old fears about going to the Revenue Commissioners no longer exist. However, a disturbing case has occurred which involves one of my constituents which a number of Ministers are aware of.  It concerns Barbara Hyland, a well known campaigner for equity in a series of matters.  She circulated a document recently about an allegedly untruthful affidavit which formed part of a taxation issue.  This requires attention, and one of the Minister's colleagues has responded positively to this and a copy of correspondence in the case was sent to the Minister's office.  If it is true that an invalid affidavit was sworn by a public official, all of us should be concerned.  That would be carrying vigour to an extreme nobody wants.  The Minister should look into this.</P>
      <P>We are making significant changes in the area of public management, which is the subject of a new public management Bill.  Section 157 will allow nominated officers to effectively receive delegation and goes in much the same direction as the Public Management (No. 2) Bill will go for the directors general of Departments.</P>
      <P>Previously, as the Minister knows, the Revenue Commissioners were not subject to ministerial responsibility in their day to day duties.  It is interesting that the Revenue Commissioners will be no less delegation-oriented under the new legislation, and any liberalisation in the management structure of the Civil Service should be reflected in the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I raise the particular case of the affidavit as it is of some concern and perhaps the Minister or relevant officials in the Revenue Commissioners could look into the report on it.</P>

      <P>I wish to record my appreciation for the way the House has dealt with the Finance Bill.  Because of a Government commitment that does not normally arise on Wednesday lunchtime I was unable to be here yesterday, but the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, informed me that the debate was as constructive as I have come to expect.  He told me that when politically focused, the debate was sharp but not petulant.  The Committee Stage debate has reflected that also.</P>
      <P>I also wish to record my appreciation for the wonderful professional service I have received from my colleagues in the Department of Finance and the professional civil servants of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  I appreciate the tributes paid to the Revenue Commissioners by Senator Ross and hope his commitment will spill over into his column on Sunday.  We can then read something more pleasant and constructive than the rubbish he usually writes.  However, he was genuine and fulsome in his praise.</P>
      <P>This is the third Finance Bill I have had the honour to bring to this House.  It would not be possible to have the fairness we have in our taxation system without the dedication, commitment, professionalism and, most importantly, integrity of our public servants.  They work under potentially extraordinary pressures.  I am proud to say that we are blessed with a professional public service with whom I have been honoured to work.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on a complex Bill.  Yesterday I said I would have liked more political ingenuity here and there in it, which is a reasonable political point.  As an ex-civil servant in the Department of Finance, I join with the Minister in saying that it is an extraordinarily complex area, and becoming more complex by the day.  In the Internal Revenue Service building in Washington there is a saying that &ldquo;tax is the price for living in a just society&rdquo;.  During the French Revolution a wise person said that before Government gives, it must first take away in tax. That is a reality we do not always accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good Finance Bill.  I would have changed some parts of it, but that is the nature of <Col N="782" /> things.  I compliment the Minister and his staff on a job well done.</P>

I compliment Senator Roche and Fianna Fáil on their co-operation in the passing of this Bill.  It is an excellent Finance Bill and the people will reap the rewards of this legislation in the year ahead.  I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to the excellent staff of the Department of Finance.

      <P>This is a Government of achievement.  When we came into office two and a half years ago, we set ourselves a series of objectives for the social and economic development of this country.  We are achieving these objectives.  One of our primary goals was the development of an innovative, enterprising economy which meets the demands of international competition and shares the rewards of effort, initiative and success.  We can be very proud of our record on that front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has carefully nurtured the economic development of this country and our success is evident in the emergence and sustained development of our &ldquo;celtic tiger&rdquo; economy which <Col N="783" /> is the envy of many of our EU partners, and other countries worldwide.  For example, inflation rates are at an all time low and are remaining low.  The number of people at work is at an all time high and continues to grow.  The national debt ratio continues to fall.  This is firm and concrete proof of the success of this Government's policies on the economic front, a success which is unprecedented in recent experience.  Furthermore, the ESRI report published last week forecasts a continuation of growth and prosperity into the next century.</P>
    <P>However, strong economic performance is not the only criterion by which to judge a country's performance.  We all know that social and other such considerations are as important if we are to achieve a balanced development nationwide where every sector of society benefits equally.  As such, in tandem with our economic objectives, this Government is also committed to the implementation of policies to promote the best quality of life for the people generally through measures, for example, to promote health care, justice, housing and education.  Our record in these areas is one of solid achievement.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the area of social housing, which is a good example of any Administration's commitment to improving the quality of life of its people generally, our record is outstanding.  In <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> we promised that public housing and social housing starts would be increased to 7,000 annually.  As Minister for the Environment, I am proud that this year the total provision for housing amounts to £400 million. This represents an increase of 9 per cent on the 1996 provision and will allow us, once again this year, to meet the commitment to 7,000 starts. Taking into account the local authority housing programme and the full range of social housing measures, the needs of over 10,000 households will be met in 1997.</P>
    <P>I am also proud of our achievements in the environment field.  As promised, I have met the goals set in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> on the preparation of a national sustainable development strategy to address all areas of Government policy which impact on the environment.  I have also successfully introduced major legislation in relation to waste management.</P>
    <P>The policy agreement made a number of commitments concerning local government funding. We all know how contentious the issue of service charges has been over the past ten years or so. However, as Minister for the Environment, I have not been afraid to tackle this issue.  In <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> we gave three specific commitments which had direct relevance to service charges.  Our first commitment was to amend the 1962 Sanitary Services Act to delimit the power of local authorities to disconnect domestic water supplies for non-payment of service charges.  Our second commitment was to grant a tax allowance at the standard rate up to a maximum of £150 in respect of service charges <Col N="784" /> paid in full and on time which was implemented in the 1995 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Our third commitment was to commission a professional study on local government funding to see how a fair, equitable and reasonable system of funding could be introduced.  Within months of being appointed Minister for the Environment, I engaged KPMG management consulting to carry out this study.  It carried out an in-depth analysis of local authorities' existing and future funding requirements and evaluated the capacity of the system to meet these requirements. It examined a range of funding options.  Its underlying conclusion is that there is no one right way of funding local government.  Instead, it was a matter for me, as Minister for the Environment, to weigh up the pros and cons of the various options to decide which one was the best fit to the Irish context now and in the future.</P>
    <P>As I said, this Government is one of achievement. In just over two years, we have met the three specific commitments we set in relation to local government funding.  That is no mean feat. However, we were not prepared to rest on our laurels.  Further work was necessary if the overall issue of local government funding was to be comprehensively tackled once and for all to enable this important sector realise its full potential.</P>
    <P>Last February I addressed this House on the issue of local government financing and I put on the record my proposals to deal with this issue. As I said previously, I was not daunted by this challenge &mdash; it has been one of my top priorities since my appointment as Minister for the Environment. I stated that I did not want this issue to be seen in negative terms as a thorny issue or a political minefield.  My objective was to turn the area of local government funding and the focus of local government around so that it would be thought of and seen in a positive light in terms of opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is just over two months since I told this House about my plans on local government financing and I am back here presenting the Bill which will give legal effect to these plans.  The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1997, has two major objectives.  First, it will provide local authorities with their own viable source of finance to enable them to carry out the range of functions demanded by their customers in the 21st century.  Secondly, it will ensure that local authorities make the best possible use of these resources.</P>
    <P>Local government financing has been a problem for a number of years with the local authorities experiencing a long-term decline in their fortunes.  The effects of too narrow a funding base, compounded by the conferring of new functions without any change in their finances, created a financial stranglehold for local authorities. This position could not be allowed to continue. Already we have seen its effects.  In a number of cases services have had to be cut back or have been cut out altogether.  We know only too well the reaction of the public to such cut backs <Col N="785" /> in services.  Local authorities cannot continue to provide a sufficient level of services if they do not have adequate resources.</P>
    <P>This Government acknowledges the important role the local government sector has to play in our society.  It is one of the most obvious manifestations of democracy &mdash; people power.  A local government system which is able to meet the needs of its public in an efficient and effective manner has a pivotal role to play in this context. This is because local authorities are in the best position to identify and respond to local needs.  I acknowledge the actions of the local authorities in this context.  They have already taken great steps in recent years to improve the way they do business to better meet the needs of their customers. However, we need to build on their work if we are to be confident that this sector will evolve and take on the new functions and services needed for local development into the next century. Local authorities must re-examine their methods of operation and their relationship with the public generally.  They must ensure they provide the public with the services it wants as effectively and efficiently as possible.  They must suit the needs of their customers rather than themselves. Quality customer service is the key.</P>
    <P>I have already taken steps to assist the authorities in the realisation of these objectives.  Last December I launched a major new programme for the reform of local government: &ldquo;Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change&rdquo;.  This is a comprehensive programme of specific action for the future development of local government. Its objective is to reshape the general approach of local authorities in order to build a new local government which is sharper, more independent and powerful.  Central to this strategy is the provision of proper funding for local authorities.  The Bill before the House provides the necessary statutory basis for the new local authority funding system.  Three key issues are addressed.  First, domestic water and sewerage charges are being abolished with effect from 1 January this year; second, the rate support grant which my Department pays to local authorities is being terminated; third, the income foregone from these charges and the rate support grant is being replaced by assigning the full proceeds of motor tax income to the authorities to provide them with their own independent source of income fully protected by legislation.</P>
    <P>While the Delimitation Act, 1995, dealt with the issue of water disconnection, it was also necessary to review the fundamental <i>raison d'être</i> of service charges.  Charges can be good as they can encourage the optimum use of resources and promote conservation.  Theoretically, if one has to pay for the amount of the service one uses, it is logical that under normal circumstances one will cut down on the amount used to save money. However, this theory does not hold true where the level of the charge bears no relation to the amount used.  Unfortunately, this has been the <Col N="786" /> case for domestic water and sewerage charges where local authorities applied either a flat rate charge or a charge related to broad rateable valuations. As a result, the level of usage never entered the equation.  It did not matter how much water was used, people were still liable for the same amount in charges.  Therefore, an individual living alone in a small house was liable for the same amount in domestic water charges as a family living in a large house with, perhaps, two or three bathrooms.</P>
    <P>This was unfair but what could be done to overcome it?  Metering domestic supplies was not a viable alternative.  We have heard much about this in recent days and weeks.  I commissioned KPMG to examine the issue and it published its report last June at which stage I held a press conference about it.  KPMG examined the potential for metering supplies and concluded that it was not viable in view of the costs involved and the income generated.  The costs were £200 million capital investment and £8 million per year thereafter to monitor, read and maintain.  As a result, the Government logically concluded that, as charges for domestic water and sewerage services could not be economically related to usage, they were, therefore, taxes and should be incorporated into general taxation.</P>
    <P>Section 12 removes the power of local authorities to levy charges for the supply of water for domestic purposes and for the disposal of domestic sewage with effect from 1 January 1997.  A domestic supply in this context means a supply for ordinary household purposes to a dwelling or to a group water scheme.  A supply for commercial, agricultural, industrial or other purposes does not constitute a domestic supply.  Where a supply is mixed, serving both domestic and non-domestic purposes, local authorities will be expected to apportion between the two.  Domestic water and sewerage charges levied before 1 January 1997 remain valid and I expect the authorities to pursue outstanding amounts due to them. Charges linked to usage are a useful and good way of encouraging efficient use of resources.  As such, they can have an important role to play in environmental policy generally.  Commercial service charges can be related to usage through the use of meters and these charges are, therefore, remaining.  So too are refuse charges as these can also be related to usage.  For example, a number of local authorities operate a &ldquo;tag a bag&rdquo; payment system.  Refuse charges are also important in promoting the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle, which is an important element in our national waste management policy.</P>
    <P>Under section 3, the full proceeds of motor tax income are assigned to local authorities to replace the income lost through the abolition of domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant.  I wish to clarify that these proposals do not involve any new tax but a redirection of existing taxation, which will remain local rather than being paid to the Exchequer.  This will provide local authorities with full ownership of the proceeds <Col N="787" /> of a single buoyant tax fully protected by law.  They will have full control over this resource and it will be a matter for them to decide how to distribute it.  This is what real local government should entail and I am very proud to introduce it by means of this Bill.  All local authorities will benefit from this new arrangement and the inbuilt buoyancy will ensure this.  For example, the 1996 Estimates revealed that the income from motor tax would exceed the income from domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant combined by approximately £12 million and I believe the difference will be greater this year.</P>
    <P>Another reason for using motor tax income is its practicality.  Local authorities already collect motor tax on behalf of the Exchequer.  All we are doing now is allowing the authorities to retain the income they collect, subject to the payment of a certain amount into the new equalisation fund, the purpose of which I will outline.  The new system will, therefore, be relatively simple and practical to implement.  It will also introduce a greater degree of certainty into the funding of local government.  As a result, the authorities will be able to estimate with greater accuracy how much income they will receive over a period of years rather than relying on the annual Estimates decisions of Government.  Forward planning of services will be greatly facilitated.  Section 11 allows local authorities to deduct the expenses incurred by them in collecting motor tax before paying into the equalisation fund and before sharing the moneys collected among other local authorities.</P>
    <P>The national rates of motor tax are set by central Government and there has been no increase in these rates since 1992 when the Labour Party came into Government.  However, is it right that central Government should have such total control over the system of local government funding? It will be recalled that, under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No 2) Act, 1983, local authorities had complete discretion over whether to levy domestic service charges and their amount.  Such local discretion is essential for the concept of local democracy.  If we are to have real, effective local government capable of responding to local needs, it must have some discretion over how it raises the finance necessary to fund its activities.</P>
    <P>This is now being provided for under section 9 which provides motor tax authorities with the power from next year to increase the national rates of motor tax on cars and motor cycles by up to 6 per cent, subject to a maximum of 3 per cent next year.  Local authorities, at their own discretion, will be entitled to increase motor tax rates for cars and motorcycles by 3 per cent next year and by 3 per cent the following year.  After that, they will not be entitled to any further increase unless the base is moved by central Government. This is designed to strike the right balance between the need to give local authorities discretion <Col N="788" /> in raising finance on the one hand and, on the other, the requirement not to impose any significant new form of taxation.  Some 6 per cent is the limit to the increase above the national base. Section 9 also provides for consultation between county councils, urban district councils and individual local authorities on the extent of any variation in rates where one collects on behalf of another on foot of an agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the establishment of an equalisation fund.  The resources of the fund will be used to replace the income from domestic water and sewerage services and the balance will be allocated as equitably as possible, having regard to the needs and resources of all authorities. All local authorities will benefit from this new system.  No authority will lose out.</P>
    <P>Under section 5, local authorities will be required to pay into the fund 20 per cent of the motor tax collected on cars and motor cycles, in addition to all other motor taxes, driver licence fees and other miscellaneous fees and duties.  It was decided, following consideration of each authority's income from rate support grant, domestic water and sewerage charges and each licensing authority's motor tax income, that local authorities should retain 80 per cent of motor tax income on cars and motor cycles.  We concluded that this was the optimum retention rate if the authorities were to be allowed to retain the maximum amounts possible of motor tax income collected by them, while at the same time making sure there would be sufficient resources in the equalisation fund to enable it achieve the objective for which it is being established.</P>
    <P>The purposes for which moneys may be paid out of the equalisation fund are set out in section 6.  These may include contributions towards the expenditure of local authorities in performing their functions generally, payments in respect of any expenses incurred in promoting the delivery of quality and efficient local authority services and in respect of expenses incurred with the collection of motor tax.  Section 6 also provides for the establishment of a committee to advise the Minister on payments to local authorities from the fund.</P>
    <P>Given the pivotal role of the equalisation fund in the future of local government funding, it was important that we gave due consideration to how this fund should be managed.  Initially, the fund will be managed by the Minister for the Environment. However, as local authorities ultimately own the money in the fund, it is only right that they should have a major role in deciding on its use.  If we want real local government capable of responding to local demands and initiatives, the authorities must be able to decide how this money should be distributed.  To facilitate this, section 7 provides for the establishment, by order, of a Local Government (Equalisation) Council. This council will manage the fund and decide on payments from it and may also carry out additional functions allocated to it.  I expect the council to be established some time next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> The Bill was carefully drafted to ensure all situations are covered.  Motor tax authorities operate only at county or city level.  However, the rate support grant was paid to all authorities.  Furthermore, all authorities in 1996, with the exception of two, levied some combination of domestic water and sewerage charges.  In addition, some authorities collect motor tax on behalf of other authorities.  However, all authorities should have a legal right to their fair share of the proceeds from motor tax.  It was, therefore, necessary to make provision in the legislation to ensure all authorities enjoy the benefits of the new funding system and that the tax which is not paid into the equalisation fund is shared out on an equitable basis.  These requirements are met by section 10 which provides for the sharing of retained motor tax among all authorities.  Section 10 also empowers the Minister for the Environment, or the equalisation council when established, to give directions to the motor tax authorities as to how the tax should be shared.</P>
    <P>Hand in hand with the provision of a new funding system for local authorities, this Bill also introduces measures to ensure the authorities realise the best possible return from this new system. We must ensure local government is operating as efficiently and effectively as possible so that it continues to aid the development of this country into the next century.  With this in mind, we must ensure local authorities have greater regard to the three tenets of efficiency, effectiveness and economy.  Of necessity, local government has already become far more professional in its operations over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, I require the authorities to go even further along this road by opening up their operations to a greater level of scrutiny and comparison. In particular, the core requirement of value for money is being strengthened in all local government operations.  While a value for money &mdash; VFM &mdash; unit has been in operation within my Department since 1993, section 14 will now formally establish the unit on a legal basis and provide for its role and functions.  Section 15 provides that, in addition to the normal regulatory audits, from now on local authorities will also be subject to VFM audits similar to those currently carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Furthermore, the unit will be required to publish full details of the results of its work.  A range of performance indicators will also be developed for local authority operations to identify best practice and encourage the authorities to improve their performance.</P>
    <P>Section 17 aims to address a serious anomaly in legislation which has existed since 1993 and, in spite of an amendment in 1995 and action in the courts, has not been successfully rectified.  I am referring to section 20 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992, under which liability for licensing and payment of motor tax arises from the date of registration of a vehicle in the State.  Several Senators will have encountered this difficulty in their constituency clinics.  A number of cases have arisen <Col N="790" /> which are clearly anomalous, where the vehicle was never on the road yet the individuals concerned, through no fault of their own, paid arrears in addition to the cost of a tax disc.  The amendment proposed in the Bill will ensure motor tax is only payable when the vehicle is first used in a public place, provided the individual, on or before the application for a tax disc, produces evidence that the vehicle was not so used.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to provide local authorities with a proper financial system to enable them to carry out the range of functions demanded by the general public.  In tandem with this, it will also require the authorities to realise the best return from the resources awarded to them.  It is, therefore, important legislation of which I am justifiably proud.  Its beneficial effects will continue to be felt long into the next century.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to present the Bill and I strongly urge Senators to agree its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the abolition of water charges many problems have arisen with regard to discrepancies among group water schemes and the funding of local authorities.  The Minister, with good intent, seeks to give autonomy and an independent source of funding to local authorities. However, the method he has adopted is poor.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows why water charges were abolished.  County Kerry introduced water charges long before 1983.  People were willing to pay them because they knew the local authority needed the extra funding to make up the shortfall in funds from central Government.  Indeed, the county went a step further and introduced sewerage charges, which people were also prepared to pay.  It is difficult to introduce a scheme for which people must pay and, when they are paying for a service and are happy to do so, it is foolish to abolish it because it will be difficult to introduce a new type of taxation in the future to service local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister had an ideal opportunity on a previous occasion to allocate 80 per cent of motor taxation to local authorities to deal with county roads while, at the same time, leaving the service charges in place.  That would have been a means of dealing with the problem of potholes in county roads.  The Minister has increased the allocation of funding for county roads this year and that is greatly appreciated.  However, prior to that, this and previous Administrations have ignored the problem of county roads even though they were falling apart.</P>
      <P>When I first entered local government 20 years ago roads were surface-dressed every eight years. That has changed now to once every 40 years.  If a road in your area is being tarred and you have a young child you should bring him out to see the tarring machine because it is possible he will not see one again for 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had an ideal opportunity to give 80 per cent of motor taxation to local authorities who do their business properly, run a good house, <Col N="791" /> provide accountability and balance their budgets. Some authorities spend and spend and are completely out of control.  The local authorities who run their business well are being penalised.</P>
    <P>Why should people in Dublin not pay water charges when people in rural Ireland who have bad services, bad roads and no transportation have to pay more than those who have all these services at their fingertips?  It is time equalisation was introduced into the system.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years I have listened to Members talk about the west.  Everybody thought the west started in Mayo and ended in Galway until Minister Carey brought Clare in by the back of its neck.  They have forgotten about County Kerry.  They do not think it is part of the west.  I was taught that the west started from one point in the north to the southwest of Cork.</P>
    <P>If local authorities had been given the 80 per cent funding from motor taxation for even one year the Minister would have been able to take care of all the problems with county roads.  The Minister is asking people who pay motor tax to contribute to the upkeep of group water schemes, sewerage schemes and all local authority services. He is asking this of people in rural Ireland who need a car to get to work because there is no public transport &mdash; the Minister knows this coming as he does from rural Ireland.  A one car family is no longer viable.  People living in rural Ireland need two cars; the woman needs a car to get the children to school, the man needs a car to get to work.  He may not be able to get a job locally and so has to travel 40 or 50 miles to his place of work.  This is what we are faced with.</P>
    <P>The Minister has used much fancy phraseology about how he can juggle the equalisation fund so that no county will lose out.  Somebody has to lose.  Unless you give back what has been collected somebody will lose.  What is happening is that large amounts of money are collected in Dublin through motor taxation; in other areas there would not be that many cars, and the mileage of county roads is not taken into account.</P>
    <P>I will baptize my own child first.  In Kerry we have something like 2,500 miles of county road, roads that have been falling apart for the last ten years.  How can we support the upkeep of those roads?  There has been some improvement this year.  People talk about the improvement in roads.  They have improved in certain areas, but certain parts of the road network are disimproving. The Minister will have to look seriously at the secondary primary routes.  The national primary roads come under the aegis of the National Roads Authority.  The secondary routes are being completely ignored.  Many of these routes are the main arteries to counties.</P>
    <P>When you come to Kerry from the west Limerick side you have to take the road through Limerick, Foynes and Tarbert.  There is a secondary route on to Tarbert, where there is a car ferry which takes people from County Clare, and the route carries on for 28 miles into Tralee, the centre <Col N="792" /> of our industry, even though there are no jobs available there.  The amount of money allocated to the upkeep of that road for this year is £500,000.  That road is in a deplorable state.  Many county roads are in better condition than the secondary primary route.  Where will the money for the upkeep of the secondary primary routes come from in the future?</P>
    <P>New sewage treatment plants have been installed in Kerry.  Where will the money for the upkeep of these sewage plants or new ones come from?  Where will the money for new group water schemes come from?  I live in an area in Kerry where we have no running water.  An application has been before the Minister's Department for the last number of years for the damming of the Smeala River in Listowel at a cost of £22 million. I am led to believe that £18 million of this money will come from cohesion funding and the Government will have to come up with the remaining £4 million.</P>
    <P>An application was lodged with the Minister's Department by a group water scheme in Kerry. It is one of the biggest group schemes ever undertaken in Kerry and comprises over 500 people. That application is lying somewhere in the back of somebody's drawer and has not been looked at.  We have been told repeatedly that if an industrialist came into Kerry tomorrow we could not even entertain him because we have no infrastructure or water supply.  We need an extra two or three million gallons of water daily for an industrial site.  We have 800 acres of industrial land, with no infrastructure, on the Shannon Estuary purchased many years ago at enormous expense to the taxpayer.  Where will the money for these group water schemes come in the future?  How will the Minister share the equalisation fund?  He says nobody will lose out.</P>
    <P>We have a very good record in Kerry for the collection of water service charges.  Ninety per cent of our customers were paying up.  What is the Minister's response to the announcement from his counterpart in Europe of cutbacks because of the lack of services?  I have listened very carefully to the Minister.  He says the money will go into an overall pile and will be available. It is the taxpayer who will make up the 5 per cent shortfall.  We will not get the same amount of grants from Europe due to cutbacks in water charges.  The 5 per cent will come out of the booming economy.  I am very worried about this booming economy.  The boom will be over in a couple of years and all the money coming from Europe will be absorbed also.</P>
    <P>We need millions of gallons of water in north Kerry for industry, which could be helped by the damming of the River Smeala.  We have no industry in north Kerry; the factories we have there are closing down.  The new county manager in Kerry told me that if an emergency arose and an industrialist came on the Shannon Estuary to build an oil refinery or smelter, they could get water across the River Shannon from Clare on a temporary basis where there is a surplus of water. <Col N="793" /> That is something I put before the Department of the Environment some time ago.  If County Clare has a surplus of five million gallons and are only a mile away from us by water, then why can we not bring water to the people who are without it and who are prepared to pay for it?</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has heard of the village of Asdee through song and folklore and stories of moving statues.  It is a village without running water.  The people living there are waiting for the establishment of the group scheme and paid their contributions years ago, even under the Fianna Fáil Administration.  The local authority has used its own funds to conduct surveys for the application, which seems to be at a standstill.</P>
    <P>While everything is rosy at the moment, one always has to worry about the future.  I know the local government system better than anyone else. People paying road tax must have a good road beneath them.  If we are asked to increase road tax by 3 per cent or the ceiling on it by 6 per cent over the next two years, county managers will use the easy way out to balance their books, which happened when they added an extra £10 or £20 on service charges to meet the increase in rates. Where will the additional money come from when there are breakdowns in treatment plants and other services?  Something will suffer somewhere along the line.  The road tax payer will ask why he or she should pay for the water rates of a family in a local authority house with no car when he or she does not have the benefits of good roads?  These problems cannot be worked out overnight.</P>
    <P>I know what the Minister said in the other House about how he intends to implement the equalisation fund.  He continuously says no local authority will have less funding for services than last year.  This is easy to say regarding local authorities who never collect service charges &mdash; they will not pocket anything from the equalisation fund because they never paid into it in the first place.  I am worried about the well-run authorities. What will be done about the people who owe money to local authorities since last year and those in Dublin who never paid a shilling?  How will fish be made of one and flesh of another?</P>
    <P>The holding of by-elections is good in getting people back on a level playing pitch and giving them a sense of reality.  The recent election in Britain displayed the power of democracy.  People can remove one person from office and replace him or her with someone else.  I know our spokesman on the Environment in the other House is dying to take the Minister's place.</P>

      <P>I am worried about the future of local authorities. We are all looking for autonomy and further power for them.  The road tax was like the three card trick &mdash; now you see it, now you don't. If one has 100 per cent in one pocket and one transfers 80 per cent to the other, 20 per cent is missing.  If the Minister, like Houdini, told me there would be 20 per cent equalisation but local authorities would not be at a loss, I would be like Thomas the apostle &mdash; I would have to see it.  I know the way the system works.  When there is a shortfall the local authority and the people on the ground suffer.  If one talks about autonomy and giving meaningful power back to local authorities, they should be given proper funding.  This cannot be done by motor taxation.</P>
      <P>The Minister is waiting for an all party agreement on the restructuring and funding of local authorities.  This would be good for the country. Everyone could pay their fair share, including the people of Dublin.  People in rural Ireland are finding it more difficult to live everyday.  They have bad roads, bigger repairs to their cars and longer distances to travel to work.  Some of them are unemployed and do not have great services. The North Kerry stage IV group water scheme is waiting for £22 million from the Department of the Environment for its implementation.  These people are prepared to pay for their services. They want water and cannot get it.</P>
      <P>Where will the funding from these schemes come from?  There may be a capital allowance, but one has to look at the running costs and servicing afterwards.  Problems with water mains may have to be dealt with, as well as poor quality water and pollution.  These problems have to be dealt with by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> I cannot see the motor taxation measure working. If the Minister is considering equalisation, he should look at the county roads in poorer counties which need to be enhanced.  For example, in Kerry tourists visit and spend their money in hotels etc., However, they travel on roads which are disintegrating.  The primary route from Castleisland to Killarney around Farranfore Airport has improved in the past number of years. This part of the county is helped by this route. However, at the other side of the county secondary routes are ignored.  They will have to be restructured, upgraded to national primary route standard and receive equal funding.  The secondary route from Tarbert to Tralee is falling apart. It is the main route from west Limerick and is the location of the car ferry.  Finance will have to be provided for it.  I cannot see this happening under motor taxation.  Where will the funding for these schemes come from?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Minister for missing his contribution.  I also apologise to Senator Dan Kiely because I was only here for a small part of his enlightening <i>tour de force</i> around Kerry.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1997, has the absolute support of this side of the House.  It is a measure which all parties on this side of the House have been seeking for some time and it gives effect to a Government commitment to restructure the entire financing system of local government.</P>
      <P>I said in another forum last week that cynicism in politics is understood purely on the basis that works which should be done by local authorities cannot be done because of lack of funding.  If we are serious about enhancing local government we must seriously address the issue of funding.  The Government, under this Minister, has done that. The Minister is to be commended and congratulated on the stance he has taken.  The legislation we are debating this evening is part of a process of reform which we are only beginning to embark upon.  It will necessitate a huge cultural change within local authorities and among councillors, officials, the Department of the Environment and the public.  That change has started under this Government and it is something of which we are intensely proud.</P>
      <P>As regards funding local government, the real issue is to provide it with an adequate source of revenue year in and year out which will ensure that local services and functions provided by councils can be delivered in an efficient and effective manner.  It is worth revisiting the KPMG report published last year.  It outlined, in very stark terms, the real challenge for local government over the next five years.  That challenge arises from the fact that many new infrastructural projects have been put in place with EU money over the past five or six years and these must be serviced by the councils concerned.  That will necessitate an expansion of moneys to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> There has been a radical change in our road network.  That has proved to be a tremendous opportunity for those who use our roads but, equally, significant extra money will be required to ensure that the road system is serviced.</P>
    <P>There have been fantastic new infrastructural developments in water supply, sewerage and the environmental issue of waste disposal.  Those infrastructural projects must be funded over the next five to ten years.  That is at the heart of the issue.  If we are serious about servicing infrastructure which has been put in place through EU funds we must be serious about looking for ways to fund that into the future.  I am particularly pleased that this Government has addressed the issue in that context.</P>
    <P>Five key principles highlighted in the KPMG report are central to this debate.  Any new system of funding must be accountable; in other words those responsible for spending taxpayers' money must also be responsible for raising revenue. Under this legislation councillors are directly responsible in respect of motor taxation revenue.</P>
    <P>The second principle highlighted by the KPMG report was one of practicality.  Any system must be simple, straightforward and manageable.  The previous system of funding water charges was anything but straightforward and practical.  Large numbers of people in my county council area did not pay water rates because of the difference between Dublin Corporation as compared with South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire County Councils.  This new form of funding is practical.  It is a source of revenue which is already at the disposal of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The third issue highlighted was that of local variability.  There are two of the five worst urban areas in the country in terms of deprivation, unemployment and poverty in my area.  Any system of funding must allow for the fact that there must be a variability in terms of the amount of money which can be raised from each local authority area.  That is also provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The fourth issue highlighted concerned acceptability.  The previous form of rates and water charges were not acceptable to large sections of the community.  The fifth issue highlighted concerned certainty.  There must be an element of certainty in any form of funding.  We have seen four changes in funding local government over the past 20 years.  In 1978, the disastrous decision to abolish rates was taken.  In 1985, we saw charges abolished which were reinstated in the early 1990s and which have recently been abolished again.  I hope we finally have a degree of certainty about the amount of moneys which can be provided to corporations and county councils.</P>
    <P>I am articulating the views of many PAYE people particularly in my area of Dublin.  There is a feeling that the £70 charge operated by South Dublin County Council was the thin end of the wedge.  Nobody in the Dublin Corporation area was paying water rates whereas people in other county council areas were obliged to pay.  That <Col N="797" /> was not an equitable system and many argued that it was double taxation.</P>
    <P>I want to nail the lie on water metering which has come to public attention over recent weeks. Are we seriously proposing that every household will install a water meter?  Are we seriously proposing that we will dig up pavements and streets in order to put water meters in place?  That is the reality.  Who will pay for the capital costs involved in installing these water meters?  Who will install them?  We had a major debate in this House last year about the devastation which will be caused as a result of installing the Luas transport system as that will necessitate the digging up of a number of streets.  What will happen if we have to dig up every single street, pavement and road throughout the country in order to put water meters in place?  That is simply not practical.</P>
    <P>An argument has been advanced in relation to the fact that water is a scarce resource.  Of course water is a scarce resource but there are many other scarce resources within our community.  We must educate people to use water sparingly and seek to ensure that water may be reused in other ways.  I saw recently in Britain where water coming from washing machines was used to water gardens. That ingenious system has been put in place by a number of local authorities in Britain.  We must look at the different ways in which we can use water more sparingly and re-educate people about its use.  We must also repair the present system of pipes.  I am glad to see that a structure of funding has been put in place by the Minister in Dublin to change the old system which is losing something of the order of a quarter or a third of the city's water supply as the pipes are not working particularly well.</P>
    <P>On the equalisation fund, a view has been put forward by many people within the local government sector that local authority members must have a strong and dominant representative role on the council which is being set up.  That is important.  If we are to have an equalisation fund which will channel money to counties which are losing money as a result of the new funding system, it is important that the people who make up local government are represented on an equalisaction council.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>It is important that we ring fence the amounts of money which are raised in the equalisation fund and that this money is not hived off into the Exchequer.  The Minister's view is that this money should remain locally and I am sure it will.  We need to examine the criteria established to deal with the equalisation fund.  What are the priorities which the equalisation council will call upon local authorities to make in terms of their budgets?</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in section 14 that the Minister is proposing to establish a value for money unit. It is very important that local authorities are given advice on a regular basis about spending and controlling money.  A value for money unit must be established because the way in which local government <Col N="798" /> has spent its money over recent years has not been transparent.  We had the situation where we agreed a budget in late autumn or early winter but had to depend on the Minister and the Government to release funds for the budget in the spring.  It is important that this be changed and I know the legislation will achieve this.</P>
    <P>This side of the House welcomes the Bill which is in harmony with what Members on this side have been saying from some time.  We look forward to its speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the way the Minister took on this challenge since coming to office, the prompt manner in which he asked KPMG to present him with a number of options and the effort he is making in restructuring local authority finances.</P>
      <P>Senator Kiely impressed me with his depth of experience of county councils at local and national level and he raised a number of issues. However, I do not have that experience and I would like to focus on the issue of charging for water.</P>
      <P>The existing system was ill conceived.  A flat rate tax on every home, regardless of the amount used, is daft.  It is right to abolish that approach but it is wrong to rubbish the idea of paying for water.  People who take that line are replicating the ghastly mistake of 1977, to which Senator Hayes referred, when, in order to win an election, domestic rates were abolished.  We have been suffering from that decision ever since.  The phobia about rates has been a millstone around the neck of local government financing ever since that time and is the reason there is a problem about financing local authorities.  It also illustrates how a mistake made in the heat of an election can haunt the country for a generation, and certainly for 20 years.</P>
      <P>I am saddened to see the same kind of mistake being made 20 years later.  It is not a mistake to get rid of flat rate water charges but it is a mistake of gigantic proportions to do so in such a way as to make it politically impossible in future to introduce any charge for domestic water.  If we make that mistake we are turning back to the 19th century rather than heading towards the 21st century.  We are turning our backs on Europe rather than harmonising our approach with that of our partners.  I know this will be hurtful to the Minister, but we are also turning our backs on environmental concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A month ago the Government with the avid enthusiasm of the Minister published with fanfare its environmental strategy based on the concept of sustainable development.  If anybody can take credit for this the Minister can in the context of the number of Bills he has introduced in recent years.  However, when the ESRI published a report outlining the consequences of the present policy the Government ran for cover.  In the Dáil the Minister treated the report with derision.  Perhaps this was because proposals for taxation are <Col N="799" /> not the kind of thing to be promoting particularly before an election.</P>
    <P>The idea of free domestic water originated in the 19th century and was born out of the public health situation of that time.  A national priority of Westminster was to encourage people to use water in that era when disease and infection were rife throughout Britain and Ireland in order to keep themselves and their surroundings clean. Water was free because health authorities were afraid poor people would not use enough if they had to pay for it.</P>
    <P>The provision of free domestic water was a correct and imaginative response to the challenges of that time.  The challenges faced today are totally different.  For example, it is clear that even in Ireland water has become a scarce resource. There may be a feeling that it rains constantly here but we do not have enough water to use in the wasteful manner which has now become a habit.</P>
    <P>The environmental issue surrounding water is not just about ensuring it is clean but it involves properly stewarding an increasingly scarce and therefore very valuable resource.  I know the Minister is aware of this as he has made a similar point since coming into office.</P>
    <P>The attitude we are now parroting appears peculiar to our partners in Europe and we will pay dearly for it in hard cash if we persist with the policy.  Across Europe water is regarded as a scarce resource.  Some years back the President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, said that wars of the 21st century will revolve around resources. Among the world's scarcest resource is water.  I cannot see the member states of the EU coming to blows about water but in every other European country people pay for water according to the amount they use.  Any other system strikes mainland Europeans as unbelievably wasteful.</P>
    <P>Waste is the central issue.  We are careful about what we pay for but we are not careful about things we get for free.  The extent to which we waste water is an environmental scandal.  We design our bathrooms so that every time we flush the toilet we use up to three times the amount of water necessary.  We spend so little on maintaining our water distribution system that in some cases up to 60 per cent of water disappears through leakage before it reaches the customer.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes made a strong point but he then said it was not practical to place meters measuring water consumption.  However, I am not talking about doing it this year.  We seem to be closing the door for all time on the idea.  It is not practical to continue wasting as much water as we are.</P>
    <P>By providing free water we encourage waste when we should be encouraging the careful use of this scarce resource.  There is no doubt that this situation will have to change, if not with this Bill or this year then in the future.  We should not be looking to the 21st century with anything else in mind.  Everybody in this House knows the policy <Col N="800" /> will have to change sometime and I am disappointed we are not making that change now.</P>
    <P>I praise the courageous exception of the Progressive Democrats Party, who have no representatives here today, in saying change is necessary. I am disappointed they are not here to support this stance.  Nobody seems to be willing to stand up and admit the truth.  I do not see the political difficulty surrounding this question.  There is no problem admitting that the present flat rate system is wrong, something the Minister accepts. That aside, why can we not say that the flat rate system is inequitable and unworkable and that it is going to be abolished but that some better method will have to be found to charge for domestic water?  I think the people would accept this because it would have a ring of honesty. However, telling them that they will never have to pay for water is like offering them a free lunch which everybody knows is too good to be true.</P>
    <P>I support what the Minister is attempting to do and the concept behind the Bill but I am deeply concerned that we seem to be closing the door for all time on the issue of water charges.  I would like some way of leaving the door open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and his document, <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change.</i>  I am a member of Cork County Council and I know many discussions have taken place at local level regarding funding of local authorities.  A special meeting of the county council was called some years back and all sorts of ways and means of funding local authorities were discussed.  They ranged from what is being proposed now &mdash; that motor taxation collected locally should be retained locally &mdash; to the suggestion that a certain amount of VAT should be kept for local spending.  Some even advocated that a proportion of all taxes collected in the area by central Government should be kept in the local area for use there.  While many of these proposals were unmanageable, I am glad to see the Minister has come up with a good solution for funding local government.</P>
      <P>We want to look at the functions of local authorities. The services provided by local authorities are many and varied.  As any member of a local authority will know, they meet the needs of people in the locality.  The authority's functions cover water supplies, sewerage schemes, waste management, environmental protection, housing, repairs, grants, roads, beaches, piers, the fire and library services, veterinary care, national monuments, court houses, the register of electors and many other aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of water and sewerage service charges for domestic users because some people were paying while others were not.  That was totally wrong.  People avoided paying and there was a big problem in enforcing payment in certain areas.  When some local authorities took it upon themselves not to charge at all because they had money from other sources, that threw petrol on the fire and there was no way out of it. <Col N="801" /> In respect of water and sewerage charges one is talking about having to pay a big sum of money at once.  If one is paying £1 a week it is not missed too much but if one receives a bill for £52 a year, which still amounts to only £1 a week, it is a lot of money to have to pay out in one go.  That is another negative aspect that hit local authorities. As Senator Hayes said, the cost of metering would be huge.  It would mean that not only would people be charged for water but they would also be charged a rental for the meter.</P>
    <P>The idea of local authorities using motor taxes is a good one.  Local authorities collect the money, so administration costs are there already. In the past the money went into the local authority and was transferred to Central Exchequer funds.  Under the new system local authorities will have a ready cash flow because when the money is paid in they will not be waiting to get grants back from the Department of the Environment. The money is there to be used immediately, giving the council a cash flow.  That, combined with October budgets, means councils will be able to begin their work earlier in the year instead of waiting for sanction from the Department by which time the good summer weather has gone. Council works frequently have to be rushed through the bad autumn and winter weather conditions. All these points support the new situation.</P>
    <P>Those in favour of charges should come out and say so clearly.  As regards the idea of free water, other services are also free.  For example, in education, tuition fees for primary, secondary and third level education are free.</P>
    <P>Some people have difficulty with the equalisation fund.  In his speech, the Minister said the 1996 Estimates revealed that income from motor tax in the year would exceed the income from domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant by approximately £12 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>That money is there already.  By holding back 20 per cent plus the commercial vehicles, it can be distributed more fairly to counties where there is not as big an amount of money coming in.  Some counties will have a surplus and others will not, so the equalisation fund will balance the situation.  The Minister and his departmental officials have already seen to this.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's handling of the group schemes and the way in which he has dealt with the problem both for urban and rural dwellers. He has introduced the £1,600 grant for people who want to sink their own wells because they cannot get a mains water supply otherwise or because their existing water supply is poor.  Those grants were abolished in 1987 and nothing was done to replace them until now.  I am glad to see they have been restored.</P>

      <P>Nothing is free because somebody is always paying, no matter what it is.  With regard to water charges, we pay for them in our taxes.  I will be supporting the Bill on behalf of my party so it will receive a free passage through the House.  However, certain aspects of it worry me.  I cannot understand why we should bow to those who want free water.  Some 40 years ago my mother was paying five shillings per week water rent.  It was metered and the meter is still there to this day.  I do not agree with those who put such a tag on metering water.  It is the only way people will respect the amount of water they use. It would surprise some people to learn that they are using 1,000 gallons a day and not 100 gallons as they may think.</P>
      <P>In the past people lived on a couple of buckets of water from the well every day and they got by on that because it was metered in a way; people were careful not to waste it because they had to draw it from the well and carry it to their houses. Water should not be wasted and the only way of ensuring that is by metering its use.  I do not support Senator Hayes' idea that it would be necessary to dig up the whole place to do so.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Beyond 2000&rdquo; programme showed a device which is connected to a water pipe and monitors the flow using a couple of wires connected to a meter.  Everyone is treated the same way by monitoring the flow of water through the pipe. We already have electricity meters.  Telephone meters can be situated in the exchange or in a person's house to see what units are being used. As time goes by the problem of metering water will become less difficult due to small and simple devices which can be fixed to a pipe and wired electronically to do the monitoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While water is essential television is not, yet people pay for a colour television licence.  I forget how much I paid, I think it was nearly £80.  If I had to choose, I would rather have water which is essential than television.  Every house in Dublin has a television.  I do not want to reduce this to a discussion about Dublin versus rural areas, but I must point out to Senator Hayes that the light outside my door is my light.  I paid for it. Nobody else put it there and while it is lighting. <Col N="803" /> all night, I am paying for it.  In addition, I paid for the driveway to my house.  There are lights throughout the streets of cities and towns and the people enjoy free lighting outside their houses. Footpaths are provided free and there are good roads; but I come out on to a bad potholed road, the only good part of which is my driveway.  Why are we complaining?  We are bowing to a minority group.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes rightly said that many of these measures were introduced in the past by parties trying to better each other before the electorate.  This is a similar case.  It is about an election.  We saw what happened in Dublin West when my neighbour, Mr. Joe Higgins, who lived only 200 or 300 yards from me, was nearly elected.  He gave everybody the fright of their lives.  Now he is bound to be elected because he is now on a pedestal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they will say &ldquo;That is the man who gave us free water.  Only for him we would be paying for it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Many people who live on the Dingle peninsula, County Kerry, operate bed and breakfasts and my wife and I have three rooms for that purpose. How much water charges will we pay?  We paid £212 last year for water simply because we were categorised as a guest house, even though I told Kerry County Council that it is not a guest house, because Bord Fáilte inform all bed and breakfast operators each year that if they use the term &ldquo;guest house&rdquo; they are breaking a law because a guest house is a place which provides accommodation and full board.  Will I and everybody operating bed and breakfasts benefit from my water rate?  The reason I am looking to be treated like everybody else is that we paid tax on the bed and breakfast business.  It is all above board and anybody can check it out.  I and all those registered operators of bed and breakfasts are entitled to complain because we are doing a great deal of good for the economy.  For instance, there are 52 restaurants and two hotels, with 130 and 25 rooms respectively, in Dingle and Senator Calnan would know of towns in west Cork in similar circumstances. The restaurants are kept going by people who use bed and breakfast accommodation and new restaurants open every year.  I welcome that, but bed and breakfast operators are making a contribution by paying taxes.</P>
      <P>I hope the tourism season will get longer.  We will be lucky to stretch it to seven months, but there are only two people, my wife and I, living in the House for five or six months of the year because the children are only at home at weekends. What kind of charge will be levied on people like me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> Senator Calnan mentioned people who have their own water supply.  What will happen in their case?  Will they be subjected to the increased level of motor tax like everybody else?  What about businesses which have three lorries on the road and which use water only to make tea for the employees?  Will all those people suffer?  I hope not.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to refuse.  People have wheelie bins and pay a refuse charge, but refuse turns up everywhere.  When I look down a street of 60 houses, I see only about ten wheelie bins out for collection.  Why does the council not knock on the door of the people who do not pay for a refuse service and ask where they put their refuse, because there is no official dump for refuse in Dingle?  Where are the people who do not avail of the wheelie bin service putting their rubbish, because they are the culprits?  Some sort of levy should be imposed on them because they must generate refuse.  To where does their ordinary domestic refuse go?  I guarantee that only half the people in Irish towns avail ol' a refuse collection.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a number of queries and I do not want to hold up the show.</P>

      <P>I wanted to ask a few questions and I got them off my chest.  I hope the Minister will answer a few of them.  I suppose the Bill makes a start.  I can see problems with the measure down the line, but let us wait and see.  I will not condemn it until then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to respond to the debate and I thank Senators for their positive contributions. As I learn every time I come back to the Seanad, where I spent four years as a Member, it is always worth listening to the practical experiences one hears about in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kiely wanted to leave the service charges as they are.  No other Senator argued that particular point.  There is a general acknowledgement that the flat rate service charge which was in place was just not fair.  It was not related to the cost of producing water or, more importantly, to the volume of consumption.  Whether one used little or much, one paid the same flat rate and people in some local authorities paid nothing. That was a bone of contention for years and it was a niggling battleground at local authorities. Local authorities with budgets of millions of pounds ended up having major rows, occupying huge tranches of time at meetings on the estimates <Col N="805" /> about a few thousand pounds in water charges.  Now this matter has been dealt with and it has been removed from the agenda, which is a good thing.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Kiely's comments about county roads, he is obviously aware of the county roads programme I have put in place.  I acknowledged the problem with county roads when I assumed office.  From that time a large volume of money has been invested in county roads, including £173 million State funding and £77 million of county council funds during the current year.  Therefore, the better part of£250 million has been spent to upgrade non-national roads.  This would have been considered impossible in the not too distant past.</P>
    <P>The Senator stated that if local authorities were given the motor tax pool for one year it would solve all their problems.  I must inform him that I have made provision to do so.  The total motor tax pool amounts to £258 million, £243 million of which will be given to local authorities in the coming years.  We are building a fund to tackle the problem of potholes, once and for all.  Most local authorities have acknowledged the work carried out.  In this year alone, 10,000 miles of non-national roads will be resurfaced which will be a a major boon to people living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely also made a number of points about north Kerry.  In terms of infrastructure, that area is extremely well catered for and has been for a considerable period.  This is due mainly to the pivotal and influential role played by a senior Deputy from north Kerry, namely, the Tánaiste. There is no Department which does not cater for the area in question and the infrastructure is there to be seen.  Therefore, Senator Kiely will plough that furrow aimlessly.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked how the new sewerage schemes will be financed.  The EU and national Government will be responsible in this regard. Approximately £150 million, the largest such allocation in the history of the State, will be spent on water and sewerage schemes.  I expect this figure to be increased because of an understanding on the European Union's part that Ireland will be obliged to upgrade its infrastructural standards to European norms.  For this reason, we are spending the enormous sum of money to which I referred.  The local authorities will maintain these schemes with the revenue I am providing.  Commercial charges, which traditionally form the bulk of funding obtained from commercial use of water and sewerage, will be unchanged by the provisions I have introduced.  These will also be put towards the cost of maintaining the schemes. There will be no difficulty maintaining the schemes.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Senator Hayes' point about the central issue of funding.  The KPMG report is a good document and its drafting involved much work on the part of the General Council of County Councils, the municipal authorities and the officials of my Department, whose input I heartily salute.  The report is a blueprint for the <Col N="806" /> genuine and meaningful reform of local government. However, this process will be meaningless unless a funding mechanism is put in place and the legislation sets out to achieve this.  The Bill is a practical measure.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to water leakages, which goes to the nub of the issue raised by the Progressive Democrats earlier in the week, and by Senator Quinn during this debate, about placing a practical value on water.  Acknowledging that the current system is inequitous and should be abolished &mdash; Senator Kiely stated that the old system should be retained but there is no cogent argument to support his assertion &mdash; I accept that there is an argument in favour of considering the introduction of meters.  I did so last year, but obviously the Progressive Democrats were asleep or were not interested at that stage.  I asked KPMG to investigate the introduction of water meters and, in its independent report, it stated that it was not a viable option.  I was informed that it would cost £200 million to install a metering system and a further £8 million to maintain it. The total income from domestic water charges last year was approximately £53 million.  How could one justify imposing a cost of £30 million per year to introduce water metering?  The Progressive Democrats want to impose that cost in respect of a leaking water system.  That is not the logical way to do business.</P>
    <P>If I had £200 million to spend, would it not be better to use it to provide water to those areas which do not yet have a water supply?  A sum of £32 million has been allocated to Dublin to plug the leaks in the system which will save 22 million gallons of water per day.  That is a more socially progressive environmental action to take rather than seeking to save water by charging people.  I took a practical not an ideological decision in respect of this matter.  I sought independent advice, which I accepted, and was informed that the introduction of meters was not viable.</P>
    <P>I usually listen with great care and respect to comments made be Senator Quinn because he is normally a very practical man.  However, he knows the first rule of business, namely, one has to be sensitive to the needs of one's customers.  If one's customers are opposed to a certain measure, regardless of whether one believes it to be correct, there is no point flogging a dead horse.  I had a discussion with the Senator about plastic bags.  He informed me that his company tried to stop using plastic bags but customer resistance to the move was such that they had to be reintroduced.  He knew it was right to stop using these bags but customer pressure obliged him to reverse his decision.  I do not believe the political system is any different.  We must be responsive to the needs of our customers, namely, the people and there has been great resistance to water charges in the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to the ESRI report on green taxes, the general thrust of which I strongly support.  However, I would not support every detail of the report.  I have argued with the Minister <Col N="807" /> for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and encouraged him to consider the issue of green taxes.  It is my ambition that, during our next term in Government, we will move towards the introduction of additional green taxes.  It would be a progressive measure to put in place clearer &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principles.  However, we must temper our actions in the interests of practicality.</P>
    <P>If I had decided to introduce water meters to every household throughout the country there would have been chaos.  It is wonderful that people can posit these ideas in theory.  However, the practical consequence of placing a meter in every household is that people would physically resist such action.  They resisted paying water charges in the past and one can imagine the reaction if council workers arrived to place meters in people's homes.  Some individuals would offer physical resistance.  We must ask when charging would begin.  Would charges be put in place when meters were placed in some homes or would we be obliged to wait until all meters were in place? In the interim, colossal sums of money would be spent.  Therefore, it was not viable or practical to introduce a metering system and everyone is aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>When the proposed infrastructure is in place, we can consider this issue again.  We may have to revisit these issues but that will not be until some time in the next century.  As already stated, I have no ideological objection to the introduction of water meters &mdash; my objection is a practical one.  I believe the hallmark of my actions during my four and a half years in Government is that I have been practical.  There is no point proposing measures which are clearly impractical.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have been disingenuous on this issue, which they discovered late in the day, and they did not take part in the debate when I published the KPMG report last June.  They entered the debate because Deputy Molloy had a rush of blood to the head and stated that we should pay £23 million for group water schemes.  His assertion sent such a shock through the Progressive Democrats' culture base that the party's leader, Deputy Harney, stated that we should return to the old system.  However, that did not suit party sensibilities so they proposed the introduction of metering.  The Progressive Democrats' current position, which was voiced in the Lower House last evening, is that it would introduce metering but would not charge for it until 2012.  I know of no one who previously suggested a solution whereby a system of funding would be put in place but charges in respect of it would not be introduced until 13 to 14 years later.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats know this suggestion is impractical.  The proposals before the House are designed to meet current challenges and needs.  They are aimed at providing local authorities with the strength to reform their structures and giving them the devolved responsibilities they have sought for some time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> I thank Senator Calnan for his support for the measure and I join him in acknowledging the work of local authorities.  Group schemes with private wells are important and the measures which the Government has promulgated acknowledge their work for the first time.  I am proud of the individual wells grant because it will be of great benefit to many isolated individuals in rural Ireland.  I am pleased to be able to provide that and I thank the colleagues in Government for enabling me to do so.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the contribution of Fianna Fáil in Government with Labour prior to 1994 in the improvement in our finances; a great deal of work was done.  They were in a desperate state when Fianna Fáil was in office on its own and with the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>They were in a dreadful state in 1992.  We turned the ship around together and there has been a remarkable improvement over the subsequent four years during both Administrations. We must maintain a steady course and not allow extraneous forces with odd ideas divert a successful ship off course.  I am sure there will be other avenues to argue that in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald made a number of specific points.  Metering makes people respect water. However, it is not practical for the reasons given. I will not spend £200 million over the next number of years when I want to spend it on plugging leaks and providing a water supply.  If I had £200 million and came into the House and asked Senators to decide whether I should spend it on their water schemes in Kerry, Cork or elsewhere, or on meters for all, what response would I get? I would be told that I must provide water for the people and that is what I intend to do.  It is the correct social, economic and environmental course of action to take.</P>
      <P>The Senators referred to bed and breakfast accommodation.  Commercial enterprises will be charged commercial water rates but where one is associated with a domestic dwelling, the local authority will apportion the cost between the two. Every household will have a domestic allowance so they will not be charged for that.  That applies to farms where there is a dual domestic and commercial supply also.  There will be an apportionment between the two and the domestic supply will be free.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>The season lasts for only half of the year.  Will that be taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the local authority and I have every confidence the Senator is in a strong position to argue the case with the local authority concerned as it is practical.  Commercial water charges will remain.  Where the commercial operation is clearly a small element of the total usage, a minimal charge would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> Senator Fitzgerald also referred to commercial road tax.  I will explain how the equalisation fund will apply.  The fund will be provided to ensure the commitment I have given &mdash; that every local authority will benefit &mdash; will be delivered.  Certain local authorities generate a great deal more revenue in car tax than they do in rates support grant and charges.  I do not propose that they should keep this huge windfall and the only way to prevent that is to take a slice off the top, create a new equalisation fund and distribute it.  Every penny of commercial and domestic motor tax will stay with local government &mdash; 80 per cent of domestic motor tax will stay in local government and 20 per cent will go into the fund, while all commercial motor tax will go into the fund.  The pool will be distributed to ensure the top up meets everybody's requirements.</P>
    <P>How do I know that each local authority will do better?  It is a simple mathematical formula. The total money from rates support grant and water charges is less than that available from motor tax.  It is a buoyant pool and has increased considerably this year over last.  It would have meant a benefit of about £12 million over and above last year had it been in operation last year and I expect it to be even more this year.  I want the equalisation fund to be controlled by local authorities, not by the Department of the Environment or, especially, the Department of Finance, and I am establishing an equalisation council to do that.  If times get bad during a future Administration, I do not want this to be seen as a nice pool of money to grab.  The way to do that is to establish a separate funding mechanism and this Bill will enable me to do so by order.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the enactment of this Bill and to coming back as Minister later in the year or early in the new year with the next Bill on local government reform.  It will implement the remaining parts of this programme and will coincide with the centenary of local government in 1998.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the establishment of a body which shall be known as the Local Government Equalisation Council.  It does not specify the number of members which shall comprise it; it is at the discretion of the Minister.  Can the number be varied depending <Col N="810" /> on the number of party supporters which the Minister might wish to appoint to the council?  It also does not specify the duration or length of term of office of council members and this is also at the discretion of the Minister.  The section provides that the Minister may by order determine the number of members which shall be on the council.  Can the number be varied from time to time?</P>
      <P>The section does not specify whether the chairman will be elected or appointed and what the term of office will be.  It does not provide any mechanism whereby continuity would be provided for the council.  For example, a certain percentage of the members of the council could retire after a specified number of years and the same percentage could retire the following year, and so on.  This would be desirable as it would provide continuity.</P>
      <P>Section 7(4) states that the Minister &ldquo;may by order confer on the council one or more of the following functions&rdquo;.

      <P>Since publishing <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change,</i> I established a number of working groups involving the General Council of County Councils, the Municipal Authorities Association and the County Managers Association. I asked them to flesh out the proposals in a working atmosphere.  I will take their recommendations on board in relation to the structure of this council and draft regulations accordingly. Those regulations will be published and subjected to annulment in the House if they are unsatisfactory. I will happily discuss them with Senators when the regulations are made.  However, rather than having me decide on the shape and the chairmanship of this body it would be better to involve the practitioners, management and elected members and I will be guided by their deliberations.</P>

      <P>A huge number of people do not pay car tax.  I do not know the figure, but I can never understand why there is no local authority system to inform the Garda that such a person has not paid their tax.</P>
      <P>Four years ago my car was stolen in Dublin.  I only had the car for a short period and I could not remember the registration number, although I knew the colour.  I reported the incident in a Garda station and eventually got the number of the car.  When the Garda had the registration number he pressed a few buttons on a keyboard and was able to access all the necessary information about the vehicle.</P>
      <P>Local authorities use computers.  Car tax forms are sent out every year and one fills in the details. This comes back to zero tolerance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely every car is on a computer system.  Why can local authorities not send out a letter to everyone and if there is no response it is clear they have not paid their tax?</P>
      <P>We are told that up to 10 per cent of cars are not taxed.  These people get away with not paying water charges.  This might not be appropriate to this section of the Bill.  Has the Minister any suggestions on how to tackle this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities will now have a strong, vested interest in maximising their car tax revenue.  This was not the case up to now as authorities were only a conduit through which revenue was passed to Dublin.  A number of innovative ideas will be generated by local authorities to ensure that all car owners pay their car tax.</P>
      <P>The evasion rate is less than 5 per cent.  I have contacted the Garda Síochána in relation to this matter because I wish to preserve national revenues. There will now be a more focused campaign by local authorities to collect their own revenues. The national rate for persistent evasion is 2.8 per cent resulting in an estimated loss of £7.5 million last year.  I do not know if there is a difference between persistent and ordinary evasion. That figure is low by international standards.  The comparative figure in the UK is 4.1 per cent.  The 1996 survey results show an improvement when compared with the 1991 results.  We are getting better and the local authorities will ensure further improvements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has fought this battle and the arguments have been made for and against this measure.  Would the Minister agree that our rates of motor taxation are high in European terms and relative to the UK?  There was a successful political initiative to abolish car tax in 1977.  It was reinstated in 1979.  It was foolishly abolished, as were house rates, but that is another argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could a future Government unravel and disassemble everything the Minister has painstakingly <Col N="812" /> put together?  What contingency plans does the Minister have if even he finds himself in Government in another Department where he is being pressed for funds and he starts looking at this attractive mountain of money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to have this Bill enacted as I am aware of that temptation.  The Bill ring-fences a new source of funding for local government.  That funding is untouchable without an amending Act, so any future Government seeking an alteration will have to come back to the Oireachtas.  This is not being done by ministerial order but by an Act of the Oireachtas, which states that motor tax is owned by local authorities.</P>
      <P>In preparation for this Bill and with the authority of the Government, I instructed the Exchequer to begin to create this pool once the £100 million rate support grant already paid out is repaid in motor tax income.  That £100 million has already been repaid to the Exchequer.  The pool for local authorities is growing and waiting for the enactment of this Bill to be released.</P>
      <P>If any future Minister for the Environment receives the approval of the Oireachtas to unravel this plan then that is democracy and I have no control over it.  However, from speaking to other parties, there is a growing awareness that this is a prudent, practical and achievable mechanism for funding local government.  The other options have been examined by KPMG.  We might share views on the mistakes of the past but I do not see any future Government rushing in to do some of the things people are proposing.</P>
      <P>This mechanism will be a boon to local authorities as it is a buoyant source of income.  Car ownership rates in Ireland are at the lower end of the European average.  They are much lower than any other country in the EU and more akin to Central European countries.  As we become more affluent more people will own cars.  The buoyancy exists without touching the base rates.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report stated that we should increase car tax, carbon taxes and charges on fuels and a variety of services and goods which pollute.  That is a debate for the future.  Green taxation is out there, so no future Government will abolish car tax.  There will be a view that carbon or polluting taxes must exist on any mechanism, service or utility which causes environmental harm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on carbon tax is a real one and the Minister's argument is well made. Surely this will prove an attractive option for a future Government.  Will it prove part of central Exchequer funding or will local authorities be given the right to raise revenue in this area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I genuinely believe in local government and if I have my way we will reshape it.  When Minister for Health, I believed the Department should be the policy department, arguing for national resources and shaping policy, but the &ldquo;doers&rdquo; should be the health boards, subsections <Col N="813" /> of the health services and the deliverers of care.  Every decision should not be made centrally. By and large, that is how that system has evolved.</P>
      <P>Local government is eager to do much more, but so much is decided centrally that need not be decided there.  If we give real powers of implementation to local authorities they should also get the necessary resources.  There is now a strong view in Governments of all political hues that the day of passing Bills to tell local authorities what to do, without giving them the financial wherewithal to do so, is gone.  The new tax bases being discussed for local government will be available, and it is a good direction to go and will bring us into line with European administrations.  That will also be good for central Government as we will have more time for policy than being absorbed in the minutiae of delivery.  I also hope it changes the culture in the media and among the public, who are very demanding in this regard.  They want Ministers to do what is needed with national policy, walk the European stage and represent Ireland in the European Union, but they also demand involvement by Ministers in the minutiae of detailed delivery of services by our Departments which is a burden that falls on no other country's Ministers.  This debate needs to be in a broad context if we are to achieve the objectives shared by all sides of the House on the fundamental shift in the way the country is governed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of my declared interest as a nominee of the Library Association of Ireland.  It has made submissions and buttonholed the Minister more than once since he announced the abolition of water charges last Christmas.  The association has asked him to abolish library book charges which are levied by local authorities in their annual estimates.  These have been a source of major irritation to librarians and have proven counterproductive.  These charges have inhibited the orderly, natural and important development of a wider book readership, particularly <Col N="814" /> among those who need it most.  The administrative costs involved and the revenue generated do not justify the continuation of these charges; although they are introduced and maintained by a wide variety of local authorities, due to resentment of them they have rarely been increased appreciably.  Those charges have not kept pace with inflation or rises in other revenue-generating activities of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that we are talking about water charges, but this is my opportunity to raise this issue and to make the Minister consider this question. What is his view on this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The media have been absorbed by demands for charges, so it is very difficult to argue for any service to be provided free.  There is some merit in the Senator's argument, although it is not pertinent to this legislation.  In the event of an electoral contest occurring soon, I hope there will be a vested interest in my discussions with the Library Association of Ireland and that I return to the position I hold.  From the dialogue I have had, I feel I would be good for the Library Association of Ireland and the development of libraries.</P>
      <P>On the specific question of whether I would bring in legislation to forbid charging for such services, I am not minded to do so now, but I will keep an open mind on it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister covered this elsewhere.  Will the administration of the transfer of this money increase administrative charges at local authority level in a way that would detract from local authorities' net income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As Senators have already pointed out, this is a unique tax in that it is collected already in the local government system. Local authorities would simply be instructed to keep 80 per cent of the money.  The only situation in which additional administrative costs would arise would be in the case of those authorities which do not currently collect motor tax and who then decide to do so, such as the Dublin authorities. Dublin Corporation currently collects for the entire area and I envisage the other authorities wishing to become their own motor taxation collectors.  That would have some obvious administrative costs and would reduce the volume of funding available to them.  Other costs, such as computer modification costs, might occur, but no other tax lends itself so perfectly to being transferred to local authorities because it is already in their remit and would have the least financial impact in its administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two points.  First, the Minister mentioned local authorities which do not currently collect tax.  In Dublin there are three local authorities which will now, presumably, seek the power to collect revenue.  There must be down-sizing implications for Dublin Corporation and staff implications for the three local authorities because of expansion of their duties.</P>
      <P>The second point is related.  I gather the varying increase of 3 per cent, which the Minister will allow, is at the discretion of local authorities. Dublin local authorities have huge revenue earning facilities unlike my county of Leitrim which must squeeze every last penny.  Taking those two extremes, will there be staffing implications throughout the country because of the variable nature of what the Minister has outlined?  That is not necessarily bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing implications would be minimal in that they would not apply to counties other than those which might for the first time become motor tax collecting authorities.  Part of the thrust of the programme for local government reform is to focus services on the customer.  I envisage a process of decentralisation.  If a person wants to pay motor tax in my county of Wexford, he or she must go to the County Hall.  Wexford is a large county and technology should be in place to allow people to pay their motor tax in Enniscorthy, Gorey or New Ross.  Such technology should be available throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be implications if we provide such a service.  However, we will not only provide a new motor tax office but hopefully a one stop shop where the range of service available from the local authority and other services will be available. <Col N="816" /> There should be a single house for community development.  People have easy access to services, which should be as efficient and open as possible.  The two day seminar held last year &mdash; I am not sure if the Senator attended it &mdash; was good in that regard.</P>
    <P>County Donegal is an example of decentralisation. That county is regionalising its services to provide a one stop shop on the doorstep of as many people as possible.  I would see that process happening in parallel and it will have staffing and cost implications.  It is, however, meaningful reform in the best sense of this document.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have circulated a long version of my speech as Members may wish to study it in detail.  This is a non-contentious Bill that gives effect to the Chemical Weapons Convention which is the result of 24 years of painstaking negotiations.  It provides a framework for monitoring chemical industries and for the prevention and destruction of existing chemical weapons.  It also ensures that these weapons of appalling destruction are not manufactured in our manufacturing plants and that the means of manufacture do not find their way to unsavoury regimes or to terrorist groups. Unlike other measures in the arms limitation field, the Bill provides for the destruction of all chemical weapons and chemical weapon production facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an elaborate system of verification and inspection which will be undertaken by an independent international organisation to ensure compliance by the ratifying states.  Ireland ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention in June 1996.  The purpose of the Bill is to create the structures and powers necessary for the State to meet its obligations under the convention.  The convention requires that a national authority be established in each ratifying <Col N="817" /> state and the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health Authority will be the body in Ireland.  In the course of its normal inspections of chemical facilities it will carry out the inspections required to ensure that controlled substances are properly monitored and that these premises are not being used for the manufacture of chemical weapons.  The authority has all the necessary expertise and is familiar with the chemical industry from its mainstream work.</P>
    <P>The enforcement powers provided in the Bill are modelled on similar provisions in existing legislation, notably the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  Under the Chemical Weapons Convention declarations will be required from the State and the chemical industry. The State will declare that it processes no chemical weapons and has no chemical weapon production facilities.  The Schedules to the Bill deal with chemicals that could be used to form chemical weapons, some of which have legitimate peace time uses.  There are procedures for monitoring and controlling the use of these chemicals and which ensure they are not used in the manufacture of chemical weapons at home or that they are not exported to unsavoury or unsuitable organisations abroad.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains strict provisions on confidentiality concerning information given to the national authority for transmission to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague which will monitor compliance &mdash; in other words, commercially sensitive information will not be disclosed if chemical companies provide information under the Bill on the stocks of chemicals they hold.  It is very much in the interests of the chemical industry that Ireland ratifies this convention as trade in certain chemicals with non-ratifying countries is restricted under the convention.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was being prepared there were extensive consultations with industry interests which have expressed themselves satisfied with its provisions and are anxious that we pass this legislation with due speed so that we can continue to trade on the basis that we have a chemical industry of which we can be proud, which has nothing to hide and which is not involved directly or indirectly in the production of these appalling weapons.</P>
    <P>To date nearly 90 states have ratified the treaty, including all EU member states and the US.  We want all UN member states to sign up to the treaty.  In Israel a case is taking place involving somebody who is alleged to have supplied the makings of a mustard gas factory to Iran.  It is important from a humanitarian point of view that we have proper control over these potentially appalling weapons internationally.  This is an important humanitarian measure which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill which should be on the Statute Book.  The <Col N="818" /> Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has discussed chemical and biological weapons.  I refer to the report of the UN subcommittee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on peacekeeping and peace enforcement in the light of UN reform.  The report refers to the fourth review conference of the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention in December 1996 which gave added impetus to the work in hand and strengthened the BTWC.  It also says that it is generally agreed that agreement will be reached on a new verification Protocol to the convention and that the Chemical Weapons Convention came into force on 29 April 1997 but has yet to be ratified by either of the two declared possessors, the United States and Russia.  The Minister of State stated that ratification by the United States proved to be an important step in persuading other countries to ratify before 29 April.  The European Union is working with the United States Administration to encourage approval by the United States Congress.  I am glad the EU has given the United States the impetus to talk about this.</P>
      <P>Chemical weapons are not new as they have been used in wars for generations.  No one can condone their use.  The horrific effects of the use of chemical weapons during the First World War should never be forgotten as the carnage caused by their use by both sides was atrocious.  Much was made of the use of chemical weapons by the Iraqis against the Kurdish people and their own population.  We should condemn the use by Saddam Hussein and his Government of chemical weapons.  In August and September 1988, over 55,000 Kurds fled to Turkey from northern Iraq to escape military attacks by the Iraqi Government forces.  Some 90 per cent of these were civilians who were attacked with chemical weapons. We should not forget that happened.  Neither should we forget, although some people want to, what was done by the United States during the Vietnam War.  Agent Orange is something about which the western world would like to forget, but we must remember that millions of people suffered because of it and the actions of the United States.  I hope the US Government and its people will never again allow what happened in Vietnam to happen elsewhere in the world.  It was atrocious and horrific.</P>
      <P>All major powers, including the British, have used chemical weapons.  They are indiscriminate and do not differentiate between those at whom they are aimed and ordinary civilians.  They kill everyone in the area at which they are aimed. That is inhumane and should never be condoned. This Bill, which ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention, is one with which everyone in Ireland should agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister ask the British Government about the dumping of chemical weapons in the Irish Sea and in seas around Ireland off the Heb-rides and the west coast?  The <i>Carrickatine,</i> a boat which sank off north Donegal about two years ago, has never been found.  We employed United <Col N="819" /> States personnel to search for it at the time and they found sunken U-boats and blocks of cement containing gas canisters.  The United Kingdom has never told the Irish Government how many U-boats or gas canisters it sank or dumped.  The containers held the most horrific of chemical weapons, such as phosgene and anthrax.  These are in the Irish Sea and the British Government has still not told anyone where they have been dumped.  I think what happened was that navy personnel who were instructed to dump these in mid-Atlantic brought them a short distance off the Irish coast and dumped them there instead, probably because it would save them money.</P>
    <P>The crimes against humanity caused by chemical weapons are too numerous to mention or for us to feel that we should ever again allow anyone to use them.  Regardless of what we say and who signs the convention, they will be used in future. All we can do is to try and ensure that, if they are used, there will be sanctions against the countries which use and sell them.  This Bill is a welcome addition to our legislation and is overdue.  I am delighted to hear from the Minister that the United States has signed the convention.  It should have been the first signatory because it was the largest producer of chemical weapons and I am not sure if it is still.  Having signed the convention, it is to be hoped that the international community can monitor what happens in such countries which I think are still producing chemical weapons, although they have signed the convention.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as an addition to the legislation of this country.</P>

She has an impressive record of legislation to her credit during this Parliament's lifetime and I hope those of us in the next Parliament will have the pleasure of seeing her as Minister again.</P>
      <P>I echo Senator Lanigan's words that this is an important Bill and he put it into context in an eloquent contribution.  This country is doing the right thing by passing this Bill because it ensures our own bona fide chemical industry can continue to be a major part of our economy while ensuring there will be no abuse of the chemicals process. Everyone in the House is agreed in principle that it is a good and well thought out measure.  Perhaps it will be abused by others who want to use chemical weapons for their own ends and we may not be able to do much about it.  At least we have done our bit and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>On reading the first page of the Minister's speech, I was reminded of the First World War.  My mother's brother, Patrick O'Brien, was gassed in France during that war. My other uncle was also in the war and was in <Col N="820" /> the same hospital having been gassed as well, but he survived.  He told me of the terrible death his brother suffered.  This brought home to me how serious this issue can be.  The world is a small place.  We read in the paper of countries experimenting with these gases and chemical weapons and some of them could be accidentally emitted and be blown in our direction, as happened in Chernobyl.  We saw the horrific scenes of what happened in Tokyo when someone crazy enough used these gases.  I support the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important if small legislation compared to what we dealt with earlier. Like Senator Fitzgerald I am influenced in my opinion by what I have read about the First World War.  Although it is more than 70 years and two generations since the end of that war, as a youngster I met members of the Connacht Rangers in County Leitrim who had fought for the freedom of small nations during the war.  It is interesting that old soldiers rarely regale one with stories about the battlefield.  They will tell many other stories that would bore one to tears but getting them to talk about the more horrific elements of war is like drawing teeth.  War is horrific anyway.</P>
      <P>The use of mustard gas between 1914 and 1918 by the Germans was the first indication the world received of how lethal chemical weapons could be.  I have an abiding memory of old black and white footage from that war.  It showed a line of young men of about 18 or 19 years, each of whom had been blinded by the gas, and each has their hand on their comrade's shoulder as they were led by one person who could see.  The experience of the First World War concentrated the minds of civilised countries and led to the first Geneva Convention.  Ultimately it led to this modern treaty which Ireland is ratifying.</P>
      <P>The potential for the treaty's effectiveness has been increased as a result of its ratification by the United States.  Is it true that China and India have not ratified the convention?  I understand India has deliberately opted out.  What are the implications for Irish industry?  Is there evidence of Irish industry manufacturing chemical or biological material which could be used in the armaments trade?  The Minister of State also referred to the monitoring process.  We are granting a large concession by ratifying the convention because we are permitting access to the State and its installations to representatives from outside the State.  A national authority for occupational safety and health will be appointed under the Bill and it will be the national authority for the purposes of the convention.  However, the Bill also grants people from outside the jurisdiction the right to carry out inspections.  What will they inspect?  If Irish industry is not involved in producing these materials, is it a normal responsibility of our ratification that we permit such general access or is it a specific proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While inspection and monitoring will not cause <Col N="821" /> difficulty for this State, an indication of the increasing difficulties facing civilised nations in achieving a consensus in this area is offered by the reaction of the Iraqi regime which has used every trick in the book to prevent the United Nations from carrying out a full and detailed investigation of its installations.  Although this legislation is worthy and it is right that we should be a party to the convention, the reality is that not every country is a good neighbour or an &ldquo;honest injun&rdquo; in matters of this nature.  There are leaders of countries who would use biological weapons at the drop of a hat to further their aims.</P>
    <P>I hope the convention and the fact that the largest and most powerful country in the world has ratified it, at roughly the same time as one of the smallest but equally influential countries, will act as a beacon to other countries and convey the message that this type of manufacture is unacceptable.  However, wars are not started by reasonable people sitting together drinking coffee but by despots and people who have grandiose ambitions beyond their station.  It is, therefore, vital that we continue to play an active role by not only ratifying conventions of this nature but by seeking to ensure international monitoring of the conventions.  Will we make a contribution to monitoring the convention or do we have the expertise to do so?</P>
    <P>I am pleased this legislation has come before the House.  It proves our responsibilities in the international community are not taken lightly but are addressed when the occasion demands.  I commend the Minister of State for introducing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their unanimous support of the Bill.  Whatever partisan differences we have &mdash; they will be debated thoroughly in the next few weeks &mdash; there has always been unanimity among politicians on issues of humanitarian concern.</P>
      <P>I was interested to listen to Senator Fitzgerald speak about his family's experiences.  It puts faces on statistics and shows us reality.  It is not an abstract matter but is very much part of the memory of people in this country.  One can read the Schedules to the Bill and the long list of unpronounceable chemicals but Senator Fitzgerald's contribution was an important reminder that chemical warfare affects real people and causes real suffering.  It affects not just foreign countries but has an impact on the people of our country as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan asked about the dumping of munitions and the sinking of U boats around our coast.  I have a detailed note on that matter which I will forward to the Senator.  A detailed study was carried out under the auspices of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and the conclusion of independent experts was to leave well enough alone since removal of the material might <Col N="822" /> cause more problems.  At present, marine life is unaffected and regular testing is carried out.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked if we would have a role internationally.  As contributors to the UN we will help to fund the expert group, whose members will be familiar with the chemicals concerned, which will be based in Geneva.  In Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority is expert in this area and will monitor our chemical industry to ensure it remains chemical weapon free.  Some of the substances listed in the Schedules have peaceful applications and can be used to produce legitimate products, such as paint.  The authority will ensure those substances are only used for legitimate products and not to produce saran or mustard gas.</P>
    <P>We would like to see all countries involved. The most important country is Russia.  The obligations under the convention require the destruction of these weapons.  The EU is in the process of putting together a financial package for this purpose because there are large financial costs for countries such as Russia which have a stockpile of these materials.  The financial package will assist Russia and the former CIS countries to ratify the convention by being in the financial position to dispose of the materials.  Eighty-seven countries have ratified the convention to date.  The ratification by the US was extremely important.  It had a more difficult passage through their Senate than hopefully it will have through ours.  Anybody who wants to do business with the US will have to have ratified the convention.  That economic signal is a very powerful tool for making countries comply.</P>

      <P>They are chemicals which can be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons.  It is a peculiarity that I cannot understand.  If we are going to ban the use of chemical weapons we must make certain that materials which can be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons are also banned.  That might seem extreme as there might be certain chemicals which could be used for humanitarian purposes.  Where is the line to be drawn in relation to the manufacture of these chemicals?  This is where the Bill and the convention will possibly fall down.  There are countries who will use the opt-out &ldquo;except as authorised&rdquo;. It is an opt-out.

      <P>The First Schedule deals with a list of chemicals, not weapons.  It is not a practical issue for us because very little or any of these toxic chemicals are in use or held in Ireland.  Until the Bill is passed and we do the counting we will not know if the amount is negligible rather than nil.  To some extent it is academic.  In theory some of these substances could be used for research, medical, pharmaceutical or protective use which is permitted under the convention.  The aggregate amount of chemicals listed in the First Schedule which a country can use is one tonne, which is small.  Conditions are placed on the transfer of such chemicals to other countries.  Exports are permitted only to other State parties and such exports must be notified to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.  If chemicals were being used for peaceful purposes &mdash; for example, the manufacture of paint &mdash; and were being exported to Berger Paints in the UK or Germany the movement of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not have shares in any company except Dundrum Community Radio, in which I have a £10 share.</P>
      <P>The movement from one area to another would be controlled.  The use of chemicals is highly restricted because they are toxic.  Even though there are theoretical peace-time uses for them, they are controlled and their movement will be controlled by the organisation to be set up in Geneva.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 provides the Minister with powers to make regulations for the purpose of controlling the use, production, acquisition or possession of the chemicals in the First Schedule.  It tightens up rather than loosens the Bill.  Because of the quantitative limit of one tonne, it is proposed to introduce <Col N="824" /> a licensing system for these chemicals, which will be administered by the Health and Safety Authority.  Our information is that very little, if any, of these are in use.  If in theory there was a peace-time use for these chemicals it would be very tightly supervised under these regulations. The movement of them from one country to another would be very tightly overseen at international level.  This is very much in keeping with the convention.  It ensures nobody will be able to utilise peace-time use for illegitimate purposes. There are no loopholes.  It will be regulated, so there will be no under the counter export to, say, Iraq.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a flaw in the Bill.  There is absolutely no doubt but that a cocktail of legitimate chemicals can be used to produce a chemical weapon.  The problem is that the chemical industry is worldwide and is controlled by a small number of people.  Each element in a chemical weapon can be used in a legitimate situation, but the cocktail that makes the chemical weapon could be used by an international group by individually sending parts within the one tonne.</P>

      <P>Can anyone imagine a one-tonne cocktail chemical weapon?  That is enough to wipe out Dublin in about ten seconds.  It is a flaw and how to address it is beyond us. It is not something that can be monitored by the international community or this legislation.  It is a flaw that will remain because chemical weapons are a cocktail of legitimate pieces of chemicals.  I put down a marker that there can be legitimate production of certain chemicals which, if mixed together, become chemical weapons.  Knowing the nature of the international conglomorates who produce chemicals, I do not think they can be controlled by the United Nations.  If international conglomorates decide to produce a chemical weapon from legitimate chemicals they will do so.  I do not wish to make an issue of this but it is something which should be recognised.</P>

      <P>It will cause a headache.  If we cast our minds back to 25 years ago when the bombing started in Northern Ireland, it was weed killer, imported by all of us, that made the most lethal bomb.  It was a granulated type of weedkiller. It was discovered after four or five years that this weedkiller was being used for making bombs.  It could be bought in large quantities in almost every agricultural shop and co-op throughout the country.  I was working in a shop at the time when a tonne of this weedkiller was bought in in a large consignment because we were wholesaling to another shop.  Many years later we discovered, through the Garda, that some of it could have gone to bad use.  It was eventually banned.  I am not saying Senator Lanigan is right, <Col N="825" /> but I can see there might be a loophole in the Bill.</P>

      <P>From our contacts with the chemical industry it does not seem that any of the substances listed in the First Schedule are used or are likely to be used by Irish companies.  There are three Schedules to the Bill.  The First Schedule deals with the most toxic chemicals and has the most stringent controls.  There can be no more than one tonne of such chemicals in the country. It will be very stringently monitored by the Health and Safety Authority.  There are powers of seizure and terms of life imprisonment for breaches of this legislation.  It is extremely tough. I believe the Bill, as drafted, allows us to adequately supervise what are theoretical peace-time uses for these highly toxic groups of chemicals. In relation to the Second and Third Schedule lists, which are less toxic and which are organised in terms of degrees of toxicity in line with the provisions of the convention, there are different degrees of control.  The First Schedule has the most stringent controls.</P>
      <P>We are all trying to achieve the same goal.  I reassure Senators that the powers in the Bill are tough.  We can close places down, seize materials etc., destroy substances found and jail people. Offenders will not be able to trade with the United States.  This will keep people on the straight and narrow.  Irish expertise in the chemical area is second to none and there are superb staff in the Health and Safety Authority.  They were recognised as such by our European partners during our Presidency.  The controls in this section are good and they will be implemented.</P>

      <P>Under section 13 a person who contravenes the Act shall be liable:</P>
      <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,500, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, or</P>
      <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £100,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.</P>
      <P>These fines and convictions applied to an international chemical company in breach of the law are a nonsense.  They should be multiplied at least tenfold.  If someone is providing chemical weapons to an organisation, whether it is a Government or non-Government one, a fine of £1,500, imprisonment for 12 months or a fine not exceeding £100,000 does no good.  I do not think anyone would disagree with these measures being increased tenfold.</P>

      <Col N="826" /> The Schedules list the toxic chemicals covered under the Bill.  When the <i>Carrickatine</i> went down the Americans found canisters which contained phosgene carbonyl dichloride, which is listed in the Third Schedule.  Chemicals such as this and others listed in the Schedules are found in cannisters in the Irish Sea.  They have been there since the first World War.  These were seen on spot image pictures made by the Americans when we were looking for the <i>Carrickatine.</i>  I do not know what we can do about it, and I do not want to ask the British Government again.  Section 13 is not strong enough.</P>

      <P>I draw the Senator's attention to section 3(4)(b) which provides for a sentence of life imprisonment for anyone who produces, develops, uses or transfers a chemical weapon, directly or indirectly, constructs a premises or engages in preparations of a military nature to use a chemical weapon.  The maximum fine in a District Court is £1,500.  I would envisage that District Court prosecutions will be taken only for minor technical breaches, possibly if someone was a day late with paperwork.  It normally would not be appropriate to conduct a District Court prosecution.</P>
      <P>Section 13 states &ldquo;where no other penalty is provided by this Act.&rdquo;  Life imprisonment is the key penalty in the Bill and is provided for in section 3(4) (b).</P>

      <P>If a company produces chemical weapons and a court case ensues, who will receive a sentence of life imprisonment?  Will it be the board of directors?  This is not specified.  It is stated that a sentence of life imprisonment can be imposed under section 3.  Who is responsible, the managing director, the chief executive or everyone in the company?  This is a nonsense unless every person involved in the decision to manufacture chemical weapons is specified.  There will be a fall guy in each company who will be jailed for life and the rest of the company will get away with the production of weapons.  Under section 3, who is the fall guy?</P>
