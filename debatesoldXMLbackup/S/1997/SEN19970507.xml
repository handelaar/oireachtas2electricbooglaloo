      <P>I have notice from Senator D. Kiely that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to bring forward his proposals to provide local authority members with pensions as outlined by the General Council of County Councils of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3.  We will take the Second Stage of item 1 from the end of the Order of Business until 7 p.m., the Minister to be called to conclude not later than 6.30 p.m.  There will be 30 minutes per speaker and Members may share time.  Item 2 will be taken from 7 p.m. until 11 p.m.  The Whips may discuss whether Second Stage or all Stages of the Bill will be taken.  Item 3, the Fisheries Amendment Bill, will be taken at 11 p.m.</P>

      <P>I welcome sharing time on item 1 which will ensure that every Member who wants to contribute on the Finance Bill can do so.  In relation to item 2, we on this side will facilitate matters in every way possible.  Although we may have some differences with the Bill as passed by the Dáil, our party spokesperson initiated the first Bill on this matter.</P>
      <P>Today's newspapers contain possibly leaked reports on a strategy relating to major changes in the Department of the Marine.  The Leader might ask the Minister for the Marine to comment on those decisions as this is a young Department.</P>
      <P>Finally, although this may be a difficult question for the Leader to answer, can he tell us what legislation he intends to deal with next week?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;coming from the Great Lakes area of Africa, Irish people have been very generous in their response to the humanitarian problems there.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement on this matter to the House?  We hear that Government aid should not be given to this group yet conflicting information is coming from the various humanitarian groups working there.  Irish people are very concerned about the humanitarian issues in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. It is important that item 3 &mdash; the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1996 &mdash; be passed as soon as possible.  It has been amended significantly to afford extra protection to our inland waterways and to ensure that fish farming is conducted in an environmentally friendly manner.  Those amendments have been beneficial and the Bill should advance rapidly.</P>
      <P>On the environment as a whole, last week we had an ESRI report on the economy and the Government side were quick to point to the favourable points made in that report about the future of the economy.  I share their welcome for that favourable report.  However, will they have the same approach to this week's report on the environment from the ESRI?  It points out that there are no free lunches anymore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, last week several speeches were made on the more favourable report and they were not interrupted.  This is not a speech but an important point.  In addition to the report, the EU Commissioner responsible for the environment commented yesterday that we stand to lose EU money unless we implement the environmental policies for which that money is allocated.  What is in the report published this week that is so undesirable compared to last week's report?  In the past, Fine Gael had a very responsible attitude to this matter; it supported the idea of no free water during the previous general election and the Dublin West by-election. Why and when was that policy changed?  Time should be made available for a debate on this report as it contains very serious implications for the country.</P>

      <P>I am sure Members will be pleased to join me in congratulating one of my constituents, Ken Doherty, on winning the World Snooker Championships last Sunday.  The manner in which he won has shown him to be a wonderful <Col N="603" /> ambassador for the country and especially for our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Ministers for Justice, Health and Social Welfare to get together to form a task force to consider the problem of crimes committed by people who have been in care and who have been abused?  As a result of the abuse they received as children or young adults, these people have become abusers and have appeared before the courts as the perpetrators of major crimes.  Somebody who has been in care as a result of abuse, family problems, etc., should not be thrown out and expected to look after themselves.</P>
      <P>Murders have been committed by people who have been the victims of abuse and have not been helped by society.  These people should not be thrown on the scrap heap, as many have been. This social problem is growing at a considerable rate and unless it is tackled by a task force, we will see an escalation in abuse by people who themselves have been abused and were not cared for in the community.  These people are becoming drop outs and are clogging the courts not because they want to be in trouble, but because they have been ignored by society and thrown on the scrap heap.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Henry that we should do whatever we can for the people in the Great Lakes region. There is no doubt conflicting statements are emerging from the region but the humanitarian issue must be addressed.  No side, whether in Rwanda or Zaire, should be absolved of blame.  I do not know how the international community can resolve these problems because it has tried and has failed.  The European Union and other agencies must try to eliminate the chaos in the Great Lakes region, which is not only confined to Rwanda and Zaire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of the election results in Northern Ireland.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to give his views on what will happen in the North in the light of the high representation for Sinn Féin?  As somebody who worked for the Labour cause in Northern Ireland, I have been told by Tony Blair that the SDLP is our sister party.  This is the first time I have known a resurgence of Labour in Britain which did not associate itself with the Northern Ireland Labour Party or the equivalent in this country.  The Labour Party always does well in Ireland and it is doing well in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will notice the red rose I am wearing. Although I will not become a member of the Labour Party in Britain, I attach myself to it.  Will the Leader relay to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the high vote for Sinn Féin has alarmed the Unionist community?  It does not alarm me because we have been through this before when Sinn Féin received the high vote because of the <Col N="604" /> poor organisation of the SDLP.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come here so that all sides of this House can voice their views on what is happening in the North?  It is an important matter which should occupy our minds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Justice, and possibly the Minister for Social Welfare, the public disquiet about people, whom I understand to be North Africans, coming to the country, collecting social welfare benefits and then returning to the UK?  It is especially annoying and outrageous that they are also given temporary accommodation when our citizens live rough on the streets of Dublin because they cannot be housed.  The Department responsible, Social Welfare or Justice, should take drastic action to weed out these people.  I am not opposed to needy people receiving social welfare benefits.  However, people travelling over on the ferry, collecting benefits and returning that night is too much, as is their being given accommodation which they are subletting.  I ask the Minister responsible to take the necessary action, and the more drastic the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader set time aside to debate both reports to which Senator Dardis referred &mdash; the ESRI report on the booming and well managed economy and the second report? He makes a play on the word &ldquo;free&rdquo;.  There is no such thing as a free lunch; there are no free pensions, yet there are; there is no free transport, yet there is; there is no free fuel, yet people receive it.  The State sometimes takes upon itself, as it should, the necessity, right and duty to provide things for people which they could not otherwise provide.  The State has made a decision on water charges.  Senator Dardis's problem is not with Government policy but with Deputies Bertie Ahern's and Dempsey's comments that this debate is over and not to be revisited.  The Senator's problem is not with us but with his partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator apolitical?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am highly political but I am not party political which is an important distinction. Public representatives are often critical of decisions taken by the Garda.  We have acknowledged the difficulty of their task at various times. Last Saturday night, during the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin, senior gardaí took what I believe was the most difficult of decisions.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Justice our appreciation of people who take decisions which put their careers and futures on the line and at risk?  If anything had gone wrong, they would have been the subject of negative comment this week.  We should recognise that someone among senior gardaí took a hard but correct and laudatory <Col N="605" /> decision and is a credit to their profession. We have had difficulties with decisions taken before but this is one where we do not and the Garda is to be congratulated for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader raise with the appropriate Minister the extraordinary state of affairs published in a Sunday newspaper which pointed out that the current crop of Ministers are spending more taxpayers' money on photographs than Lorenzo Di Medici spent on all the art works he commissioned throughout his long life? It seems extraordinary that mugshots of Ministers now cost the taxpayer far in excess of £100,000. The press report in question only dealt with the cost for senior Ministers.  A civil servant suggested to me that there was an oversight in the question in that it would have been nice to know the photographic expenses of some of our more flamboyant Ministers of State, such as Deputy Rabbitte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the conflicts of sworn evidence been given by a Member of this side of the House, we would have heard much more about it. With regard to tribunals, it would be worthwhile establishing a tribunal to look beyond the largesse of one named individual to politicians.  I would like to find out about printing presses in offices and illegal and extra-legal activities in a neighbouring jurisdiction to fund political parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be.  They are of grave public concern.  It is a matter of grave concern when the Taoiseach gives sworn evidence to two different tribunals and newspapers can point out that there are serious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support that either. However, there are serious allegations that the Taoiseach has given conflicting evidence under oath to two different tribunals.  That is a matter of public concern.  The other side of the House might try to sweep it under the carpet but the journalists who wrote the stories in last week's <i>Sunday Independent</i> did us a great service.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Education to make a statement on a number of pressing issues relating to second level education? I have raised these issues on the Adjournment on several occasions and I was given the usual positive soundings.  There is a serious need for a second level school in north-east Wicklow and the roof of the community college in Arklow is ready to fall off.  In addition, Coláiste Bríd in Carnew&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff of the House can confirm that I tried to raise a number of them on the Adjournment today.  However, I will raise one of them tomorrow.  Perhaps my requests were excessive.</P>
      <P>Can the House examine the operation of the Child Care Act?  As all sides of the House will confirm, there is serious concern about <i>in camera</i> proceedings and what is happening to cases that are continually referred back to the courts when children are in the care of the health boards. There are 1,400 children currently in the care of the Eastern Health Board and, to say the least, a leisurely attitude is adopted to the processing of a number of cases.  This is causing great concern. Clearly, if children are in danger nobody would wish to intervene in the matter.  However, if the danger comes from statutory operations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

      <P>On a point of clarification, when I signal to the Cathaoirleach that I wish to raise a matter on the Order of Business, I do not seek to be called at the end of the list.  Today I signalled that I wished to raise a matter on the Order of Business before my colleagues signalled; I did so by arrangement with them.

      <P>The Shannon River Council Bill passed Second Stage by agreement of all parties in the House and is important for that reason. Can the Leader indicate whether Committee and Final Stages of this Bill will be taken next week? At the end of Second Stage, Senator Belton, who was the only Member representing the Opposition, said, I thought in jest, that the next Stage would be taken on 6 June.  I note from the Order Paper that Committee Stage is ordered for 6 June.  That cannot be a serious proposal.  Can the Leader take Committee and Final Stages&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When a tribunal is established by resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas by definition every Member is obliged to treat it with the respect to which it is entitled.  The evidence given to that tribunal should be treated as the equivalent of evidence given to a court of law.  It should be ensured that evidence given is in accordance with the highest standards of bona fide conduct in a court of law.  It is essential that the Taoiseach comes to the House, rather than communicating his views through newspapers and treating both Houses with contempt.  Will he come before the Houses which gave him authority?</P>

This is sheer insanity.  The unfortunate person was forced to buy a motorcycle instead of a car.

They are looking for a clear statement and commitment &mdash; which they got from my party leader &mdash; that the Government will recognise the special case of small Protestant schools in the southern Border counties that are now down to one or two teachers.  The lack of funding for the schools must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Leader wants to be helpful but it does not look very good if spokespersons from the North of Ireland look to the South and point out what is happening to Protestants here.  I do not want this situation to prevail and I am certain the Leader does not want it either.  We do not want this perception to go out from this Administration. There is a special place for all Protestants in this island and I want it to be recognised that there is no campaign to diminish the number of small Protestant schools.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator McAughtry in his call for a debate on recent events in Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is astonishing that there has not been much comment in this House on the election result of cataclysmic proportions and the very significant result in the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  There are significant issues for consideration and I ask the Leader to have a debate on what has happened in the last week in Britain and Northern Ireland and what may happen at Drumcree in July.</P>
      <P>I raise the matter because we are now embarking on a very serious period that will affect this part of the country as much as the North if things get out of hand.  My information is that the Orange Order is looking for a window of opportunity and I am sure Senator McAughtry would agree with that.  It comes as some surprise to learn, from my own contacts, that Mr. Trimble is not exactly flavour of the month, particularly among the Armagh brethren.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that there is a real need to have the newly elected Sinn Féin MPs involved in trying to avoid another episode on the Garvahy Road? There is a need for them to get involved and there is a window of opportunity through which to do so.  Without going into specific details, we are now literally on the brink.  Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness could specifically progress the marching issue and help to avoid confrontation. They would be much more effective on the Nationalist side than Mr. Trimble would be on the Unionist side.</P>

I have noted the report on restructuring the Department of the Marine.  I am sure that, in view of the excellent relationship between the Opposition spokesman on Fisheries and the Minister, we could make time available informally tonight. I will speak to the Minister about that.  I am sure that if that cannot be done something suitable could be done.</P>
      <P>I do not have the list of next week's business with me but later today I will give Senators a schedule of the business it is proposed to take next week.  Among the items to be taken are the Youth Work Bill, the Local Government Finance Bill, and water charges.  I will give all Opposition groups the exact details later today.  A substantial amount of work remains to be done next week and there could be a four day sitting.  On the other hand there might not; I do not know.</P>
      <P>I take the point made by Senator Henry about the Great Lakes area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, has a special interest in that issue and I will ask her if time can be made available, perhaps tomorrow, for a short series of statements. It could perhaps be done during the lunchtime break, with a half an hour being devoted to it.  People would like to have an update on what is happening in the region.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the two ESRI reports and I would be delighted to have them debated together.  There is a great tendency, of which the Senator would never be guilty, to cherry pick bits and pieces from the reports. From what I have seen of the second ESRI report, it contains many useful ideas that would be worth ventilating in the House.  I have no difficulty having both ESRI reports debated together, although it might be a long debate.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Doyle that the new world snooker champion comes from the village of Ranelagh in his constituency.  Senator Lanigan's point is well made and I will refer it to the Ministers concerned.</P>

    <P>Senator McAughtry and Senator Mooney raised the future of Northern policy.  I would certainly like to see a debate.

We all hope that the meeting between the Taoiseach and the new British Prime Minister, as well as the Tánaiste and the new Northern Secretary, which are taking place tomorrow, will be successful.  We all wish them well going into the talks.</P>
    <P>Senator Bohan raised an interesting question but I am not aware of the facts.  If he can give them to me I will refer them to the Minister straightaway.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Cassidy raised the exemplary policing by the Garda of the major event last weekend.  By and large, the Garda Síochána is superb when it comes to crowd control and traffic management at major events.  It was a tough call last Saturday night and the Assistant Commissioner who made the decision must be complimented for his preparatory work which meant everything worked out well.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche &mdash; I thought this was a new Senator Roche but I was wrong &mdash; raised a number of issues.

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1997  [  Certified Money Bill ]   : SecondStage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Finance who is at a Cabinet meeting. <Col N="618" /> He will be here later and will respond to the debate.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to put before the Seanad the Finance Bill, 1997.  It will enable the Government to reward work, safeguard jobs, reduce business tax and stimulate enterprise.  It gives effect to the single biggest set of personal and corporation tax reductions in the past 20 years or more and its passage will secure a substantial increase in after tax income for the tax paying public.  It introduces a number of important new reliefs in the areas of education and training.  As a recent ESRI report pointed out, investment in the past in the enhancement of skills and knowledge has paid substantial dividends by way of accelerated economic growth.</P>
      <P>Naturally, as one would expect, this year's Bill also closes off a series of tax loopholes both in indirect and direct tax areas.  It also includes a package of measures to further combat illegal tobacco sales, thus safeguarding a revenue source for the Exchequer and cutting off a revenue source for many criminal gangs, particularly in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains a further series of preconsolidation provisions which prepare the way for the Taxes Consolidation Bill, the draft of which the Minister for Finance published on 16 April.  The text runs to two hefty volumes containing over 1,100 sections and 29 Schedules and is a testimony to the Revenue Commissioners and their joint venture with the private sector in producing the Bill in line with the target set by the Minister in his first budget in 1995.</P>
      <P>Sections 1 to 3 provide for the substantial increases in personal allowances and exemption limits provided for in the budget in addition to a reduction in the standard rate of income tax and the widening of the standard rate bands.</P>
      <P>Section 4 meets a commitment in <i>Partnership 2000</i> by exempting the first three weeks of disability benefit payments from income tax in the 1997-98 tax year and the first six weeks from the 1998-99 tax year onwards.</P>
      <P>Section 5 and a number of later sections incorporate into the Bill the existing provisions on income tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, probate tax and stamp duty contained in the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  This will ensure that these tax provisions will be found now in the Finance Acts for the guidance of taxpayers and practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 introduces a change in the tax procedures for employing a person in the home.  At present, an employer is obliged to register and operate PAYE where payments in excess of £6 per week are made to an employee.  The limit is £1 per week where the employee has another employment.  These limits date from the 1960s. Section 6 increases these limits to £30 per week where an individual employs a person to work in a domestic capacity in the individual's private home and that person is the only person employed in that capacity.  This will remove red <Col N="619" /> tape from certain domestic employment situations and make it easier to employ such domestic help.  A simplified arrangement is also being provided for in respect of registration and payment of employers' PRSI for these domestic situations and the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare will be producing a leaflet on the new system in the near future.  I hope this initiative will be welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>Section 7 relates to tax relief for third level fees for undergraduates and confirms that fees paid for qualifying part-time third level courses by non-earning spouses can be set against their earning spouses' taxable income.  The section also allows for retention of tax relief for those progressing from certificates to diplomas to degrees within the same course.  It also extends relief to those pursuing approved distance education courses provided in the State by colleges in another EU member state which meet certain codes of standards.  Section 8 contains a new tax relief at the standard rate for those undertaking certain IT and foreign language courses in order to develop their employment skills.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10, 31 and 75 give effect to the package of tax reliefs announced in the budget to encourage the newly established developing companies market.  These reliefs cover access to the BES for DCM companies and a special increase in the investment limits on special portfolio investment accounts where DCM investments are concerned.  This increase, which will be available for three years, is aimed to help the DCM get off the ground.</P>
    <P>Section 11 will curb the use of long-standing tax relief for scholarship income as a means by which companies can provide tax free income to, for example, directors, under the guise of scholarship schemes for their children.  There is no wish to interfere with genuine schemes or with the tax position of the recipient.  For that reason, the section continues the current exemption in respect of the recipients of scholarship income.  It provides, however, for the taxation of the income as a benefit-in-kind in the hands of the parent if the scheme under which the scholarship is provided does not disburse at least 75 per cent of the scholarship income to persons not connected to the employer providing the scholarship.  The new rules apply to all new schemes from 26 March 1997 and to existing schemes from 6 April 1998.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 are technical amendments to provisions dealing with the taxation of severance payments and to the withholding tax deduction system for sub-contractors. Section 14 introduces a new relief aimed at assisting certain firms to adapt to a change in their competitive environment.  It provides that where a company restructures its operations by agreement with the workforce to secure its survival, income tax relief can be made available on certain lump sums paid by the company to employees to achieve and compensate for a substantial pay restructuring.  The maximum lump <Col N="620" /> sum to be tax relieved is £6,000 plus £200 per year of service up to an overall maximum of £10,000. The pay cut involved must be at least 10 per cent of average pay for the previous two years and the reduction must remain in force for at least five years.  The payment of normal general pay round increases and increments will not affect the availability of the relief.  The proposed restructuring will have to be certified by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, on advice from the Labour Relations Commission, as being necessary and effective to meet the new situation.  The Minister has been conscious of the need to target this relief on the essential function of saving jobs and to minimise the tax planning aspects and is happy that this has been achieved.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for tax relief on certain corporate and personal donations of £1,000 or more to publicly funded third level institutions.  The donations must be in respect of defined projects in the areas of research, acquisition of capital equipment, infrastructural development in certain specified institutions and the provision of facilities to meet defined skills needs.  Projects in these areas must be approved by the Minister for Education, following consultation with the Higher Education Authority on the basis of guidelines to be agreed with the Minister for Finance.  The guidelines will deal with the approval process, the definition of skills needs and the specification of approved infrastructural developments.  In addition, section 25 introduces a facility whereby tax relief can be provided for certain financing arrangements for the construction of third level facilities where the project is approved by the Ministers for Education and Finance and where at least half of the expenditure involved is met by private donations.  This relief is being introduced on a pilot basis for three years and will operate where it can be shown there are benefits to the State by using such financing arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the extension of tax relief on expenditure on the repair, maintenance or restoration of approved heritage buildings and gardens.  Relief will be given for aggregate expenditure of up to £5,000 per annum on alarms, public liability insurance and restoration of approved art contents on condition that the contents are kept on display for a minimum period of two years after restoration.  It also provides that any qualifying expenditure which is unrelieved in any one year can be carried forward for up to two subsequent years.  In addition, section 137 brings the current 90 days per year public access requirement for the purposes of the CAT relief down to 60 days per year and, thus, into line with the income tax access requirement.  This is a sensible and useful simplification.</P>
    <P>A number of sections deal with farmer taxation. Stock relief for farmers will continue at 25 per cent for a two year period from 6 April 1997 to 5 April 1999 by virtue of section 18.  Section 19 provides that stock relief at a rate of 100 per cent will be available to farmers under 35 years of age who, between 6 April 1997 and 5 April 1999, <Col N="621" /> either qualify for the scheme of installation aid for young farmers or become chargeable for the first time to income tax in respect of profits or gains from farming and meet specific training requirements.  This special relief will be available to qualifying farmers for two years.</P>
    <P>Section 20 and the Fourth Schedule introduce a new &lsquo;year one&rsquo; capital allowance of 50 per cent for expenditure incurred on necessary farm pollution control measures up to an expenditure limit of £20,000.  The balance of expenditure will be written off over the following seven years in accordance with the normal wear and tear allowances. The scheme applies for three years from 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2000.  The Fourth Schedule sets out the farm buildings and structures to which the allowances for pollution control will apply.  Section 126 continues the two thirds stamp duty relief for young trained farmers in respect of agricultural land and buildings transferred to them for a further three years up to 31 December 1999.</P>
    <P>Sections 21, 22 and 23 relate to the capital allowances regime for motor vehicles, rented accommodation, and the application of balancing charges in certain cases.  Section 24 deals with an abuse of capital allowances for hotels.  These allowances, which can be offset against all the income of investors, apply at the rate of 15 per cent of expenditure for the first six years and 10 per cent in year seven &mdash; 100 per cent in total. Under the scheme, the investors claim the capital allowances for the seven years and, at the end of the period, are each given ownership of a nominated suite in the &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;&mdash; in effect privately owned suites for private use located in what had been until then a hotel building.  The section will deny capital allowances to investors in such cases with appropriate transitional arrangements for projects where contracts were signed or applications for planning permission were received by the local authority before 26 March 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 26 extends the deadline for tax relief under the general urban renewal scheme from 31 July 1997 to 31 July 1998 subject to certain conditions. Section 26 also makes provision for the designation by order of areas immediately adjacent to seven regional airports as enterprise areas where a viable qualifying proposal has been put forward for location in these areas.  The airports are at Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Knock, Sligo and Waterford.  The designation order will be made by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  The section also provides for the designation of three new enterprise areas in Cherry Orchard-Gallanstown, Finglas and Rosslare Harbour as described in the Tenth Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 28 allows the Minister to extend by order the definition of the Custom House Docks area for the purposes of the IFSC tax regime.  It is proposed to extend the area to include the block bounded by Commons Street, Mayor Street, Guild Street and the North Wall Quay, a block <Col N="622" /> of land immediately to the east of the original Custom House Docks area site which houses the IFSC.  Sections 32, 36, 66, 67 and 74 deal with a number of IFSC tax issues to provide continued certainty beyond 2005 for the tax transparency of collective funds managed by certified IFSC and Shannon companies and the exemption of securities issued by such companies from withholding tax and to modify a number of provisions in relation to the tax treatment of certain life assurance policies issued by IFSC life assurance companies.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for relief for pre-trading non-capital expenses which was announced in the budget.  Expenses which are wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of a trade or profession not more than three years prior to the commencement of trading and which would have been allowed if incurred after trading commenced will be deductible.  This important new relief will be available for new businesses, whether incorporated or not, which commence trading on or after 22 January 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 30 amends the relief for investment in films which is known as &ldquo;section 35&rdquo; relief.  It is proposed to increase the existing cap on &ldquo;section 35&rdquo; investment in any one film from £7.5 million to £15 million where at least 50 per cent of the &ldquo;section 35&rdquo; investment is made by corporate bodies.  The section will also increase the current £6 million annual investment limit for corporate bodies to £8 million in total and the limit for corporate investment in any one film from £2 million to £3 million.  In addition, it is proposed to allow an additional 10 per cent &ldquo;section 35&rdquo; finance for films in respect of which post-production, such as editing, dubbing or mixing, is carried out in the State.  The section also provides for a number of changes to the film certification process operated by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. These are designed to strengthen his powers in this regard and to prevent abuse of the system by certain applicants for relief.</P>
    <P>Sections 33 to 35 together with sections 69 and 161 of the Bill deal with strips of interest bearing securities.  Strips are created when interest bearing securities are split into their component parts, individual yearly interest elements and final principal element, the rights to which can then be separately sold and traded in their own right as zero coupon securities.  The introduction of such a facility for Government securities has been recommended by the NTMA as a necessary step in widening and deepening the market in Irish Government securities to match similar market developments in other countries.  However, within the present tax code, the creation of strips could open up the possibility for tax deferral and avoidance in certain circumstances, especially in the case of individuals, non-trading corporates and life assurance companies.  The Bill sets out tax rules to deal with the creation of, and transactions in, strips to minimise the risk of tax planning. This will involve taxing the growth in the value of these zero coupon securities on an <Col N="623" /> annual basis rather than when the gain or income is realised on redemption.</P>
    <P>Sections 35 and 69 also address a potential avoidance mechanism involving equity and Government security swaps in the case of certain taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Section 39 deals with the tax treatment of share buybacks involving quoted companies.  Under the new rules, such a buy-back will not be treated as a distribution of profits so that a tax credit will no longer apply to the payments made by the company to the shareholders concerned.  Consequently, the sale of shares to the company by the shareholders will be regarded as falling within the capital gains tax provisions.  This will protect the position of the Exchequer in such buy-back situations.</P>
    <P>Section 40 exempts from tax employment grants which are made to employers by the National Rehabilitation Board under the employment support scheme and by the Rehab Group under the pilot programme for people with disabilities. Similar exemptions have been granted in previous years for employment grants in other areas.</P>
    <P>Section 41 closes off a loophole in the operation of tax relief on employer contributions to occupational pension schemes to ensure that relief is only given where contributions are actually paid into the schemes and not where they are merely payable, as some tax advisers have sought to claim.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 to 44 close off a gap in the capital gains tax legislation which allows certain Irish companies to avoid paying tax on capital gains on the disposal of assets by transferring the residence of the company abroad, usually to a tax haven, shortly before the disposal takes place.  If left unchecked, this loophole could give rise to a significant loss of tax revenue.  The provisions, however, will not apply to companies which are owned and controlled by non-resident shareholders from a country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty.</P>
    <P>Section 50 makes a number of changes to existing approved profit sharing schemes, in particular the minimum period for individuals to hold shares in order to gain full income tax relief is reduced from five to three years, and part-time employees must in future be eligible to participate in such schemes on the same basis as fulltime employees.</P>
    <P>Section 51 and the Third Schedule allow for the establishment of a new form of employee share ownership trust under which, subject to certain conditions, a company and its employees may set up a trust, whether controlled by the employees or otherwise, to enable the employees to build up a long-term holding in their employer company via the trust.  The establishment of the trust is a matter for negotiation between an employer and employees and the section permits certain tax reliefs once the trust is established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> Sections 49 and 52 to 58 deal with the Dublin Docklands Authority.  Section 49 exempts the authority from corporation tax and capital gains tax.  Section 128 exempts from stamp duty land purchases by the authority.  Sections 52 to 58 provide for a scheme of tax reliefs for the development of the docklands area.  The Minister announced in his budget that a package of reliefs would be put in place for the Dublin Docklands Authority when the consultants drawing up the draft master plan for the area finalised their report.  While the report is not yet completed, there has been extensive consultation with both the consultants and the Department of the Environment on the appropriate structure and form of reliefs to be put in place for the development of the area and the proposals now put forward will be consistent with the report.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the new Dublin Docklands Authority will recommend that the Minister for the Environment designate particular geographical sub-areas of the Dublin docklands area where one or more or all of the various tax incentives should apply.  The Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance will then, if they agree with the recommendations, apply the various incentives by way of orders.</P>
    <P>The menu of tax incentives in terms of capital allowances, rent and rates relief is broadly the same as those already applying in the Custom House Docks area.  The tax package will apply initially for a period of three years, i.e., from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 2000.  The Minister is confident that these reliefs will help reinvigorate the area in combination with other public and private sector projects and that we will see over the next 15 years a transformation of the area in terms of jobs, infrastructure and the provision of amenities for the benefit of the local population.</P>
    <P>Section 59 reduces the standard rate of corporation tax from 38 per cent to 36 per cent while under section 60 the lower rate on the first £50,000 of taxable income is being reduced from 30 per cent to 28 per cent.  The reduced rates apply from 1 April 1997.  Provision is also being made in section 37 for a reduction in the tax credit on dividend payments to shareholders in line with these rate reductions.  Section 60 also clears up a technical problem with the formula for the application of the 28 per cent rate of corporation tax which came to light some months ago and which has already been addressed by Revenue.</P>
    <P>Section 61 provides for the removal of the VHI's exemption from corporation tax under section 80 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, with effect from 1 March 1997.  This is necessary to ensure a common corporation tax regime for all health insurers operating in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Section 129 removes the £1 duty payable on non-life insurance policies from policies offered by authorised insurers in respect of health insurance business covered by section 2 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 62 deals with the tax treatment of the profits of harbour authorities which have been <Col N="625" /> reconstituted as harbour companies under the Harbours Act, 1996.  These companies are now being brought into the corporation tax net in line with the general policy of subjecting commercial State bodies to tax in the same way as private concerns.  However, the Government has decided to afford the harbour companies an appropriate transitional period and not to apply full taxation until 2001 to allow the companies time to adapt to the new situation.  A similar tax régime will be extended to privately owned ports in the transitional period 1997-2000, inclusive.  Harbour authorities which are not vested as companies will retain their exemption from tax for the present. The harbour companies which are being brought into the tax net in this way currently handle over 90 per cent of commercial port traffic.  Section 48 and the Fifth Schedule also provide that the transfer of assets from the former harbour authorities to the new harbour companies does not in itself trigger a tax charge.</P>
    <P>Section 63 exempts the Irish Take-over Panel from corporation tax.  Sections 64 and 65 extend the tax relief on corporate donations to First Step and to the Enterprise Trust until 31 December 1999 in both cases.  This is in recognition of the contribution to enterprise development and employment made by both bodies and the commitment to continued relief in <i>Partnership 2000</i> in the case of the Enterprise Trust.</P>
    <P>Sections 70 to 78 deal with capital gains tax, principally the cut in the CGT reduced rate from 27 per cent to 26 per cent, a reduction to three years in the trading period for qualification for the reduced rate, the closing off of certain CGT loopholes, a relief from CGT on life interests in certain heritage houses and objects and the treatment of free shares on demutualisation of life companies.  As I mentioned earlier, the application of exemption from CGT in certain family law cases and to the DCM is also dealt with here.</P>
    <P>Section 77 provides for CGT roll-over relief on the disposal of development land which is an asset of an authorised racecourse once the proceeds of the sale are reinvested in the assets of such a racecourse.  This relief will apply from 6 April 1995.</P>
    <P>Sections 82 to 94 relate to excise matters.  The sections firstly confirm the budget day excise changes on tobacco and road fuels.  They also deal with a number of other technical items including a provision the effect of which will restrict a rebate of duty on recycled waste oil to such oil used for any purpose other than motor fuel.  More importantly, sections 86 to 93, inclusive, provide considerably increased powers to support the increasingly more successful fight against illegal tobacco sales.  The sections provide for increased penalties, new powers of arrest and detention, new offences aimed at illegal wholesaling as well as retail street vending of illicit tobacco products, improved seizure powers and more streamlined court arrangements in certain cases.  These new powers were drawn up by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="626" /> in consultation with the Garda Síochána and are an indication of the Government's determination to do all that is necessary to ensure that this problem is dealt with firmly and in an effective way.  This is, of course, a Europe wide problem and with my agreement the Revenue Commissioners have taken up the issue at that level with a view to having all aspects of the matter examined.  The Commission has now agreed with member states to establish a high level group for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Sections 95 to 114 include a series of important changes to the VAT codes, particularly in the area of property and telecommunications.  The purpose of these changes is to combat avoidance and to protect Exchequer resources.  The provisions on telecommunications also ensure that there is a level playing field between EU and non-EU suppliers with regard to VAT.</P>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum sets out in some detail the reasons for and the precise details of the new VAT regime in both property and telecommunications so I will not dwell at length on these aspects.  However, some brief elaboration is required.  With regard to VAT on property, the Bill seeks to ensure that the tax cannot be avoided by VAT exempt bodies such as banks and insurers.  The amendment will close off loopholes which, over time, could cost significant amounts to the Exchequer.  The manner in which these loopholes are to be closed partly involves an EU derogation for what is known as a reverse charge mechanism whereby the customer is responsible for the VAT charge.  The Government has applied for this approval and the request is currently before the EU.  When granted, the reverse charge will apply from the date of publication of the Finance Bill, 26 March 1997.  The way the loopholes are being closed is explained in detail in the Explanatory Memorandum.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications changes are aimed at eliminating a tax-based distortion of competition arising largely from the fact that non-EU suppliers of telecommunications services are not, at present, liable for VAT on services supplied within the EU.  The Bill provides that, for purposes of VAT, the place of supply of international telecommunications services will, in general, be shifted to where the customer is located rather than from where the services are being supplied.  A reverse charge mechanism will be introduced for business customers who will be obliged to account for VAT.  Non-EU telecommunications operators who supply non-business customers in the State will be required to register and account for VAT on those supplies.  The change, which has EU approval and is being implemented in all 15 member states, will come into operation in Ireland on 1 July 1997.</P>
    <P>The Bill also addresses certain problems in the operation of the VAT refund retail export scheme.  A number of agencies operate schemes whereby non-EU visitors may claim VAT refunds on purchases of goods which they take home. <Col N="627" /> Arising from a recent court case on the operation of one such scheme, the Bill will permit traders and agencies to zero rate goods sold to tourists only when certain conditions are fulfilled.  These conditions concern, for example, the time limit for export of the goods, the exchange rate to be used when a repayment is being made and the information to be given to the visitor about fees or commissions being charged.</P>
    <P>Section 101 requires that traders selling horticultural produce to final consumers must register for VAT once the standard VAT registration threshold of £40,000 in sales per annum is exceeded.  This threshold is reduced to £20,000 if the trader is also providing agricultural services. Previously, certain traders had been using the farmer flat rate VAT mechanism to avoid registration. Section 113 reduces the VAT rate on certain horticultural products from 21 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  These sections will have effect from a date specified by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Section 110 provides for an effective exemption from VAT for commercial childminding.  This will be achieved in two ways.  First, by applying the exemption to child care facilities covered by recent regulations made under the Childcare Act, 1991.  Second, by clarifying that the exemption for educational services applies to children's and young persons' education generally, to cover facilities which might not be regarded as child care within the meaning of the Child Care Act. The exemption will be effective from 1 May 1997, the start of the current VAT period.  It brings our treatment of child care into line with many other member states and will comply with EU VAT law as recently clarified for the Revenue Commissioners by the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with a number of technical VAT measures to close off certain minor loopholes in the system, to simplify the administration of the system and to comply with EU rulings in the Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>Sections 115 to 122 enact the new stamp duty regime given effect in the budget whereby three new rates of stamp duty have been introduced in respect of residential property valued above £150,000.  The budget measures provided for a transitional exemption from the new rates for contracts signed on or before budget day and executed before 1 April 1997.  In response to representations this period has now been extended to 1 May 1997.  Section 124 of the Bill confirms that relief from stamp duty for certain large new houses contained in section 112 of the Finance Act, 1990, does not extend to secondhand houses.</P>
    <P>Section 125 extends the exemption from stamp duty, which American depositary receipts (ADRs) enjoy, to shares quoted on a recognised Canadian stock exchange.  ADRs are a means of facilitating companies raising capital in the US and Canada.  Furthermore, this section removes a barrier to offshore funds relocating to Ireland by exempting the transfer of certain financial instruments from stamp duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> Section 131 abolishes residential property tax with effect from 5 April 1997.  The existing tax clearance arrangements in the case of sales of houses above a specified value threshold are, however, being maintained in order to assist in the collection of RPT arrears.  Under the legislation, the specified value threshold for clearance purposes is the actual RPT value threshold, i.e. £101,000 in 1996.  This threshold will continue to be adjusted annually by the increase in the Department of the Environment's new house price index.  The new threshold, which applies to house sale contracts executed on or after 5 April 1997, is £115,000.</P>
    <P>Sections 133 to 143 deal with various aspects of capital acquisitions taxation.  Section 138 increases the relief from CAT in respect of the family house when transferred from one sibling to another from 60 per cent of the value of the house or £60,000, whichever is the lesser, to 60 per cent or £80,000, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>Sections 139 to 141 increase the rate of business relief for capital acquisitions tax purposes from 75 per cent to 90 per cent for all qualifying business assets, provided these assets are retained in the business for a period of ten years or more after the transfer.  In line with this increase, the relief in respect of agricultural land, buildings, livestock and machinery transferred by gift or inheritance is also being increased to 90 per cent in section 134.  Business relief is also being extended to situations involving the termination of a life interest in land, building, machinery or plant used for the purpose of a business but which have been held outside the business.</P>
    <P>The CAT code currently exempts Government and other public sector securities from CAT in the hands of foreign beneficiaries subject, in certain cases, to a minimum holding period of three years prior to the gift or inheritance.  The exemption is designed to encourage foreign investment in such securities.  Section 135 closes off the unintended use of this exemption in certain cases to avoid CAT where property is transferred out of a trust after the death of a disponer or on the change of domicile, or ordinary residence, of the disponer.  The other sections deal with family law issues and CAT which I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>Sections 144 to 156 contain extensive pre-consolidation provisions which are intended to rewrite, simplify and codify existing tax measures in certain areas in a comprehensible way prior to consolidation in the forthcoming Taxes Consolidation Bill.  I wish to make clear that no substantive change is involved but, as the House will appreciate, it would not be unusual for some parts of the tax legislation to need a good spring clean before they can be incorporated in a consolidation Bill.  Thus, in the case of mortgage interest relief and the Temple Bar reliefs, the existing legislation has become complex and convoluted as changes were made over the years.  For example, in the case of mortgage interest relief the transitional provisions for standard rating the <Col N="629" /> relief are not needed in a consolidation Bill since full standard rating now applies.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill also includes numerous preconsolidation provisions to amend incorrect or out of date references, update the wording of particular reliefs, for example, for genderproofing reasons and to repeal redundant or spent provisions.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, a draft of the Consolidated Bill was launched last month and it has been the Minister's policy to publish as much as possible of the consolidation measures in advance of the Bill and the Revenue Commissioners have hosted a number of information seminars for members of the Oireachtas and tax practitioners to acquaint them in advance with progress on this major undertaking.</P>
    <P>Sections 157 to 160 deal with several tax administration measures.  Section 158 relates to the publication of the names of tax defaulters.  At present, the list of tax defaulters is published on an annual basis in the Revenue Commissioners' Annual Report.  The list includes all those upon whom a fine or other penalty was imposed by a court and all those in whose case the Revenue Commissioners accepted a settlement in excess of £10,000.  Settlements are not published where the amount is less than £10,000 or where the taxpayer has, in advance of any Revenue investigation, voluntarily furnished complete information relating to undisclosed tax liabilities.  This section proposes to drop the requirement to publish in the Commissioners' Annual Report.  Instead, the Commissioners will publish the lists on a quarterly basis.  Quarterly publication will ensure more speedy and up to date information.</P>
    <P>Section 159 provides for a new procedure for the issue of ID cards to Revenue field officers.</P>
    <P>Section 160 applies tax clearance to applications for moneylenders' licences and credit and mortgage intermediaries authorisations under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Section 162 enables the Minister for Finance to lend to the Post Office Savings Bank for the purpose of buying, holding or selling Government securities.  This amendment will assist the NTMA in managing the market in such securities.  Section 163 enables the NTMA to act as agent for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in relation to the management of borrowing for the purposes of FEOGA schemes.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections are the standard provisions which appear in each year's Bill on the care and management of taxation, the capital services redemption account and the necessary citation clauses.</P>
    <P>I hope that the House will support all the measures in this Bill and also the programme of the Government in putting these forward.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for a comprehensive run through what is a complex, pedantic and dull Bill.  There have been very few occasions when a Minister for Finance has had <Col N="630" /> the ball at his feet to the extent that the present Minister has, and if there was ever an occasion for adventurous legislation in the finance area, this was it.  Unfortunately, although there are welcome changes which it would be churlish not to recognise, there is far too little innovation in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill was rightly described in the Dáil as somewhat unimaginative, rather uninspiring and a disappointing non-event.  It is all of that.  My conclusion, having read the Bill and listened to the Minister of State's admittedly excellent speech, is that the economy is on autopilot in some way and that we have handed over the nation's finances to technically competent and trustworthy public officials.  However, the political zest one expects in a Finance Bill, especially when things are going well, is missing.  With the exception of some amendments which were introduced late in the day, the Bill is dull, boring and lacks a sense of adventure.</P>
      <P>It also seems to suggest a certain loss of direction on the economy.  We are going through an extraordinary period that is widely recognised as unprecedented.  All parties in both Houses can take some credit for that.  Fianna Fáil, between 1987 and 1994, contributed in no small way to putting in place the foundations of current economic progress, and, in general, the Minister has prudently tried to keep to the path laid out prior to the changeover in Administrations.</P>
      <P>However, there is slippage on a number of fronts and we are unlikely to have so many winds blowing in our favour again.  That is why this Bill is disappointing.  There are issues of public expenditure, the continued need to borrow, adventurous use of taxation and opportunities for tax reform which are not being addressed in the Bill. Despite the budget concessions, tax reform and reduction remain on the back boiler.  The Minister of State is correct.  There are some tax changes here which are very welcome, but one does not get the impression from the Bill or the contributions of various Ministers that we have a coherent long term strategy aimed at reducing the tax burden, especially that of personal tax.</P>
      <P>What we are achieving in terms of tax reform in this Bill is minimalist.  We have a long way to go before we can say we have an enterprise-oriented tax system or can make it worthwhile for people on benefit to come back into the labour market.  Even with some welcome changes, we still have high marginal rates of taxation and the level of personal taxation is a disincentive to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is technical, as are all Finance Bills. There is, as the Minister of State said, much tidying up of the system to be done.  Nevertheless, one does not get the sense that there was any political interest taken in the framing of this Bill. Excellent though the Bill is in putting change in place and tidying up certain matters, there seems to be little political input in it.  It seems to be fundamentally a technocrat's Bill rather than a political one.  One expects political input on the Finance <Col N="631" /> Bill and something other than housekeeping arrangements, which is what is in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are specific matters which are to be welcomed. Section 12, on the exemption of payments to employees under certain company restructuring arrangements, is very worthwhile.  I also welcome the extension on the financial services side. The Irish Financial Services Centre has been a tremendous success and is a classic example of what I mean by political input in a Finance Bill. It was the creation of a political mind in 1987 and was not dreamt up in a Department.  That is not to say that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners did not have a big role to play.  The Centre's operation has been a tremendous success because we have good public servants who are technically adept.  Nonetheless, when it comes to the Finance Bill, one expects political enthusiasm and we do not get that from this Bill to the extent that it existed in the Finance Bill, 1987.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned tax breaks for educational contributions.  It is a welcome change and one I have advocated for some time.  I will return to the issue of tax incentives for charitable contributions, and we received an excellent submission today on this matter from the combined charities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the airport measures and the measures for Rosslare and certain Dublin sites.  A cynic might suggest that the late introduction of these measures was a matter of political expediency. I could not care less whether they were a matter of political expediency or not.  If they work, they will be positive developments for the communities involved.  Rather than score points, we should see how, in the days or hours remaining to this Administration, we can use the Finance Bill to create jobs and an enterprise climate.</P>
    <P>I will not apologise for being parochial but having looked at section 26 and what happened in relation to the airports, the harbour at Rosslare and the Dublin sites, what has County Wicklow done to this Government?  It is one of the few counties which has not had a break.  The Minister of State did rather well in County Wexford and I take my hat off to the people there who are to be congratulated.  Sadly, we have a number of silent priests in County Wicklow and, by the looks of things, they will never get a parish.  Perhaps the situation will be different in the next Dáil and somebody who will put forward the arguments for County Wicklow more vociferously will be there.  I will come back to that issue.</P>
    <P>One might have expected the Finance Bill to give a long-term clear signal on what is happening with the 10 per cent corporation profit tax.  There have been a series of promises on the long-term strategy statement but final clarification is needed.  This point was made in the Dáil by several contributors and it is worthwhile reiterating it here.  This is a reality we must face because of the success of our economy and because we must enter economic and monetary union.  I have no <Col N="632" /> doubt Ireland will qualify and will be among the first entrants to economic and monetary union, but we will have some difficulties.  It is time for a strategic long-term statement rather than incremental statements on CPT.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that there will be changes in the film industry, which I welcome. The 1993 Finance Act had a positive and immediate impact on the film industry but there has been a degree of dithering since.  Clawing back the incentives in 1996 was, as I said at the time, a major error, which was made for reasons I do not fully understand.  I think they had more to do with the ideological imperatives of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht than with advices which had come up as a result of the success of this tax incentive area.  We made a bad move and I welcome the fact the Government is rowing back to some degree.  Dithering on the issue of tax incentives for the film industry is not helpful in the long-term in creating confidence.  What happened in 1996 was a bad blow and we now must reinvent Ireland as a location.  I have no doubt we have the people who can do that, but a mistake was made.  I welcome the changes in that regard but I caution against swinging backwards and forwards on this issue like a pendulum.</P>
    <P>The Bill is almost silent on the business expansion scheme, although it is referred to in one of the Schedules.  The business expansion scheme has been successful and has gone through a series of innovations since its introduction.  The point of the BES is that there must be an element of risk and that it should not simply be a bolt-hole for tax avoidance.  Nonetheless, we need to look at the scheme to see how it might be used more effectively.  In the early years the scheme seemed to provide necessary injections of enterprise to specific areas.  I suggest to the Minister and the officials in the Department that it might be time to consider targeting the BES to geographical areas.  I would like to give a specific example. Initially, hotels were successfully covered by the BES but then it seemed the scheme has achieved all it had set out to accomplish.  I remember panic in County Wicklow where some hotel schemes were going ahead.</P>
    <P>I would like to use the case of County Wicklow to illustrate the point.  Everyone accepts that County Wicklow has phenomenal potential as a tourism centre and that I am not simply making a parochial point.  It has all the positives of County Kerry but it does not have significant hotel accommodation.  Although the BES incentives were used rather successfully, we still do not have the type of investments coming forward.  I suggest to the Minister and the Department that it might be worthwhile identifying areas where there are specific needs and allowing a geographical focus. If, for example, there was a proposition to build significant additional hotel accommodation in County Wicklow, it would be positive in terms of jobs and inward investments and warrant specific consideration.  Because of the nature of the BES, <Col N="633" /> that type of targeting is not permissible under the scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been a limited extension of the urban renewal scheme.  Coming from County Wexford, the Minister of State will know this has been an extraordinarily successful scheme and has taken off in a number places.  In some cases because the sites selected were not suitable or because there was an impediment on the sites, the scheme has not been too successful.  After the last extension of urban renewal sites in County Wicklow, particularly in Bray, there was a failure to think through what was happening.  With some adjustment of territories, the urban renewal scheme could be successful in the Albert Walk seafront area of Bray.  At present the scheme is not winning any great takers.  There is, therefore, a need to continuously monitor the urban renewal scheme.  Rather than simply having a cut off date and hoping people will come in under the scheme, a section in the Department should actively look at how the scheme operates.  If there are impediments, particularly impediments caused by the geographical focus of the scheme, they should be removed.</P>
    <P>When the Government extended the urban renewal scheme areas in Bray, it did so in the hope that it would produce necessary investment in specific areas.  As it turns out, one of the areas is not producing investment because it is too geographically focused.  However, if one goes 150 yards down the road, one will see such investment. There needs to be a degree of flexibility in its operation.</P>
    <P>With any of these tax schemes, we not only have to put the scheme in place, we must monitor any impediments to the scheme being taken up. In the case of the most recent urban renewal designation in Bray &mdash; an area around the station and along the Albert Walk to the sea front &mdash; if there had been some flexibility in the scheme whereby an entire block or half the surrounding block could have been designated, we would have had major investment.  However, that has not happened because of a variety of factors.  The urban renewal scheme is excellent and has tremendous potential but sometimes specific local factors operate as a brake and impede that potential being taken up.  A degree of flexibility should be allowed.  A renewal in 1998 might possibly be too late.  It should be possible to have a continuous review of the scheme, perhaps by way of secondary legislation or ministerial regulation, to make slight amendments to include small additional territory, which would help.</P>
    <P>On the issue of tax reform, the Bill must be labelled timid in the extreme.  I make no apologies for blowing a political trumpet during the current climate but between 1989 and 1992, Ministers for Finance from my party, both alone and in partnership with the Progressive Democrats, cut the standard rate of income tax from 35 per cent to 27 per cent.  The top rate of income tax was reduced from 58 per cent to 48 per cent.  VAT also came down in that period from 25 per cent <Col N="634" /> to 21 per cent.  There is no comparison in this Government's programme and I understand the reason.  If it were left to the senior party in the Coalition, there is no doubt that type of tax cut would have been followed.  However, the leading party in this Government finds itself lumbered with a number of big spending partners who are clearly in the way of real and radical tax reform. When we could be putting pounds back in the pockets of the PAYE taxpayer, we are still spending, incurring tax debts and mortgaging the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister's multiannual budget tables show that Ireland continues to borrow up to £700 million to £900 million per year.  Anyone with a sense of economics accepts that is wrong.  We are lumbering the taxpayers of tomorrow with the debts of today with little effort being made to control the growth in public expenditure.  Serious tax relief will come only when there is a commitment not to allow Government spending to overextend itself.</P>
    <P>In the three year period of January 1995 to December 1997, the Government will increase net current spending by over 20 per cent while the cumulative level of inflation will be 6 per cent. While it is accepted that many good schemes are being introduced, there is no justifiable reason for Government expenditure increasing at a rate 3.5 times that of the cumulative rate of inflation.  If we are to make any impact on the debt burden and create a situation where expectations of public services are more in line with our capacity to fund them, we cannot continue to operate in this manner.  There has been a real failure of budgetary control and Ministers know that to be the case.  Both the Culliton and Forfás reports argue that servicing the national debt is absorbing too much of the nation's tax resources.  Last year, over half the direct taxes raised were spent on servicing the national debt.  That is wrong, we cannot afford it and we need political leadership to change it.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, outlined the initial changes in the Bill, he referred specifically to section 7 which amends section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996.  It deals with the general issue of tax relief on the fees of part-time undergraduates and third level fees generally.  It provides that fees paid by non-earning spouses, or on their behalf by their spouses, qualify for tax relief. I was a night student and one of the great senses of injustice I had was that I could not set all my fees against tax or get a reasonable allowance to write off some of the cost of putting myself through third level education.  That view is still shared by many students and demands attention.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced a political element in section 26 during the latter stages of the Bill's consideration in the Dáil.  I do not blame it for doing so but I blame it for rejecting a modest proposal for a tax break in part of County Wicklow.  The Minister is aware that Bray was the first seaside resort in Ireland.  Last year, I introduced a tax break for the town when debating <Col N="635" /> the Finance Act, 1996.  I suggested there was no justification for ignoring the seaside resorts of Wicklow.  The Minister of State present indicated at the time that there was no reason for ignoring the seaside resorts of Wexford and, to her credit, she managed to have an amendment accepted and got tax breaks for a number of them.  To my credit, I got one for Arklow.  I was told a tax break for the entire town of Bray was unattainable because the town was too big and I accepted that as a valid argument.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage of this Bill in the Dáil, Deputy McCreevy introduced on my behalf a modest proposition extending the seaside resorts tax break to the area of Bray between the railway line and the sea.  This modest amendment was rejected by the Government, reintroduced on Report Stage in the Dáil and again rejected.  We are losing inward investment in Bray because of that.  There is a proposal to invest a significant amount of money in building a new hotel and upgrading a grotty area of the sea front.  We are introducing politically sensible changes in the case of Rosslare port, Finglas, Gallanstown and Cherry Orchard in Dublin and the seven regional airports.  What is it that we in County Wicklow have done that we cannot even get this minor level of designation?  The county has five Deputies in the other House whose silence on this issue has been deafening.  People are asking what we have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has introduced special designation for Rosslare Harbour which is a positive move and I fully support it.  I have asked the Government to make a decision on the Forfás report requesting a new east coast roll on-roll off ferry.  I pointed out that a private company in Arklow has a huge amount of land and a jetty already in place and is offering to be the centre of the innovation.  However, I cannot get a decision.  I will make a recommendation to this Bill that the tax break which has gone in the case of Rosslare should also be considered for a new roll on-roll off port to be built at Arklow.  The blighted industrial lands around The Murrough in Wicklow town should also be examined as they could be easily designated and are part of a port complex.  I am not seeking something other counties do not have.  I am asking on behalf of my constituents for small concessions from Government. Why are we not getting them?</P>
      <P>Section 28 extends the designation of the Irish Financial Services Centre which has been very successful.  Rather than the incremental approach we are adopting, should we not decide the territory covered by it and resolve the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already welcomed the provisions in section 30 relating to changes made in tax relief for film investment.  Raising the limit from £7.5 million to £15 million, while welcome, is still relatively small.  The cost of large budget films is considerable. <Col N="636" /> If people want to invest money, it is wrong to impose a limit of £15 million.</P>
    <P>Bray has the only operational film studios in Ireland.  A few years ago, when they fell on hard times, they were forced to sell a considerable portion of the backlot for housing development, which was a terrible tragedy.  When making the place smaller, they were forced to dispose of a huge amount of material, such as props, which had been accumulated. There is need to create an Irish film archive which not only protects Irish films but also the material used in the production of such films. Some form of tax designation or break should be considered to prevent the film studios in future having to consider selling off or dismantling valuable properties simply because they do not have sufficient space to store them.  That would produce real benefits.</P>
    <P>Having been critical of some aspects of the Bill I wish to welcome a number of its provisions.  The changes in section 40 which apply to the employment subsidy for people receiving assistance from the NRB, or Rehab, are welcome.  Section 51 refers to the creation of employee share ownership trusts.  That is a good innovation and it would be churlish of me not to recognise it.  Section 131 abolishes the residential property tax.  I can summarise my views on this by saying good riddance to bad tax.  It is a lesson for all of us about hastily introduced taxes.  However, I also wish to refer to stamp duties.  As a result of the dramatic escalation in property prices, particularly in the greater Dublin, north Wicklow, Meath and Kildare areas, stamp duty is creating major problems for young people who wish to purchase older properties.  A graded system of property tax must be introduced to deal with that.</P>
    <P>The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group submitted excellent proposals for tax concessions for charitable donations, particularly for corporate donations to approved charities.  Given that the Bill introduces a corporate tax break for money which is invested in third level education, it is surprising the same section was not used to concede a tax break for tax efficient corporate donations to charities.  There were significant discussions between the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group and various programme managers and advisers before the introduction of the Finance Bill.  Perhaps the proposals were made too late, but I intend to put down a recommendation in that regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It will enable the Government to reward work, safeguard jobs, reduce business tax and stimulate enterprise.  The Bill gives effect to the single largest set of personal and corporation tax reductions in the past 20 years.  Its passage will ensure a substantial increase in after tax income for the tax paying public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, told the Dáil that the world is changing rapidly and that we must adjust to those <Col N="637" /> changes.  We are part of the change within Europe, as was demonstrated by our successful Presidency of the European Union.  I congratulate the Taoiseach and his Ministers on their handling of the Presidency.  They were complimented throughout Europe on their efficiency and they displayed how well this country can operate in the European context.  The Minister for Finance went on to tell the Dáil that we must move with Europe and endeavour to shape it in the coming years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Partnership 2000</i> is a programme to accommodate change and growth which will take us to the start of the next century.  However, we must look further ahead in order to manage the present and secure our future.  Our needs in recent years have given us the experience and courage to embrace the future with confidence.  In the budget he introduced three years ago, the Minister for Finance set out five goals to which this country could aspire and which we could plan to achieve by the year 2010.  The first goal was for Ireland to achieve the average <i>per capita</i> income of the European Union; the second was to provide full employment for those seeking work; third, we should have the best managed and best preserved environment in the European Union; fourth, we should possess the most effective public administration in the EU and, fifth, be perceived outside Europe as the best place in which to invest and do business in Europe.</P>
    <P>Since this Government took office the Minister for Finance has done great work and I take this opportunity to congratulate him.  Some of the goals he outlined almost three years ago have been achieved.  The nation has become richer. Real wealth is being created by our continuous economic growth, which is four times higher than the European average.  If we achieve the ambitions which the Minister outlined for the next three years, we will be close to the EU average <i>per capita</i> income by the end of <i>Partnership 2000.</i>  Our average <i>per capita</i> income now surpasses that of Britain for the first time in hundreds of years.  All those involved in that achievement deserve our congratulations.</P>
    <P>Employment figures show that 150,000 jobs have been created in the past two and a half years.  For the first time in modern history we have seen a sustained net increase in jobs.  This is the first Government to stop emigration.  That is a wonderful development.  Our young people are not only staying at home but advertisements are being placed in English and European newspapers to entice those who left the country in recent years to return to work in Ireland.  We have experienced a huge economic boom in every industry and particularly in the building industry. Every person who has a trade in that sector is fully employed and the sector has seen unprecedented levels of work.  This is a tribute to how the Government has handled the economy since it came into office.</P>
    <P>The Minister of Finance also said our environment continues to present a challenge.  We will <Col N="638" /> grow and prosper but policies are being put in place to protect and enhance our environment into the next century.  A number of Bills have been introduced in the past 12 months which will assist the preservation of the environment and the Litter Pollution Bill was the most recent.  I am delighted steps are being taken to ensure the protection of our environment.  Any initiative taken in this regard is welcome.</P>
    <P>The strategic management initiative provides the basis for the transformation of our public administration system.  I wish to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, on her work on that initiative during the past two years and for introducing the Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill.  This legislation will transform the public service for the next century, and that is welcome. Not long ago, this House debated the advantages of the legislation.  Any legislation which streamlines the public service and removes red tape should be welcomed.  I congratulate the Minister of State on the introduction of that legislation, which the Minister for Finance envisaged three and a half years ago.  He also stated at that time that the IDA said Ireland was the number one location for US investment in Europe.  We have seen the fruits of this in the past number of years with the creation of 150,000 jobs.  The Minister showed foresight in what he said three years ago. He saw the direction in which the economy was heading and the manner in which he and the Government wanted to lead it into the next century. The Government is to be congratulated because the economy is on course.  What the Minister said two and a half years ago when he introduced his first budget as the first Labour Minister for Finance has proved to be correct.  We now have an economy which will prosper into the future and stand to us into the next century.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche expressed his concerns about the Bill and the winds on our backs in relation to our economic performance in the past two and a half years.  This Government has created its own forces because of the prudent manner in which it is looking after the economy.  This is illustrated by lower interest rates, low inflation and the creation of 150,000 jobs.  Interest rates have never been lower in the history of the State.  There has been discussion recently about a small increase in interest rates, which is outside the control of this Government.  A low interest rate is a real sign that the economy is progressing well.  It enables young people to buy houses, business people to employ staff, and is the basis of a booming economy.</P>
    <P>Inflation has never been lower &mdash; 2.6 per cent is an unprecedented level and is the lowest in Europe.  This is due to the management of the economy.  This Government is on target.  When the election is called, perhaps in the not too distant future, the electorate will respond and return the present Government because of the manner in which it has handled the economy in the past two and a half years and because the country will be safe in its hands for another term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> I welcome the recent announcement on the tax designated area for Knock International Airport and other regional airports.  This is a significant move towards the development of the west. There are airports in Sligo, Donegal, Knock and Galway.  The bishops' initiative &ldquo;Developing the West Together&rdquo; was formulated because of the decline in business, loss of jobs and depopulation in the rural areas of the west.  In the past two and a half years the decline in population has ceased.</P>
    <P>The designation of the airports is the answer to the bishops' initiative.  I congratulate the Government on this because it opens avenues to industry and transportation companies to invest in these tax designated areas.  Monsignor Horan showed foresight in developing Knock International Airport. It is an ideal location beside the north-south and east-west access route.  This is one of the best initiatives to be introduced by any Government and will stop the decline of the west.</P>
    <P>I recently attended the AGM of the islands' committee held in Westport.  The islanders' biggest fear is that this Government will not be returned as it was the first Government to recognise their plight.  Fianna Fáil recognised them recently and announced measures it would take if it enters Government.  The islanders appreciate the present Government's contribution.  This Government appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for Western Development, Deputy Carey.  He has been complimented on doing a good job in his portfolio.  The tax designation initiatives undertaken by the Government will play a significant role in the western regions.</P>
    <P>The Government also introduced the £1,000 car scrappage scheme, which many people laughed at.  However, it was one of the most successful initiatives introduced by any Government. It has played a significant role in helping the motor industry and an unprecedented number of new cars has been sold in the past two years, partly due to the scheme.  I compliment the Minister on extending the scheme.  Free third level education fees has affected the middle class population over the past number of years and I am delighted this Government introduced them.  This initiative has been welcomed by people who appreciate what the Government has done for them.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche said &ldquo;good riddance&rdquo; to the property tax.  It was a penal tax in some cases. However, while I appreciate that wealthy people should pay, there is a large number of people earning a very modest living who may have houses which were valued at a higher price than they should have been.  Dublin people in middle income wage brackets have seen the value of their properties increase significantly over the past number of years because of the economic boom in this country.  These people were caught in the property tax trap and I am delighted the tax has been abolished.  This Government is to be congratulated on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> The Government abolished domestic water charges and that was a significant step although everyone did not appreciate or agree with it. There was significant inequity in the level of water charges which applied throughout the country, from local authority charges to group water schemes.  In my county water charges increased from £40 to £250 per household in some instances.  It is not fair that one person should pay £40 and another £250.  The Government should be given credit for abolishing that inequitable system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the urban renewal scheme.  The Bill stipulates that 15 per cent of the work under this scheme must be carried out before an appointed date in July.  I appreciate the significance of that and that all of the work must be completed by July 1998.  However, there are cases where, for one reason or another, it will not be possible to carry out 15 per cent of the work before the July 1997 deadline.  Planning permission may be held up and appeals may be lodged with An Bord Pleanála.  Family disputes may occur and problems may arise in relation to the acquisition or sale of properties.  I agree with the July 1998 deadline but I would ask the Minister to be lenient in relation to the 15 per cent stipulation.  Perhaps he could have a look at that prior to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One of my hobby horses is VAT payments for small family businesses by which I mean businesses run by a husband and wife, their children and one or two employees.  Such businesses would include small shops, public houses and so on.  There are many such businesses and they provide employment in rural areas.  Certain concessions should be made available to them with regard to VAT.  The threshold for registration for VAT purposes should be increased to a level which would allow people to earn a reasonable income on which they could survive.  Increasing the VAT threshold would prove to be a very significant step in the preservation of rural society and in ensuring that there are small shops, public houses and so on in remote and rural areas.  No such incentives are available at present.</P>
    <P>In past years we have seen a trend for people to move towards larger, urban areas.  If the VAT registration threshold were increased to a level which would provide people with a reasonable income, small businesses would be in a position to survive in the most remote and rural parts of Ireland and a significant burden would be lifted from them.  Perhaps the Minister could examine this issue in a future budget or a future Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider insurance costs for young drivers, a matter which was raised by Senator McGowan on the Order of Business. Young drivers are severely penalised and, in most cases, the cost of insurance is prohibitive and greater than that of the car.  I urge the Minister to do whatever he can to ensure that insurance costs for young drivers are reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> I compliment everyone responsible for putting the Bill together.  It is a very significant Bill which introduces many changes to the economy and will assist its prosperity and growth over the next 12 months.  I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke made his speech with his usual eloquence.  However, I have heard it all before.  The Senator used the word &ldquo;congratulate&rdquo; 14 times before I lost count.  That is symptomatic of this Government's attitude to the economy in that it is glowing and wallowing in self satisfaction while it really cannot believe its luck. Everything has been going well for the Government as far as the economy is concerned in the three years it has been in power.  However, it is quite apparent that there is nobody in the Cabinet, the Government or in these Houses who can explain why this is so.  I have asked many people the reasons for the growth and prosperity of the economy.  It does not matter whether one asks a member of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the independents, Fianna Fáil or whatever, one receives a different answer every time.  Economists also answer the question differently.  I am reminded of a group of drunken sailors bumbling towards a party without realising where they will end up but thanking God that they are where they are and taking all the credit for it.</P>
      <P>The economy is showing outstanding growth rates and nearly all of the variables are right. However, the credit for this prosperity is not exclusively due to the Government any more than it is due to the previous Government.  I need only remind Senator Burke, when he is offering congratulations, that this Government, the previous one and politicians in general are the first to claim credit for the economy when it is booming and are also the first to blame external forces when it is not.  The Senator is correct in saying we have the lowest inflation levels in Europe.  He claimed that the Government was responsible for this but it was the same complexion of Government, albeit with a less left wing hue, which in the 1983-7 period constantly blamed external forces for high inflation levels.  It seems that low inflation is due to the Government while high inflation is imported.</P>
      <P>The same argument has been used on interest rates and Senator Burke contradicted himself when he spoke about them.  He stated that interest rates were low here due to good management of the economy but went on to point out that interest rates have been rising in the last few; days but that was not the fault of the Government. In this case it is due to external factors. Interest rates are only under the controls of the Government to a small extent.  They are far higher here than in Germany.</P>

      <P>I was wondering why so many Members were entering the House to listen to what I had to say.  I realise there were matters of greater importance for discussion.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke eloquently symbolises what is so wrong with the economy.  He touched on it himself when he talked about Knock Airport.  He was naturally delighted with the designation of Knock Airport and the surrounding area, but what really happened?  I do not know but it appears that when designation was changed and this Bill was altered to facilitate special tax facilities at Knock, every Minister said that if Deputy Enda Kenny is going to get special designation for Knock, they would all look for it for their areas.  I have lost count of how many Ministers and Deputies subdenly got tax designation as a result of an initiative targeted specifically at one area in Mayo.  So drunk are the Cabinet, metaphorically speaking, and so drunk is the Government in throwing away money that when everybody else wants the same designation as Knock they get it and small areas in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is money involved. If tax facilities and designation are given to one area, there has to be a loss of taxation elsewhere. We might as well give special tax designation to the whole country.  Would there be no money involved then?  Of course there would; massive amounts of money would be involved.</P>
      <P>I rang the Department of Finance last week to ask them how much this generous tax exemption to every member of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left who sought it for their constituency would cost?  They told me they did not know.  They had not done any calculations on it because it was a sudden political decision made in the light of an immediate electoral future.  Taxpayers' money is being thrown away like confetti and the economy is being disregarded and subordinated to political considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> We are a well of economy but can we afford to behave in the way we are?  While we may have the highest growth and fundamentals which look right at the moment, I put it to the House that the economy is the worst equipped in Europe for any downturn.  I have not heard a single Minister or any of their puppets in the various organisations in which they have been placed, state what we are doing if there is a downturn in the world economy or a halt or slow down in growth.  That is never considered.</P>
    <P>We had an irresponsible ESRI report greeted by the Government saying growth was going to continue for ten years.  According to the Government it is now fact that we have growth forever and that there is no need to consider the possibility of a downturn.  This is a disastrous policy and I blame the Labour Party for it &mdash; not Senator Burke's party &mdash; and the Democratic Left.  I date the danger to our economy to the day a Labour Party Deputy was first appointed Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance is particularly able and aware &mdash; for a Labour Party Minister &mdash; of the dangers of having a socialist high spending Government in power.  However, if we had not had a Labour Party Minister these high spending activities would not have happened.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the doctrine behind the Programme for Government.  It promised that spending would not exceed inflation plus 2 per cent.  The fundamental tenet of the Programme for Government has been discarded and is dead. What happens when there is a downturn in the economy?  What will be done about spending?</P>
    <P>I have not heard anything about this from either side in the debate because to talk about spending cuts or anything pessimistic or to prepare for the day when things are not so prosperous is apparently political death.  Therefore, we all have to go through the pretence that growth will continue forever, that the economy will boom forever and that we will all be congratulating each other for the next ten years in the way Senator Burke has congratulated every Minister.</P>
    <P>This will not happen because one cannot predict the unexpected.  It is as simple as that and the unexpected will happen and we will not be equipped for it.  It is a disaster for us to take this attitude when we are in the middle of a growth boom.  We have seen boom times before and we have always had the same people saying it would go on forever without a cloud on the horizon. However, they never lasted.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the boom will continue, nor does anybody else.  However, our spending targets are completely out of hand.  The Government is well past its own targets.  Let us examine the national debt which is a fair barometer of what is happening.  People like to compare it with the percentage of GNP.  They say it is only £30 billion, and as a percentage of GNP it is actually going down, which is true.  However, Senator Roche eloquently pointed out that the amount of tax going to service the national debt is phenomenal <Col N="645" />&mdash; about half the income tax take.  It is far too high, but no effort has been made in this period of unprecedented prosperity to pay it off. Apparently, the national debt will somehow go away.  At the end of last year the national debt did go down.  At 31 December 1996 it was down a minute amount, from about £30 billion to £29.9 billion.  That was trumpeted at a big press conference, as the NTMA always does, telling the world it had managed to do it.  The reason for it was currencies had moved in the right direction at the time so technically it was down and we had not invested as heavily in the wrong currencies as we had done before.</P>
    <P>The national debt went up last week but nobody heard anything about that.  I cannot remember it being featured in any newspapers and no Minister told us about it.  It went up because we were, and are, borrowing in the wrong currencies, and because the Irish pound went down 3 per cent one day and 5 per cent another day against other currencies.  We do not hear the bad news, only the good news.</P>
    <P>It demonstrates as nonsense the claims being made by Senator Burke and by the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, that we are in charge of our economy, as well as the claim made in a virile way by the Taoiseach that we have now decoupled from Britain and are masters of our economy.  We are not and never were because we are far too small.  We are subject to Britain for our interest and inflation rates.  That is where we stand so let us not hear these false claims.  When we are fortunate enough to be doing very well &mdash; and maybe much of it is due to our own efforts &mdash; we should not make these idle boasts, which will come back to haunt us in bad times when we are doing badly.  Those bad times will come.</P>
    <P>There are areas where the Government has fallen down very badly but they are disguised by what we call &ldquo;tax buoyancy&rdquo;.  Every year since this Government has been in power it has missed its targets but it has been very lucky its income has gone up so it has been able to spend more. All that indicates is that it is not master of its own destiny; it has been lucky.  The income is coming in at a far greater rate than it expected so it can afford to bribe the electorate and that is what it has been doing.</P>
    <P>Possibly the worst case of spending is in public service pay.  Just a week before the last public service pay deal, which caused such an apparent problem within the Government, the Minister for Finance said he could not afford to pay it.  The Minister was right, but behind his back while he was up in Dublin Castle, the Tánaiste agreed a public service pay deal with the unions.  It was the most irresponsible public service pay deal that has ever been negotiated because it was one which a Labour Minister had said could not be afforded.  The deal was done because an election was coming up, and it will form the basis of all public service pay deals in the years to come.  We now hear the same old story from the same people &mdash; we cannot afford any more public service <Col N="646" /> pay deals of this sort.  Yet, in the last few weeks we have seen every single lobby group beating down the doors of the Minister for Finance and getting what it wants.</P>
    <P>If I could relive my life I would be a teacher because teachers have the best deal in the country. They are paid enormous sums of money, have large incomes and they got a £70 million deal which broke through the PCW a few months ago, although everybody pretends it did not.  They set the tone and pace for the rest of the public service. They had a willing Government that gave in to them on that deal, though it pretended to resist for a very short time.  These people have security of tenure for life and pensions.  They work 167 days a year and receive other exemptions as well. They are getting larger rewards than the risk takers. They are secure and they are pushing at open doors with the Labour Party to get what they want from the Department of Education.  It is absolutely disastrous for this country that the public service unions should have such enormous power.</P>
    <P>Let us look at those who are enjoying the fruits of the economic boom because they have not filtered through to those who take the greatest risks.  Those who take least risks are getting the greatest benefit, and that is wrong.  These are people who will permanently benefit and for whom the State will have to pay.</P>
    <P>I would refer also to those who picket the gates of Leinster House.  It seems that one does not have to picket those gates for very long these days.  They are picketing one day and get a cheque the next.  It may be that we can afford to pay it today but we cannot afford to behave like that much longer or we will pay a terrible price.</P>

      <P>One of the problems with this partnership Government is that it has created a new group of insiders.  One of them is IBEC, the employers group, of which Senator Sherlock would have disapproved so strongly years ago.  He would not have shared the same room as them but he is now in love with them.  They are all together, looking after each other and scratching each other's backs, while the poor PAYE workers receive no benefits at all.  However, they are being told they are happy by the union bosses, of whom I am sure Senator Sherlock approves, and by IBEC and many other little groups who form the social partnership and consensus, led, of course, by RTÉ, <i>The Irish Times</i> and the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The other people who are benefiting are those on social welfare whom Senator Sherlock champions so loudly, many of whom should not be receiving it.  The difference, between the two registers was such that many of them must have been on the fiddle, although it was politically taboo to say that.  One was should down in the House for saying it but it was proved to be true.  They were fiddling the Exchequer with the connivance of politicians who did not have the guts to say so.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty at 9 per cent is outrageous.  This was meant to dampen the property boom but it has not done anything of the sort.  Stamp duty is not that high anywhere else in Europe.  It is 1 per cent in the UK, for example.  That is the rate for properties over £150,000 but the way the property market is booming every house will be worth that much very shortly.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the State bank, ICC, which makes more money out of the BES than any other institution, does not have to reveal the fees it charges small businesses, to the investors or to anyone proposing to invest or to reveal in which companies it has invested or will invest.  It is amazing that there is no transparency in this area which benefits the promoters more than the investors.  A Labour Party Government is promoting a scheme which hides from small investors while purporting to save them tax, but the reality is that many of the promoters of this scheme are earning so much money they are ashamed to tell the investors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government on some aspects of this Bill which will enable the Government to reward work, safeguard jobs, reduce business tax and stimulate enterprise. However, I am alarmed by some of the things which have happened on the economic front since this Bill was published.  We are in danger of lowering our guard when victory is just over the horizon. We are beginning to behave as if we have reached the end of our journey when we are only part of the way there and, as a result, we run the risk of not getting there at all.</P>
      <P>Costly promises are being thrown around like snuff at a wake because of the forthcoming election. Senator Ross was right when he said the demands of many lobby groups are being met. There seems to have been less responsibility in this regard in recent weeks.  The sooner the election is called the better because the taxpayer cannot afford these auction prices.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke referred to the recent ESRI report which is being used by some as a justification for higher spending.  It is difficult to see the downside of what has been happening recently. The ESRI report is not short on warnings despite the bright picture it paints for the future. However, it does not justify the euphoria we have seen during the past couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the currency issue.  Over the past four or five months the Irish pound has depreciated by over 10 per cent against sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> That makes it easy to export goods but it will not be long before it shows in the prices our consumers must pay.  Given that sterling is likely to remain strong &mdash; it survived the British general election &mdash; the Irish pound will have to depreciate more if we want it to compete with the deutschmark and other ERM currencies.  That has grave implications for inflation and we have not helped matters by pushing up interest rates.</P>
    <P>The margin for error in the Maastricht criteria is wafer thin.  It would take little to miss the target for inflation as laid out in the Maastricht Treaty, which would mean our efforts to meet the public sector deficit criteria would be in vain.  Leaving aside economic and monetary union, if our inflation is out of line there is no guarantee we would have the capacity to get it under control. We should prevent inflation because it is difficult and expensive to cure.  The 3 per cent level is dangerous because if inflation rises above that figure, it could reach epidemic proportions.  We are shutting our minds to this because it is an election year.</P>
    <P>Despite the good forecast for world trade &mdash; we have seen good figures from the United States and around the world &mdash; and for strong future growth in Ireland, we can still mess things up. Many things could happen to blow us off course, such as the threat of imported inflation, the fact that the transition to a single currency might not be smooth or the temptation to loosen the constraints on public spending, about which Senator Ross spoke passionately, and we have given in to that temptation over the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>When things are going well a prudent business does what it cannot do in times of crises, such as putting its house in order and strengthening its ability to cope with a rainy day.  Senator Ross said this was the most ill-equipped nation for an economic downturn.  We should equip ourselves for such an event when things are going well.  We should not have a current deficit and we should face up to the reality that we cannot ride with one foot on the sterling horse and another on the deutschmark when the two horses are going in different directions.  We do not have a proper strategy.  Instead of putting our house in order, we are squandering every improvement in our finances.  We listen only to the good news and close our minds to anything negative.</P>
    <P>The Customs House Docks is a good example of the success of our tax designation policy.  I have sympathy for Senator Roche who said that Bray is not a designated area but Rosslare is.  Giving tax designation status to airports is a good idea because it will allow developments to take place there.  Thirty years ago the then Government introduced two tax free allowances: one was for artists because successful artists were leaving this country, and the other was for people involved in mining, which created many jobs.  I support our tax designation policy because it allows areas to develop which would not do so otherwise.  Perhaps we could extend this scheme to other areas, but that would mean overcoming the disapproval <Col N="649" /> of the mandarins in, Merrion Street who are afraid of taking a risk.  We should look for opportunities rather than closing the door as soon as difficulties arise.  Section 14 recognises this need for change by making it easier for businesses to accept change.</P>
    <P>We must look at long-term not short-term measures.  A number of steps have already been taken in this regard and Senator Roche referred to one earlier when he spoke on section 51 and the Third Schedule which deals with employee share ownership and encourages people to take a long-term holding.</P>
    <P>Another is the recognition of the family business and the family farm, to which Senator Burke also referred.  However, there is a danger under section 101 in that benefits for small businesses may hinder growth.  If one allows a benefit for small businesses or farms, one is saying &ldquo;Whatever you do, do not grow because you will lose benefits&rdquo;.  It is important that we support small family businesses and farms but let us be careful not to create a disincentive to growth, although there is not much danger of that under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see steps being taken to curb the illegal sale of tobacco but I do not know how quickly they will take effect.  I walked down Henry Street recently and I was surprised at how much I was coaxed to buy tobacco by dozens of people.  Such activity deprives the State of tax and gives the message that we do not enforce the law but allow flexibility.  If we turn a blind eye to some aspects of the law, people will become accustomed to getting away with it.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence from the Irish European Cross-Border Workers Association which referred to the unfair plight of those who live in the South but work north of the Border.  I do not know how the Government can solve that problem but, when we live in a united Europe in which it is easy to work and transfer goods to another member state, it makes matters difficult if the tax regime in one member state is very different from that in another.  When one compares Ireland to Britain, one finds that Ireland has a more beneficial tax on manufacturing of only 10 per cent but in other areas the British have many advantages. We are forced to compete with Britain and that competition is unfair to those living just south of the Border or businesses competing with British companies.  We must work hard to make sure that the Irish tax system is never much out of line with that of our competitors.  We must focus continually on that issue.  It is not that it affects just those who live just south of the Border; it affects everybody who relies on a job in a competitive Irish market.  Everybody is affected because we are in a competitive market nowadays.</P>
    <P>Many of the firms which have been creating jobs in Ireland in recent years have been attracted by good tax incentives.  That is part of the reason for the economic boom which we have enjoyed. Let us not lose sight of the fact that we have a <Col N="650" /> long way to go along the competitive road before we are able to compete equally in many other areas, such as on corporation and inheritance taxes.  We must take steps to compete with those abroad and maintain the economic boom.  We must keep our eye on the ball so that we do not lose sight of that objective.</P>
    <P>I will risk the criticism of Senator Ross by congratulating the Minister on this Bill.  If the election were held quickly, we would be on much sounder ground because, irrespective of who is in power, the spending promises which are made by all sides at the time of an election are dangerous to the economy.  We must resist those temptations.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill and I compliment the Minister on the way he has handled matters since he took office.  He has shown insight and ability in this year's budget.  It was mentioned that it was a matter of luck.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It was good management and sound financial work that led to that budget.  I believe that the member of the Opposition who mentioned luck took his little does of anti-Labour/teacher medication this morning.</P>
      <P>Some sweeping statements have been made about cutting expenditure and I ask the people involved to state publicly where expenditure will be cut.  Few local authority houses were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  In the course of cutting public spending, is it envisaged that no further houses will be built?  Should there be hospital waiting lists?  Should pay settlements not be made, thereby plunging the country into strike after strike?  Incidentally, the recent pay settlements were agreed through the due process of labour relations.  <i>Partnership 2000</i> is on line and going well and all parts of it will be honoured by this Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister has rewarded work, safeguarded jobs and stimulated enterprise.  We have seen the introduction of the biggest personal and corporation tax reductions in 20 years and the wage packets of taxpayers have been increased substantially following sound management of the economy and good Government.</P>
      <P>An accusation was levelled that the smaller parties in this coalition were telling the largest party what to do, and they were referred to as the big spending partners.  The three parties in this Government have worked together in unison to produce this budget.  If other parties find the concept of a functioning coalition alien to their culture, that is their problem.  The coalition is working well and nobody is being bulldozed, as was the case in other coalitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, mentioned personal <Col N="651" /> allowances and exemptions and reference was made to the plight of those in the 48 per cent tax band.  People in that band benefited substantially in the budget because all the allowances benefited them just as much as those on lower income levels.  It is better to give extra allowances to those in the lower bracket, take more people out of the tax net and give people on low wages more money in their pockets, as happened in this budget.</P>
    <P>The age allowance is worth looking at because benefit can be given to old age pensioners who worked over the years and paid their taxes and PRSI.  These people can benefit from the age allowance, which was doubled in this budget from £200 to £400 for single people and from £400 to £800 for a married couple.  If that allowance could be increased substantially, it would be of benefit to those who have worked for the good of this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure to exempt the first three weeks of disability benefit payments from income tax and that this will be extended to six weeks from 1998-99 onward.  These are minor points when considered in the overall context of the budget but they are important for individuals. By taking them together, the Minister saw a way to help small groups of people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in respect of the employment of persons in the home.  In the past if such people earned over £6 per week their employers were obliged to register and operate the PAYE system.  Many people are involved in providing valuable home help.  To accommodate them, section 6 increases the relevant limits to £30 per week where an individual employs a person to work in a domestic capacity in the individual's private home and that person is the only person employed in that capacity.  That is a welcome development because great work is being done by those involved in providing home help.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax reliefs provided in respect of third level graduates.  Under section 7 fees paid for qualifying part-time third level courses by non-earning spouses can be set against their earning spouses' taxable income.  Combined with the removal of fees in respect of third level education, this will be of tremendous benefit to those intent on furthering their education.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister intends to curb the use of the long standing tax relief for scholarship income as a means by which companies can provide tax free income to, for example, directors under the guise of scholarship schemes for their children.  In the past, through the use of deeds of covenant, people were able to give sizeable amounts of money to their relatives and friends and obtain tax relief.  This provided a means for the wealthy to obtain free education for their children while ordinary people could not do so.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has closed this loophole.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the action he has taken in respect of the film industry.  Terrific <Col N="652" /> opportunities exist in Ireland in respect of film making and I compliment the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, for his work in this area.  Filming motion pictures in coastal villages and inland towns in rural areas helps to create employment and provides other spin-off benefits.  Films such as &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo;, &ldquo;War of the Buttons&rdquo;, &ldquo;Broken Harvest&rdquo; and another movie produced in Westhaven, County Cork, a number of years ago, were shot in part or entirely in the area where I live.  This proved of major benefit to people who provided accommodation or obtained part-time employment. Members may be interested to know that the legendary Maureen O'Hara lives in west Cork.  I compliment the Ministers involved for their work in promoting the film industry which will be of major benefit to people living in rural areas and the younger members of the community who have a great interest in motion pictures.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to a number of items I intend to raise on Committee Stage.  I welcome the provision of tax exemption for employment grants paid to employers by the National Rehabilitation Board under the employment support scheme and by the Rehab Group under the pilot programme for people with disabilities.  The Minister is aware that providing help to the disabled is important.  The Bill also provides for an effective exemption from VAT for commercial child minding. Parents incur major expenses in providing education and training for our young people.  If VAT was charged for commercial child minding parents would eventually be obliged to foot the bill and the costs incurred by these valuable small facilities in towns and cities, which often help young people prior to their enrolment in national schools, would increase.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister who will be remembered for introducing a budget which caters for people's needs.  Despite the criticism levelled at him, Members on this side of the House know he is doing a good job.  I am proud to be a member of the same party as the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I believe it was Rothschild who stated &ldquo;Give me control of a country's finance and I do not care who makes the laws&rdquo;.  Anyone with control of the Department of Finance has great power because it is the focal point of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As previous speakers stated, the Finance Bill gives effect to the budget proposals.  I am glad that, in matter years, people have become increasingly aware of what the Finance Bill entails.  This is an educating process and it is good for the political system because people follow daily trends and judge the Government accordingly.  I believe that any assessment by the public of the Government's performance on current issues would be very reasonable.  In addition to the Social Welfare Bill, the Finance Bill gives effect to the changes announced in the budget.  It will also address <Col N="653" /> some of the issues not tackled in the budget which have surfaced in the interim.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 3 which increases tax allowances across the board.  However, I would be critical of section 4, despite the fact that it was praised by other Members.  Under the provisions of section 4, a person who is unemployed for a period and receives unemployment benefit will be issued with an amended tax allowance certificate to show that their tax allowance has been reduced by the amount they received on unemployment benefit.  That is unfair and there should be a link with the social welfare code to ensure it does not happen.  In certain instances, people who were prevented from working due to illness or were unemployed for a period have endured hardship because their tax allowances were reduced.</P>
    <P>Under section 4, disability benefit payable for 18 days, or three weeks, in the tax year 1997-98 and 36 days, or six weeks, will be exempt from tax.  It was also pointed out that the special exemption for unemployment benefit payable to certain systematic short-time workers will be continued for the year 1997-98.  However, the section does not refer to the serious matter I raised about the taxation of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Finance give consideration to the most vulnerable people in our society, namely, those on fixed incomes, such as widows and pensioners who do not qualify under current house improvement grant schemes? There is an urgent need to provide a home improvement grant for repairs to roofs, windows, doors, etc., to people who do not qualify under existing schemes.  The housing aid for the elderly scheme was introduced in the early 1990s.  The system devised was to be operated by local authorities and health boards but it is now operated exclusively by the health boards and the amounts being provided are not adequate.</P>
    <P>For example, a person living alone will benefit substantially but two old age pensioners living in the same house, the windows of which require repairs, will be informed that only two of those windows can be repaired in the current year and the health board may give a commitment to see if further repairs can be carried out during the following year.  That is not good enough.  Widows relying on their pensions cannot obtain assistance because there is no home improvement grant available.  I welcome the fact that local authorities provide assistance in respect of house improvement in lieu of rehousing.  Will the Minister consider this matter and improve the amount of funding available under the housing aid for the elderly scheme?  The health board say it is not effective because it must be spread so thinly.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister introduce a new provision in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme? Community welfare officers quote the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, which limits the amount of supplementary welfare allowance that can be paid towards rent or mortgage; this information is being circulated in north Cork and it will impose hardship on people on fixed income <Col N="654" /> social welfare who are committed to high mortgage or rent repayments and I ask for flexibility on this.</P>
    <P>There is a need to allow tax relief on charitable donations made by corporations.  Charities perform a variety of vital functions, often plugging the gaps left by State services.  At a time of buoyant tax receipts the Minister has an opportunity to make a gesture to charities.  The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group made submissions to the Minister suggesting that tax relief be introduced on corporate donations from £100 to £1,000 and, according to its calculations, such an initiative could be introduced on an initial pilot basis and would increase donations to charities by around £7 million while costing the Exchequer only £3 million.</P>
    <P>In the past year, I have come across cases where social welfare officers have disallowed people deemed to be cohabiting from any social welfare entitlement.  They are told they are not entitled to unemployment assistance because they are cohabiting and their partner is working.  The partner is given no tax allowance to provide for that and that creates hardship.  Provision may have been made and if it has, I stand corrected.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with pollution control. Although this is desirable, very often it is found that only those who can afford it will avail of it. Many small holders have problems and, unfortunately, find it very hard to implement these measures.  Nevertheless, the Minister is introducing a new one year capital allowance at 50 per cent for expenditure incurred in necessary farm pollution control measures up to a limit of £20,000, which is a substantial outlay for many smallholders.</P>
    <P>I welcome the VAT exemption for commercial child minding.  That has been a prominent issue in recent times but it was addressed immediately. I welcome the Bill and ask the Minister to give consideration to the points I made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senators Ross and Quinn.  While Senator Ross may be accused of having deserted the Government benches, Senator Quinn has voted with the Government many times.  Their contributions provide a fair analysis of the debate on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to make a constructive contribution.  My main area of concern is the neglect of funding for the Border region and I have consistently raised this issue.  The six southern Border counties have been totally neglected as has the west.  Senator Burke complimented the Minister of State. Deputy Carey, on the great work he was doing for the west.  I accept that he has a brief for that region but it is a tragedy that he does not also have one for the six southern Border counties.  It is an example of the neglect that the Government has not seen fit to appoint a Minister or Minister of State for ten counties including the southern Border counties.  That has not happened to date and it cannot be said that people of the right calibre were not available because, as I pointed out <Col N="655" /> in the past, Deputy Harte, who held the portfolio for Post and Telegraphs, and Deputy Nealon, who was a Minister, were available and lived in this area.</P>
    <P>During the Labour-Fine Gael Administration in 1983, the economic and social committee of the EU carried out a study of the Border counties. They published detailed recommendations, none of which was implemented.  There is a consistent pattern to the total neglect of this area.  David Trimble says we have nothing to do with the North and that we should not interfere.  He told the Tánaiste he did not have time to meet him and said that when he did, he would not discuss the internal affairs of Northern Ireland.  The Irish and British Governments agreed at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 21 October 1983 to initiate a study of the north-west of Ireland.  It was stated:</P>
    <P>Both Governments decided to press ahead with the study because they recognise the problems of the area are enormous and cannot be effectively tackled by either Government acting in isolation.</P>
    <P>This was agreed yet the Tánaiste was told by David Trimble that it was none of his business and to keep out of the affairs of Northern Ireland. After John Bruton was appointed Taoiseach in 1995 he visited Letterkenny and told a cross-Border group that there would be no additionality to funding from the EU because we were trying to keep our finances in order with a view to joining economic and monetary union.  The Minister for Finance visited Monaghan in December and in the presence of Commissioner Wolf Mathies stated that there would be additionality.  He tried to recover the ground lost by the Taoiseach.  Perhaps the Taoiseach was being honest or it was a slip of the tongue, but he clearly told us there would be no additionality.  We get pious platitudes but no input or recognition, and the fact that we do not have a Minister of State for the southern Border counties is a clear message that this Government has no concern for that area.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live close to the Border have to read headlines like &ldquo;IDB Approves £26 million for Ardagarvan factory&rdquo;; &ldquo;£800,000 for Strabane factory&rdquo; every day.  I have many cuttings announcing funding for every type of project, large and small, on the northern side of the Border. However, it is no longer wise or prudent for a serious business concern to think of setting up on the southern side of the Border.  This is borne out by the fact that less than three months ago the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in a reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy O'Hanlon confirmed &mdash; despite the boom in the economy mentioned by several Senators &mdash; that no new jobs have been provided by the IDA in any of the six southern Border counties or the west, except in Dundalk.  It is obvious to business people that while the present Administration is in place there is no chance or opportunity of setting <Col N="656" /> up in the six southern Border counties or the west.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke mentioned what was happening in the west.  There is a simple explanation.  Nearly three years ago the bishops initiative &ldquo;Developing the West Together&rdquo; was formulated but it got nowhere; it might have got some money to carry out a study but then the bishops formed a company which operated for about a year.  Now, before the election, a commission is to be put in place which has been promised £2 million.  I do not believe they will ever get a penny of that money.  When members of the new commission to develop the west were being picked, a very prominent Fine Gael man from Buncrana, my county manager who is a very energetic, committed development officer, one of the best in the country, was selected.  Yet, no matter how little progress is made he is not in a position to announce his dissatisfaction.  He is a good, honest, hard working civil servant but he will not come back to Donegal saying no progress is being made and that he will not be part of the commission to develop the west which is going nowhere.  That it is a charade.  That will not happen.  Why?  Will somebody tell me why there is total neglect of the Border counties and the west?  The pattern is consistent and starts with the neglect to appoint a Minister or Minister of State from ten counties. I do not understand that.  I hope these politicians are not expecting an increase in votes or even reaching what they did in the last election because there is no way that will happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment recently abolished water charges but he forgot about the 5,600 group water schemes in rural Ireland.  There are 200 such schemes in my county experiencing very serious problems.  Most of those group water schemes started with 40 and 50 households connected but most of them extended to include 200 or 300 houses which had piping but no water.  Not so long ago I raised a very serious concern about the use of asbestos pipes.  I have a copy of a letter, which I will make available to the Minister should he wish to pursure it, dated 21 April 1997 which states:</P>
    <P>Further to your recent inquiry regarding the length of above-mentioned pipes [asbestos pipes] in the county, the total is approximately 410 kilometres.</P>
    <P>That is the length of asbestos piping carrying drinking water.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid tabled a parliamentary question in the Dáil on this issue and the Minister dismissed him saying those asbestos pipes are now being lined with concrete.  That was a clever answer.  In reality, hundreds of kilometres of piping all over Ireland are not lined with concrete. We have failed to recognise the problems associated with the use of asbestos piping for carrying water.</P>
    <P>Removing water charges is a cosmetic exercise which will help out locally but creates a bigger problem for group schemes.  The Minister for the Environment talks about giving £15,000 to group <Col N="657" /> water schemes to help towards fixing the pipes; Deputy Molloy says it will cost £25,000 but my estimate is that the £260 million in motor tax being passed on to local authorities will not cover the cost.  Many of these pipes are broken and cannot carry water.  A real problem exists in rural Ireland and the Government has played Mickey Mouse with it and disrespected the local authorities to satisfy Democratic Left.  I am sorry the Senator representing Democratic Left is not present because he knows if the Government could afford to tomorrow, it would throw him overboard as quickly as it would a rotten fish.  The Government would not have him on board if it could do without him.  He should know that.  The dogs in the street know that.</P>

      <P>I will make a copy of this letter available to the Minister.  I will not mention the name of the official in my local authority who signed this letter informing me of the length of asbestos pipe in Donegal.  This piping breaks nearly every time a vehicle passes over the mountain area and the asbestos pipe ends up on the side of the road.  I will make the broken pipe, the letter or both available to the Minister of State in the hope that he will recognise that the problem is bigger than is acknowledged by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>I have pleaded with the Leader of the House to invite the Minister for the Environment here to debate this issue.  I was astonished that he could go on RTE and provide answers to questions he was unable to give here.  Can the Minister tell me what my or most local authorities in rural Ireland will do?  They will not be able to solve the problem with the £15 million suggested by the Minister for the Environment.  That figure is an insult.</P>
      <P>A number of agencies have been set up; we have a new one almost every day.  One such agency is largely controlled by the Taoiseach's office.  Every county enterprise board now has a strategy committee, which is largely controlled from the Taoiseach's office.  We have since discovered they nearly eliminated representation by local authority members; we were 16 to four.  Sixteen community groups had representation on strategy groups and county enterprise boards as opposed to four elected members.  The Government has discovered that it is not politically expedient to exclude local authority members.  A directive was issued by the Taoiseach's office in the last two months stating that elected representatives will comprise 50 per cent of strategy groups and county enterprise boards, including the Chairman.  The Government is trying to recover lost ground.  Any Senator from the Government side who will canvass a local authority member will be told that the Government has almost eliminated local authority representation.</P>

      <P>The Government will meet the not so dumb elected county councillor whose vote it will be seeking.  It will be told that it is a bit late in the day in recognising the value and input of local authority members.  The directive states that local authorities and county councils will administer funding.  That directive was issued within the last few weeks, too near the election.  The Government went down that road until it could go no further.  It got to a stage where local authority members did not consider it worthwhile attending county enterprise board or strategy group meetings.</P>
      <P>The same can be said of regional tourism for which there is no funding.  There is a single regional tourism organisation, based in Sligo, to administer tourism in the north-west.  Bord Fáilte received INTERREG funding and spent it on building a new office in Sligo.  The same organisation could not give one pound to buy a chimney pot.  However, the staff have enough money to cover travelling expenses to go to festivals and be seen on the ground.</P>
      <P>Tourism is one of our greatest potential sources of employment yet not a penny is available to people in rural Ireland who are energetic enough to open a guesthouse.  When I raised this with the Minister he replied that soft loans were available from banks.  However, these loans have already been oversubscribed.  A few large players have benefited.  I hope the Minister will prove me wrong.  He should telephone Bord Fáilte.  Not one pound is available for tourism development in rural Ireland.  I do not know why we maintain regional tourism organisations.  The staff in these organisations do not know why they are there. They have no function and nothing to administer. I do not know why we spent £2 million on a headquarters in Sligo.</P>
      <P>It was unwise to abolish water charges so that the Government could win extra votes in parts of Dublin.  This has caused problems for local authorities. Will everyone pay increased motor tax rather than water charges?  I do not think anyone will be conned by this.  It is similar to replacing residential property tax with stamp duty.  The Minister should recognise that local authorities are strapped for cash and the removal of water charges has caused a serious problem.  No alternative funding has been put in place.  Senator Ross correctly stated that the day of reckoning is not far away.</P>
      <P>Political flag waving will not achieve much.  The House will go on but the people will recognise that this Government has been a disaster.  I do not know if it is bending over backwards to facilitate Democratic Left.  One or two Members of Government give the impression that they are in command.  The Government has delivered nothing but disappointment to local authorities and rural dwellers.  The Finance Bill is a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> I have consistently tried to raise the issue of spending by the National Roads Authority.  The Leader of the House recognised this and commented that, as Leader of the Opposition, he tried to do likewise.  The NRA published an elaborate brochure.  However, I would not show the cover picture to someone who was trying to have a road on the side of a mountain in Donegal repaired.  However, there is a story behind the picture.  Seventy three per cent of the NRAs spending goes on Dublin city.  Recently I spoke to a number of Dublin Corporation workers replacing shrubs on the island in the centre of the Stillorgan Road and I thought of the different type of public representative who recognises the importance of replacing the shrubs in the centre of the road.  I am not criticising; I recognise it is important to keep our cities and towns looking good.  However any public representative in rural Ireland must call the county engineers several times to get potholes fixed.  The message I get from that is one of the total neglect of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Need I say any more?  Is anyone in control of the National Roads Authority?  It would cost £30 million to put a railway line from Belfast to Dublin. What will that do for the people of rural Ireland?  Has the Government lost its focus?  Is there any place in rural Ireland for people or does the Government want to shove them into a concrete jungle where they will seek supplementary rent allowances of £100 per week?  Does anyone know what is going on?  People are being driven out of rural Ireland and into concrete jungles where they must be maintained with jobs or social welfare.  Having coupled Senator Ross's contribution with my experience, I have a clear picture.</P>
    <P>I have nothing personal to say to the Minister of State, but I have no confidence in this Finance Bill.  Nobody cares at all.  The people in rural Ireland will get an opportunity in the next four weeks to register the same protest that I am making. It is crystal clear that the Government has neglected the Border counties and the west of Ireland.  Little organisations have been set up as a cosmetic exercise and we now have 74 of them, but those will not convince anybody.  The Government will pay the price for their neglect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the Cork Enterprise Board and am aware of the problems of those boards when they were created in 1992.  The way some of them spent money did not improve their relationship with central Government.  Regarding representation on these boards, Senator McGowan is right in saying that there was very little representation by public representatives, but those boards were set up by a Fianna Fáil-Progressive <Col N="660" /> Democrat Government, and the Senator should acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>That structure is being changed by this Bill to recognise the work and ability of the public representative, and not just on the enterprise board. I am not blaming the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government for this, but another Government should not be blamed and we should have our facts right in this regard.  The Senator's point is constructive but it is not true that this Government did the damage.  This Government is reversing the damage done then.</P>
    <P>The Senator was right in his points about our second biggest industry, tourism.  The Minister for Finance made strong points about this when introducing the Finance Bill and there is an emphasis on promotion of tourism in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can say that those problems and those of infrastructural dilapidation were created by this Government since 1994.  We should look at how local government is being funded, and the Minister of State should look at this matter.  The budget looked at many relevant issues, but we must give a commitment that local government funding is provided in a block grant so that each local authority can work to its advantage. Some local authorities are doing better than others.  A number of them believe there is no need for certain charges while others see a need for additional charges.  Some local authorities are not working to their full potential, a fact we readily admit.</P>
      <P>There are opportunities in this budget.  I would be the first to say so if benefits were not being given to people to create a better future for themselves and their families. Opportunities have been created by various Governments, although probabaly not quickly enough.  We should look at the reduction in income tax, the increase social welfare benefits and at the growth and inflation rates and make comparisons with other countries.  For the first time in the history of this State, which is only 75 years old, our standard of living is better than that Britain, something of which we can be proud.  The present growth is due to actions taken since 1987 when there was a Fianna Fáil Minister in office. Mr. MacSharry deserves great credit for the work he did in 1987.  The Leader of the Opposition at that time also deserves credit because he readily admitted that we needed to take particular actions.  Work done at that time has resulted in the present growth rate.  Mr. MacSharry, Deputy Dukes, the Leader of the Opposition at the time, and others in Opposition deserve credit for the line they took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are benefits for those who wish to remain in the home, for example.  Income tax has <Col N="662" /> been reduced from 27 per cent to 26 per cent and classes A, H and B PRSI contributions have been reduced by 1 per cent.  These measures are needed to ensure people at work are better off. The personal allowance has also been increased for both single and married people.  The personal allowance for widows, single parents and widowed parents has been increased by £250, which is badly needed.  This need, however, has been recognised and an increase in the allowances was given.  The personal allowance for single parents has also been increased.</P>
    <P>Social welfare payments have been increased by double the rate of inflation.  Two years ago the Opposition complained that we gave only a 2 per cent increase, but it was still 0.2 per cent higher than the rate of inflation.  We have now increased payments by double the rate of inflation.  I make no apology for saying people deserve more than the rate of inflation.  I do not want to tell people on social welfare they are doing well as social welfare payments have been increased by double the rate of inflation, because they are not doing well enough.  However, the opportunities created by this budget and Government will mean there will be fewer people on social welfare.  The 50,000 extra people at work this years is proof that there are fewer people unemployed.  People in Cork, Dublin and elsewhere are motivated and are no longer depressed by the economic situation.  Irrespective of what Government was in power, people were depressed.  We began to take action in 1987 and are progressing at such a pace that our European partners have said we are doing well.  Young people are doing particularly well.</P>
    <P>People working in the high technology area and those at third level are receiving benefits which are long overdue.  People who believed they would not go on to third level education are able to do so at no cost.  We must consider the savings to somebody earning less than £10,000 or £15,000 gross per annum.  The primary education sector is not receiving enough money.  We must ensure the less well off receive a primary education. While I know the Minister for Education recognises this, more money is needed at primary level.  It is imperative that the less well off are given educational opportunities because when they are given opportunities, they do exceptionally well at third level.  Industrialists coming to this country, including the Cork region, are very happy with our education system.</P>
    <P>During debates on Social Welfare Bills I pushed hard to allow workers to become shareholders. Telecom Éireann has introduced a scheme which allows this to happen.  In the private sector a Cork company, Musgraves, was to the fore in this regard.  It was one of the first companies to allow employees to become shareholders and it has worked well.  We must encourage this in the private and public sectors because it works well from the point of view of employees, pensions and investment.  We need only to consider the uptake in Telecom Éireann and the <Col N="663" /> commitment given by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>There is no reason the scheme operating in Telecom Éireann should not be introduced in Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta or Bord Gáis Éireann, CIE or the ESB because everybody will benefit from such a scheme.  Telecom Éireann is competing and will continue to compete with the best. Communications is a costly business and Governments have invested in it over the years.  In 1973 Conor Cruise O'Brien, as Minister, invested £77 million in communications, yet everyone laughed at him.  By 1977 we had one of the best communications system in the world and it has continued to improve.  We are as forward thinking as the best in the world.  This is something of which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>Everything is not perfect, and I am particularly concerned about the primary education sector. We must recognise that some people in our society are not getting the same benefits as others.  However, we are no longer housing people in two bedroomed apartments nor are we building &ldquo;dives&rdquo;, as we did in the 1960s and the early 1970s.  We are not building high rise apartment blocks which we have to knock down and we will not consider such an option again.</P>
    <P>There is no reason a less well-off person should live in a poorer area than a better off person. There is nothing wrong with a better social mix of people and, slowly but surely, this is happening because the Government has allowed local authorities to buy houses from the private sector.  I campaigned strongly for this in Cork Corporation. I said for many years that it was cheaper to buy houses from the private sector than to build them.  It rewards less well off people by allowing them to live in areas in which we never thought they would live.  They deserve it because, with a little encouragement, they can go far.  Over 200 such houses were bought in the past two years by Cork Corporation and each house was cheaper by £7,000 to £8,000 than it would cost to build them.  The savings could have bought another five houses.  The Government is providing the opportunity for and promoting the idea of self-sufficiency.</P>
    <P>Although I do not speak on behalf of the farming community, I am aware of the opportunities given to young farmers to take over the running of farms from their elderly fathers.  That commitment is given by the Government in this Bill but it should be expanded to businesses, especially small businesses.  People should be given the opportunity to transfer their business to their family without being subject to capital gains tax. This would mean parents would not have to stay in business all their lives.  There is no need for that.  Also people should be encouraged to create at least one extra job in their own business.</P>
    <P>When I was Lord Mayor of Cork, I spoke with an industrialist in the city at a time when there was concern about an industry on the north side of the city which was in difficulty.  This was in <Col N="664" /> 1991-2 when the economy was starting to improve but was not in good shape and jobs were important, as they are today.  We were deep in discussion and I was prepared to tell him I was so worried about the industry that I would gut him for one job.  It is important to retain employment, especially in manufacturing.  However, people need to know when they enter the workforce that they are needed.  There is no point creating work just for the sake of it and employing people when they would be better off elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I was in Kinsale for the long weekend and was out on Saturday night with some friends.  The place we went to was short of catering staff.  The proprietor told me he could get as many CERT trainees as he wanted between October and April but could only get one in May, although he may have three over summer.  I find that very disturbing. This person was exceptionally busy and he did not have the trained staff.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly raised another point about which I am concerned which is low pay for employees in the catering and tourism sectors.  I asked the person in Kinsale whether he was paying sufficient wages.  He said he paid exceptionally well but he still could not get trained staff from CERT &mdash; waitresses, commis chefs and chefs.  I find that disturbing, especially if we want to improve our tourism industry which we recognise will be our biggest industry in five years' time.  The work it can create annually is massive and every year for the past five has proved that.  Society is now more affluent and people have more leisure time.  More properly trained and properly paid staff are required to service the leisure and tourism industries. I have too often heard of people working long hours in hotels for little money.  I will not condone that but neither will I condone the situation I saw on Saturday night where an employer offering good pay was short of staff.  It is not right that this should be so when people are working long hours for little pay.  Staff should be properly paid, especially if good service is given and profits are made.</P>
    <P>We can be proud of the service our young people give.  They put an enormous amount of time and effort into jobs in which they are interested.  They are much better than we were in the sixties, seventies or even the eighties.  They are more motivated and interested in their work and it is only right they are recognised for that and are properly paid for the service they provide. The proof of the quality of this service is in the positive feedback from people who go to restaurants, etc.  Everywhere I go I am conscious of the way young people treat me, how they like to do their work and how well they look.  That is important.  I would appreciate if the Minister would examine this area, especially the fact that insufficient numbers of people are being trained by CERT.  Such people may not have the same ability or intelligence as others but everyone with ability has intelligence.</P>
    <P>I wish to make specific points about provisions in the Bill relating to the elderly and the disabled. <Col N="665" /> We have now returned to the system where a person out sick does not pay tax on their disability benefit for the first three weeks; this will be increased to six weeks over the next two years. This is long overdue.  This provision was abolished because the system was abused by people who did not want to work.  Now things are different. If a person does not work, someone else will replace them.  I appreciate that, despite past abuses, people who are genuinely sick will not suffer and will gain for the first three weeks.  That is important because people need more money when they are sick.  This is a fine measure introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also given increases in other areas.  The increase in the carer's allowance was long overdue and has been a massive increase of 200 per cent.  I am sure we did not believe we would ever see the day when fewer old people would need to go to nursing homes.  Between 1987 and 1992, the growth in the number of nursing homes was phenomenal.  I never liked nursing homes but I do not deny they are needed.  There should not be too much emphasis on putting elderly people into institutions.  The carer's allowance gives the message to families that we want them to look after their elderly.  We can learn lessons in this regard from the way the Portuguese, Spaniards and Italians take care of their elders. They do not look upon them as old people but as the elders of their society and of their families. We are now telling people who wish to look after their elders at home that we support them in doing so.  We are not demanding that they take care of them all the time if they are seriously ill. From the point of view of health, social welfare and society it is imperative that the elderly be properly looked after when they are sick.  For too long we were inclined to put them in old people's homes.  That should not happen.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general increases in social welfare and the increases that will result from the tax provisions.  Most importantly, I welcome the motivation of the Minister for Finance in his public pronouncements.  However, I am concerned about what we say on our interest rates.  Certain people claim our currency should be worth between 10 per cent and 15 per cent less than sterling.  I disagree.  We must be extraordinarily careful about our statements in this regard because they could cost ordinary people money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be an unusual challenge for a Minister for Finance to frame a budget in circumstances as benign and in an atmosphere as optimistic as pertain at present.  This has been the case for the last couple of budgets.  It is a welcome change from the long-term assumptions on which budgets were framed previously.  It is probably too early to say if this is a good budget because only time will tell.  However, we have an accomplished Minister for Finance even if his reputation will ultimately depend on what happens in years to come rather than what is happening now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> It is worth remembering that this country has, in some respects, been in this situation previously but we managed to escape the possibility of sustained growth by mismanaging our public finances.  In so far as our earlier success were followed by failure, we should not assume the automatic continuance of the current boom, despite the ESRI report.  Senator Ross, in a spirited denunciation of our policies, said nobody knows why the current boom has occurred.  In one way he is right, but in another way he is wrong.  There is no mystery attached to why we have a growth rate trend of about 4 per cent.  One need only look at the historic performance of the economy.  The reason we did not experience that level of sustained growth for much of our history was we did the wrong things and it does not require genius to identify what we did wrong, even if it was not possible at the time to do things right.  Achieving a growth rate of about 4 per cent does not require anything exceptional other than the avoidance of draft policies.</P>
    <P>There is a challenge in explaining why the economy spurted to a 7 per cent growth rate in 1993 and has been sustained at that level since. Even the most optimistic projections assume that growth will reduce to about 5 per cent in the forthcoming decade.  That is still above our historic trend but it is not mysterious.  The circumstances surrounding the 7 per cent growth rate of the Celtic tiger are specific to a certain period of time when everything that could go right went right simultaneously and to policies which avoided the grosser absurdities that had created problems in earlier periods of success.  We should not assume normalcy to be stagnation; it should be a growth rate of about 4 per cent barring extremely negative external circumstances.</P>
    <P>The question is whether we might repeat earlier mistakes.  Many of them were self inflicted and unnecessary.  Nobody will forget the late 1970s and early 1980s.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s we experienced a four year period in which total growth was almost the same as total growth for the past four years.  That took place in less propitious circumstances.  At the time Ireland was not a member of the European Union and did not have the massive surge in computer and pharmaceutical exports or the huge growth in the tourism sector.  The latter three factors are the three key variables which have contributed to the boom of recent years.  It is not necessarily true that something unprecedented has happened but the way in which it occurred is unprecedented.</P>
    <P>After the 1968 to 1972 period, our economy was thrown off course, to an extent, by the oil crisis and it was further thrown off course by our response to it.  The economy experienced another surge in the late 1970s but it was thrown off course by our consuming the seed corn before the crop was ripe.  In other words, we failed to sustain a degree of discipline in terms of distribution of wealth creation and the continued investment that would have been necessary to sustain the rapid rates of growth for a longer period.  We paid <Col N="667" /> the price for that.  We lost almost ten years in the 1980s as a result of over-indulgence at the end of the 1970s.</P>
    <P>It is fair to ask if we can blow it again now.  If one wishes to take the malign scenario, there is no difficulty listing things that might go wrong. Some are within our control, particularly the rate of incomes growth, and some are beyond our control, such as what might happen in economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I do not share Senator Ross's pessimism about the likelihood of everything going wrong simultaneously, although that could happen.  I do not share his view, which was articulately expressed on this and other occasions, that we grossly overpay public sector workers, although I have an interest in this regard because I am a public sector worker in the education sector.  We are not making grossly irresponsible settlements in that sector.</P>
    <P>In order to sustain growth it is essential to have the type of consensus which was attempted during the past ten years.  How one sustains that consensus depends on the community sense of fairness, and that cannot be quantified in strictly economic terms.  It requires political leadership of a high order because it deals with intangibles. However, that sense of fairness must include the feeling that everybody who is deemed to be contributing towards growth is getting a return for it. If we believe health sector workers are contributing to improving life expectancy, which presumably they are, or if we believe teachers are contributing to the enhancement of the skills and knowledge that have paid substantial dividends by way of accelerating economic growth, how do we reasonably and fairly compensate those sectors for their contribution?</P>
    <P>If one is a teacher one cannot take out share options in Ireland's future economic growth, which economists tell us is partly attributable to the contribution of the education sector.  If one is involved in private business and wishes to look after oneself properly, one can make arrangements at managerial level to allow one to cash in massively on the success of the firm.  Good luck to those who make such arrangements if they have contributed to that success.  If one is in the public sector, however, regardless of whether one is a teacher, health worker or a civil servant, one cannot make that type of investment in a potential bonus.</P>
    <P>I am not known as a sycophantic admirer of the Department of Finance.  If most of our recent growth is due to high quality policy formation in the Department, the individuals involved will not receive the return they deserve on their contribution. They would earn more if they worked for a private firm where they would benefit from substantial profits &mdash; as many who have left the Department are doing.  It is important we keep a sense of perspective and balance on what is fair recompense for those who broadly contribute to economic growth as it cannot be quantified narrowly. <Col N="668" /> The public realise it is only fair that those who have contributed to the rate of economic growth should gain recognition for doing so.  We should not engage in the politics of sectoral jealousy and begrudgery which is easy to do if everything is considered constant.  One sector is then isolated and it can be said they are getting more than they should or have jumped the queue.</P>
    <P>Our thinking about income distribution is underdeveloped.  We have lurched along in terms of relativities which were often established in different circumstances in the past.  Many people would be able to make a stronger claim for their income if they cast it in terms of the contribution they are making as distinct from relativities which someone else, through trade union strength or whatever, has made.  Perhaps trade union strength only allows groups of workers to acheive something close to what they would receive if we had any knowledge of fair income distribution.</P>
    <P>I do not take the moral high ground in terms of what one sector ought to get.  The question of income distribution, from an equity and efficiency point of view, is one of the grossly underdeveloped areas of socio-economic thought.  In the real world, we must have rough and ready solutions.  I hope that a unit somewhere is thinking about what distribution should be in terms of combining equity and efficiency.  We are not on the verge of blowing it through excessively indulgent or irresponsible income settlements but we must remember it is not a bottomless pit.  That is where the problem arises.</P>
    <P>I am open to correction, but I believe the PCW was the first agreement of its type which was concluded on the eve of election psychosis.  Other agreements were concluded shortly after the Government came to power or when an election was not due to be held.  When an election is in the offing, it puts pressure on Government negotiators to concede what they may have struggled against more firmly.  In this pre-election period there is, understandably, enormous pressure on Government to make concessions.  Perhaps many of those concessions were objectively justified, if we are in a position to take an objective view of these matters.  However, because of the timescale, the lobbying system and the fact that we do not have any clearly defined concept of fair income distribution it is inevitable there will be leapfrogging, lobbying and concessions made.</P>
    <P>I hope &mdash; and this will be small confort to anyone &mdash; a stable, long-term Government emerges from the next election.  I can envisage circumstances where we blow the fruits of recent years and jettison the lesson we learned painfully from the late 1970s and early 1980s.  If we enter sustained option politics and there is no clear majority following the election, whatever Government is in power will inevitably be tempted to yield, beyond any economically justifiably level, to pressures which will continue to rain in thick and fast.  It is important that the Government in power after the election has a clear working majority which will enable it plan for the long-term <Col N="669" /> rather than thinking &ldquo;How many weeks to the next election?&rdquo;  This is beyond the control of any individual but is the type of trap into which we may fall and which could potentially undermine much of the great work done in recent years.</P>

      <P>No.  There should be responsible Independents who take a long-term view of the national interest, with the same balance of distribution and the capacity to improve legislation which the Seanad has been in a position to offer in recent times.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Cregan on a number of matters.  One of the more civilised developments in recent times has been the recognition of the nature of handicap imposed by disability.  It is time we began to approach the challenge of disability in a way which recognises the problems the disabled face and the tremendous courage and character so many of them show in coping with that challenge.  I hope the changes in disability benefits and the exemption from income tax will be the start of a sustained commitment to the disabled. It looks like a small provision on paper but it is an improvement.</P>
      <P>Section 40 refers to REHAB.  Any measure which improves developments in that direction should be warmly welcomed.  The problems for charities in the voluntary sector are being looked at by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice.  The voluntary sector has a very strong claim to a positive response to its argument in terms of the objective desirability of what it is claiming and the importance of a vigorous voluntary sector in ensuring a stable and civilised society.  I am not anti-Statist or ideological in that sense.  However, people who are able and willing to give their energies and talents to foster the voluntary sector should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan was also correct in what he said about the carer's allowance.  However, I am not as optimistic as he is, given the general direction of society, that this will solve the problems.  There is an almost Sisyphean endeavour involved, although it is welcome.  If one wants to get old in this country one should hurry because conditions for the elderly will deteriorate over time due to the value system we have chosen to embrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the tax reforms regarding adult and evening education.  However, they do not go far enough.  This issue was debated at length in this House.  The reforms are a step in the right direction but they maintain discrimination.  I do not see why it is for a non-earning spouse only.  If someone makes an effort and commitment for several years &mdash; some people who attend my classes drive from Tralee to Cork, covering 150 miles in one night &mdash; the fact that they are earning an income should not be held against them. They should get some recognition for their effort. I know that is an extreme case but there are many <Col N="670" /> people in between who are contributing a lot of their energy and imagination and who are disrupting their lives to do so.  They should receive some recognition and encouragement for this and not simply be dismissed as if they were doing nothing extra.  Undergraduate fees have been abolished and there is something, though not enough, being provided for part-time adult education.</P>
    <P>Am I correct in thinking that there is nothing in the Bill for the research student category?  That category is growing rapidly.  This kind of education is badly needed in the type of economy and society we are moving into and it is important that it continues to grow.  As I understand it, research students still pay full fees and do not receive any tax concessions.  I hope I am wrong about that.  The entire research student sector &mdash; and I speak from personal experience &mdash; stands out as uniquely underprivileged and discriminated against in terms of the way in which tax relief for third level students is conceived.  That should be a high priority for Government thinking in terms of ensuring fairness and efficiency. The research sector is very important and it is the highest quality students who proceed to this sector as there are very demanding entry requirements for entry to this level.  These students will go into the research and development area.  They were badly treated before and they are even worse treated now, in relative terms, than they formerly were.  From the point of view of equity and efficiency and from a social and economic point of view their case needs serious attention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax reliefs on corporate and personal donations to publicly funded third level institutions.  That is a long overdue reform and it is a step in the right direction.  It may need to be refined at a later stage as I can see certain possible pitfalls arising but I will not linger over those at the moment.  I hope this measure will begin to create an atmosphere in which the private sector can contribute more effectively and efficiently to the fostering of research and development in general. There is public agreement in this country and in all of the reports published on this issue that research and development is grossly underfunded by any reasonable, comparative criteria. We have been remarkably lucky in some respects in getting this far given the lack of research and development which has taken place. As we become more high tech, it is essential that we become more research and development oriented.</P>
    <P>I want to make a plea here for the recognition of the importance of basic research, strategic and applied.  There are constant debates about the priorities in these areas.  As somebody who stands outside science and technology in certain respects, I hope I am not too biased to say that industry and the development agencies will make the case for applied research in a very specific, narrow and focused way.  It is very important to get the balance right for anything more than the shortest of short term thinking on research orientation. <Col N="671" /> That is not succumbing to some romantic notion about the importance of research or knowledge for the sake of it.  I welcome the move; it has a lot of potential which I hope will be built upon in due course.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan spoke about the difficulty of getting specialist workers in the tourism sector. That sector is not &ldquo;high tech&rdquo; in the normal understanding of the word.  Of course, there is a lot of high tech associated with it as technology applies across the board to the service as well as the industrial sector.  Tourism is our most important indigenous growth industry.  We are still disproportionately reliant on multinationals in the computer and pharmaceutical sector.  It is interesting that we are discussing this at a time when Ryanair is in the headlines.  Access transport costs to Ireland were reduced from the late eighties onwards and that made a colossal contribution to the opening up of the potential of the tourism market.  While we must recognise the importance of high technology, we should be mindful of Senator Cregan's comments and avoid being swept away by the notion that everything is moving in that direction.  Human factors are very important in the tourism sector and we must keep that dimension in mind constantly and seek to foster it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of tax reliefs for approved heritage buildings and gardens.  I am not an expert in this area but it seems to me that we need to have a total tourism strategy in this country of which this is part.  Even if a tourist never visited the country we should have some respect for our own concept of what constitutes an aesthetically acceptable environment.  There is a sense of self respect associated with this as well as one of market opportunities.</P>
    <P>My final point concerns the maintenance of discipline and provides a challenge to politicians.  We blew it in the late seventies and early eighties partly because we raised peoples' expectations by proclaiming that we were experiencing a boom. One cannot expect people not to want part of an ever increasing cake and merely satisfy themselves with crumbs.  It is understandable that politicians will take deliberate pleasure in the success of their stewardship but it is important to achieve a balance between talking legitimate credit and raising expectations beyond any reasonable level. That is a very difficult trick to pull off and it requires real statesmanship.  Even with real statesmanship it may not be possible to achieve. It seems to me that we are in danger of undermining what we have achieved by talking up the Celtic tiger beyond any reasonable level.  I would probably behave the same way myself in similar circumstances but I hope we will not hear the type of exaggerated rhetoric over the coming months which will raise expectations even further.  If an unstable Government is elected, it will be left in an even worse lurch on entering office than it would have been if the expectations had not been raised so high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill.  There are many good things in the Bill but given the financial air of confidence in this country at the moment, I do not think enough has been done for many sections of society.  The Government had an ideal opportunity to assist the needy and the less well off in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is an increase in moneys for roads and so on provided for in the Bill but some of the roads in this country, particularly the secondary primary routes, seem to receive no funding at all. I do not know why the National Roads Authority has a secondary primary route on its books at all. If priority is to be given to the primary routes in this country, the secondary primary routes should be taken off the books altogether.  These roads seem to be in a limbo situation.  Many of these routes are main arteries into counties and the Minister should make funding available for them.</P>
      <P>There was not a big reduction in the income tax bands in the budget.  There seems to be a new poor emerging in this country and this category seems to be a kind of middleman who always gets caught somewhere along the line.  Such a person never seems to get help when in need.  The economy has been growing but the PAYE worker who earns over a certain limit &mdash; approximately £23,000 &mdash; enters the higher tax band and seems to have to pay for everything, including school fees, mortgage, etc.  He is put to the pin of his collar to survice.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil promised a reduction in income tax and we delivered on that in Government.  The upper rate was reduced from 60 per cent to 48 per cent, a drop of 12 per cent.  There was an ideal opportunity for the Minister for Finance to reduce this rate further.  However, he failed to do so.  The lower rate of income tax was reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent under a Fianna Fáil led Administration, a drop of 8 per cent.</P>
      <P>Everybody is talking about the healthy state of the economy.  One must refer back to 1987 when things were much more difficult following a coalition Government from 1983-87.  The national debt doubled in that period.  Many cutbacks and tough decisions had to be made which were not easy for any public representative to take. However, Fianna Fáil in Government addressed them and we moved to a situation of low inflation and low interest rates.  Everything was put in place for the development of a strong economy. The Maastricht Treaty was also agreed, subsequent to which billions of pounds started coming into the country.  By 2000 this money will have completely run out and I do not believe the money is being properly invested.  Many schemes are creating jobs that are not meaningful. Between now and 2000 better planning should be undertaken in order to create meaningful jobs for the future.  The Minister for Finance had an ideal opportunity to address this issue in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about what will happen when the EU money runs out, particularly if money is not invested properly before then.  I am <Col N="673" /> looking for money for a scheme in north Kerry. Senator Cregan spoke about the boom that is being experienced everywhere.  Unemployment in north Kerry is at its highest level since the foundation of the State.  There are no jobs and no jobs are being created.  There is no industry there. Four weeks ago a factory closed with the loss of 105 jobs.  This may not mean much to the people in Dublin or the bigger cities, but the loss of 105 jobs in Listowel is a disaster.  There is another industry there on the verge of closure with the loss of another 60 jobs.  I cannot see where the boom and the jobs are.  There are 2,000 people unemployed in the Listowel and north Kerry area with a further 3,500 or 4,000 unemployed in the Tralee area.  This is the highest unemployment rate we have ever had in the region.  If there is an economic boom it is not being felt in my part of the Kerry constituency, which is also the constituency of the Tánaiste and one Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will have to do something to examine the different areas of rural Ireland.  There is much talk about a tourist boom, which is evident and which we welcome.  In the future we will have more tourists coming to Ireland and I do not believe enough is being done to cultivate this market.</P>
    <P>Regarding unemployment, we are told that up to 50,000 jobs are being created annually.  This is difficult to understand because emigration is still rampant, whether it is to the United States, England, etc.  There is continuous mass emigration from Ireland.  I was listening to a debate earlier today when it was mentioned that people are returning because of the better social welfare system and claiming housing benefits here.  Perhaps this is so, but I do not see this happening on the ground.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the billions of pounds made available to the economy is being invested.  Starting various schemes in small towns and villages which create six or seven or eight jobs paid for from central Government funds is tantamount to having people on social welfare and getting handouts. When the European money runs out all of these people will return to the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the Government's policies regarding the elderly, the needy and the poor.  An increase for an adult dependant of £1.17 per week on average on each of the three budgets introduced by this Government is miserable.  It is an insult to provide an increase of £1.17 to an old person.  If we are concerned about old people and the needy they should be helped.  For widows the average increase per week was only £2.20 and for unemployed and those on disability allowance the increase was only £2.17 per week.  In a time of economic growth these are the sectors that should be helped most.  It was interesting to listen to some Senators saying these were large increases when in fact they were not.</P>
    <P>The 1 per cent reduction in taxation for PAYE workers was small and was a great disappointment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> The Minister for Finance said that the issues of crime and drugs would be handled by other Departments.  However, it comes back to the Minister for Finance to put enough money aside to tackle the crisis we have at the moment.  The Minister failed badly by not putting money aside to address these problems.  We have to provide for renewal in areas affected by crime and drugs, and financial incentives have to be provided for those who are trying to develop such areas.</P>
    <P>Growth in the economy must be shared by all and I think the Finance Bill fails to provide the necessary leadership in this area.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an important element in the process of law reform on which the Minister has embarked since taking office and which she has been actively pursuing in bringing forward new legislation to strengthen the law on crime and to ensure the fullest and most effective protection to society.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill, 1997, will replace offences which lie at the core of criminal law with provisions more responsive to modern needs, including provisions aimed at new forms of criminal misconduct which have become manifest in recent years.</P>
      <P>The present law on non-fatal offences against the person is contained in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  The 1861 Act has been the subject of much criticism over the years and it has been described as a &ldquo;ragbag of offences&rdquo;.  In February 1994 the Law Reform Commission submitted a report containing recommendations for the a repeal and replacement of those provisions which deal with non-fatal offences against the person.  That report was taken into account in the preparation of this Bill which will repeal the greater part of the 1861 Act and will codify in statutory form and in modern language the law dealing with non-fatal offences against the person. The Law Reform Commission is at present reviewing the law on homicide.  When its report on that subject is received, it will be acted upon.</P>
      <P>This Bill restates the law relating to various forms of assault, threats to kill or cause serious harm, poisoning, false imprisonment and abduction of children as well as providing for certain new offences.  The Bill includes provision to deal with the scourge of syringe attacks as well as creating a new offence of harassment which is aimed at behaviour commonly known as &ldquo;stalking&rdquo;. Among the other new offences provided for in the Bill are the offence of abduction out of the State of a child by a parent in a tug of love situation and the offence of endangerment where a person intentionally or recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first substantive section in this Bill is section 2.  This section replaces the common law offences of assault and battery, usually referred to as common assault, with the new offence of assault, which combines in one offence the element of inflicting personal violence, as in battery, and the element of causing another to apprehend the immediate inflication of personal <Col N="676" /> violence, as in assault.  This offence will cover most minor assaults and the penalty on, summary conviction will be a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for up to six months or both.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the more serious offence of assault causing harm.  This new offence replaces the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm contained in section 47 of the 1861 Act. This section provides a maximum penalty of five years for this offence, which is the same as the existing penalty.  Under the present law consent cannot be a defence to a charge of causing actual bodily harm.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that such a rule is no longer appropriate and the Minister has accepted that view. Since section 3 is framed by reference to an assault and consent is a defence to simple assault, it will also be a defence where actual bodily harm is caused.  We are not talking of cases of serious harm covered by the next section.</P>
    <P>Section 4 creates the offence of causing serious harm.  This offence will replace the offences of wounding or causing or inflicting grievous bodily harm in sections 18 and 20 of the 1861 Act.</P>
    <P>Consent will not be a defence to a charge of causing serious harm, but section 22 provides that existing common law defences will continue to apply.  Accordingly, the common law rules concerning bodily harm arising in the course of sports, dangerous exhibitions or medical treatments will apply, where appropriate, to exempt the action from criminal liability.  The Minister has provided that a person convicted of this offence on indictment will be liable to life imprisonment, which is the present maximum penalty for the offence of causing grievous bodily harm and which is being replaced by section 4.</P>
    <P>Section 5 updates section 16 of the 1861 Act, which makes it an offence to threaten in writing to kill or murder another.  Instead, this section provides for a broader offence which covers threats by any means and extends to threats to cause serious injury as well as to threats to kill.  It also provides for a maximum punishment of ten years imprisonment for this offence.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 7 and 8 create a range of new offences relating to criminal conduct involving syringes. Section 6 deals with syringe attacks, section 7 deals with possession offences and section 8 deals with abandoning of syringes.  Section 6 provides for the following offences: injuring another by piercing the skin of that other with a syringe or threatening to do so with the intention of or where there is a likelihood of causing the other person to believe that he or she may become infected with disease; spraying or pouring or putting onto another blood or any fluid or substance resembling blood or threatening to do so with the intention of or where there is a likelihood of causing the other person to believe that he or she may become infected with disease; injuring a third person in either of these ways even where the person was not the intended target.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment for these offences.  In doing so, the Minister is conscious that the offence may <Col N="677" /> result in great suffering for victims who have, for example, been wounded with a syringe and must face a long and agonising wait until he or she knows if he or she has contracted a life threatening disease.</P>
    <P>In the same section provision is made for what is one of the most important of the syringe offences, that is, the offence of intentionally injuring another by piercing his or her skin with a syringe which contains or has on it contaminated blood or contaminated fluid.  Similarly, the Bill makes it an offence to intentionally spray, pour or put on to another contaminated blood.  The Bill also makes it an offence to injure a third person in this way, even where that person was not the intended target.  As all of these offences could result in the infliction of life threatening injuries, the Minister is providing that this crime will be punishable by up to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with possession offences.  It provides that a person who has in any place a syringe or any blood in a container intended to cause or threaten injury to or to intimidate another will commit an offence.  Some concern has been expressed that this, provision could make innocent possession of a syringe a criminal offence.  I assure people who carry syringes for legitimate purposes &mdash; for example, people who are diabetic &mdash; that the provision does not criminalise mere possession.  The section criminalises possession with the intention of causing or threatening injury or of intimidating another.  The maximum punishment for these offences will be seven years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the serious problem caused by people who, perhaps intentionally or otherwise, leave or abandon syringes in places so that they injure or are likely to injure, cause a threat to or frighten others.  This is particularly abhorrent behaviour and the people who engage in it may do so to get a sadistic pleasure out of the wounding of an unsuspecting garda or prison officer or, indeed, a member of the public who, for example, sits down in a café or cinema or on a bus or train and finds too late that a syringe has been left on his or her seat.  It is important, therefore, to ensure that the prescribed punishment fully fits the seriousness of the conduct involved.  In this respect the Minister accepted a suggestion in the other House to increase the maximum penalty for this offence to seven years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of this House to the fact that the Minister is also providing for the more serious offence of intentionaly placing a contaminated syringe in such a way that it injures another.  Such behaviour is very near to attempted murder and the Minister had no hesitation in providing that it will be punishable by the highest possible penalty, which is life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the very important new offence of harassment, which is aimed at what is commonly called &ldquo;stalking&rdquo;.  We are all aware of high profile cases of stalking, but of course such <Col N="678" /> behaviour is not necessarily peculiar to people in the spotlight.  It can unfortunately occur in everyday life when a person, usually a woman, becomes the object of the stalker's affection &mdash; perhaps &ldquo;obsession&rdquo; is a better word &mdash; and that person is subjected to sustained harassment and intimidation in a perverted attempt by the stalker to gain the attention or affection of the unfortunate person concerned.  This harassment can have a profoundly detrimental effect on the life of the victim.  The Bill provides that a person will be guilty of this offence if he or she, by any means, harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with him or her.  Provision is being made for a definition of what constitutes harassment, the basic element of which is that the offender intentionally or recklessly seriously interferes with the peace and privacy of another person or causes them alarm, distress or harm and his or her acts are such that a reasonable person would realise that they would have such an effect.</P>
    <P>The penalty provision for this offence in the Bill as published was five years.  However, given the very serious detrimental effects stalking can have on the life of the victim, given that the harassment can extend over many years, that in most cases the woman victim will live with a growing fear of personal violence from the stalker and given that some cases have resulted in personal violence, the Minister took on board a suggestion during the passage of this Bill through the other House to increase the maximum penalty and, accordingly, provided for a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment.  Because this behaviour can be such a serious and distressing interference with the person's privacy, provision is also made to empower the court, in addition to imposing a penalty and even where it decides not to convict, to order the stalker not to communicate in any way with the victim for such period as may be specified by the court or to approach within a specified distance of the victim's residence or place of employment.  Breach of such an order will be an offence and the maximum penalty here also will be seven years.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for a particular type of harassment, associated with demands for payment of a debt.  The Minister is making it an offence, punishable by a fine of £1,500, for a person to subject a debtor to demands which, by reason of their frequency, causes the person or his or her family alarm, distress or humiliation.</P>
    <P>Section 12 replaces the offence of administering poison with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy contained in the 1861 Act with a new offence of poisoning.  The offence can incur a three year sentence.  If the poisoning results in serious harm or death, more serious charges would, of course, lie.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 14 deal with endangerment offences.  Section 13 provides for a general endangerment offence where a person either intentionally or recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or <Col N="679" /> serious harm.  This offence is punishable by a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. While we have many endangerment offences in our law dealing with specific behaviour, such as dangerous driving and dangerous parking, a general endangerment offence of this nature is new. The essence of the offence is the creation of a dangerous situation which may result in death or serious injury.  The actual causing of death or injury is not necessary.  Where death or serious harm results, other more serious charges would arise.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the specific offence of endangering traffic.  The offence relates to traffic on land and water and is intended to replace sections 32 and 33 of the 1861 Act, which are endangerment offences related to railways.  This section creates an offence where any person intentionally puts a dangerous obstruction in a railway, street, road, etc., or interferes with any device for the control or direction of traffic or throws anything at any conveyance being aware that injury to the person or damage to property may be caused or is reckless in that regard.  The Minister is proposing to make this offence punishable by up to seven years imprisonment.  This conduct can have very serious results.  We have all, I imagine, heard of instances where objects are thrown from motorway bridges at moving traffic with disastrous consequences.</P>
    <P>Section 15 gives statutory expression to the common law offence of false imprisonment but also extends the offence to cover cases where the false imprisonment is brought about by deception, causing the victim to believe that he or she is under legal compulsion to consent.  As this is obviously a very serious offence, it will be punishable, as at present, by up to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 16 creates a new offence of abduction of a child by his or her parent or guardian.  Ireland has, of course, already ratified and put into law the provisions of the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction and the Council of Europe Convention on recognition and enforcement of child custody decisions.  However, the Minister is now proposing that we go one step further and make it an offence for a parent to abduct a child out of the jurisdiction in defiance of a court order or without the other parent's consent or to arrange to have a child so abducted. If the child is not taken out of the country, the Minister felt it better not to involve the criminal law, but to leave the matter to be dealt with in the usual custody proceedings.  The Minister proposes that this offence should be punishable by up to seven years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>In section 17, the Minister is providing for the separate offence of abduction of a child by other persons.  This section replaces sections 55 and 56 of the 1861 Act which deal, respectively, with the abduction of a girl under 16 years and the stealing of a child.  The new abduction offence will be punishable by up to seven years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> Sections 18, 19 and 20 give statutory expression to what are understood to be the existing rules governing the use of force in public or private defence.  The existing law in this respect is governed by the common law and the Criminal Damage Act 1991.</P>
    <P>Section 21 amends section 6(2) of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, so that the test in respect of damaging property is the same as the test set out in section 18, namely, that the conduct of the defendant must be reasonable, given the circumstances he or she believed to exist.  Section 22 preserves defences available under the common law or statute law in relation to acts which might otherwise attract criminal sanctions under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that a minor who has attained the age of 16 can give effective consent to surgical, medical or dental treatment which, without consent, would be a trespass.  At present the effectiveness of a consent by a minor to medical treatment is dependent on whether the minor understands the purpose and implications of the treatment.  The purpose of this provision is to bring an element of greater certainty in the case of older minors.</P>
    <P>Section 24 abolished the common law rule in respect of immunity of teachers from criminal liability in respect of physical chastisement of pupils.  The provision will serve to reinforce the Department of Education's policy on the prohibition of corporal punishment in schools.  The use of force by teachers, following the enactment of the Bill, will be governed, as in the case of other people, by the rules set out in sections 18 and 19.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the Bill is a very comprehensive proposal and, as already stated, it deals with a wide range of offences which are central to our criminal law.  It is in keeping with the Minister's strong commitment to update and modernise our criminal law that I present the Bill to the House.  I believe that, when enacted, it will provide an effective and modern legal instrument to deal with attacks upon the person.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It was introduced in the Dáil by Deputies O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan, who deemed it a necessary measure. The Minister has made a number of minor changes and I do not know whether they will prove to be for the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have reached the stage where the syringe has become more dangerous than the gun.  I would rather look down the barrel of a gun than face a person wielding a syringe or needle.  As I know from experience, one can suffer gunshot wounds, but at least one will eventually be restored to health.  However, a person attacked with a syringe will face serious difficulties for the remainder of their life and may die in agony. There should be positive sentencing in respect of this offence and anyone who attempts it a second time should be imprisoned for life.  It should not be left to the discretion of a judge to make <Col N="681" /> decisions in this regard because a person who uses a syringe as a weapon sets out to destroy people.</P>
    <P>Syringes are popular weapons because they are easy to carry.  Free syringes were introduced to try to stop the spread of AIDS, hepatitis, etc., because it was believed that these problems could be brought under control through the use of clean needles.  Unfortunately, they are being used for more sinister purposes.  A person who attempts to use a syringe on a taxi driver, a garda or a prison warden &mdash; it is important that these people are protected by the law because they provide valuable services to the community &mdash; should be imprisoned for life on their first offence.  Heavy sentences should be imposed in respect of these types of offences.</P>
    <P>During his contribution, the Minister of State indicated that &ldquo;spraying or pouring or putting onto another blood or any fluid or substance resembling blood would be an offence&rdquo;.  This provision should be strengthened.  If a person produces a syringe, regardless of its contents, they intend to use it as a dangerous weapon.  It might contain tomato juice or the blood of an animal, but it could also contain a dangerous substance resembling a clear liquid.  It should be enough for someone to produce a syringe for it to be an offence.  Why should they carry a syringe in the first instance?  Only those who suffer from medical conditions such as diabetes, for which they require the use of a syringe, should be permitted to carry one.  It should be an offence for others to carry a syringe.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding harassment and stalking is becoming serious.  Will the Minister of State clarify what he meant when he stated that section 11 provides for a particular type of harassment associated with demands for payment of a debt? I worked as a rate collector and I am aware of the difficulties involved in that area.  One of the best ways to obtain money is to call on customers as often as possible.  If one does not do so, it is likely that one will not obtain outstanding amounts.  It would be wrong if genuine business people were prohibited from calling on clients at the end of the week when there is a likelihood that they could obtain money.  People should not be allowed to use this provision as an excuse for not paying their debts.</P>
    <P>I am aware that section 11 is designed to curb the activities of moneylenders, who often send individuals to the houses of people who owe money threatening to cause damage or beat them up.  I do not know whether we will ever come to grips with this problem, but that is another day's work.  There are many cases of people being beaten up in Dublin where charges were never brought against those responsible.  I hope that this provision can be amended so that honest business people who sell goods on credit will not be prohibited from collecting moneys owed.</P>
    <P>People who do not want to pay their debts are capable of using the law to their own ends.  In that context, one need only consider the compensation <Col N="682" /> culture and the way people set up accidents and use the law to obtain easy money.  If it can be proven that an accident took place, questions are not often asked about how it occurred.  We must be careful that the law is not abused.  I fear honest business persons will be prevented from collecting accounts that are due.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 14 deal with endangerment offences.  Section 13 provides for a general endangerment offence where a person either intentionally or recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm.  Will the Minister explain what is involved?  Does this apply where youngsters engage in horseplay on a street corner and one of them gets injured?  That may not be intended but it could be treated as such.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the specific offence of endangering traffic.  In some areas around Dublin where there are overhead bridges, individuals throw stones and other missiles at cars and trains. There is no doubt that activity must be curbed. The offence relates to traffic on land and water. If an individual digs up a road to provide a service to people on the other side and a person is injured as a result of those works, could the individual be prosecuted under this section even though he may have protected the works as well as possible?  That is not clear.  We have the best of intentions when debating legislation but we often find when the Bill is passed that we could have been more clearcut about what was intended.</P>
    <P>A sentence of seven years should be the minimum for any individual who throws a missile from a bridge because one does not know how many people will be injured.  It is particularly dangerous in regard to traffic on roads.  If a car is hit by a missile, the driver could lose control of the car and there could be a pile up.  This could result in many deaths or injuries because one does not know the volume of traffic on the road at the time.  Many of the bridges are protected by grills and the answer to the problem might to be put one on every bridge so that it would be impossible for people to throw anything from them.  While this may be a deterrent, I have not heard of any of the villains who commit those offences being caught or prosecuted.  They are not caught throwing missiles at trains even though it should be easy to do so.</P>
    <P>Sections 18, 19 and 20 give statutory expression to what are understood to be the existing rules governing the use of force in public or private defence.  If a person is defending himself or herself from an attack and comes out of it better than the attacker, it would be wrong if that person were punishable by law.  There was a case in Galway where an old man would have been beaten to death were it not for the fact that he had a loaded gun and was able to injure one of the intruders.  Most people thought he was right to do so in the circumstances &mdash; it was him or them. Could one be charged with an offence under this section?  Self-preservation is the first law of nature. <Col N="683" /> It would be wrong if the law dictated that an individual who is attacked walking along a street at night would be charged if the attacker came out second best.  People should be allowed to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>Section 24 abolishes the common law rule in respect of immunity for teachers.  We need to be careful.  What constitutes the use of force by a teacher?  Perhaps too much control has been taken out of schools and if that continues we will have a situation similar to that in America where state policemen patrol playgrounds with loaded guns.  There must be a form of positive control in schools.  We should not return to the days of corporal punishment but teachers should have some way to control rowdy students.  If they do not, the most docile boy in the class will become a cowboy if he sees the others getting away with rowdy behaviour.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Government will act and enough prison places will be provided to take people who use syringes, in particular, off the street.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is an important step in the Minister's fight against crime.  It updates the 1861 Act which does not relate effectively to modern day criminal activity. It addresses the modern phenomenon of the use of weapons to attack, intimidate or cause serious injury.  Modern manifestations of crime are totally different to those of 1861.  People are extremely intimidated by thugs walking the streets.  They should be allowed to go about their daily business without the threat of violence.  I agree with previous speakers that the threat of the use of a syringe is the most frightening one that a person could face.  Society should not tolerate people who threaten others in such a fashion.  The Minister proposes a sentence of ten years imprisonment for such crimes.  That should be the minimum sentence.</P>
      <P>I do not have a problem with any form of sentencing for people who commit such dastardly offences.  It must be emphasised to the criminal fraternity that attacks with syringes are regarded by society to be as lethal as attacks with any other weapon and are punished severely.  We trust the courts will respond to the views of both Houses by ensuring the sentencing policies outlined by the Minister are fully implemented.  There should be very little leniency shown towards someone who intimidates people with a syringe, especially if they injure someone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a criminal offence to be in possession of a gun.  It should also be considered a criminal offence to be in possession of a blood filled syringe. A syringe filled with contaminated blood or fluid is also a weapon of death and is comparable to a gun.  The only difference is that a syringe attack will cause a slow lingering death over a number of years.  I do not see why the possession of a syringe is less threatening than the possession <Col N="684" /> of a gun.  I would go along with the view that that area should be examined.</P>
    <P>I welcome sections 6 to 8 which create a range of new offences involving syringes.  I agree that a person should receive the maximum of ten years imprisonment for injuring another person by piercing the skin of another person, or threatening to do so, with a contaminated syringe causing the injured person to believe he or she may be infected with a disease.  I also welcome the maximum sentence of ten years for spraying, pouring or contaminating another blood sample or any fluid or substance resembling blood or threatening to do so.  This is important as the threat of infection is also an offence.  To injure a third person in either of these ways where the person is not intended to be a target is an offence. These are very comprehensive proposals.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the other sections which make it a criminal offence to intentionally place a contaminated syringe in such a way that it injures another person.  As the Minister said, such behaviour is close to attempted murder and she has introduced the highest penalty of life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>In relation to moneylending the Minister has imposed a fine of £1,500 for a person to subject a debtor to demands which by reason of their frequency causes a person or his family alarm, distress or humiliation.  The parasites involved in illegal moneylending must be rooted out of society.  These moneylenders cause extreme stress throughout the country, especially in larger cities. They cause extreme stress to families and they prey on their vulnerability and need for cash. These debtors are trapped in a situation where they continually find it difficult to repay debts at exorbitant interest rates.  These interest rates are also illegal.  Even where a person has a legal debt there are legal means to recover that debt.  It should be illegal to subject people, either their family or themselves, to any type of harassment.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a long statement on stalking. I am pleased stalking, which is an abominable offence, has been legislated for in this Bill.  The Bill is another contribution to the Minister's ongoing fight to reduce crime and to deal with the pests who are destroying our society.  While we welcome the decline in crime in 1996 we must ensure that the incidence of crime drops still further.  Even though there is a downturn in some crimes the level of serious crime has increased. While many of the Minister's Bills over the past 18 months will counteract the situation in the long term, we must be vigilant when it comes to a problem society wants tackled.  I believe this Government has contributed substantially to this end but we cannot be complacent.  I look forward to a comprehensive programme of more legislation and prison spaces to ensure that the fight against crime continues.  For that reason I see this Bill as part of the ongoing programme and I welcome it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Party has produced 13 Bills.  On 25 February 1997, Deputy O'Donoghue produced the Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill which is only one of 13 Bills produced by the Fianna Fáil Party.  On 26 February the Minister introduced this Bill and I am glad she was able to incorporate many good aspects of our Bill into it. I think it is an important Bill because of some of the issues outlined in it and I would like to comment on one or two.</P>
      <P>Section 1 (1) defines a member of the family as any person cohabiting with another person.  That means anyone living in sin becomes a member of the family.  I know it is unfashionable to say this but I find this very objectionable.  The family is constantly being redefined all the time by trendy liberals but I find this objectionable and unnecessary and I am sad to see it incorporated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 2(1) includes the phrase &ldquo;without lawful excuse&rdquo;.  This is a good section.  Section 2(2)(a) refers to the &ldquo;application of heat, light, electric current, noise or any other form of energy&rdquo;.  It is a pity this cannot apply to parts of the Six Counties; white noise was used in Castlereagh torture centre. People are still being tortured there but I do not know if white noise is still being used.</P>
      <P>Section 2(3) states &ldquo;No such offence is committed...if the defendant does not know or believe that it is in fact unacceptable to the other person&rdquo;. I have often passed the RDS when a pop concert was held there and the noise was deafening. Many sick and old people living nearby find this unacceptable.  If these people make it known to the promoters of these concerts that the noise is unacceptable and an infringement of their privacy, will it become an offence and can they have action taken against the promoters?  I am in favour of pop concerts as long as they are held at locations such as the Phoenix Park.  However, many people find them objectionable.  We take it for granted that noise can be foisted upon us.  This is not right.  We do not accept other forms of noxious stimuli, such as the application of heat, light or electric current, yet we allow noise to affect many people.</P>
      <P>Section 4(1) states &ldquo;A person who intentionally or recklessly causes serious harm&rdquo;.  I have no difficulty with the phrase &ldquo;intentionally causes harm&rdquo;.  However, there is a big difference in the concept of &ldquo;intentionally or recklessly&rdquo;.  Is it necessary to include the word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo;?  Is this not too strong or too fluid?</P>
      <P>Talking about fluids, subsection 6(2)(a) could include additional words.  It states that &ldquo;A person who sprays, pours or puts onto another blood or any fluid or substances resembling blood&rdquo;.  This is good but it would read better if it &ldquo;stated sprays, pours or puts onto another blood, or substances resembling blood, or any other contaminated fluid&rdquo;.  This could include urine, semen or anything which could be throw at people or injected using syringes.  Those words should be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> Section 8 is a good section and deals with the placing or abandoning of a syringe in a manner which threatens or frightens a person.  However, if a person leaves a syringe in their home it must be shown that it was placed there in a threatening manner.  I agree with the Minister that syringe attacks need to be controlled.  There were 353 such attacks in 1994, 514 in 1995 and 1,152 in 1996.  A syringe has become a deadly weapon.  I have seen cases where people have been injected by syringes and have gone through hell for months until they discovered what they had or had not contracted.</P>
    <P>Section 10 refers to harassment by any means including by use of a telephone.  This is a good section.  However, section 10(1) includes the phrase &ldquo;harasses another by persistently following&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;persistently&rdquo; needs to be clarified. A smart barrister could get around this by claiming that five or six times did not constitute &ldquo;persistently&rdquo;.  I accept a word such as this has to be included but the intention is good and I commend the section.  It is important because people are being harassed by telephone calls.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is peculiar.  I accept the intent and I concur with it.  However, subsection 11(1)(a) states &ldquo;the demands by reason of their frequency are calculated to subject the debtor or a member of the family of the debtor to alarm, distress or humiliation&rdquo;.  I was recently sent a VHI bill which included a demand for something I had forgotten to pay.  I unintentionally allowed this to continue and eventually received a reminder almost every week.  Would this constitute an offence under the Bill?  This needs to be spelled out more clearly. Poor people get into debt and receive reminders. There is nothing wrong with a reminder. However, the phrase &ldquo;the demands by reason of their frequency&rdquo; is unclear.  Does this mean once a week, a month, every three or four months? How often?</P>
    <P>I have frequently sent a bill to someone who owes me money.  If I continue to send this bill every couple of months that will be all right but if I increase the frequency to every week will I be accused of harassing this person, or causing them alarm, distress or humiliation?  I would like to cause them alarm, distress or humiliation because they are not paying their bill.  This is a serious matter which needs clarification.</P>
    <P>Section 12 refers to poisoning.  The imprisonment terms mentioned in this section are not severe enough.  Any person who sets out to poison another person is guilty of an offence.  However, I believe the imprisonment terms set out in the Bill are not strong enough because no one knows the effect the poison will have on the victim. From administering drugs to people I know that tolerances differ.  If I poison someone with the intention of hurting them, I may kill them.  The imprisonment terms should be increased.  Poisoning someone is a serious offence because one is dealing with uncertainty.  It is not like hitting someone with a stick.  It is putting a substance into another's body the effect of which one cannot <Col N="687" /> be sure, except that it will damage them in some way.  Since the extent of the damage is not clear, it is open to abuse and the punishment should be increased.</P>
    <P>Section 13 refers to endangerment and also includes the phrase &ldquo;intentionally or recklessly&rdquo;. Would the Minister clarify whether this section refers to activities such as motor racing, stock car racing or horse racing?  I hope not.  Section 13(1) also refers to someone who &ldquo;engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another&rdquo;.  I presume consensual sports would be excluded.  One can interpret that term as widely as one likes, but I wonder what exactly this section covers.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is also a good section as are some of the other sections.  Would the Minister clarify section 18?  Section 18(3) states that</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this section an act involves a &ldquo;crime&rdquo; or is &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; although the person committing it, if charged with an offence in respect of it, would be acquitted on the ground that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(d) he or she was in a state of intoxication.</P>
    <P>Does that mean it would be an offence on my part if I were intoxicated when I committed a crime?  If so, it should not be in the Bill.  For too long we have tolerated serious offences by saying a person had a few drinks and did not mean to commit the crime.  That is no defence.  Perhaps I am reading this incorrectly, and, if so, the Minister of State might clarify it.  I would find it hard to believe that because someone is intoxicated he or she is not responsible for their actions, unless they become intoxicated involuntarily.  Otherwise, people should be responsible for their actions because they caused themselves to be in that state by their own hand.</P>
    <P>Section 23 refers to the consent of minors and the age of 16 years concerns me.  It may be all right but was it 18 years previously?  Does this section cover surgical, medical or dental treatment? Is it intended that a minor could have an abortion without the consent of her parents?  It is intended that abortion be brought into this country because the Review Group on the Constitution recommended it.  Its report stated we would have to legislate for abortion.  Does this section reflect that?  Sometimes there is sleight of hand in the way matters are brought in.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State paid very little attention to sections 18 and 19, and these were also neglected in explanatory materials.  However, in general, this is a good Bill and I have no problem with it.  The public will welcome it, though there are parts of it that need to be tightened up.</P>
    <P>I worry about too much legislation being introduced in some areas.  Many people are now advocating zero tolerance but I often visit prisons, and the people I see there are usually poor, although one may see the odd rich embezzler.  I worry <Col N="688" /> accordingly about right-wing legislation, because the poor suffer from and bear the brunt of such laws in the Four Courts and the prisons.  That is my concern about strong legislation, though it is necessary.  This is only part of the fight against crime and prevention is always better than cure. The Bill is reasonable and I do not oppose it, but I seek clarification of my points.</P>

      <P>The aim of our criminal legislation is to make the law more responsive to the needs of society and to ensure that that legislation is sufficiently comprehensive to give the fullest possible protection to all citizens.  In that sense this Bill is welcome because it updates legislation dating back to 1861.  In doing so, we are following the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission which were published in 1994.</P>
      <P>The Bill codifies the law and updates language that would now be outdated.  It introduces measures to deal with new offences such as syringe attacks.  The provision in respect of such conduct is comprehensive and well drafted.  The possession of a syringe or container of blood with intent to threaten or injure also includes the placing or abandoning of a syringe, the actual injuries inflicted and the threat to so injure.  The throwing or placing of blood is also included.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the increased powers of the Garda in dealing with such issues and the penalties for such offences are sufficient.  The legislation is well thought out.  The definition of &ldquo;blood&rdquo; includes something which may not be blood but which another person believes to be blood and which is sufficient to cause fear in that person.  I worry about the incentive there is for the Garda to deal with these matters and to seize syringes.  We must appreciate the work the Garda does in tackling crime in very dangerous conditions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill on harassment. Section 10 makes it an offence to telephone, harass or permanently follow, watch, pester, beset or communicate with another person, thereby causing alarm, distress or harm to that person.  That section will be a huge relief to a large number of women.  I have had the unwelcome experience on different occasions of being watched and followed. On another occasion I was written to incessantly.  It is a frightening experience.  Members may know what it is like to walk down a street at night and hear footsteps behind one.</P>

      <P>It puts the fear of God into one. That is a particularly frightening experience for a woman because there is the added fear of not being physically able to address what might happen next unless one has a black belt in judo.  It takes a lot to frighten me but I have been frightened on such occasions.  It was never good enough for the law to say that no offence was committed and for the matter to be left at that.  If <Col N="689" /> our laws are to address what is wrong in our society, they must deal with people's fear that they are not safe on our streets.  I am delighted we have created the offence of harassment in this Bill.  It is a progressive provision which I welcome.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Lydon's point on what must be proven.  If it is the case that a person must be persistently followed, I would be unhappy with such a provision.  It should be changed to read &ldquo;frequent&rdquo;, as it is frightening enough for this to happen once without having to wait for, say, further telephone calls to be made before an offence is created.  This has to be looked at again, as it would be a pity to hinder the intention of this legislation with unfortunate wording.</P>
      <P>The Bill also deals with child abduction in what are wrongly called &ldquo;tug of love&rdquo; scenarios, where a child is taken out of the country by one spouse against the wishes or consent of the other.  When marriages take place between couples of different nationalities this can happen all too easily. Recently I was involved in a case where a child was taken out of the country.  One parent was Italian and the other was Irish; one parent had to spend time and money to get the child back.  The reply will be that the Hague Convention is in place to deal with this, but I went to the High Court with this case and the Hague Convention is not being used properly.  The Minister should inform the Department of Justice of this.  The intention of the Hague Convention is that the child should return to its country of origin, where a court in that jurisdiction can deal with matters relating to him or her.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, our courts tend to deal with such matters themselves and go through each issue, including maintenance, access, custody and other arrangements, which costs a considerable amount of money and requires much time.  It is not sufficient to say legal aid is available because in cases of child abduction time is of the essence and one cannot afford to wait for legal aid.  I hope this area of law will be addressed by the Minister for Justice or by the relevant Department.</P>
      <P>This is a welcome provision in that it might address the situation to some degree.  I do not know how enforceable it will be because normally the parent abducting the child goes with the child. Is it correct that this provision would only be enforceable in circumstances where the child is brought to Ireland?  The Minister of State indicated it would not be enforceable if the child was brought out of the country.  Does the Hague Convention or the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, deal with it?  I would welcome clarification on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the issue of the demand for the payment of debts causing alarm to those owing them.  I understand the frustration of being owed money while somebody sits back and does nothing.  The root cause of this problem is our archaic debt collection system.  Perhaps this is another issue for the Minister for Equality and <Col N="690" /> Law Reform or the Minister for Justice, who might try to deal with a slow and inefficient system. This is perhaps not the best legislation in which to deal with this matter.  The provision included in the Bill is sufficient in that it deals with intimidation by moneylenders.  Such protection is needed.  The frustration of those owed money must be addressed by updating the law on debt collection generally.</P>
    <P>The Bill also addresses some of the old language used in our legal system for some time.  The offence of assault and battery, which is widely misunderstood, has been clarified and updated. There are also sensible provisions clarifying the law on what is imprisonment, endangerment, the justifiable use of force and the giving of consent. Overall this is comprehensive legislation.  Many other areas of law relating to attacks on the person have been addressed practically.  Legal problems which have existed for decades, and in some cases for over a century, have been clarified in the legislation.  I am always concerned the law is easily defined and made as practical as possible in its application, and in that respect this Bill is excellent.  I welcome the Bill and urge its speedy enactment.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions and will do my best to deal with points raised.  Senator Farrell said the offence of spraying somebody with fluids, etc. should carry a greater penalty.  Fluids other than blood carry the same penalty if the victim is put in jeopardy and is in fear of their life.  Senator Farrell also said it should be an offence to carry a syringe.  It is an offence to carry a syringe except for persons who are entitled to do so &mdash; for example, diabetics and medical practitioners.  A number of Senators referred to debt collection, with which I will deal.</P>
      <P>All Senators mentioned endangerment and dropping obstacles on motor vehicles, railway carriages, etc.  Heretofore, it was not always possible to refer to an Act in court which dealt with people who stood on bridges over motorways and railway tracks and dropped obstacles with the intention of maiming people or causing them serious harm.  The Bill also refers to recklessness. I assume it would be reckless for anybody to throw or to cause to be thrown a projectile, a heavy rock or piece of iron onto a public transport or a private vehicle or to roll an obstacle onto a motorway from a height, which is a common practice, as we all know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill updates the 1861 Act, which everyone believes is out of date.  Senator Lydon and Senator Farrell claim to be responsible for publication of this Bill.  I am sorry to disappoint them, but I wrote to the Minister for Justice pointing out the need for such legislation over a year ago. While I do not wish to claim responsibility for the inspiration which resulted in its publication, this legislation has been required for a long time. Attacks with syringes and knives and with what <Col N="691" /> used to be referred to as blunt instruments have been causing much concern.</P>

      <P>We will see.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission suggested that the construction of a dangerous building, installing a domestic heating appliance without proper ventilation, contamination of a building or a water supply are types of conduct which would come under the scope of this legislation.  That is interesting because it could surreptitiously alter the individuals' rights and privacy and the right to protection and safety.  That was alluded to by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell and Senator Neville referred to section 11, which covers creditors making frequent requests for payment.  The Bill deals with the type of intimidation referred to by Senators. We all recognise that people in business expect to get paid for their goods and services.  Over the years people have referred to laws and rules and regulations which do not exist in their attempts to collect debts.  It may be a justifiable debt or it could be from a moneylender, but recognition must be given to the law of the land in the collection of debts.  Reference to alleged laws, rules and regulations, or the prediction of dire consequences for a defenceless person in circumstances referred to, would not be tolerated under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the issue of syringes.  The maximum term of life imprisonment is available for use of a contaminated syringe to attack another person.  Some Senators said the penalties should be greater.  They will be if a greater crime is deemed to have been committed and the Bill provides for those circumstances.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators referred to section 18 on justifiable use of force.  This would not mean an old person using force to defend themselves from an attacker would be guilty of a criminal offence. The section provides that the use of force by a person to protect themselves from an attack will not be an offence.</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon referred to the definition of the family.  I do not want to spend the evening discussing that, but I assure the Senator I agree with the section in the Bill.  It is correctly worded and covers what is regarded as a family today.  Changing the definition at this stage would not make any difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lydon also referred to section 12 on poisoning.  He spoke at some length about the insidious nature of poisoning and that the same amount of poison could have different effects, especially on vulnerable people or those of a smaller frame.  The same applies to physical violence. A person of smaller stature or one who has a physical problem may be more vulnerable than others.  The law would apply in those circumstances as it has always applied.  Unfortunately, <Col N="692" /> people cannot measure the tolerances of their potential victims nor would it be a good idea for them to do so.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the issue of harassment or stalking and its definition in the Bill.  It was suggested that section 10 could be open to interpretation and Senator Lydon said it might be weakened as a result.  Subsection (2) contains an important aid to interpretation by providing that a person harasses another where his or her acts are such that a reasonable person would realise that the acts would interfere with the other person's peace and privacy and cause alarm, distress or harm to them.  The key term is &ldquo;reasonable person&rdquo;.  Any such person would deem that the activities of the stalker would be of a very serious nature.  I agree with the concerns expressed by Senator Gallagher about a woman or a person of smaller physical stature being threatened by the persistent appearance of another person.  Persistent does not necessarily mean over a number of weeks but could be on one specific occasion where the person is pursued and harassed to the extent they feel threatened and fear for their lives.  There have been many instances where a person &mdash; a woman or young person, for example &mdash; found themselves likely to be overpowered and their lives in serious danger. They must be protected in those circumstances and that is what the Bill proposes to do.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon referred to section 23, which deals with consent by a minor to surgical, medical and dental treatment.  The position is that the consent by a 16 or 17 year old to medical treatment would be sufficient if the minor understood the nature and implications of the medical treatment.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the removal of criminal immunity for the teaching profession. The Bill proposes to remove from law the criminal immunity of teachers in respect of pupils.  This proposal follows a recommendation by the Law Reform Commission on the matter.  Teachers who currently use &ldquo;reasonable and moderate&rdquo; force are not open to a charge of assault, although such use may be against the wishes of parents and in contravention of the Department of Education's prohibition on such practice in schools. Removing the immunity merely makes teachers subject to the same rigours of the law as other citizens in regard to the use of force.  Modern law and parental concern over the years has brought about a justifiable situation whereby a parent would be concerned if someone else decided to administer corporal punishment to their child.  As a parent myself &mdash; and I am sure Senators agree with me &mdash; I would be unhappy that if action were to be taken, someone else had the right to administer corporal punishment to a child, be it a minor or a juvenile.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher referred to the Hague Convention, and I understand her concerns.  The Bill does as much as possible, since the convention is in the area of responsibility of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  As time goes by, all <Col N="693" /> our laws must be examined in the prevailing circumstances. Having dealt with cases of the kind to which Senator Gallagher referred, I found that when children were abducted out of the country, it was most important to act quickly.  If the courts were able to act quickly, it saved a great deal of time and energy.  Instead of having to go to a foreign jurisdication where different laws applied, it was much better and effective to resort to the courts here and deal with the case quickly.  I have found that to be satisfactory so far, but there have been a number of recent cases where concern was expressed.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  The purpose of the Bill is to codify and restate in modern terms the law on non-fatal offences against the person, which offences are central to criminal law and are in the main contained in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  The modernisation of old legislation is crucial if we are to meet the challenge presented by modern criminal trends.  The Minister has sought in the many Bills introduced by her since she took office to ensure the law is not left to stand still but is developed to meet the ever increasing challenges presented by the modern criminal.  Modern technology and communications are such as to impose greater urgency in updating legislation, particularly where it refers to the protection of the person and the rights of the individual.  The rights of the criminal are progressing at as fast a pace as those of law abiding citizens and in some cases are progressing even faster.</P>
    <P>In addition to updating existing law, the Bill creates offences to deal with what might be called modern crimes.  It includes comprehensive provisions to deal with the serious problem of syringe attacks and the serious intrusion into the peace and well-being of individuals, usually women, caused by the perversion known as stalking.  The latter is a reprehensible practice which has become common in recent times.  The person who harasses and stalks another person does so in the full knowledge that they are intimidating that person, whether it is by telephone calls or letters or by physical pursuit.  That is the aspect of the act which causes such distress and worry to victims.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be a strong and effective instrument in the fight against crime in its many forms and I look forward to its speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil put down amendments to this section on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  A threat to kill is a serious offence.  If the threat goes wrong it will result in the death of the person and a charge of murder.  Imprisonment for a term &ldquo;not exceeding&rdquo; 12 months is not a huge sentence.  The same words regarding sentences appear in many sections of the Bill.  It would have been better if the words &ldquo;not exceeding&rdquo; had been changed to &ldquo;not less than&rdquo;.  In the case of other offences, the term &ldquo;not exceeding ten years&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;not less than ten years&rdquo;.  I might be incorrect in my interpretation of this section, but it appears to be extremely light punishment for a crime that is very close to murder. The offence is a threat to kill.  A person who sets out to cause the offence stated in the section is not beyond killing another person, especially where the abuse of drugs is involved.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to hold up the passage of the Bill because it is good legislation.  My colleague from Kerry, Deputy O'Donoghue, contributed a great deal to its introduction.  As the Kerry football team is doing so well, it is no harm to mention our local Deputy.</P>

      <P>However, I had to point out to the Deputy that it was not the practice for Ministers for Justice to legislate for mandatory sentences. Sentences are provided for in legislation, but the judge should have the latitude to impose a higher or lower sentence, given the existence of a maximum rather than a minimum in the legislation, because there could be mitigating circumstances. The Senator's learned colleague has experience in the courts and he might have to go to court to defend a client on a charge.  Part of his defence might rely on mitigating circumstances in which intent and premeditation would be taken into account.  It might not be good or safe law to provide, notwithstanding those circumstances, for a mandatory minimum sentence in every event. There could also be constitutional difficulties in that regard.  I made these comments to the Senator's colleague and he did not disagree, so I presume they will be acceptable to the Senator.</P>

      <P>I agree with whatever the Minister says because he is in charge.  However, draconian laws are needed to curb occurrences of crime on the streets.  I am not blaming the Government for the dilemma with which the Garda and Justice have been presented.  This Bill covers a number of circumstances.  The scourge <Col N="696" /> of drugs and its effects is detested.  Are there mitigating circumstances where a crime specified under this section could warrant less than a 12 months sentence?</P>

      <P>I cannot think of one under the section.  I know the Senator is a solicitor, but does she know of a lesser crime?  Threats to kill are exactly that.  There is no in-between so there is no lesser case to plead.  While I agree with the law and justice, a provision of not less than 12 months would be better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert in this area but I still contend there can be a difference in a threat to kill, whether it is written or otherwise.  The manner and method in which the threat is made gives an indication of the intention of the person concerned.  The circumstances in which the threat is made needs to be taken into account in determining whether there is a wilful intention to cause bodily harm which could result in serious injury or death.  Circumstances can differ considerably depending on the environment at the time.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (2) provides that the maximum penalty on conviction on indictment is ten years.  The Law Reform Commission recommended a maximum of seven years because the offence of threatening to damage property in section 3 of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, is punishable with a maximum sentence of ten years.  This is being brought into line as it would be anomalous to have a lower penalty for threats to life.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the Senator's reservations, there can be a difference in threats made.  We have all heard of circumstances where one person has threatened another.  However, there is a vast difference between an off the cuff remark and a deliberate threat made verbally or in writing.  This is envisaged in this section.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Farrell and know of incidents where the section should be applicable.  For example, a telephoto lens was used to photograph the singer of &ldquo;Lady in Red&rdquo; in his house.  It is despicable.  A former Minister was also subjected to disgusting harassment of this type in a national newspaper.  We all know about the article, which involved his private life. The way the newspaper in question behaved was disgraceful.  It does not matter what he did, his family did nothing and should not be subject to harassment.  It is possible that if this Bill is passed, it will apply to these cases.  It is time it did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw a distinction between public and private lives, even though there is a line in public life which should not be overstepped. There was one case which related to a lady in Kildare who was murdered in tragic circumstances. At the funeral the photographers almost got into the hearse, which was objectionable and insensitive.  I tackled &mdash; if I may use that word in the present context &mdash; one of these people afterwards who said the public had a right to know.  I do not think they have this right and if they do, it is not with the use of those tactics.  In circumstances such as that it would be desirable that the law be invoked to ensure the invasion of privacy would be minimised.</P>
      <P>The journalistic practice for many years was that people in mourning were left alone and not subject to close-up shots by telephoto lenses.  It is appropriate to take photographs of public persons at funerals; but chief mourners, irrespective of whether they are public persons, should be left alone.  During the funeral of the late Brian Lenihan, a party colleague of the Minister's who was in the news was photographed at prayer in the church.  That is not acceptable.  I presume this Bill cannot be used in those circumstances, but it could be in the case of the murder I gave an example of where the family was almost jostled aside to obtain pictures.</P>

      <P>The Bill was not introduced with that senario in mind.  However, I note the points raised by Senators.  I recall the cases to which Senator Dardis referred.  We must recognise that it is traditional that at times of bereavement, space, time and privacy should be given to those in mourning.  As our society develops, it appears to have become more important for a person to get a quick quote at the right time, for reasons best known to him or hereself.  I am not sure the Bill covers this, but it could if it were determined by the court that there was severe and serious harassment thereby making the victim feel that he or she was in danger, threatened or intimidated. I presume it would be a defence in such circumstances that no harm or ill was intended and it was merely in the pursuit of information and so on.  That point was raised by Senator Dardis.  As a non-legal person I believe it would be a question of whether the pursuit of information for the benefit of the general public or the protection and privacy of the individual was the greater need.</P>
      <P>It is sad to see someone who has been tragically bereaved being asked for a comment.  I do not know what comment one could make in such circumstances. The bereaved person or the injured party should be given the time and space to grieve and should not be subjected to intimidation or harassment.  I hope that message will get across.  This section is intended to deal with another type of insidious problem, to which I referred earlier, which has become more prevalent in recent times and which is completely and totally unacceptable.</P>

      <P>Are private detectives covered under the Bill or are they exempted from it? Private investigation is another form of harassment. Private detectives are hired to pursue people and take photographs of them and that can be nerve wracking whether done for genuine reasons or not.  Has a person a right to personal freedom?  I do not think civilians should be in that business which seems to be a growing one for insurance and other reasons.  If there is a problem, the Garda should deal with it.</P>

This section is intended to cover a situation where it is felt that the object of an exercise is to maim and where it is clearly determined that a person will be liable on summary conviction and so on.  The objective in sport is to participate and win or lose as the case may be.  The purpose of feneing or kickboxing is not to maim but to score on a points system and to ascertain which of the competitors is the better one.  With regard to ice hockey, I assure Senators that the purpose of the exercise, despite illustrations to the contrary, is not to maim other competitors.  If one pursues an activity the purpose of which is to maim or cause serious bodily harm, the section would apply in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>This section is a good one.  The Minister referred to tug of love situations of which there have been many in recent years.  How far does this legislation go in the event of a person taking a child out of the State unlawfully?  Can that person be brought back into the country?  We have seen a number of cases where a child or children have been abducted late at night and taken to a foreign country.  What effect will this legislation have in returning those children to their proper home or parent?  If a court decides that a child, or children, should reside with their father or mother, has this legislation any jurisdiction outside of the State to ensure that is so?  Is there any way we can bring such a person back from a foreign country?  If this is not provided for it is pointless having this legislation.  Anybody within the State will normally come under existing laws. However, the section refers to taking a child under the age of 16 years out of the State.  I agree with the provision but it is not much good having it in the Bill.  What good will it do if we cannot pursue a person who kidnaps or abducts a child under 16 years and takes them out of the State?</P>
      <P>We have adequate laws to deal with the problem within the State.  It is not a very big island. What will be the effect of this Bill outside the State?</P>

      <P>The section is aimed at what have become known as tug-of-love cases where one parent takes his or her child out of the jurisdiction in defiance of a court order or without the consent of the other parent.  The incidence of this type of abduction has become more prevalent as people from different countries and cultures come increasingly into contact, marry and have children.</P>
      <P>There are two international conventions dealing with the matter, namely, the Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction and the Council of Europe convention on the recognition and enforcement of child custody orders, which is also important.  Ireland ratified both conventions following enactment of the child abduction and enforcement of custody orders legislation of 1991.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) makes it an offence for a person to whom the section applies to take a child under the age of 16 years out of the State in defiance of a court order or without the consent of each person who is a parent, guardian or person to whom custody of the child was granted by a court unless consent of the court was obtained.</P>
      <P>In the case of countries with whom we have an extradition agreement, matters could be resolved more easily where a child is taken out of the country.  In other cases it is not so easily dealt with.  We have all heard of cases in other jurisdictions with which we do not have extradition arrangements.  The process in such circumstances may be difficult, tedious and long drawn out.  In a number of cases these procedures were embarked upon to bring the person back to the jurisdiction again.  However, this does not resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>I know it is difficult to determine when a child is at risk.  There may be no evidence of threats having been made.  This Bill purports to deal with the situation in so far as one can with other jurisdictions which have a similar inclination.</P>

      <P>Earlier I asked a question on subsection (3) (d) which refers to a person in a state of intoxication.  Does this mean that if I protect my property from somebody who is attacking it and the person claims they were intoxicated at the time they can get off scot-free?  What does the phrase &ldquo;he or she was in a state of intoxication&rdquo; mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>While taken into consideration, it is not a complete defence to claim that the person <Col N="702" /> was in a state of intoxication.  In certain circumstances an act will be regarded as a crime or criminal even though the person doing the act is not held to be criminally responsible.  When the children's legislation is enacted, the reference to seven years in paragraph (a) will require to be changed.  Intoxication is not as such a defence in a criminal charge.  However, it is mentioned in paragraph (d) to cater for the special case identified in a particular instance, namely, the Kingston case in 1993, where the defendant has the intent to commit the forbidden act but his or her conduct is not criminal because his or her ability to resist the desire to do the act was reduced or excluded by involuntary intoxication.  I presume &ldquo;involuntary intoxication&rdquo; means the person themselves did not become intoxicated, but that it was introduced to them by other means.</P>
      <P>The section does not mean that intoxication is a defence in itself.  My understanding is that it refers to where the court, in particular circumstances, will examine a case to determine whether intoxication is germane to it.</P>

      <P>I am not familiar with the Kingston case.  However, I understand that the reference is to somebody intoxicated without their consent, be it from drugs, alcohol, etc.  It seems extraordinary to take that into account.  I have rarely seen anybody involuntarily intoxicated.  Responsibility generally lies with the person.  If it is necessary to provide for this then so be it but it is extraordinary that anybody could be said to be of diminished responsibility because they were drunk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am reading this section, which is a good one, correctly, this is the first time in legislation that a person can protect themselves where a crime is being committed.  There was a recent case in the west where an elderly man resorted to using a gun to protect himself and rightly so.  I supported him at the time and still do.  This section is far-reaching because I have been told, although I am a layman like the Minister, that in the case of a criminal who has an accident while breaking into another person's property, that person could be held liable.  In other words, if somebody is breaking into a store through a skylight and falls and hurts themselves, the criminal could bring an action against the owner of the property and win the case.  Under this section, particularly the first part, does that mean we will see no further such cases and that if a criminal gets hurt on a premises the owner of the premises will not be responsible?  Even though it is something we should not welcome that much, a person should at least have a right <Col N="703" /> to protect themselves.  There have been a couple of such cases in recent years where violence was used and I am not sure whether criminal charges arose.  Does this Bill indemnify the owner of the property which a criminal is breaking into?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the circumstances to which the Senator referred, whereby a criminal could claim negligence on behalf of the householder in the event of the criminal entering the house with felonious intent, have been changed.  It does not occur now.  From memory, the case used to be that a householder was negligent.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, I remember a case which took up quite an amount of space in newspapers several years ago when somebody was protecting their property in a way which was also dangerous to unsuspecting visitors, even though the person attempting to visit the property might have no intention of committing an offence as such.  In those circumstances there is provision in the Bill if it was felt that something extraordinary was done which could present a threat to a casual passer-by.  There would still be a problem there. In so far as I am aware, the situation whereby a person could claim damages against the property owner while they were in pursuit of felonious activity has rightfully gone by the wayside.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) sets out various situations in which reasonable force may be used.  It provides a defence against both criminal and tortious acts, but where force is used to protect against trespass to another person or another person's property the force must be used with the authority of that other person.  So if you are moving into a second or third party situation the same obviously does not apply to the same extent.</P>
      <P>That is to prevent meddling, or intermeddling, as the Bill refers to it.  Generally speaking the Bill is pitched in such a way, following recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission, as to meet the requirements which have been referred to both here and in the Lower House over many years.  I feel it will be effective in doing that.</P>
      <P>One must wait until the law is tested in the courts to see how it works.  We may be compelled in future to react more quickly and bring about changes in legislation.  For example, we have changed the Offences against the Person Act, 1861, in many ways.  There is a need to update our legislation and bring it on stream in a way that is meaningful to today's situation.  This Bill simply does that.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to amend the Schedule to the Bail Act, 1997.  It is no harm to recall references I made a few moments ago to the need to modernise legislation and to interlink it with legislation which may have an interdependency with it, thereby strengthening either the current legislation or the previously enacted legislation.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bail Act, 1997, provides that bail can be refused by a court where the person is charged with a serious offence and where such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Serious offence&rdquo; is an offence specified in this Schedule to the Act, and an offence meriting at least five years imprisonment.  Five offences mentioned in the Bail Act Schedule are being repealed by the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill, and four have been replaced by modern equivalents.  Accordingly, a technical amendment to the Bail Act Schedule is now necessary.</P>
      <P>The offences in question are: false imprisonment; kidnapping; assault causing actual bodily harm, section 18; wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm; and section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, causing grievous bodily harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also a number of new offences in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill, carrying penalties from five years to life, which the Minister considers should be included in the Schedule to the Bail Act.  These new offences, which are now proposed by way of amendment to include the Bail Act Schedule, are as follows: section 5, threats to kill or cause serious harm, for which the maximum penalty is ten years imprisonment; section 6, syringe attacks, for which the maximum penalties, depending on the nature of the attack, are ten years or life imprisonment; section 7, possession of syringe, for which the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment; section 8, placing or abandoning syringes, for which the maximum penalties, depending on the circumstances and seriousness of the offence, are seven years or life imprisonment; section 9, coercion, for which the maximum penalty is five years imprisonment; section 10, harassment, or stalking as it is more commonly known, for which the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment; section 13, endangerment, for which the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment; section 4, endangering traffic, for which the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment; section 16, abduction of child by parent, for which the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment; <Col N="706" /> and section 17, abduction of child by others, for which the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that these are all serious offences.  In particular, I draw the attention of the House to the offences concerning syringes and the offence of harassment, or stalking as it is known, from which there is a real need to protect the individual and the community.  It is of course only right when creating new offences of this nature to ensure that all the protection of the law available for comparable offences is also available for the new offences.  Accordingly, this amendment will ensure that the provisions of the Bail Act, 1997, will apply to the offences I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I thank all Members of the House for their participation in the debate on this Bill.  It is an important step in the process of legislative reform which the Minister for Justice has been putting in place since she took up office. Most of the 17 Bills she has published this year, and hopefully all of which will be enacted shortly, represent a very significant strengthening and modernisation of the law to provide the fullest and most effective protection for society against criminal attack.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an important part of that legislative reform because it replaces offences which lie at the core of criminal law with provisions more responsive to modern needs, including provisions for new forms of criminal misconduct, such as syringe attacks and stalking, which, unfortunately, have become a problem in recent years.  This Bill, when enacted, will be a valuable legislative instrument in the fight against many forms of criminality.  It will be a modern statute to meet modern needs.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions and for raising matters about which the public is concerned. This Bill, when enacted, will be valuable in the fight against the criminals and will help to level the playing pitch for the citizens who need protection.</P>

Senator Burke will note the removal of the provision for perpetual licences in section 15.  In addition, his concern that authorised officers from the fisheries boards might be hampered in the performance of their duties by the trespass provisions in section 20 has been explicitly addressed by way of amendment to that section. Both Senator Burke and Senator Fitzgerald raised the question of the notification of licensing decisions.  Regulations to be made under section 10 will require the licensing authority to give notice of its decision.  Following amendment of section 12, the applicant for a licence will not have any role in the matter.</P>
      <P>I have also included a specific reference in section 10 (3) (f) to consultation with statutory bodies, which include fisheries boards, local authorities and harbour commissioners.  A significant amendment to the Bill since it was before the Seanad relates to the provisions for nominations to the appeals boards of representatives of various interests, including aquaculture and wild fisheries, as specified in section 23.  This has been put in place to give the board the broadest possible representation in terms of all relevant interests and to ensure that its composition is fair, balanced and commands respect and confidence.</P>

      <P>I agree with the amendments made by the Dáil.  This Bill got a speedy passage through the House last December.  It was welcomed by the people who work in the hatcheries in the west.  These amendments improve the Bill, which speeds up the licensing process.  I am happy with the final draft.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been significantly improved by these amendments and I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues for that.  Perhaps it might have been delayed longer in this House than it was, but it has been improved in the other House.  I have a few minor quibbles about things which should be included in the Bill. However, I am happy with the Minister's assurance that fresh water will be protected and that fish farming will not be allowed in our premier salmon waters in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> I welcome the provision in the licensing procedures in section 7 for the reporting of the incidence of disease and the presence of parasites, but this matter has been allowed to drift.  There has been a lack of scientific clarity about whether there is a specific connection between fin-fish farming at sea and the demise of the sea-trout.  I have a vested interest in this matter because I have fished for sea-trout from Waterville, County Kerry, to Doolough, County Mayo.  I know most of the sea-trout fisheries in between and what has happened to them is nothing short of a national disaster.  There are measures in the Bill to provide for environmental interests to be represented on the board and the protection of the environment is also a matter of consideration under section 7.  I welcome those provisions, but it should be clearly stated whether there is an empirical link between fin-fish farming and what has been allowed happen to the sea-trout, which is nothing short of an environmental crime &mdash; I use those words advisedly.</P>
    <P>There has been some recovery.  Last year I caught sea-trout in Costelloe, County Galway, and they were fresh and in good condition.  Fallowing has a place in all of this.  It has been reported to me that there are problems in County Galway but I do not have first hand knowledge of that.</P>
    <P>My primary purpose in appealing to the Minister is that this has gone on for far too long.  The sea-trout population must be encouraged and helped to recover because these fisheries are of international importance.  When I began fishing in the west 25 years ago people travelled from all over the world.  They flew into Shannon Airport and hired a car for a month and a ghillie for every day of that month and spent significant sums of money.  Those people will go to the Falkland Islands, Russia, Canada or wherever the sport is. If we provide the sport, they will come here. Everything must be done to restore that position.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if the licences were for a shorter period than 20 years and I know that matter was debated in the Dáil.  However, I accept that the Bill has been improved significantly and is much better than when it left this House.  It includes protections which I regard as extremely important.  The environmental aspect has been improved and the Bill will have the effect of affording the type of protection which is essential.  I accept fully the economic importance of fin-fish farming but tourism, which is derived from trout and sea-trout fisheries, is important also, particularly in the west in areas where there are few alternatives.  We could get into a broader argument about the need to protect our waters and the environmental degradation which has taken place, but that is for another day.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes to the Bill and it is not my intention to delay it further.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Dardis for their remarks.  Although the Bill passed through this House in one day, it was made clear by a number of Senators during the course of the debate that there were issues which they wished to have examined and I undertook to do so before the Bill was considered in the Dáil.  The amendments which were made to the Bill in the Dáil reflect and respond to the issues which were raised in this House when the Bill was introduced.</P>
      <P>In response to the matters which Senator Dardis, in particular, raised, I do not accept that there has been any neglect in the way the trout issue has been addressed.  Sea-trout stocks dropped dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  As Senator Dardis stated, there is a lack of scientific clarity as to the cause and effect of that collapse.  None of us is in a position to instruct scientists on what they should find.  The fact of the matter is that, after almost a decade of examining this problem at considerable expense to the many agencies of the State, scientists differ on the cause of the decline of the sea-trout.</P>
      <P>Having said that, there has been a considerable effort to assist the recovery of sea-trout stocks. The blueprint for that is the Whitaker report which examined the matter some years ago.  The Department of the Marine is operating on the precautionary principle.   In other words, we are taking whatever measures are necessary to prevent a further decline in sea-trout stocks and to attempt the rehabilitation of those stocks. There is also considerable investment in the rehabilitation of sea-trout stocks through the tourism angling measure and I am encouraged that there has been some recovery in some systems, although there is no room for complacency in regard to the state of sea-trout stocks.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions to this Bill both when the Bill was introduced and this evening in responding to the amendments which have been made by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his usual courtesy and efficiency.  I want to record, as Senator Dardis stated, that this House did not just rubber stamp this Bill.  I would not like the House to get a name for rubber stamping Bills because that is not in our pedigree.  As the Minister knows, even though the Harbours Bill, 1995, passed through the Dáil and the select committee, this House found room for improvement.  On that occasion, we outlined the faults we found in the Bill but we did not go too hard on it because we were under the impression that it was an essential and urgent Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> Nobody knows what is the problem with sea-trout. Mr. Pat Brosnan of Dingle, County Kerry, who is dead about 20 years, told me no herring was caught in Dingle in two separate periods spanning about 30 years.  Nobody could understand why this occurred or where the herring had gone.  I suppose these matters are a mystery to be solved by scientists.</P>

The Minister and his officials are to be congratulated on the way in which it was dealt with in the other House.  At this stage most people are happy with the Bill.  I know the angling interest regard it as being reasonably satisfactory.  I wish the Bill well and hope it will lead to the type of regulation and environmental quality we all wish to see.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions and their kind remarks about the Bill.  I assure Senator Fitzgerald that it was not rubber stamped by the House.  When I introduced the Bill in December last, Members made clear their concerns about particular aspects of the Bill. During the course of that debate I undertook to address those issues prior to the Dáil debate on the Bill.  That was the understanding of Members in agreeing to the Second Stage debate.</P>
      <P>The Bill is important legislation.  The numbers of people consuming fish and the amounts of fish being consumed are on the increase.  The problem is that the quantity of wild fish available globally is in decline.  The only way the increasing demand for fish can be met and the pressure taken off wild stocks of fish is by farming the resource.  At present, 25 per cent of all fish produced in Ireland is produced by fish farms.  That proportion will increase and we must ensure that we develop an environmentally sustainable way to farm fish.  The Bill will provide a basis for doing that because it sets down a new licensing mechanism, an appeals system and strict standards and criteria which must be met by the operators of fish farms.</P>
      <P>The Bill lays the basis for the development of an important industry and the production of an important, safe and wholesome source of food. It also provides for the protection of the marine environment.  I thank Members, the Cathaoirleach and the staff of the House for their co-operation in dealing with the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Pensions for Local Authority Members.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter which is being actively pursued by the General Council of County Councils and which I have pursued for some time.</P>
      <P>The role of councillors and the time and effort they put into doing constituency work has not been appreciated in the past.  People may be of the opinion that this matter is a red herring but it is not.  If one considers the local authority system, approximately 30,000 people are employed in local government and they service the needs of our 883 county councillors.  People working in local government are eligible to receive pensions while councillors who work on behalf of the public are not rewarded, except through the payment of expenses.  I welcome the introduction of the new form of expenses but the efforts of some councillors who live a distance from their local town hall or place of business have been hindered. These people are not rewarded for much of the committee work, etc., they carry out.</P>
      <P>The councillors with whom I deal work almost on a full-time basis.  They receive between £8 and £10 per day but they do as much work as the majority of Deputies and Senators.  Many of them have opened full-time advice centres, etc., and are paying for these from their own funds.  In addition, like Deputies and Senators, councillors attend every meeting and activity that takes place in their constituencies.  They are obliged to pay their own expenses and receive no reward.</P>
      <P>The General Council of County Councils asked me to raise this issue on the Adjournment of the House and I promised to do so.  I also raised it with my colleagues in Fianna Fáil at a meeting of our parliamentary party.  In principle, my party supports the concept of a pension for councillors. A draft proposal was submitted to the Department of the Environment from the General Council of County Councils and it should be given careful consideration to see if it can be implemented.  I am aware that there may be some difficulties but councillors who spend 20 to 30 years representing their localities should be rewarded at the end of their period of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, a councillor's door is always open.  With modern telecommunications systems, he or she takes telephone calls from early morning to late at night.  The people councillors represent expect to have access to them at all times.  Most councillors have full-time jobs and the bulk of their social time each evening is taken up with constituency work. They forward any problems with which they are <Col N="713" /> unable to deal to their local Deputies to try to have them resolved.  The 30,000 people employed in local government, with the exception of the 883 councillors who service it, are eligible to receive pensions.  For that reason, pensions for councillors should be introduced.</P>
    <P>People may state that councillors receive vast amounts of money in travelling expenses.  That may have been the case in the past but a new system was put in place whereby councillors receive a salary to attend the 40 to 60 meetings held in their constituencies each month.  Some councillors are obliged to attend every one of those meetings.  A number of them attend 50 meetings per month and only receive payment for attending 30 meetings.  A quota system was introduced by a former Fianna Fáil Minister in this regard which should be increased in some local authority areas.  The Minister should take this into account when considering the overall situation.</P>
    <P>The draft proposal submitted to the Department of the Environment provides a suggested breakdown on how a pension scheme should be introduced.  The General Council of County Councils proposes that 25 per cent of the contribution should be paid by councillors, 25 per cent by local authorities and the remaining 50 per cent should come from central funds.  In addition, there must be an age requirement in respect of when a person should be entitled to draw his or her pension.</P>
    <P>There is good reason for the introduction of a pension based on the amount of work they do and the number of hours they work.  If they were paid per hour worked, no system would be able to pay them enough.  If one adds up the hours they work in a week, it would total in the region of 40 to 60.  Some councillors work continuously. They finish their day job and then attend council or committee meetings.  They must find people to replace them in their workplaces, whether they are farmers, publicans, teachers, etc.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, a pension would be a small reward for the amount of work they do for society.  They are social workers in their own right.  They advise groups on how to get schemes for their towns or villages, organise grants and so forth.  They improve the appearances of towns and villages in conjunction with local development associations and other active community groups.  Councillors are at the beck and call of the groups and try to meet their needs.  They also take care of a great deal of work for local Deputies and Senators and bring various problems to their attention.</P>
    <P>They do not get a penny for attending such meetings.  The Department of the Environment should look at their case and implement a pension scheme for councillors.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Kiely for raising this matter and I welcome the opportunity to place on record the Government's recognition of the enormous contribution of councillors to our local government system and the measures taken by the Government to support councillors and to enhance their role.  Aganist that background, I will deal with the question of a pension scheme for councillors.</P>
      <P>One of the first things the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, did on entering office was to carry out an indepth review of the system of expenses for councillors.  As a result, a number of improvements was notified to local authorities in August 1995.  A key change was the automatic linkage of alterations in councillors' travel and subsistence rates to those for senior local authority officers.  Another significant change was a relaxation in the threshold for attendance at meetings in order to qualify for the full allowance.</P>
      <P>In the case of regional authorities an allowance for the Cathaoirleach was introduced to give proper recognition to the important role of this office.  A new independent system of funding based on contributions from local authorities is in operation for the local authority associations &mdash; the General Council of County Councils, the AMAI and LAMA.  The position of councillors who are members of the committee of the regions has also been improved through the provision of significant ongoing logistic and administrative support.</P>
      <P>These support measures, welcome though they are, are but one element of the Government's strategy to improve and strengthen the position of councillors in the local government system.  Fundamental to this strategy is the major programme for the renewal and reform of local government entitled <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change</i> which was published by the Minister for the Environment in December 1996.  The enhancement of the role of councillor is central to the programme. Implementation of the programme will result in councillors being more meaningfully involved and better equipped in fulfilling their policy role.  This will be achieved by a radical overhaul of the local authority committee system with the establishment of strategic policy committees mirroring the major functions. The new system will provide the necessary support and improved information and training for councillors.  A working group, on which councillors are represented, is currently developing the detailed arrangements for implementation of this new committee system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Council of County Councils has, as Senator Kiely said, made a submission to the Minister for the Environment on a pension <Col N="715" /> scheme for councillors.  The submission is being examined by the Department and the Department of Finance, but it would be wrong to anticipate the result of the review.  However, I should make it clear that this is not a simple issue, and I am sure the general council appreciates this. There are practical difficulties involved, not least the fact that councillors' allowances constitute an expenses system rather than a salary or remuneration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> I listened carefully to the Senator and will pass on his views to the Minister for the Environment. I reiterate, however, that this Government has a record second to none in furthering and promoting the role of our councillors in the local government system.  We will continue to do so with the implementation of the reform programme &mdash; Better Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 May 1997.</P>
