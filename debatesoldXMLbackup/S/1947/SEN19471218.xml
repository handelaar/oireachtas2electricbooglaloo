      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask, with regard to this rather elaborate programme put before us in the week before Christmas, how much of it is urgent and how much of it it is desired to pass before the dissolution?  We have got no information on that question.  There have been no consultations on it.  Perhaps we might have that information in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister for Local Government is anxious to have the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Bill, the Local Elections Bill and all the other Bills in which he is concerned, passed before the recess.  If there is a suggestion of a conference or a talk in the matter, I would suggest that we should adjourn any decision on it until later in the sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the other Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a very great advantage if there could be a talk in regard to the matter, so that we could decide what Bills we should take before the recess.  The time at our disposal could be better apportioned from that point of view.  If the matter could be taken up later it might be possible to have a definite decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to be told where I am, because I know where I am.  I am utterly unaffected by any of these desires to pass certain measures speedily and to subject them only to a cursory examination.  I am going to examine these measures and to give them the consideration they <Col N="1766" /> merit quite apart from any consideration as to the approach of Christmas or of an election.  I think that is the responsibility of the House and we should not allow any question of urgency to influence us in rushing the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Senator Sir John Keane's stand as a new, all-sacrificing son of Cathleen Ní Houlihan, but there are certain factors which have to be considered.  The approach of Christmas is one of these factors; the approach of a general election is another.  The third fact is that the responsibility of a person here with some group behind him and some leadership is greater than Senator Sir John Keane's responsibility.  I feel it is impossible, in the circumstances, before the recess&mdash;that is, before to-night&mdash;to give adequate consideration to the Bills here in the name of the Minister for Local Government. Everybody who knows what adequate consideration means knows that.  There is no use in telling us, as we were told by Senator Hawkins, sitting in the seat of the leader, but not being leader, that he would sit through Christmas. We cannot all sit through Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>And he does not want to sit through Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I never made any reference as to how long we should sit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Senator said we should sit next week but I waive that.  What we really want to get clear about is this: It clearly is not possible to give adequate consideration to all these Bills before the recess.  That is not possible and, in the atmosphere of a general election, it is not possible to give them that consideration after the recess either.  The Dáil passed these Bills rapidly, but I am against passing Bills rapidly.  I do not think anybody in this House has done as much to keep Bills from being passed rapidly as I have.  People find fault with me for that, but, in the present situation, I should like to face what are the real facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have a consultation, we will have to have it before the Minister <Col N="1767" /> for Local Government is let loose upon the House.  If he is let loose upon the House he is the greatest obstructionist in the two Houses combined and the business could not possibly be concluded with the Minister performing publicly.  Therefore, I suggest we will have to have some kind of scheme in regard to this.  I am quite frank.  I do not want to pretend that I am able to give adequate consideration to these Bills before the recess or, indeed, after the recess, when our minds will be on something else.  There are some of the Bills which are completely new.  The Garda Síochána (Acquisition of Sites and Retention of Premises) Bill has a completely new principle, a very vicious principle, against which I would like to make a protest.</P>
    <P>As regards the proper consideration of these Bills in Committee, it is not possible and we may as well face that and see precisely what we will do about it.  The suggestion for a meeting of the Seanad a week after Christmas is not feasible in the light of the printing and the staff.  It cannot be done. Again, there is no use in meeting to-morrow if we cannot conclude the business.  I do not want to make heroic offerings; I merely want to face facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to these consultations, I suggest there are certain obligations on the House which obviously the House must discharge. There were a number of Bills passed in the Dáil and these Bills will become law automatically whether we like it or not.  There is no use in Senator Hayes shaking his head&mdash;that is the fact.  The Bills passed in the Dáil become law in a specified time and we cannot do anything about it.  It all depends on the attitude of mind.  If Senator Hayes or Senator Douglas want to prevent the House doing its business, that is one thing.  I suggest the House cannot allow that type of mentality to prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Senator mean when he says that we want to <Col N="1768" /> prevent the House doing its business? That is a new rôle for Senator Hayes and Senator Douglas, surely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Hayes has concluded, I might be permitted to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>And explain, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not called upon to explain to anybody; I am not called upon to make any explanation at all. I suggest that there is business to be done and it is the duty of the House to discharge this business.  There must be a reasonable time allowed for the conduct of the business referred to the House.  My view is that the business ordered for this week can be concluded by to-morrow.  It is not suggested, I imagine, that the Committee Stage will be taken in the case of a Bill which will be read a Second Time to-day or tomorrow&mdash;it is not suggested that the Committee Stage should be taken without a reasonable interval.  My suggestion is that the interval should be two or three weeks.  That would take us over the Christmas holidays&mdash;let us say, 7th January.  Is there any reason why we cannot come back on the 7th January and conclude the business by the 8th January?  There is, of course, a mentality in the House that we cannot be permitted to insert amendments in Bills.  If that mentality has any official backing in this House, we might as well close down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!  That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally against that, but the remedy that Senator Hayes suggests is not the real remedy.  The remedy is to come here and Senators should insist on saying in relation to a Bill what they think it necessary to say and submit such amendments as they think are called for in the circumstances. Let those who are of opinion that no amendment must be inserted if it means calling back the Dáil, take the responsibility for that action.  I think the public will know how to deal with that state of mind that says because the Government are in a hurry with the election there can <Col N="1769" /> be no amendment of any Bill, good or bad.  That is intolerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did Senator Duffy get that idea?</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Health Services (Financial Provisions)" RHead="Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage">
    <Title>Health Services (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was in the Seanad with the Health Bill before the Summer Recess some Senators expressed a certain amount of anxiety with regard to the financial provisions and they asked me who would pay for all these new services. I told the Seanad on one of the later stages that the idea was that local authorities would not have to pay more for health services for some time to come than they had been paying in the past and whatever increase there might be on the health services by each local authority, it would be paid by the State until we would reach the stage that the State was paying 50 per cent.  And the local authority 50 per cent.; from that onwards we would pay on the basis of half and half.</P>
      <P>That is what is embodied in this Bill.  As a matter of fact, this Bill is brought in to implement that idea.  I should make it clear, as I did point out at the time to the Seanad, that in calculating what the health expenditure is we do not take capital expenditure into account: it is only the current expenditure on health services. So far as capital expenditure is concerned, the greater part will be financed from sources other than the local authority.  The usual method at the moment of financing capital expenditure is to get 75 per cent. from the Hospitals' Trust Fund and 25 per cent. is put up by the local authority, raised by way of loan and afterwards paid back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provisions of this Bill, they have been explained in a <Col N="1770" /> memorandum which was circulated, because there is a good lot of what is known as legislation by reference. The rather difficult sections in the Bill have been explained in the memorandum. In order to implement the system I have mentioned there is a standard expenditure.  The standard expenditure will be determined for each local authority and that will be taken as the amount that the local authority will have to contribute for some years to come.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the State will pay whatever expenditure there is over and above the standard expenditure. Up to this there have been various State grants payable to local authorities for various specific purposes. It is proposed to abolish this and to make the financing very simple by having a lump sum paid over by the State each year to the local authority. Sections 5 to 8 deal with these State grants.  These State grants have been growing over a long number of years and have been growing haphazardly. The licence duty grant was brought in in 1898 under the Local Government (Ireland) Act and that is devoted by the local authority to the payment of certain salaries and for the upkeep of inmates of mental hospitals.  There is an estate duty grant which was introduced in 1888 for some of the public assistance services.</P>
    <P>In more recent times grants were brought in: for instance, the free milk grant, maternity and child welfare grant, grants in respect of school medical services, tuberculosis and venereal diseases.  Instead of having all these various grants brought into the accounts in each year, they are all being abolished and there is one simple amount being paid over which will, at any rate, save a great deal of clerical work and a great deal of calculation both by the local authority and by the State authority.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the estate duty grant will no longer pass through the Guarantee Fund.  It was part of the Guarantee Fund, which Senators know was a fund to guarantee the State against loss through the collection of annuities.  This will not mean <Col N="1771" /> a very big reduction in the Guarantee Fund, because it only amounts to about £150,000 in the year, whereas the agricultural grant is about £1,870,000, and reducing a fund of £1,870,000 each year by £150,000 will make very little difference.  It is only used as a guarantee to the State that the annuities will be collected.  At the present time health services are costing something over £5,000,000 per year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean central and local expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Of that amount the local authority is paying 84 per cent., and the State 16 per cent.  The purpose of this Bill is to see that the State contributes all the additional expenditure until we are in the position that the local authorities are paying 50 per cent., and the State is paying 50 per cent., and then they will remain at that percentage from that on.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with finance only and it is the only point in the White Paper that is implemented.  There are many other points in the White Paper which was issued which will come up for discussion later on.  This is for finance only.</P>
      <P>There will be a gradual increase in health services.  It is very difficult indeed to give any sort of estimate but possibly at the end of another two years there will be another £750,000 spent on health services so that the Estimate that is brought in by the Department of Health each year will show an increasing amount and it is expected that if the development of the health services proceeds as we anticipate, we may be spending, between the local authority and the State, between £9,000,000 and £10,000,000 at the end of nine or ten years.  The Estimate, of course, will appear each year and members of both Houses will have an opportunity of watching the progress of expenditure, at any rate, by reference to the Book of Estimates each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is necessary because the local authority is now preparing its estimate for the coming year.  There are extended health services coming in next year and it is well to tell the <Col N="1772" /> local authority that in budgeting for the coming year they need only provide what they spent last year even though they intend to extend the health services. I am, therefore, bringing this Bill before the Seanad and explaining to the Seanad that the Bill is urgent in that respect, that it should become law if at all possible before the end of the financial year, in fact, as soon as possible, so that the local authority may make its estimate for the coming year.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be acceptable to the Seanad and, in view of what I heard some Senators say here before my Bill was taken, I hope Senators will give me some amendments that may improve the Bill, and I will be quite happy to consider them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity the Minister for Health would not be allowed to coax the Seanad.  He would meet with a certain amount of success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>He would get his Bills through more rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>He would get his Bills through more rapidly and he would avoid amendments more easily, which possibly is his real object.  However, this Bill, as the Minister has explained, carries out certain of the financial provisions which are necessary in view of certain provisions of the Health Bill and certain promises made by the Minister with regard to the onus which would fall upon local authorities and, while there were certain things in the Health Bill to which objections were taken and which objections were very clearly stated then, this Bill, in itself, as the Minister has very clearly explained, is absolutely necessary to carry out the Health Bill and, as such, the Health Bill being law, I think there can be no objection to it.  I think the House should certainly pass the Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has taken this step.  I am glad that he has taken it in the particular way in which it has been taken.  Local authorities have become so accustomed to find that every grant that comes means an increase in the rates that it will be a really new experience to have <Col N="1773" /> a grant made available which will not mean an increase in the rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister says we will spend £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 on our health services in about ten years' time.  He says we are spending £5,000,000 at present, of which 84 per cent. is provided out of local taxation and 16 per cent. from the Central Fund.  The Minister should try to prevail on the Government to adopt the policy which he will pursue in regard to our health services in other local services and strike a fairer balance between the responsibility of the State and the responsibility of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two points on which I would like to have an answer from the Minister.  How will this money be disbursed?  What method will be adopted?  Will the advice of the health council be sought by the Minister with regard to the expenditure of this money?  It is only the Minister and his Department who can have any knowledge as to the comparative conditions of health services in the various counties.  Obviously, some counties are more backward than others in this respect.  Some counties have spent a considerable amount of money out of their own resources in raising health services.  It will be rather worrying to some of these counties who, so to speak, have borne the burden of the day, if they find themselves in the position that because their health services are tolerably advanced in comparison with others, there must be a stay on the development of their services until others are brought up to their standards. It would be very undesirable that that should be the case.  I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that counties that for a number of years have had a reasonably progressive policy, will get the assistance of these grants and will be helped to develop at the same pace at which they have been developing over a number of years.  County Cavan was one of the first counties to start building up its county health services by the appointment of a county medical officer and doing what it could with regard to its institutions, such as hospitals. <Col N="1774" /> A great deal of money has been spent there over a number of years.</P>
    <P>It is of importance to have some indication from the Minister as to the method or policy that will be adopted in regard to the disbursement of these grants and the standard by which it will be determined what is to go to the various counties.  Generally, the step the Minister is taking will be heartily welcomed and I am sure he will get all the co-operation that is necessary to ensure that the money spent will be beneficial to the health of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the intention in this Bill is to simplify the administration of grants from the central authority, it has my entire approval.  I could never understand why that complication should have lasted so long.  Since I have been in public life, everybody has been complaining of the terribly tangled way in which these grants are mixed up.  They are mixed up with estate duties and at one time were mixed up with the liquor duties.  Now, sensibly and apparently without any difficulty, the whole thing has been cleared up.  So far so good.</P>
      <P>I also welcome this arrangement whereby no further increase is going to be put on the local rates and under which the amount of the contribution from the central authority towards health services is to equal the amount now paid from the local rates.  I should like, in connection with this finance and arising out of the White Paper, to ask for some information.  The White Paper is very enigmatic on the finances of the voluntary hospitals.  We are told that a capital of some £9,000,000, now held by the sweep trustees, is going to be used for the purpose of rebuilding.  If it is going to be used for that purpose, the capital source under which the hospital deficits are now being met will disappear.  Is it the intention of the Minister to meet those deficits, as long as they continue, out of State grants?  In fact, are hospital deficits to be recognised as health services?  It is important to be told that, as the hospitals are, at present, in doubt with regard to their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another provision in this <Col N="1775" /> Bill which I may not understand and which creates in my mind no little alarm.  I am exceedingly surprised that no reference is made to it in the explanatory memorandum nor was there any reference to it in the speech of the Minister or in the speeches of those who have already spoken.  I would not like to say that the Minister deliberately abstained from making any reference to the section.  Since he did not, I shall do so now.  I refer to Section 2.  I ask Senators to examine that section.  It is provided in sub-section (1) that the Minister shall, as soon as may be, after the 1st April declare that such health services as he thinks proper shall be recognised health services.  Under sub-section (2) the Minister may from time to time declare that any health service which is not then a recognised health service shall be a recognised health service, while under sub-section (3), the Minister may from time to time declare that any health service which is then a recognised health service shall cease to be a recognised health service. Senators will see, therefore, that the Minister is taking power to create or abolish health services according to his own free will.  That seems to me to be a most astounding proposition.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act, which was passed last summer, a number of health services are included with a considerable amount of elaboration.  The working of those services is to be subject to regulation&mdash;maternity and child welfare services, the treatment of infectious diseases, services with regard to food and drugs, etc.  In spite of that, the Minister under Section 2 of this Bill is, according to my reading of it, going to supersede all those services. He is taking power to declare that any one of them is not a recognised health service.  I take it, too, that he can discriminate and say to one local authority, &ldquo;I do not recognise your health service&rdquo; or that he can say to one hospital, &ldquo;I only recognise your health service.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be a most astounding proposition.  It is very arbitrary power for a Minister to take in a measure which purports to deal only with financial policy.  I do <Col N="1776" /> not think he should get such complete, overriding power&mdash;power of a dictatorial character to say what is or what is not a health service.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this section requires to be most carefully examined.  I think that no such power should be taken by the Minister without a statutory obligation being placed on him to consult with the consultative council set up under the Health Act, and also to consult the local authorities concerned.  I certainly shall seek to have the section amended on the lines that I have indicated unless the Minister can assure me that I have struck a mare's nest which, as far as I can see, I have not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if I understood exactly what Senator Baxter wanted to get at.  I would like to point out that all the health services that we are dealing with here, leaving out the voluntary hospitals which we are not concerned with in this Bill, are administered by the local authorities. Therefore, as far as the expenditure on them goes, the local authority takes the initiative.  Senators know that in connection with many of the services the local authority must get the sanction of the Minister before they incur certain expenditure.  At any rate, that is how it works out.  The point that Senator Baxter made was a point that indeed gave me some cause for thought too; that in this scheme which we are bringing in now, we are, as it were, saying to each county: &ldquo;What you are spending now is the standard expenditure and you will not be asked to spend any more&rdquo;.  As Senator Baxter has said, it is possible that one county may be more progressive than another and so it will for all time practically&mdash;until it comes to the 50 per cent.&mdash;be spending more than the county not so progressive. When I went to examine the matter I found that, generally speaking, all the rural areas were much the same.  The urban areas, it is true, are more progressive.  In a number of the urban areas they have developed mother and child welfare services.  A number of the urban areas have also developed a venereal disease service and a few <Col N="1777" /> other services of that kind.  I think we must admit that a service like the mother and child welfare service would be more expensive in the country than in the town, and that we are not too unfair in saying to the towns: &ldquo;Well, now, you have done a certain amount for this service and we are tying you to that&rdquo;; and to the country, which is doing less: &ldquo;We are tying you to that&rdquo;.  We are also going to help the country more than the town.  We are not, I think, doing a great injustice either to the rural or the urban areas if we adopt that kind of plan.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane talked about the White Paper being somewhat enigmatic so far as the voluntary hospitals are concerned.  We do not mean to be enigmatic.  I should say, of course, that a White Paper is not too specific on many things as a rule because, generally, it is designed to be an outline of policy&mdash;to invite comments and criticism so that the Government may know what the general opinion is on a scheme before they go farther with it. With regard to the money, the £9,000,000 that is there now will be spent on buildings as soon as we can get on with a building programme.  We have a number of big propositions on hand at the moment.  Some have reached the stage where contracts are to be invited and some are not so advanced.  I should say, with regard to all the schemes that are before the Department, they will be quite sufficient to absorb the whole of this £9,000,000&mdash;that is before they are completed. That, of course, will take a few years.  It is hoped that we will have more money coming in, but, if by any chance the money did not come in, so far as I can see, the State would have to step in and do it somehow, because the hospitals must be built, whether sweepstake money is available or not. So long as the sweepstake money is there, however, we can draw upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to deficits, we are covering these deficits year after year.  They are rather disturbing, I must say, in this way, that some hospitals have consistently a very much higher deficit than others, and it is not easy to see what the explanation is.  It is a matter <Col N="1778" /> which must be examined so as to find out what would be a fair and reasonable system to adopt with regard to these deficits for the future.  There is no doubt that the deficits must be met from somewhere because we must see to it that our voluntary hospitals carry on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the health services which the Senator mentioned, it is not easy to put down all the health services. We can, of course, say straight away and even embody in the Bill that all services covered by the Health Act of 1947, mother and child, infectious disease and the cost of institutional services are included, and also the services of local authorities to which grants are payable by the Health Department, mental treatment services, because these also are dealt with by the Health Department as well and that part of the public assistance service which deals with medical treatment. The difficulty, however, is that the Health Department itself has not yet settled down.  Some services are still coming over and some going away. Senators will probably find within a few days that the Health Department will be making an Order handing over certain services to the Department of Agriculture.  At the same time, other services are coming over from Local Government, and until we settle down properly and know what exactly are the services of the Health Department, it would be very difficult to make a list of the services.</P>
    <P>Take as one example the school meals service.  Three or four Departments spent a long time debating what Department that service should go to. Some feel that it should go to Education; some feel that it should go to Social Welfare, while others feel that it should go to the Health Department. In all probability, I think it will go to the Health Department, but questions like that will arise and it would be difficult at the moment to give a list until these matters have been settled. It might happen that, in a year's time, some other service might come over, and sub-section (2) is necessary from that point of view to enable the list to be amended.  Some service might also <Col N="1779" /> go away from the Health Department to some other Department, and I, therefore, ask the Senator to be patient until we see where we stand with regard to health services in general.</P>
    <P>I do not think any injustice can be done.  We do not do much injustice to a local authority, either by leaving a service out and saying it is excluded, or putting a service in and saying it is included, and there is no inducement to a Minister watching finance from a central point of view to leave a service out or to put a service in.  It would be well, therefore, to let the matter stand, for some time, at any rate, until we see what the Health Department will be dealing with.</P>

      <P>A number of points were raised on this section yesterday and I should like to hear the Minister's views. I think there are considerable difficulties in the section which are not really appreciated and which will perhaps only reveal themselves fully when the Department comes to operate the measure.  It is important that those of us who see certain difficulties should have a clarification from the Minister. So far as I can see, it will be a very unsatisfactory section.  The whole principle embodied in it will work very unsatisfactorily from every angle and will create a position in which some of the nominating bodies will be very unhappy when the election is over, and in which they will find that, though they are supposed to get the opportunity to have a voice representing them in the Seanad, they are in fact locked out by the construction of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel unusually flattered by learning that Senator Baxter is anxious that I should address the Seanad again on this section.  I have <Col N="1780" /> spoken on the section twice at some length already, and have, I think, spoken much longer than most members of the Seanad would feel that the occasion required, because this is not a novel proposition.  The proposal here is one which is already embodied in legislation governing election to this House.  In the Act of 1940 there is a provision exactly similar to this, the only difference being that in the case of that Act the nomination committee was to be composed of three members delegated, sent or selected by the nominating bodies.  They were to meet and to select three names to go, not before the electorate proposed in the Bill but to the Taoiseach, to enable the Taoiseach to make his personal selection from these three names of the person who was to fill a casual vacancy in the House.  There is nothing novel about that.  The members of the Seanad must be perfectly well aware of how that has operated in the past. It is not proposed to make any significant change, and I do not think it is necessary for me to detain the Seanad any longer by expounding for the third time the full implications of this section.</P>

      <P>Certain of the provisions covered in the last section, this section and the following section, include provisions with which I made it clear on the Second Stage I was in disagreement. My discussing them now, to make them as good as they can be, does not imply that I am in favour of them.  Section 22 (7) is completely beyond me and does not seem to make sense at all.  There is something mysterious there which the Minister would regard as simple, or there has been an error.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The second and any subsequent appointment .... shall be made at an annual meeting .... and the day appointed ... shall be not less than 400 days and not less than 330 days <Col N="1781" /> after the day on which the appointment is made.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Sub-section (7) says, further, that the body shall, at the meeting at which it appoints its representatives, fix the date of the next annual meeting.  What happens if it changes the date afterwards? That is not uncommon, as it is often found a year later that it is not possible to hold the annual meeting on the date chosen, and most of these bodies have a means of changing it. Would that invalidate the next nomination?</P>

      <P>I am anxious to know what is meant in sub-section (5) by the expression &ldquo;an annual meeting&rdquo;.  I wonder whether, in the case of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, what is contemplated here is a meeting of all the members.  If that is so, a body like the Irish National Teachers' Organisation could not undertake the obligation to call all its members to an annual meeting specifically for the purpose of making an appointment of members to a nomination committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator would refer back to Section 8, he will see that, among the criteria according to which the returning officer is to satisfy himself as to whether a body should be entered on the register of nominating bodies, is a provision that its organisation and direction are governed by articles of association, rules or other regulations which provide for an annual general meeting.  It is that annual meeting to which reference is made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point of some importance.  Section 8 says it is an <Col N="1783" /> annual general meeting to which all members are invited.  That is a criterion for the purpose of the returning officer, but once a body is on the register an annual meeting means an annual meeting within the rules of the body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But the register is subject to revision each year and the returning officer must satisfy himself that they are entitled to be on it every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection of that was that we were told, if not by the Minister, by someone else, that the clerk can refuse on those grounds, but that he is not obliged to, and if he is not obliged to, you will find that the annual meeting is not one to which all the members are invited and that the annual meeting is not an annual meeting at all of the particular body involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to follow the argument in relation to Section 8. I am raising the question in relation to the appointment of members of nominating bodies to serve on the nominating committee and it seems to me a somewhat different thing.  What seems to be called for here is an annual meeting of the members of the nominating body, a meeting specially summoned in order to appoint its members on the nominating committee. If that is so, I want one point cleared up.  Does it mean, in the case of the National Teachers' Organisation, for instance, that its 12,000 members must be called for the purpose of appointing five members on the nominating committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the organisation.  I have known many private limited companies where only some shareholders were called to the annual meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, what does it matter what the custom is? The Oireachtas is prescribing rules and anybody who wants to enjoy the privilege of proposing members to the Seanad will have to conform to those rules.  If the rules of an organisation do not happen to conform with our regulations, they will have to fall into conformity, and it does not matter whether they have 12,000 members or not; they will have to summon all those 12,000 members to the annual meeting.  Many may not choose to attend, but anyone who takes sufficient interest in securing representation for their vocation or occupation in this Chamber will undoubtedly attend and have a voice in electing a representative. One of the results may be to break up the caucuses which control these organisations and we may get proposals for nominations from these bodies based on a much more democratic procedure than hitherto and I suggest that that is what we all want. We want to ensure that it is the body of national teachers in the country as a whole, and not the officers of that organisation, who will be making nominations for this House.  And it is similar with any other organisation of the same description.  The Oireachtas makes the law and prescribes the rules and those who want to comply with the law must keep those rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I raised is now clear.  The Minister has made it perfectly clear that this House is entitled to make a law prescribing certain rules in relation to annual meetings of nominating bodies.  Nobody challenges that.  The only question with which I was concerned was the meaning of Section 22, and now, since I know the meaning, I may say that it is one of the most insane proposals made in this House for a long time.  It is proposed that there will be a democratic appointment of five persons to serve on a nominating committee.  To do that an organisation with 12,000 members will be obliged to call all its members&mdash;<Col N="1785" /> some of whom do not live within its jurisdiction&mdash;to a public meeting in Croke Park in order to elect five members on a nominating committee, a body which may never even meet.  To say that this is democratic is absurd. What is a true expression of democracy, however, is that in the teachers' organisation the individual members in a county or a part of a county meet annually and appoint delegates from that local area to attend the annual congress of the teachers' organisation which occupies the whole of Easter week.  That is the most democratic form of organisation one can expect, and, in fact, it is much more democratic than, for instance, the mass meetings held in Beresford Place.  The delegates attend the annual meeting with an agenda which has been circulated in advance and considered by the rank and file of the members of the local branch.  After consideration the delegates are instructed by the local members how to vote and what they are to do in relation to each item on the agenda.  But in order to have the privilege of being a nominating body for the purpose of the Seanad they must alter their rules to provide for an annual meeting, a mass meeting. If anybody knows anything about the conduct of mass meetings, they must agree that that proposal is utterly unworkable and that no large organisation can possibly comply with regulations of that kind.  It seems to me that the section was drafted with an eye on organisations like the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society, a body of 120 or 100 members, all residing in or near Dublin, or whose members outside Dublin are professional people, university professors and others, who find it desirable to attend meetings in Dublin because they have the means and the facilities.  Can anybody imagine an organisation like the Irish National Teachers' Organisation bringing 12,000 members from Antrim, Kerry, Cork and Galway to Dublin in order to elect five members on a nominating committee that may never meet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the proposals of the section, to take out the section and to relate it to the facts.  If&mdash;as it seems to me&mdash;he <Col N="1786" /> wants to get rid of these bodies, all right, because he is getting rid of them whether he likes it or not as they will not comply with regulations which to them are absurd and which confer no advantage.  For let me make this clear, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation derives no advantage whatever from the fact that it is a nominating body, and particularly there is no advantage in electing five people to serve on a nominating committee which may not meet even once in 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister's interpretation is correct, there is no doubt that Senator Duffy is right and that this proposal is grotesque and completely unworkable.  There has been a lot of talk of the Teachers' Organisation, but there are far bigger organisations than that.  How does he expect to get a general meeting of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society which has over 100,000 members?  There are 60,000 members in the Beet Growers' Association.  What are you going to do with them?  Even the Creamery Managers' Organisation is a nominating body.  There is a very considerable number of them.  Is this whole vocational organisation going to be permeated with a fever of political unrest because thousands and thousands have to be collected to nominate five people&mdash;to come to a gathering to vote and, when they come, they are outvoted and they will have no nominee at all on the particular panel to which they have a right to make a nomination?  There is a saying in the country that a thing is &ldquo;as clear as mud.&rdquo;  I consider that the Minister's explanation is as clear as mud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the view that the Minister's interpretation is necessarily correct.  I cannot find any such description of an annual meeting in Section 22.  It is so described in Section 8, but Section 8 is only an indication and, according to the Minister, is not obligatory on any officer of the presiding bodies.  Therefore, it seems to me that it will entirely depend on the particular body. The interpretation placed on it by the Minister and by Senator Duffy does not <Col N="1787" /> seem to be in the section as it stands. It says &ldquo;annual meeting&rdquo;, but if it is in it, it will be because of other rules outside any in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Either Senator Duffy and Senator Baxter and I are right or Senator Douglas is right.  It does not, however, matter at this stage who is right, because if my interpretation is incorrect, I am prepared to admit that there is a case to be met in the circumstances to which Senator Duffy and Senator Baxter have referred.  In that event, a simple amendment of this section after the next election will dispose of the matter.</P>

I said that this is not only a long measure, but a very complicated measure which the Minister clearly does not understand and which he should have made temporary, because he cannot amend it at this stage.

      <P>&ldquo;Where the first appointment by a nominating body of members of a nomination committee is made at an annual meeting of the body, the body shall at that meeting appoint the day for its next annual meeting....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am connected with a number of bodies, and I know that it is a matter for consideration several times during the year to select a convenient date.

I <Col N="1788" /> think we must realise in this connection that one of the duties of the elected registration officer for the purposes of this Act will be to satisfy himself that the bodies are in a position to fulfil the requirements of the Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely these organisations, if they are at all worthy of being nominating bodies, are getting themselves into that position by virtue of the fact that they are doing work of much greater importance than anything under the operations of this Act.  Take, for instance, the Beet Growers' Association, the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, or the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  It is because they are doing much more essential work for the community that they are entitled to make a claim to be a nominating body.  If their work is satisfactory to their members, who are we to come now to outline their rules for them?  If they function and operate under rules which are satisfactory to themselves and to their members&mdash;as they have been doing for years and years without any necessity to amend or alter them except in so far as they regard it necessary now and again for the purposes of their own business or work&mdash;why can we not accept the procedure under which they have functioned to date for the purposes of this Act rather than impose altogether new conditions?  I cannot understand it and I am certain that they will not understand it and, in all probability, they will not bother their heads about coming under the Act at all.</P>

      <P>After all, the members of the joint committee did give a great deal of attention to this matter.  As we know, there were stricter proposals before the committee and they were altered.  Compromises were arrived at which were embodied in the phraseology in this section.  I can, like a number of Senators, understand that a great number of things can happen in regard to the registration of nominating bodies.  For instance, the Beet Growers' Association could be dealt with by making the standing committee or the executive of the Beet Growers' Association a nominating body for the purposes of this Act, but that does not mean that the body as one unit should become a nominating body.  The executive of the live-stock industry could be made a nominating body.  As a matter of fact, all the complications which have been introduced were introduced because Senators refused to face the fundamental position which is that the duty will rest on the Clerk of the Seanad, as registration officer, to ensure that those who appear on the register of nominating bodies are competent to discharge the duties and fulfil the functions contemplated by this Bill.</P>

I was a member of the joint committee and I may say that a joint committee on any subject simply makes recommendations.  If the Minister brings in a Bill it is his plain duty to see that it is properly drafted and workable.  It is his duty to examine the proposals of the joint committee with greater care and attention than any joint committee can in the nature of things devote to such proposals. Any joint committee merely puts them up in a general way.  The Minister is quite wrong when he says that he is the agent of the joint committee and I am sure that he does not regard himself as such.  It is something which he does not seem to understand.</P>

      <P>I would not like to give an opinion on the question as to the possibility of litigation, but there is no doubt that the point made by Senator O'Dea is an extremely important one.  It goes back to Section 8, while definitely relating itself to Section 22.  If &ldquo;may&rdquo; may mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo;&mdash; as I am inclined to think it does in Section 8&mdash;then you have put in rules which, in my personal opinion, bring about the position that there is not one body at present on the register that complies strictly with every rule. When I raised that point, I was assured by the Minister and Senator Hearne that it only meant &ldquo;may&rdquo; and that, in fact, the new Seanad returning officer, when appointed, would not rule out anybody under those particular rules.  I dropped the matter then and left it at that.  Now, Senator O'Dea thinks that there is a danger that &ldquo;may&rdquo; may mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I think myself there is.  As far as this particular section is concerned, there is <Col N="1791" /> nothing in the section that provides for those things unless the body has it actually in its own rules.  I am convinced of that.  If Senator O'Dea's point is a good one, and if you go back to Section 8, a body will not be on the register at all unless they have the rule that all members must attend. Senator O'Dea is quite right in suggesting that it would be better to take those words out.  But do not stop at those words.  Take out some of the other things that are more or less meaningless and which, for no good reason, would prevent a body from being registered.  Do not say that they must have in the rules that it must appear on the agenda that the minutes of the last meeting will be read.  You do not put in rules that the minutes of the last meeting will be read.  The minutes are read.  Sometimes they are read at a meeting of a committee or a board.  Do not make it obligatory.  If, as the Minister said, &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;may&rdquo; and it is not in any sense obligatory, then there is no need to amend it; it will work itself out.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with the four sub-sections of Section 22 which seem to be of vital importance to these bodies that expect to be nominating bodies&mdash;that is, sub-sections (4), (5), (6) and (7).  I have been looking at the section in an effort to see what we can do with it.  It seems to me that what is provided in these four sub-sections is merely machinery which could be <Col N="1792" /> dropped, leaving wide discretion, of course, to the Seanad returning officer, without prescribing the provisions set out here.  Everything that is vital to the section is covered in the remaining four sub-sections.  I would urge upon the Minister that he might consider introducing a simple amendment on the Report Stage for the purpose of dropping these four sub-sections.</P>

      <P>I indicated two or three bodies&mdash;two of them nominating bodies already.  Would the Minister point out whether, for instance, the executive committee of the standing committee is the Executive Committee of the Standing Committee of the Beet Growers' Association?  The Beet Growers' Association is somewhat different from the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  As far as I know every beet grower is a member.  The membership is rather different in the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society inasmuch as it is co-operative groups which are members.  Would the Minister point out whether under this section it is possible for the Executive Committee or the Standing Committee of the Best Growers' Association to nominate its nominating committee?  I cannot see how under the Bill as it stands there is any way open to an organisation like the Beet Growers' Association other than by calling together their 60,000 members.  If they do not do that, then the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and the creamery managers and the bloodstock breeders can go on protesting, bringing into being a perpetual controversy as to whether or not this particular committee has legitimately done its work.  Is that the situation with which we will find ourselves faced?  I think the Minister is humbugging the whole lot of us and humbugging the House and himself if he thinks he will get away with that.  No matter what he says about being the mouthpiece of the committee, surely the committee make no claim to infallibility.  No matter what claim they make the responsibility falls on us in the last analysis to ensure that this is workable. Would the Minister please answer that question and clarify that point for us?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;a member of a nomination committee ceasing to hold office as such member by reason of the expiration of the day before the day of an annual meeting of the nominating body which appointed him shall be eligible for reappointment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is the idea of having that sub-section there?  Surely, a member could be eligible for reappointment if he ceased to be a member because the nominating body which he represented ceased to be on the relevant panel and then, a year later, put on the panel. Surely, he could still be eligible for reelection. It seems to me that this sub-section is entirely unnecessary.  Surely, he is automatically eligible for re-election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I want to draw attention to the second last paragraph of sub-section (2).  This is the section which provides for the making of the Seanad General Election Order. Sub-section (2) provides that certain &ldquo;provisions shall have effect in relation to a Seanad General Election Order&rdquo;. One of those provisions set out in paragraph (c) is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The day appointed by the Order for the expiration of the time for Oireachtas nominations shall not be less than seven days after the day appointed by the Order for the expiration of the time for general panel nominations and, where practicable, shall be subsequent to the date fixed for the re-assembly of Dáil Éireann after such dissolution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there is clearly left in doubt the question whether the provisions of paragraph (c) shall apply before the re-assembly of Dáil Éireann after the general election.  If we believe in the Party system and if the Dáil, at any rate, is based on the Party system, there must obviously be time left after a general election for the members of each Party elected at that general election to meet and to form an opinion as to what proposals they will make as a Party under the provisions of this Bill.  If you leave the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; in this section, you leave it optional with the person making the Seanad General Election Order to fix the time limit, so that in fact the time may expire before the re-assembly of Dáil Éireann or before the Parties have an opportunity of meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a mistake in sub-section (2), paragraph (c), or, if it is not a mistake, I do not quite understand it.  The general reference is to &ldquo;general panel proposed nominations&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;general panel nominations&rdquo; seem to me to be intended to be the same as &ldquo;general <Col N="1795" /> panel proposed nominations&rdquo;.  If &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; is left out there, it might be taken to have a different meaning. It seems to me that, if possible, the date on which the nominations are received from nominating committees should be a few days earlier than the last date on which Dáil nominations can be received.  I think that is a point of some importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>There is some discrepancy between the phrase used in paragraph (2) (b) and the phrase used in paragraph (2) (c), but I do not think it is of great importance, because the Order is required to provide that the day appointed &ldquo;for the expiration of time for general panel proposed nominations shall not be less than four weeks after such dissolution and, where practicable, shall not be prior to the date fixed for the reassembly of Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and the day appointed by the Order &ldquo;for the expiration of the time for Oireachtas nominations shall not be less than seven days after the day appointed by the Order for the expiration of the time for general panel nominations and, where practicable, shall be subsequent to the date fixed for the reassembly of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.

      <P>Candidates for the Seanad from nominating bodies should be warned that they will have to submit themselves to three successive processes. In the first place, they will have to be selected by a nominating body as one of three and, in the second place, they will have to submit themselves to a body composed of nominees of the nominating bodies who will reduce the number of persons nominated by the nominated bodies to six by a simple process of voting.  In that process of voting, neither a person's knowledge nor experience will, presumably, outweigh other considerations. Having survived that particular process of a second election, they will then have to go to a general election by the members of the Dáil and Seanad and the county councils and the county boroughs.  In other words <Col N="1797" /> the process of simplifying and improving the method of election to the Seanad has resulted in&mdash;I will keep on repeating the words&mdash;this extremely complicated system by which a candidate from a nominating body has to survive three separate processes of election before he becomes a member of the Seanad.

      <P>I think there is conflict between the conditions in paragraph (c) at the top of page 25 and paragraph (m).  It is a question of whether the candidates are or are not entitled to be present at the counting of the votes.  Paragraph (c) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Seanad returning officer and his assistants and the persons named in the electoral roll constituted for the meeting under Section 33 of this Act, and no other person may be present at the meeting.&rdquo;</P>

I want to raise a different point with the Minister.  Under paragraph (g) the poll is compulsorily closed at the end of two hours.  I visualise it as quite within the realms of possibility that you might have 100 nominating bodies under this arrangement.  That is to say that this miniature election is going to take place with 300 people present.  By the time these people sign the roll, a considerable period will have elapsed.  Each one has got to sign a roll, get from the Seanad returning officer his ballot paper and it has got to be filled.  If you have as big a number as is conceivably possible, all the time is going to be occupied with these operations.  Quite clearly there should be a proper discretion in the returning officer to deal with the poll or a larger amount of time should be provided.  After the opening of the poll candidates must sign their names in the one book.  The opening of the poll does not take place after they sign their names.  The opening of the poll takes place before that.</P>

      <P>It is becoming more obvious as we go on that the Minister has no clear conception of what is in the Bill at all.  What I regret about the section most of all is the fact that we are going to import into a number of nominating bodies in the country a political atmosphere that has been hitherto absent.  Senator Hayes pointed out the way in which this section is going to operate.  Let us begin at the beginning.  You have, first of all, a nominating body.  Let us say that the executive of a nominating body will make a nomination.  The person nominated will have to submit himself to a further body made up of nominees of the nominating body before he finally reaches the list to be submitted to the eventual electors. What will be the attitude of the county councillors who are going to vote?  Is there not a political atmosphere imported into the county council in regard to the people upon whom they are going to pass judgment?  I think myself the whole thing is cockeyed and that it is going to play havoc in the internal affairs of our nominating <Col N="1799" /> bodies.  The Minister thinks that he is going to get a better Seanad, but I think he is reducing the whole thing to such ridicule that no decent man will be responsible for offering himself as a candidate.  You are importing into the nominating bodies a political atmosphere that has not obtained before.  The net result will be that this new method of election will cause disruption in many of these nominating bodies.</P>

      <P>I just want to say before we pass from the section that I think Senator Sweetman has misrepresented the section.  There is nothing to provide that the opening of the poll coincides with the opening of the meeting.  On the contrary, all these formalities have to be gone through before a ballot paper can be given out.  It is quite open to the returning officer not to give a ballot paper until every person has complied with the formalities provided.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;each member of the nomination committee attending the meeting shall, when or as soon as may be after he enters the meeting, sign his name in a book or other record (to be provided and kept by the Seanad returning officer) of attendances.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What is going to happen in this case?  Every member of the nomination committee is entitled to sit at the nomination committe during the whole of the proceedings.  I think the Minister will agree with that. Now the poll is only part of the proceedings. Unfortunately under paragraph (m) the Seanad returning officer is not entitled to announce the result to any member of the nomination committee then present who does not happen to be a candidate.  The paragraph says&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall announce such results to the candidates then present (if any)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are members of the nomination committee who may not be candidates. But members of the nomination committee, according to the Minister himself, are entitled to be there for the whole proceedings and the poll is only part of the proceedings.

I do not think there is anything like the ambiguity which Senators have found in this particular expression. It is quite clear that, if a person is a candidate and has been nominated from two sources, the question arises whether he will be put on one panel or the other.  If there happens to be a duplicate entry the returning officer shall give preference to the nomination of a person nominated by a nominating body.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>This section provides the electorate for the purpose of the election of a new Seanad.  I direct attention to the provisions of sub-section (2), which amount to this, that all the members of a dissolved county council would be electors for the purpose of the Act as if they were members of a functioning council. There is one exception to that rule, which is in Section 85.  Section 85 provides, in sub-section (4):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding Section 44 of this Act, a person shall not be a member of the electorate at a Seanad general election by reason only of the fact that he was a member of the council of the County of Dublin at any time before the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With the exception, therefore, of the members of the dissolved County Council of Dublin, all members of dissolved county councils are by this Act given the right to vote at the Seanad general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I know, at the moment there is one county council dissolved and its members, I take it, will be summoned from all parts of the globe to perform their functions under this Bill.  This, however, is not a temporary measure.  We disposed of that yesterday.  It is permanent legislation. So that, as years go by, we may find two, three, five county councils dissolved. That is not entirely unlikely. There was one period in which there were five county councils out of commission. Should it happen again, the <Col N="1805" /> members of those councils, some of whom may not have taken part in the business of a council for ten years, would be called upon to vote under this Bill in the election of members for the Seanad.  They would be in a rather unique position because, inasmuch as their council is dissolved, there is no likelihood that they will lose office as voters.  The members of a county council which is actively functioning will have to submit themselves to an election periodically.  The character and the personnel of the council may change and almost inevitably will change from time to time, but a dissolved county council will be in the unique position that, so long as it remains dissolved, its members will be permanent voters in Seanad elections, of course, unless they die.  I do not know if there is any other disqualification. I do not know whether a term of imprisonment or bankruptcy would interfere with the right of a member of a dissolved council to vote.  I am satisfied that once he dies his right to vote ceases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it that the disqualifications which apply to members of functioning county councils apply to them and I accept it that they cease to be electors but the fact that they do not seek re-election will not prevent them, at any rate, being electors for long periods of years.  The Dublin County Council, I think, has not met for upwards of ten years.  I agree that its members are not voters because of the provisions of Section 85, under this Bill, but, as time goes on, the Kerry County Council will be a long time out of commission.  It must be at least seven years since the last election took place in Kerry and it may be seven or eight years before another election takes place.  Broadly speaking, I think the principle of permitting members of a dissolved council to be voters for the purpose of a Seanad election is bad and I think that the provisions of Section 85 should apply to all councils which are dissolved and that sub-section <Col N="1806" /> (2) of Section 44 should be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Duffy's fears are unfounded.  There is no likelihood, under this Bill or under any other Act of the Oireachtas, that the members of a county council who have been removed from office will be permitted to remain members of the Seanad electorate in perpetuity.  You cannot, of course, read this Bill apart from other enactments on the Statute Book.  So far as the existing law is concerned, unless by special legislalation the Oireachtas determines otherwise, if the members of a local authority have been removed from office, an election must be held to reelect the members of that local authority within three years.  So that that is in fact the maximum period.  In the case of the Dublin County Council, to which the Senator has referred, there have been at least two Acts of the Oireachtas which have postponed the reconstitution of that body and the election of that body over the period to which the Senator has referred. They have been Acts designed to meet the special circumstances of County Dublin, arising out of the fact that a great deal of reorganisation has to be carried through before we are in a position to determine what the ultimate organisation of local government in Dublin City and County is going to be and how they are going to be coordinated with one another.</P>
      <P>There is a special problem, as everybody knows, in relation to County Dublin and, therefore, it has been in a special position, dealt with, as I have said, by no less than two Acts of the Oireachtas, and full cognisance of the fact that it is in a special position has been taken in this Bill, as the Senator knows, which provides that the former members of the Dublin County Council are disqualified from voting.  The position in relation to members of other county councils is quite different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dilemma with which the Minister for Local Government is faced is this: that he does not want to give any ground for the allegation that if he has to remove the members of a local authority from office because he thinks that their administration is not <Col N="1807" /> such as the interests of the ratepayers would require, he does not want to be impeded from doing that by the allegation that he is doing it for political motives in order to deprive the opponents of the Government of a certain number of votes in an election to the Seanad.  That is the reason why we decided that, even though the members of a local authority have been removed from office because they have not been functioning properly, nevertheless, we are allowing them to retain the right to vote in the election for the Seanad.  Now I can see that there is a great deal to be said against that, but I think the position has at least the overriding merit that no Minister for Local Government can endeavour to influence the result of a Seanad election by removing people from office.  The fact of the matter is that if he does remove them from office he will be likely to influence the election, undoubtedly indirectly, both against himself and against the Party which supports him, and for that reason this is in the nature, if you like, of a self-denying ordinance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which indicates the numbers to be elected on each panel.  I want to protest against the allocations.  I think the records of the House will show that a protest was also made on an occasion in the past when we had a somewhat similar scheme put before us.  The section makes provision for five members from the Cultural and Educational Panel, for 11 members from the Agricultural Panel, for 11 members from the Labour Panel, for nine members from the Industrial and Commercial Panel and for seven members from the Administrative Panel.  Senator Douglas and others have argued against the principle of making all county councillors a court of electors.  The whole construction of this section is very contradictory. It is true that the scales have been weighted, from the point of view of people with votes, in favour of the rural section of the community, but when you come to the distribution of the people who are to be elected from the various panels you find agriculture getting 11 members out of the whole House.  I do not assent to that distribution at all.  I think it bears no relation whatever to the importance of the agricultural community in the life of the nation.  I know, of course, it will be urged that some of the other panels will return agriculturists.  I suggest that not many such people will be returned from any of the other panels. Looking around this House one can see how large a part of the membership is drawn from sections in the community other than the agricultural section.  I <Col N="1810" /> think that the representation which is to be given to the agricultural industry under this Bill is unfair.  That applies not only to this Bill but to many other measures which make provision for the representation of various interests.</P>
      <P>If we consider the sort of people who could make a contribution to legislation, this House, I suggest, if considered from the vocational angle, is the place in which representatives of the agricultural industry could give the best service, but since agriculture is allotted only 11 out of a membership of 60, it is not possible to find a place for them.  It may be that one or two members who can claim to have a knowledge of, or to speak for, agriculture may get returned from the Administrative Panel, but taking the membership of the House as a whole, the representation is entirely titled towards interests other rather than agriculture. I think I hear the Minister talking in an undertone about Senator Quirke being a representative and about his being nominated on the Agricultural Panel.  That is so, but all the people whom you can elect on that panel number 11 people.  That may be the Minister's concept of what agriculture is entitled to in this House, but it is not mine.  If there is not more progress agriculturally in the country, it is due to the fact that agriculturists do not get sufficient chance to have their point of view put.  I am not finding fault with others getting a share of the representation, but it indicates the approach of the Minister and the Government to this problem.  From the countryman's angle, it is thoroughly unacceptable and I cannot permit the section to go through in its present form without making my protest.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Senator did not read the Constitution. Had he done so, he would have seen that the maximum representation to be allotted to any panel is 11 and that is the representation being given to the Agricultural Panel.  There are a lot of things I could say about some of the arguments the Senator used.  His main grievance always appears to be that the agricultural community chose others in preference to himself and his friends to represent them.  There are <Col N="1811" /> almost 80,000 people in Cavan who represent very strongly the agricultural interest and yet the Senator's Party could not secure one member of the Dáil there.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter should be fair.  He is attacking the Minister as if this proposal came from the Government.  This proposal is a recommendation of the joint committee on which were Senators Counihan, Duffy, Hayes, Hearne, McGuinness, Moore and O'Dea, as well as Senator Quirke, who replaced Senator McGuinness who died.  Why does not the Senator be fair and deal with this as coming from a united committee of both Houses and not as something controversial, from his point of view, coming from the Government?  When speaking earlier, I said that these recommendations came to the Government from the united committee and I said that unfortunately the Government seemed to adopt them all.  I personally do not agree with some of these recommendations, but the fact that they came unanimously from the joint committee carried such weight that the Government adopted the whole scheme.  They did not recommend any change in the representation <Col N="1812" /> for agriculture, and I refer not so much to representation for the agricultural community as to the so-called agricultural representatives in the Seanad, because there are members in the Seanad other than those like Senator Baxter who feel they have an interest in and represent agriculture.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter has tried to lead the House to believe that the representation for agricultural interests was confined to 11 members.  I hold that that is not true.  As a matter of fact, a member of one of our political Parties which claims to be an agricultural and farmers' Party was elected on the Labour Panel.  Nobody will deny that Senator Johnston, who was elected from Trinity College, is an advocate of farming and agricultural interests on almost every occasion and that there are on other panels members who have as great and as lively an interest in the agricultural community as Senator Baxter and those people elected on the agricultural panel.  I should say that agriculture has a majority of representatives as compared with any other section.</P>

From a technical angle, Senator O'Donovan does make a contribution, but it is from a technical angle.</P>

We may get a different point of view, but I do not think we will get more representation, because it seems to me that, when anything is said about agriculture, everybody in the House jumps to arms in defence of agriculture.  It is that defence which is killing agriculture.  The difficulty is that those who are experts in relation to agriculture cannot agree among themselves for five minutes as to what is to be done to improve it.  The result of it all is that agricultural production is going down.</P>

      <P>Or in the Farmers' Party. It is desirable that we should pay more attention to the effect of this Bill in securing adequate, and, I hope, effective representation for agriculture. That is the purpose of Section 22 and I have every reason to think that agriculture will be very efficiently and effectively represented in the next Seanad in view of the amount of canvassing which is going on already. Some of the interests mentioned in this <Col N="1814" /> section probably have a greater grievance than the agriculturists.  The Administrative Panel, notwithstanding the fact that four out of five elected will be members of local authorities, has quite inadequate representation under the section.  I would suggest to Senator Baxter that one of the most effective methods by which he would get representation for rural, including agricultural, interests would be to strengthen representation on the Administrative Panel.  I admit that we have no power to do that under the Bill.  The framework of the House is settled in the Constitution and therefore, whether Senator Baxter or I like or dislike the scheme, we are tied to it in respect of numbers and in respect of groups.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 31 and 32, to delete the words &ldquo;one hundred and eighty&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;ninety&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the period during which the Minister will be entitled to sit on a recommendation sent from the Seanad for the purpose of filling a Seanad vacancy.  Where a casual vacancy occurs at the moment, and also under the Bill, a resolution is passed by the House and sent to the Minister directing his attention to the fact that a casual vacancy exists because of the death or resignation of a member of a particular named panel; and the sub-section provides, as the present statute provides, that the Minister has 180 days, that is, six months, in which to hold a by-election for the purpose of filling that vacancy. I think that period is unreasonably long. If a vacancy exists here and the House considers it should be filled, the time within which the Minister may make his arrangements should be limited to three months, that is, 90 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad does not proceed immediately to pass a resolution when a casual vacancy occurs.  On occasions, <Col N="1815" /> two and three months are allowed to elapse before the resolution is forwarded to the Minister.  If the Minister avails of the provisions of sub-section (2) in their entirety, a period of 12 months may elapse between the occuring of the vacancy and the action taken by the Minister under this section for the purpose of filling it.</P>

      <P>Most of the matters which were raised here were, I should say, matters which related to the question of the qualification of registration bodies and the manner in which the nomination committees should be constituted.  For the purpose of the impending election the existing register of nominating bodies is deemed to be the register of nominating bodies under the Bill.  So far as the immediate mechanism of the impending election is concerned, there will be no difficulty whatsoever.  There will be no difficulty, either, in these nominating bodies selecting their five representatives to the nominating committee.  I am prepared to concede that, in the light of what has been said here, another Oireachtas must review the provisions relating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know.  If the Senator will permit me to finish? Another Oireachtas must review certain of the provisions relating to the manner in which the nominating bodies shall select their representatives upon the nomination committees.  Obviously, I think, there must be alternative provisions to meet the case of bodies such as those which have been mentioned here, say, the Best Growers' Association and that body which is, apparently, so close to Senator Duffy's head if not his heart, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, although I would say that, under the Act as it stands, the governing executives of these organisations could be entered on the register of nominating bodies. However, I do not wish to pursue that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I am prepared to concede that a case has been made for a review of the particular manner in which large organisations will select their representatives on the nomination bodies.  I am not prepared to go so far as Senator O'Dea appears to go by saying that the provision in Section 8 which appears to give the Clerk of the Seanad discretion to reject an application for registration unless certain conditions which are therein set out are <Col N="1821" /> complied with makes it mandatory on the Clerk of the Seanad to reject any body, except an excepted body, in respect of which these conditions have not been fulfilled.  There may be a case for further consideration there.</P>
    <P>So far as the discussion on the Committee Stage of this Bill has proceeded, no point of real substance has, I think, been raised except these two.  I suggest that we can let these matters stand until the next Oireachtas.  We could, I think, even bearing these things in mind and without any loss of dignity, take all the remaining stages of this Bill this evening.  I would ask the House to do so, not because the Minister in charge of the Bill would be greatly convenienced, but because all these bodies which have rights under the Bill will be convenienced.  If we can get the Bill passed this evening and if the Seanad will pass the resolution which is on the Order Paper the Bill can be made law and a lot of matters which cannot be undertaken until the Bill has been enacted as an Act will then be put in train, such as the giving of due notice to persons affected, issuing forms to nominating bodies and others who are interested in securing candidature for the election.</P>

      <P>Judging from the Minister's attitude I take it we can continue for a few minutes after 6 o'clock in order to complete this question.  I have been reduced, as a result of the Minister's attitude, to such a state that I do not care what happens.  The real blemish is that a majority of the members of the House is prepared to let the Minister have a very obviously defective Bill without any amendment. We are confronted with a Bill which we are not allowed to amend.  The Minister said that the blemishes relate to only one Part of the Bill.  For this particular election the Seanad returning officer remains as before.  Under <Col N="1822" /> the Bill in the second next election the Clerk of the Seanad becomes the returning officer.  It is impossible for any civil servant, for the Clerk of the Seanad, or any other officer to work the Bill as it now stands without amendment. I challenge the Minister.  It cannot be done.  Nobody could do it.</P>
      <P>The Bill is fundamentally defective and it is unfair to give to any officer of this House or any officer of the State the manifestly difficult task of working a Bill which is defective right through.  I made a suggestion yesterday which would have enabled the Bill to be amended; I made a suggestion which would have rendered it imperative upon the next Oireachtas to discuss the Bill.  We have demonstrated to the Minister that the Bill is complicated and radically defective&mdash; defective to the extent that the Minister himself fails to understand it and cannot explain it.  He now suggests that the next Parliament may examine this Bill.  Why does he not accept the proposal that the next Parliament must examine it?  The Minister has reduced this House to the state where it is told that its attitude must be that it must take this Bill and that it cannot amend it.  We do not mind when it is taken.</P>

      <P>I suggest the best way of dealing with the present difficulty is to divide on this motion.  There is no use having the Report Stage to-morrow if the principle is accepted that it may not be amended.  If the majority of the House feel that an amendment cannot be put in, then the best thing to do is to have a division now on the Report Stage.  If we are going to have a Report Stage, then let us amend the Bill and get down to it in detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, sub-section (3), paragraph (d), to delete sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iv).</P>
      <P>This section is concerned with the arrangement of local electoral areas and, in making arrangements, the Minister is required to have regard to certain matters.  In particular, in paragraph (d) this provision is set out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As regards local electoral areas in relation to which none of the foregoing paragraphs of this sub-section is applicable, the order shall be so framed that due regard is given to....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there are four specific considerations set out.  One is &ldquo;the rateable valuation of such areas respectively&rdquo;, and another is, &ldquo;the general character of such areas respectively&rdquo;.  I have no idea what is meant by the last sub-paragraph&mdash;&ldquo;the general character of such areas respectively&rdquo;.  But the other sub-paragraph relating to the rateable valuation of the electoral areas is pretty clear.  Obviously, it is intended that in the allocation of electoral areas it is not merely the number of voters in a proposed area that will be considered.  Equally important is <Col N="1825" /> the consideration which, under this Bill, must be given to the rateable valuation of the proposed electoral area.  That seems to me to raise a question as to whether we are departing from the principle that governed our electoral laws over a period of 25 years.</P>
    <P>The arrangement of electoral areas in everything pertaining to elections tended more and more over those years to consider the number of electors or the number of persons residing in the area, and in more recent years the present Government extended the franchise so as to include in the voters' list men and women of 21 years and over in respect of local as well as Parliamentary elections.  This is clearly a departure from that habit of thought. On the direction of the present Minister for Local Government, in future when electoral areas are being created attention must be given to the rateable valuation of the area.  Whether that means that the area must be large if the rateable valuation is low or that the electoral area shall be small if the rateable valuation relative to the country generally is high, I do not know.  There has been no explanation of these two sub-paragraphs.</P>
    <P>I join issue with the Minister, however, in relation to the principle set out in the Bill irrespective of how that principle is applied.  I am opposed to the mapping out of an electoral area in relation to its valuation.  I consider that the electoral area should be a convenient one, convenient so far as service to the public is concerned; an area of such a kind as can be served by the person elected to represent it, because, under the Bill, only one person will be elected for any area except in the case of cities.  This provision is not restricted merely to rural areas. It applies equally in city areas.  Therefore, in an area, let us say, like Rathmines or Rathgar, the Minister may, if he thinks fit, create a relatively small district for the purpose of having a representative on the city council.</P>
    <P>In another area, let us say, a poor district, the Minister may create a relatively large area.  The result of that can easily be that in wealthy districts, three councillors may represent 5,000 electors and in poor districts three <Col N="1826" /> councillors may represent 15,000 electors.  If that is not the purpose of the section I do not know why it is there at all.  Unless it is intended to be used to give weight to the representation of wealthy areas at the expense of poorer areas, it seems to me that this provision in the Bill serves no purpose.</P>
    <P>One can see how this works in practice.  Assuming, for instance, that the poorer areas are working-class areas in which there are working-class houses and families, this section can be used to limit their representation on the city council just as it can be used to expand representation on the city council for those areas in which there are important residents and highly-rated properties.  That same principle will be applied, no doubt, in the rural areas and again you will find that in poorer districts 15,000 people probably will be electing one councillor, whereas in wealthy areas in which there are large farms and extensively rated properties 3,000 or 4,000 people will elect one councillor.  That system is bound to lead to disproportionate representation. The representation of the wealthy areas will be out of all proportion to the representation of the poorer areas so that the character of the councils, as we know them, will be changed, and changed in a manner that I personally dislike, in a manner that I do not think should receive the approval of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Senator has misunderstood the purpose and the intention of the provisions of paragraph (d), sub-section (3).  I think he was also addressing himself to sub-section (5) of the section.  The idea is not to give the Minister power to do all these occult and nefarious things that the Senator suggested.  The idea is to give the Minister a certain amount of elbow room, to keep him outside the strait-jacket of a mathematical formula, as it would be if the Minister were to have regard only to numbers.  The Oireachtas has found need to do that in relation to a very much graver matter than this, in relation to the constitution of Dáil Éireann&mdash;in relation to the delimiting of constituencies for the purpose of electing members of Dáil Eireann.  The Oireachtas has considered <Col N="1827" /> that it would be wise, in fact that it would be necessary, to give to whoever was responsible for the defining of constituencies and the delimiting of their boundaries a very wide discretion because the Constitution provides&mdash;I should say not the Oireachtas but the people in this case&mdash;that representation may be on the basis of not less than one member for every 30,000 of the population and not more than one member for every 20,000 of the population.</P>
      <P>It is possible to adopt that sort of criterion in the case of the Oireachtas because we are dealing with the country as a whole, with only one entity. But, when we come to consider local authorities, we are dealing with corporate entities of all sizes and descriptions and therefore we cannot simply apply the same sort of device of fixing a minimum and a maximum number for limiting representation.  We have to try to find some other considerations to which the Minister will have regard if he is going to propound a scheme which will be practicable.  That is why we have these other matters brought in.</P>
      <P>If the electoral areas were to be framed entirely on the basis of population, we should have exactly the same anomalies as we would have if we were to say that the State was to be divided into 40 constituencies each having exactly the same population. We can see where that would lead us. We would have some part of a constituency in Dublin City, some parts in Dublin County, some parts in three counties, some constituencies divided by a mountain and so on.  It is precisely to avoid that sort of thing in relation to the constitution of local electoral areas that these provisions have been brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Senator had considered these provisions he would see that some of them will neutralise others.  If we have to give consideration not merely to the number of local government electors, but also to the rateable valuation of such an area, we can also consider these factors in relation to a poor county or a sparsely populated district, say, a mountainous district.  We can <Col N="1828" /> consider the general character of the unit as a whole so that we shall try to constitute electoral areas which will have some sort of common characteristic to bind them together, some sort of common interest which will constitute them rational units.  That is the general idea in the proposal which, I think, particularly in sub-section (5), is not at all a novel one.  In the last Local Government (Dublin) Act, an Act which increased the membership of the Dublin Corporation and gave the Minister power to divide the city into electoral areas, we had precisely the same provisions as we have embodied in this section.  That is to say, that due regard was to be given not merely to the number of local government electors registered in each area, but also to the rateable valuations in each of the areas respectively.  On the basis there laid down, I made an Order dividing the city for municipal purposes into eight electoral areas.</P>

      <P>I am sorry&mdash;nine electoral areas.  I have not heard that there was any suggestion that these areas were either gerrymandered, as they say, or that they had been improperly drawn.  I think, on the contrary&mdash;I say it with all modesty because, as everybody knows, a great part of the work in matters of this sort is done by my officers, not so much by the Minister&mdash;it has been found that the new areas were from many points of view much more satisfactory than those which they superseded.  The general purpose of this is not to do anything wrong, not to do anything secretly or occultly, but to give the responsible Minister the power to act in a rational and reasonable way when he comes to divide a county into district electoral areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Senator not to press the amendment.  Though I would like to see this Bill on the Statute Book if I could, I would have no strong objection, in principle at any rate, to accepting amendment No. 4.  I would be prepared to do that, though I can see, from the point of view of the demand on Parliamentary time, that there might be objection.  However, I would <Col N="1829" /> not be disposed to press that objection and, if the Senator would withdraw amendments Nos. 2 and 3, I will accept amendment No. 4, which will give the Oireachtas an opportunity of deciding, or at least adjudicating, should an allegation be made that the Minister has exercised his functions under this Bill improperly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has met my case reasonably and I do not propose to press this amendment.  I would like to say, however, for the benefit of the members of the House who had the patience to listen to this discussion, that we are here embarking on something new, a scheme of single-member constituencies.  In the cities they will be three-member constituencies. I think the Minister will probably recall that when the Local Government Act of 1945 was going through I raised the same point.  The Minister met the objection I then raised by giving an undertaking, as an aside perhaps, but at least he did say it, that there would be no three-member constituencies in Dublin and we left it at that.  Subsequently he did make an Order fixing the constituencies for local government purposes at five. While I have no reason to make any criticism of the manner in which that Act was implemented, I know that there has been criticism in relation to the central area.  There are nine areas and one is Dublin Central, and a number of people have raised objections&mdash;I have not examined the objections but I know that they have been made&mdash; that that central area is weighted in favour of rateable valuation as against the population.</P>

      <P>At the end of paragraph (b), line 11, page 6, to add the following words &ldquo;or is a director or other officer of a limited liability company which is the occupier of premises within the functional area of the local authority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This point was raised on the Second Stage.  I raised two principal objections to the Bill.  One has been met by the acceptance of Senator Duffy's amendment No. 4.  The second one is dealt with in this amendment.  Under this Bill you may have in the cities an extraordinary position by which the largest ratepayers who operate limited companies may find not only that they have no votes, which is another matter altogether, but that their representatives will not be able even to stand for election.  I think that is a serious mistake. It was the policy of the present Government to reduce or discourage what was called commercial representation. There used to be a special representation of five and that was abolished by this Government.  Be that right or wrong, I think this Bill is going too far.  I can see a strong case in the case of the counties why the persons who stand for election should be actually inside the area but when you come to a city like Dublin, where the managers, principal staff or directors in very many cases reside just outside the city, in County Dublin, to preclude <Col N="1832" /> these persons from becoming members of the city council when in fact their principal business is in the functional area of the council and most of their time is spent within the functional area of the county, where they have a very vital interest, seems to me a mistake.  I do not know that it was intentional.  It certainly does not seem to me to be a fundamental portion of the Act at all.  I rather take the view that it probably was accidental, that a principle which was intended for the counties, was applied also to the city for which, not only is there not a good case, but to which there is a very strong objection.</P>
    <P>I do not say that my amendment is ideal but I think it would serve its purpose.  If the person is a local government elector in any part of Ireland and if he is the director or other official of a limited company which has its business premises within the functional area, I think he should be eligible as a candidate.  The question of votes for county councils, which is an entirely different matter, does not arise under this Bill.  I have quite definite views on that but to go so far now as to prevent any of our leading business men from going into the city council would be a pity.  I think it would be a great advantage if we could persuade more of them to go into it, and I am certainly against making difficulties for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join Senator Douglas in urging this amendment or the spirit of it on the Minister.  It is often argued that more of the right type of men will not enter public life, particularly in the local councils.  Here we purport under this Bill to make it impossible for men who might so be described to be elected on local councils.  In our big cities, particularly Dublin, as has been pointed out by Senator Douglas, the residential area is outside the manufacturing area.</P>

To pass a Bill which arbitrarily excludes for all time, as long as the Bill is in operation, the owners of probably the biggest sources of <Col N="1833" /> employment in the city from figuring in the affairs of local administrative councils is something that the Minister himself would not wish to see happen. There is no need to make a long speech on it.  The arguments are self-evident and I do hope the Minister will indicate that he can meet what we believe to be a reasonable suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so too.  I also hope that we will hear the words of wisdom of Senator MacGee on this amendment.  I put it to the Minister that if a person is a citizen of this country he has certain rights under the Constitution and if that person happens to be a director of a concern that is paying very heavy rates inside the functional area, say, of the Dublin Corporation, he should be by virtue of that fact eligible to stand as a candidate. I will immediately disagree with any one who suggests that by <Col N="1836" /> virtue of his being a director of a concern, solely because it pays rates, that he should be an elector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  I am merely making the point that I would not agree.  There is a good deal of substance in what Senator Summerfield and Senator Douglas said, but the amendment is altogether too wide.  If it is pressed to a division I will have to vote against it as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise, though it was not intentional, that the amendment&mdash;I may say that I had not the drafting of it&mdash;is too wide.  When I look at the section, I find that the amendment could possibly include a person who is not otherwise a local government elector.  I am not prepared to go even as far as Senator Hearne because I think a person should be a local government elector.  If a person is a local government elector, is living, say, in the County Dublin and is willing to give his time by serving on the Dublin Corporation, I think he should not be excluded if he happens to be taking an active part&mdash;I am avoiding technical terms&mdash;in a business which happens to be a limited liability company, and, therefore, has no local government electors registered for it. I see no objection to such a person serving on the Dublin Corporation.  I do see an objection if he happens to live in Galway, or if you have the case of the far-fetched auditor living in Scotland and referred to by Senator O'Dea.  It would not worry me a great deal if auditors who live in Scotland were excluded.  In any case, I would not be in favour of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister might see that there is some point in this, and that he might produce something for the Report Stage.  I do not think that it would cost his Department more than a few minutes to put this proposal into shape.  It is a little difficult to know where exactly to insert it in the Bill. I tacked it on to paragraph (b).  From the point of view of simplicity, it might be better to confine it to directors, though, personally, I should like <Col N="1837" /> to include active managers.  I see difficulties there, too.  We are not concerned with auditors.  I must confess that, in cases where the secretary also acts as manager, I should also like to see him included.  Such men have very wide practical experience and could render very valuable service as members of a local body.  Perhaps it might meet the case if the amendment were on these lines &ldquo;or who is registered as a local government elector in any other area and who is a director of a limited liability company which is the occupier of premises within the functional area.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is something to be said in principle for this amendment.  The real purpose of the section was to ensure that individuals elected to local authorities should have some interest in the functional area of a local authority.  That is the reason why we provide, in the case of a county, that a person must live in the area which he is elected to represent.  In the case of a corporation, we have inserted a condition here that he must be registered as a local government elector for the functional area of the local authority&mdash;a corporation or urban authority as the case may be.</P>
      <P>I agree that perhaps we have gone too far, because we did not intend to exclude from sitting on a council any person who had a real business or commercial interest in the city.  Naturally, he would have an interest in the welfare of the city and of its inhabitants. I do not think there would be any great objection to allowing a person to be qualified upon some such basis as that because, after all, the last word as to who will represent them will rest with the electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the local government electors decide that a person who is a director or a senior officer of a company which is of such importance that the welfare of the city is bound up with its welfare, would fittingly represent them on the corporation, I do not see any objection in principle to it.  I can see some difficulty in drafting a provision, even to give effect to that principle, which would not be open to abuse.  For instance, if we are going to say a director of a company, do we mean the director of any sort of company?  You <Col N="1838" /> can register a company for a comparatively small sum and the capital need not be more than nominal.  It is not just so easy as it appears at first sight to give effect to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be an approach to it.  I am only anxious to see what we can do to give effect to the principle and to safeguard it against abuse.  There was a time when, under some of the old property qualifications, a person could qualify to be a member of a local authority if he happened to have a hen-house somewhere down the country.  Well, we do not want that, but that, in short, is the difficulty.  There is another difficulty arising from the fact that very often the active element in a concern is not a director who would seek municipal honours but an officer, servant or employee of the company.  Where are we going to stop?  Are we going to constitute a class of servants who are to be privileged under this section?  Is that class to be composed of managers only or managers and secretaries only, or of managers, secretaries or accountants? Again, are we to introduce this invidious distinction, where he is an accountant, that he is being paid £3 per week?  I do not think any of them are paid £3 per week now, but there was a time when they would be paid as little as that, or must we say that the accountant is a man whose salary is £800 or £900 per year?  The trouble is that I am prepared to concede the principle of this, but I would like some advice and some guidance to get me out of the difficulty of drafting a section which, while admitting the principle, will not leave it open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no sympathy at all with the idea that a man is to be despised because he has only £150 per year.  All the people residing in Dublin will be eligible as candidates, and they will not need to have £150 per year.  I think the difficulty about the limited company is quite negligible as long as they are the occupiers of premises. All the other people who are voters in the city will be eligible but <Col N="1839" /> they will not get elected.  I do not see any conceivable danger that the people of Dublin are going to elect additional undesirable people by means of this provision.  Take the case of a small, despised company with small premises in Dublin.  If the director lives in Rathmines, Ailesbury Road, Ringsend or Irishtown or in the Coombe, he will be quite eligible, but if it so happens that he lives some distance out on the Stillorgan Road or in Mount Merrion, then he becomes not eligible.  I was born in the City of Dublin and lived most of my life in it.  Up to a couple of years ago, I would have been quite eligible even under this Bill, but now that I have gone across the border line I am not eligible.  I may say that I have not the slightest intention of standing for the Dublin Corporation. All my financial and other interests, during my whole life, have been in the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I do not know the exact number of members of the present corporation who will become ineligible under this Bill, but there are several businessmen&mdash;and they are not confined to one Party, as I know&mdash;who will become ineligible for the next election, if the Bill is passed as it is.  I will not mention names, but I know there are some two or three, and in fact I think there are more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think nearly all of them are engaged in business and I suggest to the Minister therefore that this is not a matter in which enormous care is necessary.  All that is necessary is a reasonable provision.  You are only including them as being eligible to be candidates.  You are not going to get them elected.  You are including a number of people as eligible just because they are residing within the area&mdash;whether they are desirable, rich or poor does not matter.  There are some very rich people living within the boundary, and some very poor people just outside who would have business interests inside, so that no class matter arises.  It would be sufficient for present purposes if the Minister confined it to persons who are directors <Col N="1840" />&mdash;they can be comparatively easily made directors, if they want to stand&mdash; and if he stipulates that they must be local government electors in some other part of Ireland.  If he wants to make it narrower they could be local government electors within a particular city, but it is simpler to make it refer to Ireland.  If, however, he would like to prevent Senator O'Dea from going forward, let him make it Dublin&mdash;or Cork, Waterford or Galway.</P>

If you are going to make a special class of company directors, I would certainly oppose any amendment to that effect. I can see, however, a reasonable case for some such proposal and if it included business people with interests in the city, such as publicans and drapers, who may live in the country&mdash; or even street traders&mdash;everyone being put on the same level, I should agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of this which require some more consideration before a decision is reached. Let me take the smaller aspect first. The question must be decided when a nomination is made as to whether the <Col N="1841" /> person is or is not qualified as a candidate. The returning officer, whoever he may be, must decide whether a person in Dublin, Cork, Galway or Ardee, is qualified to be nominated as a candidate, and unless we can get some more precise language than is used in the amendment, I can see the difficulty of the returning officer when he has to decide whether a person is qualified by virtue of his being a director or an official of a company.  Must there not be some method of establishing that fact in advance?  We get back to where we were earlier to-day with the nominating bodies and the question of qualifications being established to the satisfaction of the returning officer that a candidate is in fact a person to be nominated for a council, either for a city council or county council.  It does not arise in the case of a county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>It could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main, it will not arise, but it can arise, and we must take account of the fact that it may. Therefore, the first thing we ought to get clear in our minds is this: Can we get a definition which will enable the bringing in of a special class of candidates who will not be defined in relation to residence, and, if so, how can we get language to express what we want so as to make it clear to the returning officer who is entitled to be nominated, and, at the same time, to keep the group&mdash;I dislike the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; in this connection&mdash;as small as we desire it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second aspect is this matter of residence generally.  That, I think, has been an old issue.  I have not looked it up for many years and I cannot say that I am familiar now with the law in relation to the qualification of candidates, but I think that, roughly speaking, in the county electoral areas, a person to qualify as a candidate should have a residence or property qualification.  If a person resided in the area for which he was being nominated, he was qualified to be a candidate, or if he had property in the area for which he was being nominated, he was entitled to be a candidate.  Even <Col N="1842" /> that limitation was abused.  I remember some instances of people taking a tumble-down shack, a house from which the roof had been removed, for a penny or threepence a week a few months before the election, so that they could qualify as property owners in the electoral areas for which they became candidates. I could cite one particular instance which would be known to a number of people here in which that transaction took place&mdash;a person who desired to be nominated as a candidate renting a house or the walls of a house for 2/6 a year.  He was then a rated occupier in the particular area and thereby qualified to be a candidate in that area.</P>
    <P>In the City of Dublin, however, a somewhat different procedure existed. I am speaking subject to correction, because I do not quite remember the facts, but I think that the position approximately was that if a person held property in Dublin, he was entitled to be a candidate for the corporation, or, if he held property in an adjoining area or resided in an adjoining area, he was entitled to be a candidate. My recollection is that people who resided, say, in Dún Laoghaire Borough, were eligible to be candidates and were, in fact, elected to be members of the Dublin Corporation, without having any property qualification within the city.</P>
    <P>When I read this Bill originally, I imagined that it was intended to get rid of that practice, because a person may have an important interest in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire or in the County Dublin outside the borough, but have no interest in the Dublin Corporation. It is conceivable that a person might be a director of a company in Dublin without having any abiding interest in the Corporation of Dublin or in the citizens of Dublin. A company is not necessarily the owner of property in Dublin.  It may have a rented office in Dublin and own no property whatever, not even pay rates in Dublin.  If the directors of that company are eligible for election to the corporation, I do not see why a man employed by a company in the City of Dublin, who happens to live outside in Dún Laoghaire or in Swords or Balbriggan, <Col N="1843" /> should be disqualified.  I am not opposing the idea running through Senator Douglas's argument, except that I desire to bring to the notice of the House these other aspects of the matter, which are important and which, in my opinion, must receive consideration if we are to alter the provisions of the Bill in relation to the qualifications for city or county councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking of the old carpet bagger and that may have been picturesque but we have moved a long way from that when we come to this argument to-night.  Really, why make these absurd restrictions as to who shall represent a man?  Why should we spend this time&mdash;with this enormous mass of legislation before us &mdash;discussing this matter in a narrow parochial way?  First of all, we may be sure there will not be too many people pressing forward to serve on local authorities, when we come to consider the little power they are allowed under our present law.  In all conscience, if there is a person within the State, a registered local government elector, why should we not simplify the whole matter and allow him to sit anywhere within the State, if he is otherwise eligible as a candidate?  Let us keep some sense of proportion.  If there was going to be an avalanche of abuse&mdash;someone drew a picture of a person becoming a director in order to be eligible to sit on the corporation&mdash; there might be something in it, but it is fantastic that we are here seeking reasons, pretexts and difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy was perfectly right. The returning officer must see a proper qualification for the candidate; and what better qualification is there than that he is a local government elector? We may be sure that people are not going to come forward to represent the city, nor are the electors going to put them in office, unless they are suitable people; so why look at it in so narrow and so parochial a manner?  Only a short time ago, a member of the House was telling me: &ldquo;I have been chairman of an urban district council all my life&rdquo;&mdash;he was an elderly man&mdash;&ldquo;and now, for the first time, I am not <Col N="1844" /> eligible to sit on that urban district council, because I do not reside in the area, although I own very big interests in the area.&rdquo;  Is not that fantastic? If they are sensible men and are Irish citizens, let them go forward as candidates anywhere within the State. They will not be going forward and seeking ways to abuse the power.</P>

Just as we do not welcome, for one reason or another, government by people over this State who live outside this country, I do not think that, in general, it is a good thing to accept the principle that any Tom, Dick or Harry who resides God knows where within the Twenty-Six Counties, is competent to sit on the council of an urban authority where he has no interest.  I will concede at once that, if the person concerned has a real tangible interest in the local community, he is at least entitled to put himself before the electorate.</P>
      <P>I would try to meet Senator Douglas's position to this extent that, if the person is not only a director of a company but is a local government elector for an adjacent area, he might be eligible.  I think that would cover the cases we have in mind.  I do not think we need make any special provision to deal with the point which Senator Hogan raised, because if a man occupies premises in his own right as an individual in the city he is a local government elector, no matter where he resides.  It is only a particular person who is acting through a company and who does not occupy premises, who is concerned here.  I am having an amendment drafted now which would be an agreed amendment, and if it would save us trouble in discussing the Bill on Report, perhaps the Cathaoirleach would accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister think that there is, in fact, any strong case for requiring candidates who are nominated for a local authority to deposit the sum of £10.  I am not terribly worried as to whether this section stands or not, but I would like to draw attention to the fact that the councillor, whether a city councillor, a town councillor or a county councillor, does not receive any remuneration for his services under the new Seanad Electoral Act and there will be few, if any, compensations for the office of councillor.  I have a feeling that there is not anything coming to a councillor which will induce a rush of candidates except in exceptional circumstances or that there is a large body of the public anxious to serve their local community by becoming members of the council.  It may be that there are occasionally freak candidates and it may be the view of the Minister in placing a fee of £10 on the candidates that he would keep out freak candidates.  But I can recall half a dozen instances of genuine freak candidates heading the poll.  I remember in Cork some years ago the university students picked up a gentleman who was a well-known character in the city and nominated him and he headed the poll in the district in which he was a candidate.  I can remember that years and years ago another such gentleman headed the poll in Galway. He was as rich as Dives so that the deposit did not matter to him, and he was in no danger of losing it.  I wonder whether this section requiring a candidate to find a deposit fee of £10 serves any useful purpose.  I have no particularly strong feelings on the matter, but I would ask the Minister to reflect on it.</P>

      <P>If the Bill did not contain this provision regarding a deposit of £10, I would have urged the Minister to place some such provision in the Bill which would amend the existing Bill, which is most unsatisfactory. At present it is possible for a person to be nominated for a local authority in a local election without his knowledge or consent.  I was faced with a rather difficult situation in Longford at the time of the last local election. There was a very popular person who was elected with two and a half quotas at every election since he became a candidate, and some people who took a very poor view of the response proposed to nominate another candidate of the same name who was utterly unsuitable.  I use the words &ldquo;utterly unsuitable&rdquo; advisedly.  The proposal of having a person elected as a joke between two candidates is deplorable. If they have to put up £10&mdash;even though there may be a possibility that they will get it back&mdash;if there is any risk of losing it, you will find that these gentlemen will be slow to attempt anything like that.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2), in page 4, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Before making such an Order, the Minister shall send to the local authority the draft of the Order proposed to be made and shall consider any representations made by the local authority in respect thereof. The making of such representations shall be a reserved function for the purposes of the County Management Acts, 1940 and 1942, and for the purposes of the Act or Acts relating to the management of any county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I debated this section on the Second Reading.  The Minister nods, I think, and says that the amendment is unnecessary. <Col N="1850" /> My purpose in raising this matter is to get information.  If the Minister tells me that the amendment will be carried into effect&mdash;that before any Order is made determining the areas that in future are going to be local government areas this draft Order will be sent to the local authorities&mdash;we will know where we stand. I cannot conceive how the Minister's executives are going to sit in the Custom House and draft an Order determining the boundaries of local areas without consultation with the local people.  It is impossible to do so. There are all sorts of considerations. I consider it necessary to have this amendment embodied in the section. I want to hear the Minister on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator has expressed the best argument himself to support my contention that the amendment which he proposes is unnecessary.  First of all, from the practical point of view, the electoral areas could not be determined except in consultation with the officers of the council and of the county.  It is unnecessary, also, in so far as it proposes to make any part of the procedure a reserved function.  All matters relating to Parliamentary and local elections are already reserved functions under the Act of 1940. Surely this amendment is unnecessary in view of the amendment which I have accepted from Senator Duffy.  I have accepted his amendment which provides that any Order made under Section 2 shall not come into force or have effect until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by resolution of each such House.  On that basis, it is quite clear that the Minister will take care to invite the views of the local authority before he proceeds to make an Order and that he will listen to any representations they may wish to make or to any views they may care to express.  Otherwise we will have to run the gamut of a debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  No Minister, with all the pressure there is normally on a Minister's time, is going to refrain from doing anything which would obviate a debate in this House upon any Order he makes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why I feel so strongly about the matter is that both of the Senators concerned are members of local authorities.  There is often talk about lack of policy on the part of local authorities because of the County Management Act.  Here we have two leading members of this House, both of them members of local authorities, who do not know the position.  In 1942, when there was a reorganisation of the county electoral districts, the representation in County Longford, in common with that of county councils all over the Twenty-Six Counties, was reduced.  In my particular county the representation was reduced from 26 to 21.</P>
      <P>The Minister sent a draft Order to the county council which the county council considered.  They agreed with the principle but, after discussing the matter, they passed a resolution asking the Minister to reduce the number in each of the existing electoral areas by one rather than to re-align the existing areas, that is, a total reduction of five.  They requested that the existing areas should be allowed to stand but that the representation be reduced by one in each area.  I may say to the credit of the Minister that almost by return of post the resolution was approved and a new Order was made complying with the wishes of the Longford County Council as set out in the resolution submitted to the Minister. That happened in 1942.  We are not theorising.  The Minister is not theorising when he says that it will be done.</P>

      <P>I just want to reiterate my point of view with regard to this Bill.  I have already stressed it on the Second Reading.  Senator Hearne seems to be all hot and bothered.  Some <Col N="1852" /> of us here, according to him, do not take our responsibilities sufficiently seriously and we are not sufficiently well informed.  I think his comments on my amendment which has not been moved are very unbecoming.  He says he has had experience in Longford.  He implies that I have not had experience in my own county.  I do not know that there is any obligation on the Minister to do this.  There is no obligation upon him under this Bill to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>You can reply to me later.  In my view this rearrangement of areas is a fundamental flaw in the Bill. In my county and in the Northern counties generally it is going to eliminate a minority which has had representation on our local authorities for a very long time.  In my view it is doing away with the principles of proportional representation.  I believe that it is impossible to confine the activities of representatives to the very small areas in which they are expected to function under this Bill.  It is, of course, very largely a waste of time to discuss machinery for local government because the responsibilities of local authorities to-day have been whittled down until their functions are merely a matter of pretence.  I speak from experience. I read other local papers.  I know what the county council in Longford does.  I know what the county council in Leitrim does.  I know what the county councils in Monaghan and elsewhere do.  It may please the Minister and his executives to continue with what he calls this reorganisation of constituencies.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of improvement of local government I do not think it is going to mean anything whatever.  I think it is going to make for more small-mindedness in local government.  The Minister is now going to break up homogeneous areas from the point of view of roads and drainage and other problems.  That is the Minister's way of doing it, but I can quite see other people, when they come along, repealing the provisions of this Bill that we are asked to pass here to-night.</P>

      <P>But one would think we had no local government in this country and no experience of local authorities prior to the year 1919 when this system was, so to speak, tried out on the dog.  I remember when local government in this country was a very vigorous element in the life of the community.  I think&mdash;and this is a consideration which moved me to introduce this Bill&mdash;that one of the principal reasons why we have not the same intense local interest in local government to-day that we had hitherto is because the element of personal responsibility for a particular locality was taken out of local government.  It was taken out when we gave to local authorities areas as large as many large Parliamentary constituencies and which to-day are in some counties larger than the whole of other counties within the Twenty-Six Counties.  That has made it virtually impossible for the man who has his own business to attend to public affairs and to devote to public affairs the amount of time they require unless he is prepared to neglect his own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I think that by reestablishing the more intimate association which used to exist between the county council and a particular area, and by limiting the number of people who will have first call upon his services to a reasonable number, and limiting the area which he will have to look after and reducing it to a reasonable size, I believe that we shall get a better type of candidate, a more alert and vigorous type of businessman, a more alert and vigorous type of farmer and worker coming forward to represent the people of a particular area. <Col N="1854" /> They will be the people generally regarded as leaders in their own parish or group of parishes.  I may be wrong in that.  It is an experiment.  I do not claim to be infallible.  But I do know that there is at the present time some malaise so far as local government is concerned; and, for good or ill, I am trying to revive interest among the people in their own local affairs.  I think that this Bill will tend to do that, despite what Senator Baxter has said in opposition to the Bill.  The extraordinary thing is that in the other House&mdash;where I think there are more members of local authorities than there are here&mdash;there was no opposition whatever to this particular provision in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it is outrageous to ask us to finish the Housing Bill to-morrow.  It is a very complicated measure and requires detailed and precise reading.  It is a Bill of grave import.  It is a travesty of our responsibilities to ask us to sit as if there were an emergency in existence or we were on the eve of the outbreak of a war, when there is merely a general election in the offing.  Surely, we can meet in the first week of January and do the business with decency and proper deliberation.  If we agree to this unnecessary and indecent haste we shall make this House ridiculous in the eyes of the public.</P>

      <P>I suggest meeting on 7th January rather than 31st December.  I think it is too Dublin-like to bring us back from the country to listen to the bells of Dublin ringing in the New Year when our families at home are without us.  There is to be a general election. Are we all to sing: &ldquo;Who Will Fill Our Places&rdquo;?  They can be filled with better men than we are.  The fact that we should be left to canvass in publichouses on the night before New Year's Day is no reason why we should meet on New Year's Eve.  I agree with what Senator Quirke has suggested.  I think the 7th January, the day after little Christmas, would be the most Christian and the most human day.  I think it would be unChristian and inhuman to meet on New Year's Eve.</P>

      <P>May I say to Senator Quirke that it is very unreasonable to ask this House to give a Second Reading to the Local Government (Superannuation) Bill to-morrow and then put it through all its Stages.  It is a very important Bill and affects a considerable <Col N="1856" /> number of people who are employees of local authorities.  Personally, I have received representations from a number of people representing employees of local authorities who have submitted to me a number of proposals for amending the Bill.  I want a day or two to have a look at these amendments before I table them.  I could table 40 amendments now, but I do not propose to do that.  I want to look at the amendments and see what ones I feel I must table and I want a few days for that.</P>
      <P>All I am asking is that the House should not be asked to proceed to the Committee Stage to-morrow of those Bills to which a Second Reading will be given.  In general, I am agreeable to the re-assembly of the House on the 7th January when I expect that the remaining Stages of these Bills will be disposed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, for another year. Senators will recall that that Act was intended to apply to two years and it would cease to have effect on the 31st March next year unless continued. Senators will recall that the Act of 1946 was passed following on an announcement by the Minister for Finance that he was providing an additional £1,000,000 towards the relief of rates on agricultural land.  This Bill is a demonstration of the Government's desire to assist the agricultural community and, in particular, to assist them through the difficulties which they face at the present time.  Towards the end of the war, the rates on agricultural land increased considerably as a result of increasing costs of all local services and, equally, because the number of services had constantly increased.  Farmers have very great need to improve their land, to restore its fertility, and the Minister for Finance in the course of his speech referred to the desirability of helping the farmers to pay increased wages to agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Grant became stabilised in 1935-36 at the figure of £1,861,000.  There was no variation in the grant in accordance with the increase of rates levied on land.  I should like to give the House a few figures showing the effect of the Agricultural Grant upon the rates levied on agricultural land under the heading of general charges and excluding the small amount of special charges provided for sanitary and other amenities in different areas.  In 1938, the net amount of rates paid upon agricultural land was £2,054,388.  By 1945-46, it had risen to £3,058,170, or roughly from £2,000,000 to £3,000,000.  In 1946-47, it was reduced by the application of the new grant to £2,392,716, and in 1947-48 it was estimated that the net contribution under this head will be £2,751,271. <Col N="1858" /> Agricultural rates rose to their maximum figure in 1945-46.  There has been a reduction since that time of some 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The contribution in respect of the current year is estimated at the very high figure of £3,165,427, or roughly £10 per farmer or £1 per head of the population.  The improvements in the Act, which is being continued, were, firstly, that the Agricultural Grant varies with the general rate levied upon agricultural land, and therefore the Government contributes in increasing degree to farmers if they have to face increasing rates.  The general principle upon which the Act was based is as follows: A primary allowance was granted on valuations not exceeding £20 and on the first £20 of all valuations of three-fifths of the general rate levied upon agricultural land.  Then a secondary allowance was given on valuations over and above the first £20 of one-fifth of the rate levied for general purposes on agricultural land. Thirdly, an employment allowance was provided of 10/- in the £ on all valuations above £20, but it was limited to £6 10s. 0d. per man employed.</P>
    <P>The effect of those three allowances can be seen in the Estimates for the current year.  The primary allowance resulted in a contribution to the small farmer, and on the first £20 of all farmers of £2,036,000.  The secondary allowance, which provided relief for larger farmers, totalled £514,000, and the employment allowance totalled £615,000.  I should add in this connection that, in Section 3, the latest date for the receipt of applications for the employment allowance has been advanced to the 15th October, 1948, so as to facilitate an earlier estimate of the cost which the Department of Finance will have to meet under this head.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, this is one of a number of measures designed to assist farmers to increase their production. We have had the loans given to farmers whose stock has been destroyed by bad weather.  We have announced a system of grants for out-houses, we have had the commitments under the recent trade agreement with England, and we are also making this further <Col N="1859" /> rate contribution.  The Minister hoped that this very heavy contribution towards the rates might be reviewed, assuming that normal conditions would prevail, but normal conditions have not yet arrived by any means and the restoration of normal conditions relating to agricultural production is likely to be very slow in taking place.  The actual position is that the value of farm output in 1938 was £44,000,000. In 1946 it had more than doubled, that is, it had reached £95,000, whereas the rates on agricultural land had increased only by 35 per cent. in the intervening period, indicating that the Government had made a definite contribution to assist the farmer to get over the difficulties caused by the war. As I have said, output values increased by over 100 per cent. and the rates on land increased by only 35 per cent. in the period from 1938 to the present day.</P>
    <P>The House might be interested to hear some figures, in regard to the rates levied on agricultural land as a percentage of the agricultural income of the country.  The agricultural income is calculated by the Department of Statistics and one can say that, in respect of the comparison between one year and another, it gives a general indication of the position.  In 1938 the rates levied off agricultural land were 5.6 per cent. of the agricultural income calculated for that year. In 1946 when the agricultural income was £95,000,000 the rates levied off agricultural land were 3.2 millions, a percentage of 3.3 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the net rate after allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In 1947 if we assume that the income was £90,000,000&mdash;it may be less or it may be more; let us assume that it was £5,000,000 less than the 1946 figure owing to the weather conditions&mdash;the rate contributions are estimated at 2.4 millions and the percentage of rates in relation to agricultural income was 2.6 per cent.  Even if my estimate is exaggerated, it still shows that the Government, as I have said, has made a contribution towards the farmer.  One effect of this very large assistance <Col N="1860" /> granted to farmers is that it should be easier for local authorities to improve local amenities.  Either in relation to sanitation or any other measures, it should be possible for them to levy a general county-at-large charge and not to have recourse to a special charge, with all its accompanying difficulties and the difficulties that are experienced in persuading people in a particular area to pay extra for amenities.</P>
      <P>The present Bill should also encourage farmers to improve their buildings with the aid of the grants that have been made available to them, encourage them to employ labour at better wages, if the Agricultural Wages Board so decide, and to overcome in general by gradual stages all the difficulties with which they have met in past years.  I might say that in the Dáil some Deputies regarded land as the raw material of the farmer. There is no foundation for that view. In our opinion, land is an asset of the farmer, a capital asset, and the fairest way to enable people in our local communities to contribute at least something towards the provision of local services is by levying some rate in proportion to the amount of land they own.  The question was asked why, if land was derated in Great Britain, land should not be derated here.  The answer to that is that the proportion of value in respect of buildings in England as compared with land is very much greater than here.  Sixty per cent. of the total valuation of this country is in respect of land and 40 per cent. in respect of buildings.  I think I have indicated to the House the general nature of this Bill.  As I have said, it embodies one of the many contributions made by the Government in aid of the farmer.  I recommend the Bill with great enthusiasm because I am glad we have been able to continue these grants, and I hope the farmers of the country will take the fullest advantage of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the Parliamentary Secretary has any justification for being enthusiastic in repeating this year what he did last year.  I wonder why he is doing it. Does the Ministry feel that this is a tremendous concession to agriculture <Col N="1861" /> or do they feel that the agricultural industry is in such a plight and that agricultural rates are rising so steeply that something must be done about it?  I do not think that agriculturists feel that it is out of the goodness of their hearts the Government are making this contribution.  The farming community do not feel that this is any great concession.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given us a number of figures.  If I had a little time and if I knew these figures were to be given, there are very good answers which I could supply to them.  The Parliamentary Secretary is rather good at handling figures in his own particular way for his own particular purpose but he did not present us with all the figures that are necessary to have a complete picture of farming conditions as they are at the moment.  He gave us figures in regard to rates and the contribution of the State over a number of years towards the relief of rates. He gave us farm incomes and percentages of the farm incomes in the various years that had to be set aside by way of payment of rates.  But were there not many other payments which farmers had to make over all these years which the Parliamentary Secretary could have given, which he did not give and which he should have given if he were presenting a fair picture of what farming conditions are like?  Rates have risen and are rising, more steeply in some counties than in others.  Agricultural wages have risen much more steeply over that period and all farm costs have risen in the same period.  The cost of farm equipment of every kind, where it is obtainable, is 150 per cent. higher than it was some years ago.  Farm costs and living costs&mdash;all these have risen for the countryman just as they have for the townsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He must wear boots and clothes and obtain all the other essentials.  Put these, in addition to the other outgoings of the farmer, along with his rates and see what picture you will get; see what demands are on the incomes of the farming community and you will then be in a better position to get an approximate idea of farming conditions to-day.  The burden of local rates is getting beyond the capacity of the rural community to bear.  Say what you like <Col N="1862" /> about the Central Fund contribution, but the general experience is that the higher the contribution from the Central Fund the higher the demand on the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I had an experience in my county the other day when there was an intimation that a grant would be available for certain road works on the condition that we would be prepared to levy against our rates next year the equivalent of about 5d. in the £.  We could get a grant if we were ready to raise the rates next year by an equivalent amount.  That is the effect that most of the grants we get have on the local rates.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that in the other House some Deputies argued that land should not be taxed because it was the raw material of the farmer.  He says the Government point of view is that there is no foundation for that and that land is a capital asset.  It may have been a capital asset 50 years ago but it is now reduced to the condition of a raw material that would require to have a great deal added to it before it can again become a capital asset.  The exploitation of the land over the years has impoverished it to the extent that it is quite impossible for science to measure the impoverishment to-day. All that we have stolen out of the land during the past 50 years is so incalculable that seven-eighths of our farmers who have an appreciation of what soil fertility means are at their wit's end to know how to build up fertility again and so make their land once more a capital asset.</P>
    <P>Side by side with a situation like that, requiring immense capital investment, we are confronted with problems relating to the improvement of roads, increased expenditure on mental homes, problems of such magnitude that they are positively frightening for the ratepayers and the local authorities, who have to determine what burden they will impose on the ratepaying community to meet these charges.  I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary knows about it, but the land could not be restored to the condition it was in 12 years ago even by the expenditure of hundreds <Col N="1863" /> of millions.  It is with that derelict raw material we are expected to work and earn incomes out of which the increasing burden of rates will be paid.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary talked about the Government's contribution to local rates.  I looked over figures in my own county and here is the effect in Cavan of your contribution&mdash;other counties may be different: The rate in 1943 was 12/6; in 1944, 12/6; in 1945, 13/2; in 1946, 13/7; in 1947, 16/7; in 1948, 18/-, and I think in the coming financial year it will be £1.  I think that is a state of affairs that every county councillor in the country can corroborate.  Perhaps in some areas the conditions are worse, although I think the figures that I have given are bad enough.  In Cavan, we are as cautious in the spending of money as people in any part of the country.  We try to get the best value we can.  In our council we do not approach our problems in a partisan way.  We look at the whole scheme of administration to see what we can do.  I have indicated the picture with which we are presented.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may tell me how magnaminous the Government are in the amount of grants that they give us, but I can give you figures to show the serious position in which the farmers find themselves.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary may ask &ldquo;What is the net amount which the farmers are paying?&rdquo;  I can produce figures of a holding to show that the amount has gone up correspondingly with the demand made here.  Other counties may be different, but I doubt if they are very much so.</P>
    <P>Our road problem is a colossal one and the restoration of our roads will be a very costly process.  During the war many materials could not be obtained and the roads were allowed to deteriorate.  Will the taxpayers be expected to reconstruct and recondition the roads?  Apparently that is what the Parliamentary Secretary expects us to do or he would have been prepared to advance more money.  What about the extra charges for mental homes?  In our joint institution in Cavan and <Col N="1864" /> Monaghan wage increases will mean an additional £11,000.  It is the same all over the country.</P>
    <P>This is a very disturbing situation for people engaged in local government who take their responsibilities seriously.  There are on local councils a certain number of people who are passengers, but there are others who are responsible persons.  They want to face their obligations and give the best service they can to the community. They keep in mind the capacity of the people to pay.  I do not think the Central Fund contribution is adequate to meet the cost of local services.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gave us the income&mdash;apparently a greatly increased income&mdash;of last year as against what it was in 1938.  Conditions were not good in 1938 because farm incomes were low.  We all know that even that very high figure of £90,000,000 represents probably the lowest level of production that the farms have ever put on the market during the lifetime of any of us.  In my judgment, the physical production of our farms is falling.  I do not see much possibility of an increase in the volume of production for a number of years.  You may have inflated prices, but it is a queer commentary on the way society organises itself that you can have higher prices when you have low production.  That is not a satisfactory condition of things, but that is the position we are faced with &mdash;low production and no possibility of increasing it unless by immense capital expenditure that is not readily available to us.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us the contribution that is being made for the improvement of farms and farm buildings.  He urged on us the employment of labour and expressed the hope that we would be able to employ labour at rates of wages even higher than the present wages if the Wages Board were prepared to recommend that.  It is one of the great problems to-day to find labour for anything.  It is probably the country's greatest problem.  It is the problem that is limiting physical production and will continue to limit it until some remedy is applied.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may be enthusiastic about what he is doing. <Col N="1865" /> He may feel that he is gracious and generous in the sum he is presenting to local authorities.  The bald fact remains that local authorities everywhere are facing an impossible situation. The amount of capital necessary at the moment for reconstructing, rebuilding and reconditioning our roads is altogether beyond the capacity of the local ratepayers.  From the point of view of cost, the position is very disturbing for local representatives. I hear the view expressed by some of the most vigorous Government supporters in Cavan County Council that the stage has been reached when the demands on local ratepayers are beyond their capacity to bear.  I do not think that fact is appreciated. Despite what the Parliamentary Secretary says about the size of the grants, the fact remains that in most counties, where grants have been increased, rates have risen accordingly. What is the remedy for that?  It may be said that farm incomes have risen correspondingly but, if you deduct from the total of farm incomes, the total outgoings and charges against it and assess what is left for the farmer out of which to pay the rates, and if you consider that there is a diminished number of people in the rural areas to find the income from which this is to be drawn, you will have a picture of the situation that is created.  Fewer and fewer people are left to carry an ever-increasing burden.  It simply cannot be done and, whatever the Parliamentary Secretary may think about the dimensions of the grant he is making available to local authorities, I do not consider that it is anything like adequate to the needs of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that always strikes me as being peculiar about this Bill when it is introduced periodically is the fact that it always seems to have a limited life.  This Bill carries on the tradition.  It provides certain relief for local rates to the 31st March, 1949.  It will then expire.  That has been the scheme year after year.  When this Bill is introduced we find that it is to carry on relief for another year or two years. When I saw that idea originally I thought the intention was that it <Col N="1866" /> would be a stop-gap, giving immediate relief to the agricultural community until the Government would frame some more adequate measure, some more comprehensive scheme for reorganising the entire agricultural industry.  Evidently that is not a correct view of the position.  Ministers do not even pretend that there is any plan or scheme in contemplation for putting agriculture on a better basis, in other words, on a profitable basis.  Obviously, this is not a plan. This idea of feeding the dog with its own tail is surely not a plan for agriculture.</P>
      <P>We collect from the community £2,000,000, or £3,000,000, and we hand it back in the form of grants to the local authorities so that they may remit some of the rates which the farming community would be required to pay in the absence of such grants. That is not a remedy for anything. The farmers are paying this money in any event.  It may be that they are paying it in a different form. They pay it when they buy an ounce of tobacco or drink a pint or go to the cinema or the dog track.  There is no external gold mine out of which this country lifts £3,000,000 per year for the relief of rates.  It is lifted in the form of taxation, levied annually in the Budget or, in an exceptional year like this, when things get bad, in a Supplementary Budget.</P>
      <P>It is no boast for the Parliamentary Secretary to come here and tell us he is giving large sums of money to the farming community.  If one were to draw the natural conclusion one might be expected to draw from the figures which the Parliamentary Secretary read out, one would feel that in a short time the contribution of the farmer in the form of rates would be expressed by a minus sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter, of course, drew attention to the other side of the picture, that the actual cash payment demanded from the farmer in the form of rates has increased from 20/- to 27/6, or thereabouts.  The Parliamentary Secretary may be complacent and tell us that this is a small percentage of the proportion of the national income attributable to agricultural production. I wonder what will happen <Col N="1867" /> if the value of agricultural production declines.  Will the demands of the local authorities decline?  Will the demands which are being levied on the agricultural community for the upkeep of roads, the maintenance of hospitals and institutions of various kinds, diminish, merely because the volume of agricultural production declines?  I do not think so.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would find, if the present Government were to remain in office and were to continue its present policy in relation to agriculture, that the proportion of the national income attributable to agriculture which is consumed in rates would increase steeply and would increase to breaking point.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter into this discussion between the Parliamentary Secretary and Senator Baxter as to whether land is a raw material or a capital asset.  We should recall that none of us created the land.  It is the one thing that was created for us and was given to the children of men for their enjoyment and sustenance.  I have a notion that if we use our land intelligently, there ought to be a good living for all the citizens of this country.  We have heard the statement over and over again that there are four acres of land per head of the community. By the use of modern science, by intelligent cultivation, by fertilisation, by organisation of markets, four acres of land would be capable of yielding a good living to a human being.  An average family, let us say, consists of five members.  Therefore, the average acreage per family is 20. That, it seems to me, is an area surely adequate to maintain a family of five on a better scale than anything we know of in large parts of the country.  Our whole approach to this land problem seems to me to be fantastic.  Senator Baxter talked about the derating of land.  I am almost aghast that this is the only country on God's earth where people, professing some knowledge of economics, should advocate the relief of land from rates and yet have no objection to the levying of rates on houses and on other improvements.</P>

      <P>I know that the Senator does institute comparisons between what is done in this country and the foolish things that are done in countries like Great Britain, where land is derated.  Surely, if there is one thing in the world on which taxation should be levied it is this gift which God has given to all men.  Is is not obvious that that is the source from which we should derive our income? The improvements which are effected by our agriculturists and by our people on the buildings they erect are the things which should be relieved from rates.  I am firmly convinced that there is going to be no satisfactory adjustment of local taxation until we make up our minds that there will be no taxes on the improvements which we effect in our property, on the houses we build, the new windows we put in or the stables we build.  All these things are intended to improve the amenities of the community and the effectiveness of our agriculturists and should be free of rates.</P>
      <P>We have this relief of rates, part of which, of course, is given as an inducement for the employment of labour. There is no obligation, however, on the farmer to pay an adequate wage to the workman he employs, and if he employs his own children he probably pays them nothing.  We are giving relief from what?  We are simply tricking ourselves if we give away a sum of money in answer to an agitation which we do not understand and which we make no effort to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many things could be done for agriculture with this sum of money which would be much more beneficial for our agriculturists and the community than what is being achieved now if we were to spend it in providing fertilisers free or almost free, or in providing transport, free, or almost free, to take our agricultural products to the markets in <Col N="1869" /> good condition and to bring to the farmer lime, fertilisers, farm implements and the other things which he needs.  If we were to do that, I suggest that we would be giving very much more service to the farming community than simply by doing out certain sums of money in an unfair ratio as between one class of the farming community and another.  The person, for instance, whose land is highly valued and who is in comfortable circumstances gets very substantial relief under this scheme, but the poor cottier or small farmer in Donegal, Kerry or Connemara gets a flea bite out of the total sum allocated.  I am sorry if I have held up the House, but I am raising these points with the Parliamentary Secretary in the hope that, if by any misfortune this Government should be returned at the next general election, there will be a new approach to the whole problem of agricultural organisation and of the manner in which relief is to be brought to the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter's speech took me completely by surprise.  As a representative of the farming community one would have thought that he would have cheered when he heard set forth the proposals in this Bill and of the numerous grants that are to be given for the relief of rates.  But, instead, he says it is not enough.  Nothing is enough.  What does the Senator think of the sum of over £3,000,000 given each year to bring about a reduction in the rates?  That is a colossal sum.  Senator Duffy referred to it as feeding the dog with a bit of his own tail.  Was there ever such a misdescription? Senator Duffy, I am sure, knows pretty well that the farmers practically pay no income-tax, and that this money which is given for the relief of rates is provided for the farmers from the Central Fund.  The farmers are treated with the greatest possible consideration.  They have fixed prices for wheat, barley, oats, beet and practically every agricultural product.  They are getting sums of money for their produce now that they had never dreamt of before.  I know it is impossible to get wheaten straw at 6/- per cwt. or £6 per ton.  I remember the <Col N="1870" /> time when it could be bought for 9d. or 10d. a cwt. and when, possibly, you could get it for nothing if you would cart it away.  In the turf areas people are making fortunes from turf, and along by the sea coast they are making fortunes from seaweed.  A man told me a year or two ago that he could not come in to see me on a very important matter because he was engaged making £5 a day on the sale of seaweed.  There was never so much money in the country as there is to-day, and yet, when everything is being done for the farmer, we are told that not enough is being done for him.  I think it was in 1935 that the Government first introduced this scheme for the relief of rates.  It was about that time that they doubled the agricultural grant.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into that.  If I were to do so we might put the boot on the right foot and show who was accountable for that, as I did on more than one occasion.  This Government, anyway, have done everything possible to help the farmer.  I do not know what more they could do. Senator Duffy asks why not give the farmers fertilisers.  Are not fertilisers being purchased for them?  The Government are providing big grants in order to reduce the price of fertilisers for farmers.  He also asked why not give them lime.  The county committees of agriculture provide free lime to some farmers.  As a matter of fact, they would not take it when it was offered to them.</P>

      <P>The presentation of the Bill gives an opportunity to the Parliamentary Secretary to explain some rather peculiar anomalies.  In connection with a Bill before the House some time ago, I made some inquiries, and I found that some towns are eligible for this Agricultural Grant while others are not.  I also found that comparing towns with comparatively small populations with those of larger populations the proportion of relief in respect of rates on agricultural land allowed in the case of smaller towns is, in some cases, considerably less than that allowed in the case of larger towns.  That anomaly was continued in that Act.  It seems to be very curious that this measure should be limited mainly to land outside urban areas.  Why should not relief be given in respect of agricultural land in all urban areas under the Act?  I have not gone very closely into the matter recently, but if relief is given in respect of agricultural land situated in some urban areas, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give the figures regarding such relief.  There is no logical reason why a man carrying on agricultural operations in an area styled urban should not get relief just as the man carrying on similar work outside does.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will explain the situation as I have found very peculiar circumstances associated with this whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would appear to be some justification for the suggestion made by Senator Duffy, that, instead of an Act continued from year to year as at present, there should be one definite comprehensive measure governing the whole arrangement.  There has been a good deal of talk about the benefits derived by the farmer from Government sources, the Central Fund and so on, but does the whole thing not boil down to a very simple point that, if you highly rate the farmer, he must in turn increase very largely his prices and therefore people who might save in the form of income-tax will have to pay in another form?  It is only throwing dust in the eyes of the people to make claims regarding these grants which will not bear examination. <Col N="1872" /> Payment must be made in one form or another.  They are a kind of dole in a way and normally should not be necessary.  The proper method would be to secure decent prices for the farmer and let him stand on his own feet&mdash;enable him to pay as everybody does.  If we do not pay in the form of increased prices, we do in the form of increased income-tax and so, on balance, things would be essentially the same.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to enter into a long discursive debate on Government agricultural policy, but I should like to make a few observations on certain things which have been said here.  In relation to growing charges for health services, Senator Baxter seems to have forgotten that the Minister for Health is now going to pay the increased cost of health services until the State contribution is equal to the contribution of the local authorities, so that that is a form of additional benefit.  Secondly, the Senator spoke of the rates increasing in County Cavan.  Unfortunately, I have not got the figures for the rates levied off agricultural land by counties over a period of years but, although some farmers may have to pay more on their agricultural land, I think that far more will be paying less, or the same amount.  In a recent publication by the Roscommon County Manager, he gave an example of the effect of the Agricultural Grant on a farm valued at £17 10s. 0d., no person being employed on it.  The net amount payable, on a rate of 13/9, was £7 1s. 11d. in 1943.  In 1948, on a rate of 17/4, this farmer paid £6 1s. 0d., so that in fact they are paying less.  If one examines the totals of the rates levied, I think it can be said that a very large number of farmers will certainly not be paying any more than they paid three or four years ago, and some will pay less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy asked what was going to be the general policy of the Government with regard to this rate relief.  So far as I know, the Government intend to continue the primary and secondary allowances.  They had thought it might be possible to reduce this amount in respect of the employment allowance &mdash;that would be something like £615,000 <Col N="1873" /> out of a total of something over £3,000,000&mdash;but that was because we anticipated the establishment of normal conditions.  One would think, listening to Senator Baxter, that I had no conception of the difficulties through which farmers are passing.  I am well aware of their difficulties.  I represent an agricultural community, and I go down there and see the farmers.  I quite understand the position of farmers who had to till their land year after year and face appalling losses during the winter.  My whole point was that this was in aid of their difficulties and a number of other contributions had been made by the Government to help them.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made here that fertilisers should be given free.  The Government are giving considerable grants towards fertilisers.  If one were to examine the additional grants given by the Government which relate directly to the improvement of the soil and the maintenance of the fertility of the soil, one would find that in the current year a total of £1,250,000 is being granted in respect of subsidies for fertilisers, for lime, for repair of farm roads and drains under the rural improvement scheme, bog development work schemes, minor relief schemes and the very large grant of £350,000 for the farm improvements scheme.  In addition to that, large sums are contributed by the State in order that farmers can secure a reasonable price for their turf and further sums are being expended for turf development generally.  All in all, one could say that, exclusive of a number of different grants, at least £6,000,000 is being granted this year to encourage the development of the soil and its fertility, the production of turf and to enable farmers to repair their roads.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy suggested that the rate relief was of no fundamental value to the farmer.  He should propose a resolution advocating the abolition of the rate relief.  He would soon get his answer from the farmers.  Every person in an agricultural community well knows the one difficulty faced by the farmer is the paying of the rate, the big sum he has to give out and the measures he has to take to save the <Col N="1874" /> money&mdash;the selling of portion of the stock for the payment of the rate.  The psychological inducement to the farmer of rating relief is enormous and farmers, I feel quite sure, appreciate it.  Although the contributions from the central fund have to be defrayed from taxation, I do not believe the farmers are under the impression that they pay the whole of the £3,000,000 in the form of increased taxes.  They know well that it is spread over the whole community&mdash;manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers and people living in towns&mdash;and that therefore it should result in a net assistance to them, even though it must be admitted they are bound to pay some small portion of it.</P>
    <P>The whole of the rating relief principle is meant to enable the farmer to increase his production and to reduce the first heavy net charge upon his production, a factor which he appreciates. The total rates, as I have already indicated, leviable off agricultural land have decreased since 1945-46 when they went down from £3,000,000 odd to £2,750,000.  I consider that an excellent thing, and if farm income should decrease as a result of a fall in prices, we will at least have the consolation of having, in the first instance, reduced the percentage of rates levied off agricultural land as a percentage of farm income, so that, if farm income should fall, the effect will not be so serious upon the farmer.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly asked a question about urban districts and boroughs. The Local Government Act, 1946, regulates the rating of land in urban districts and boroughs on a uniform basis.  In boroughs, three-quarters of the valuation of land is assessed to the municipal rate.  In other urban districts, three-fifths of the valuation is assessed to the municipal rate.  Where an urban district was created or extended since 1898, the agricultural grant is paid into the municipal fund. There is a transition arrangement by which all land in urban districts will gradually be brought to the common standard.</P>
