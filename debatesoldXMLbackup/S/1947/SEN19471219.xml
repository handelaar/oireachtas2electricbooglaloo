    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 46, after the word &ldquo;time&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;by order&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think the purpose of my amendment is self-evident.  I raised this matter yesterday and said that, as far as I understood the section, it gave the Minister absolute power to add or withdraw the health service entirely in his own discretion.  I consider that a very dangerous and far-reaching power.  He may say he is going to exercise it only to a minor degree. We cannot look at legislation in that way, we have to look at the full implications of the statute.  There is the same old grievance that what a sensible man as Minister may do is one thing and what a less sensible man may do is another.  We have to look at it at its worst and at its worst it is a very dangerous section as it stands.</P>
      <P>I have attempted to bring it into line with general regulations and to give the Oireachtas some control over the Minister's action&mdash;very slight, as I admit, because some of us think that the control given over the power of regulation is totally inadequate; but there it is, we have to be content with that, as far as it goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this section is to ensure control, not when a Minister adds a service&mdash;I do not see much danger there&mdash;but when he takes away a service. He may take away a service in whole or in part; as far as I can see, he <Col N="1878" /> may declare that one hospital is not worthy of a grant or ceases to be a recognised health service, while another is allowed to continue; or he might say that a service in one health authority is permitted and a similar service in another health authority is denied.  That is not fantastic.  We know by experience that when authority gets these wide powers it is very inclined in certain cases to abuse them.  The object of this amendment is, first of all, that the withdrawal of a health service should be done by Order; and the second amendment provides that the Order should be laid on the Table in the usual form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I must agree with the Senator that his amendment is reasonable or appears to be reasonable, I want, however, to appeal to him to listen to me and hear the difficulties which it might make for us to have an amendment of this kind brought in at this stage.  The coming financial year is very close at hand, and though the Senator may say that he is not concerned with that, I want to outline how the thing is going to work.  We have to give directions, if at all possible, to the local authorities before the end of December because they have to make their estimates for the coming year.  I have seen a draft of the circular and the list which is being prepared on the assumption that the Bill will pass both Houses.  It is a long, cumbrous document, running into several pages, and deals with the various services which are recognised under this Bill, and it will indicate, therefore, to the local authorities what they will presume to estimate.</P>
      <P>So far, of course, the Senator's amendment would not affect us, but I would say this, that if, in taking back any of these things, we did it rather hurriedly and had to face both Houses of the Oireachtas to have the regulations taken back, we would have to be very much more particular in regard to the circular and the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must amalgamate the staffs of the boards of health and the county councils and there may be individual clerks working partly for the health services and partly in local government <Col N="1879" /> work.  The direction will be that the work of such clerks will have to be apportioned and also the expenditure, and the Minister will have to have some say in whether he believes the apportionment to be correct or not. The auditor will come along at some future time and will have to review all that the local authority has done.  He will have to decide whether, in his opinion, the work and the salary have been properly apportioned or not between the health services and local government.  If the auditor thinks that it has been done unfairly and that the local authority is putting down more salary than the health service, we may have to see that the local authority cuts down the amount allowed.  It would be very hard to come to that decision by means of regulations as regulations would be a very cumbersome way to deal with it.  For a few years anyway&mdash;for we hope to have separate staffs in a few years' time&mdash; it would be a very cumbersome method to have to bring in regulations to see whether, for instance, a certain health authority had put down £10 more on the health side of a clerical officer's work than it should have.  I think that the Senator will agree that the auditor must be, if not the final arbitrator, at least the final adviser in this apportionment.</P>
    <P>I do not think it could be possible, even if a Minister were so, let us say, malignant, to cut out a certain hospital because the directions go to the local authorities in general and lay down what is to be done with all hospitals and all institutions.  I do not think that we could differentiate between one local authority and another because the circular goes to all local authorities in general.</P>
    <P>Senators have suggested, and the argument is sometimes used, that a sensible Minister may do so and so but that a Minister might come who is not sensible.  If the Dáil ever elects a Minister who is not sensible it is no use trying to provide beforehand for keeping him right.  They must put up with him and that is all.  I am afraid that an amendment like this is not going to give him sense whatever else <Col N="1880" /> it may do.  I do not think there could possibly be anything in what the Senator said because all these regulations will be general and will go to all the local authorities.  The present appeal I want to make to the Senator is to consider what a colossal job it is now to notify all the local authorities of the very, very long list of things which they might regard as health services. When we get the replies from the local authorities we may have to make amendments, maybe very small amendments, and for a year or two anyway until we get things straightened out, it might be better to leave a free hand.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say to the Senator that up to the moment, whatever Government has been in power, whether a British Government or a native one, grants have been given to local authorities entirely at the discretion of the Minister.  That is not to say, of course, that he could use his discretion in an unjust or unfair way. Up to this the Minister has the authority to say how a scheme, let us take the milk scheme, the venereal diseases scheme or the tuberculosis scheme, should be worked, the various items that should be put in to have recognition given to them and the items which might have the effect of withdrawing recognition.</P>
    <P>The matter of grants for health services to local authorities has been worked, up to the moment, on the basis that Senator Sir John Keane thinks it would be a mistake to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very plausible.  It is a pleasure to debate with him but he evaded the principle altogether.  He simply says that he wants these absolute powers on account of administrative difficulties.  If we had time I am perfectly certain we could find some means of giving him power to adjust matters as between the various authorities.  However, as we have not time, that is another matter.  It is the penalty for having to do our business in such a hurry.  I cannot see my way to depart from the stand I have taken.  I consider that the powers the Minister is seeking are dangerous.  If they are going to be used as he says, well and good, they <Col N="1881" /> are reasonable; but that is not what they carry.  They carry very wide powers indeed.  I am not going to take up the time of the House any longer. I have made my protest and while I thank the Minister for his courtesy I cannot say that I agree with his argument.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I gathered from the report, the Minister was not very explicit in regard to the policy of meeting deficits of voluntary hospitals.  I take it voluntary hospitals are entirely a health service and that they will come under the regulations. Perhaps the Minister might at this stage say when we may expect the main body of the regulations.  I take it that, in the main, the deficits will be health service.  Could the Minister give us any forecast of his policy with regard to any differentiation between hospitals?  He said that some are much more extravagant than others. I have been on a hospital board and I have seen circulars which were sent out enjoining economy.</P>
      <P>If there is going to be any discretion the matter would require much more deliberate investigation than the commission have hitherto contemplated.  A hospital may appear to be more expensive than another but it may, possibly, be able to give a very good explanation. I do not want to widen the debate unduly but could the Minister, at this stage, give any indication of his policy with regard to meeting the deficits of voluntary hospitals and of the way in which he proposes to differentiate between those which he regards as better managed and less well managed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not deal with the question of voluntary hospitals. I suppose it might touch on them if, say, the local authority were paying for certain people in the voluntary hospitals.  It would then lay down what part the local authority should pay and what part the State should pay.  Voluntary hospitals, as such, do not come under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> What I said with regard to deficits, I think, was that they vary very much. Some of them are much higher than others.  It would, therefore, appear that some voluntary hospitals are more extravagant, if you like, than others which are able to get along without a deficit.  I have not had time or, in fact, been able to think of any way of dealing with that problem.  Within the past few days I have authorised the payment of the deficits for 1946 which were lately presented.  We may be able to have the question considered.  However, I can assure the Senator that we would not come to any definite conclusion with regard to these deficits without consulting the voluntary hospitals themselves.  In fact, I should even like to ask the voluntary hospitals to come together to make some suggestion because some of the deficits, especially, are getting very high and I should like the matter to be regularised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather uneasy as to what the Minister says.  Am I right in saying that the deficits of the voluntary hospitals will not be a charge upon this contemplated increase of £5,000,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far, they are paid out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the deficit to be the subject of a separate Vote over and above the sum of roughly £5,000,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The deficits are paid out of the Hospitals Trust Fund so far and, therefore, they do not come before the House as an Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very important. The Minister is going to alienate the capital of the Hospitals Trust and the foundation of the present income will, therefore, go.  Where is the new income to come from?  I thought it was going to come out of part of these health services for which the Minister contemplates, over a period of ten years, a further expenditure of between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000.  Am I wrong in saying that the hospital deficits will be included in that sum or will they have to come from entirely new sources, presumably to be voted by the Oireachtas, over and above the finance <Col N="1883" /> contemplated in this Bill and completely divorced from the Hospitals Trust capital which is going to be alienated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a simple matter. If the local authorities were to pay for the patients within their own areas in the voluntary hospitals and pay what would be regarded as a fair amount per week then one would expect that there should be no deficit in a voluntary hospital. The matter will not be solved as easily as that, however, because there will still be a deficit.  That is the problem to which I do not see any easy solution. We certainly shall have to consider, within the next year or two, the long-term way of dealing with these deficits.  I have no intention of solving that matter myself without consulting the voluntary hospitals before coming to any conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pursue the matter any further beyond saying that I consider that the Minister's statement will create considerable anxiety among the voluntary hospitals because he has in mind no fund from which a deficit can be met.  It is left to the uncertain future.  If I understand the Minister correctly the position is that where a voluntary hospital comes under a regional authority its expenses can be met under this Bill.  The point is that most of the voluntary hospitals are in Dublin.  They certainly cannot all come under the finance of whatever the Dublin health authority may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking really without accurate knowledge of how the new scheme is going to work.  Obviously, as the Minister knows, the grants coming from the corporation will go a very small way indeed to meet the deficits of the voluntary hospitals.  I hesitate to widen the scope of this debate but it can be argued that the sweeps were started in the first instance for the voluntary hospitals.  Under this measure they are being taken over entirely by the State and the voluntary hospitals are being left out in the cold, as far as I can see, if the idea is to leave them on the long finger and use the money which was originally intended <Col N="1884" /> for them to build fresh hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I feel that that is a self-contained subject which should be dealt with in a separate debate.  I think the Minister has said quite enough to make the hospitals rather anxious about their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last stage, I wish to raise one point of principle. Is the Minister satisfied that in this broad question of health we are maintaining a satisfactory balance between health and housing?  A great many people believe that the long-term remedy to better health, or the main contribution to better health, is better housing.  As long as housing is as we know it a large amount of this heavy expenditure now contemplated will be wasted.  Is not the expenditure now contemplated under this Bill rather staggering?  It represents a capital debt of £300,000,000.  Nine million a year at 3 per cent. represents £300,000,000.  That is a very big sum. It is a question for serious consideration as to whether it would not be better to spend substantially more on housing and thereby avoid having to spend so much on health.  The two problems are closely allied.  There should be no need to spend £9,000,000. We assume that that £9,000,000 will be spent over the next nine years.  One might argue that if people are normally healthy nothing like that sum <Col N="1885" /> should be needed.  Much better health could be secured by better housing.  The two services&mdash;health and housing&mdash;are interlocked.  I would ask the Minister, now that his Department is being reorganised, to consult with his colleagues in an effort to discover whether we are really maintaining a proper balance between housing and health. Both have a bearing&mdash;one a short term and the other a long term&mdash;on our national health.  It is a very important matter.  It is no good pretending that we are grand people in spending £9,000,000 on health.  By spending substantially more on housing we could improve the general health of the community in a more satisfactory way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is something more in this than appears from the statement made by Senator Sir John Keane.  Not merely are health and housing interlocked, but health, housing and nutrition are interlocked.  It is not sufficient to spend a million or two on housing unless at the same time we raise the standard of living of those who are to occupy these houses so that they can afford to pay the rent required without cutting into the amount of food consumed by themselves and their families.  I think that is one of the most important problems of this age. We have adopted a rather extraordinary method of solving it by divorcing the services, the one from the other.  Up to the 1st of January one Minister was responsible for health and housing.  We have now made sure that there will no longer be one Minister in charge of health and housing.  We have created a new Ministry of Health under the charge of a Minister whose function it is to look more or less objectively at health while the big factor towards the creation of good health, housing, is the function of a totally different Minister. The Minister who will be responsible for housing and who will determine the rents charged by local authorities has now no responsibility for health.  It will be no part of his function to consider whether a new housing scheme is going to involve an increase in rents that will force many thousands of workmen to purchase one or two loaves of bread less per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the present Minister for <Col N="1886" /> Health is responsible for a nutritional survey which has now been going on for some considerable time.  I do not know whether any results have accrued from that investigation.  I do not know whether the Minister has been able to form any general opinion as to the condition of public health.  I would urge very strongly on the Minister and on this House that in voting large sums of money for health services we should ensure that steps are taken to protect the health of the community and to prevent illness rather than merely to provide hospitals.  In nearly all our relations with these problems we seem always to look at the wrong end.  We are prepared to spend large sums of money on building new streamlined hospitals, but we are not prepared to spend anything worth while on maintaining the people in good health rather than in curing them when they fall ill.  Notoriously, malnutrition is prevalent in this country. Tuberculosis is also prevalent.  I submit that tuberculosis or rickets or any of these other ailments so much talked about to-day are due almost entirely to two causes&mdash;under-nourishment and bad housing.  We are simply throwing money down the drain so long as we vote these large sums for a health service which in fact is not a health service at all, but a patchwork quilt created by people for the cure of illness, while they are reluctant to spend a penny on preventing the people falling into disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>The speeches we have just listened to would suggest that we may be putting the cart before the horse.  I have no fear about that in respect of the present Minister because, as Minister for Agriculture for very many years, he was well acquainted with conditions in rural Ireland.  I am sure that nobody holds more firmly than he does that the health of the people is built up in the homes of the people, which is the burden of the speeches we have heard.  That is so true that even the blindest must accept it.  The Minister is convinced, as Senator Duffy reminded us, that the homes of the people can only be kept in proper condition and a family properly nourished by good schemes of <Col N="1887" /> employment.  Another thing is that the women should be properly trained to run a home.  The health of the people will be guaranteed to a large extent if we have good homes and proper employment for the men in order to provide for those homes and keep them and proper teaching for the women to run the homes.  Proper teaching includes elementary instruction in the maintenance of health.  That is very important and part of the Health Bill is devoted to that.  I have great hopes that in the hands of the present Minister, with his acquaintance with the rural conditions of the country, that will be looked after.  It is fantastic to think that because the Minister is in charge of one Department he is not interested in another Department.  We must remember that there is Cabinet responsibility and that they all work together.  I am quite sure that Ministers contribute, each his own share, to the discussions for making this country what the Health Bill and other Bills aim at, namely, a place of happy homes well run by competent women, well kept by men in good employment trained to habits of hard work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to agree, if you like, with the principles laid down by the speakers, but I certainly am not going to agree with their conclusions that nothing is being done about certain things.  Surely no Senator can say that nothing is being done about housing.  The Minister for Local Government is straining at the leash to get another Housing Bill through and giving very generous grants under the new Housing Bill.  I think that since Governments were set up here every effort was made to get houses built for the people.  Therefore, housing is being carried out at the same time.  Do Senators think that I should have done nothing and said: &ldquo;Wait until all the houses are there and then I will bring in my health measures in 20 or 30 or 40 years' time?&rdquo; Naturally they are brought in at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy said that we are trying to cure illness instead of preventing it.  The whole object underlying the Health Act of 1947 was to prevent <Col N="1888" /> disease.  The mother and child welfare scheme, the infectious diseases provisions and so on were all on the prevention side.  It is not notorious, as Senator Duffy said, that malnutrition is rampant in this country.  It is a fact that people in this country are better nourished than the people in most other countries in the world.  There is not the slightest doubt about that.</P>

      <P>I do not care what reports I read.  The Senator should read the report on national income and the distribution of food in this country as compared with other countries.  There is a higher standard of nourishment here than in most other countries.  We should be proud of that fact and should not use the opposite as an election stunt.  We are trying to improve the health of the people and trying to prevent them from falling into disease.  We are trying to improve housing.  In spite of what I said, there is much room still for improvement in regard to nutrition of the people.  We are getting a nutritional survey carried out.  I think the result for Dublin should be ready soon, but the result for the whole of the country will not be ready for about 12 months.  If that survey discloses that improvements can be effected, it will be up to us to do what we can.</P>

      <P>This is an interim measure pending a more comprehensive examination of the legislation governing sanitary matters and sanitary services and also pending a further consolidation of the existing law.  On the formation of the Ministry of Health it became necessary to separate the sections of the Health Bill which related to measures for improving and maintaining sanitary services and creating a sanitary environment from those sections concerned with the maintenance of conditions conducive to public health.  This Bill is a result of that separation.  The Bill provides for the development of improved standards of sanitation.  Now that advances have been made generally in regard to health and hygiene, it is felt most desirable that standards in regard to sanitation should also be improved throughout the country.  It is not possible for us to get a complete consolidation of the sanitary law at present but in this Bill the code has been divided into separate subjects and consolidation can be effected by stages.  There are seven distinct Parts in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Parts II and III relate to sewerage and water supplies.  It is our intention to strengthen the powers of local authorities in regard to the connection of premises throughout the country with public sewers and water supplies. In the last 15 years, 350 sewerage systems have been installed and 500 water supply systems have been constructed throughout the country.  At the present moment, 190 such schemes are in course of preparation and in course of planning.  Others will be coming along in the near future.  The legislation regulating the connection of premises either with a sewerage system or a water supply is wholly obsolete having regard to modern standards of hygiene.  At present owners of premises may be compelled to connect their drainage to the public drainage system only if not even a minimum of drainage exists.  The intention of this Bill is to ensure that such owners be compelled to connect their premises, save under appeal to the Minister, even if they have systems such as cesspools or other systems of drainage which do not conform with modern hygienic practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1891" /> A simplified procedure has been introduced in this Bill in regard to this matter.  Owing to the fact that there has been a great deal of litigation in the past over the responsibilities of owners for joining their sewerage system with the public sewerage system, it is impossible for us at this stage to say whether the procedure as outlined in the Bill will be entirely successful, and the Minister envisages a continuing examination of this whole matter and of later bringing before the Oireachtas a further Bill, partly in the light of the experience gained, partly as a result of being able to effect further consolidation, and partly because we are not yet satisfied that this Bill will do all we want it to do.  We do think that it is very important that local authorities should be able to begin the work of improving sanitation immediately.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill sanitary authorities may require owners of premises to carry out specified works for the connection of their premises with the public sewerage, for the connection of separate premises or for connecting premises having some common connection with one another.  That applies both to sewerage and water supplies. If, in the course of the works required for making connections, more than 100 feet of water supply pipes or more than 100 feet of sewerage drains have to be laid, the sanitary authority will provide the costs in excess of that 100 feet If a number of houses are to be connected to a common drain, the sanitary authority will be responsible for the cost of laying the drain in excess of 100 feet for each premises.  If a number of premises belonging to the same owner are to be connected, the local authority will be responsible for the construction of the length of drain represented by the excess over 100 feet multiplied by the number of premises. In other words, if there are five houses owned by the same person and the total length of drain for connection purposes is 600 feet, the owner will pay for 500 feet (5 × 100) and the sanitary authority will pay for the excess of 100 feet.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill requires some <Col N="1892" /> explanation particularly in respect to Sections 10 and 11.  Under the Act of 1878, drains constructed for joining more than one premises to a public sewer were vested in the sanitary authority and the sanitary authority became responsible for such repairs as were necessary.  I want to make that quite clear.  Where there was a public sewer running along through a particular area and a number of houses became connected by another side drain with the sewer, the sanitary authority was made responsible for the upkeep, maintenance and repair of these drains.  As a result a legal distinction arose between the term &ldquo;sewer&rdquo; and the term &ldquo;drain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As soon as a drain became a sewer, in legal parlance, the sanitary authority became responsible for its upkeep and repair.  When a number of premises which had previously separate drainage became connected, the drain became a sewer or what was equivalent to a sewer for legal purposes.  One might ask: &ldquo;When is a drain not a drain?&rdquo; and get the appropriate answer: &ldquo;The higher the fewer.&rdquo;  I should say that it would be absolutely impossible for me to answer obscure legal questions but the many cases that have been heard in the courts on this matter&mdash; there is a stack of them under the appropriate authorities in the books and records&mdash;show that there has been a great deal of litigation over this whole question.  The effect of this arrangement was to minimise the liability of builders in regard to the construction of a drain pipe leading from a separate house to a sewer that had already been laid by the public authority.</P>
    <P>In 1890 a Bill was passed and in Section 19 of that measure an attempt was made to remedy the position.  Where two or more houses belonging to separate owners were connected by one drain, the arrangement was that the sanitary authority could recover from the owners any expense incurred in remedying nuisances or defects in the drain&mdash; that is, where the houses belonged to separate owners.  That Bill gave the lawyers more work and added to the difficulties.  It did not deal with houses <Col N="1893" /> belonging to the same owner whose drains were connected to a public sewer and, further, some of the houses might be sold to another person.  You would have four houses belonging to one owner and in the middle there would be one house belonging to a second individual. Further, the section did not deal with the distinction between remedying a nuisance and repairing or making good a fundamental defect in the drainage system.  Nuisances could be remedied, but the question arose whether the Act applied to fundamental defects.</P>
    <P>In Part II of this Bill a single private drain leading from one house to a public sewer continues to be defined in the same way in order to avoid making a different judicial interpretation; in fact, in order to avoid making legal difficulties.  The big change that has taken place is that the owner of a number of premises is now liable to remedy nuisances and fundamental defects in a drainage system.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that, under the 1890 Act, in the case of houses belonging to separate owners, the Act made it clear that the owners were responsible. The present Bill makes it clear in the case of premises belonging to the same owner.  The liability to maintain and repair drainage also applies to buildings that are not dwelling houses. Under previous legislation the owner of a building not a dwelling house was not responsible for the maintenance of the drain.  I might add that a number of municipalities in other countries have included provisions of this kind in private Bills for drainage purposes.</P>
    <P>Another improvement in the law is that local authorities may now open drains in order to see whether a nuisance has occurred and examine nuisances reported to them without an individual making a complaint, whereas, formerly, some individual had to make a complaint in a proper form before the local authority could open the drain for the purpose of examination.</P>
    <P>There are all the usual provisions for appeal in these matters and it will be noticed that time is given to owners <Col N="1894" /> of premises to pay for the connection of their drainage with the public drainage, if the sanitary authority does the work as a result of their failure to do so.</P>
    <P>In connection with the improvement of water supplies, under previous legislation no account was taken of improved standards.  There was no proper means by which owners could appeal against a decision that their premises must be connected with a public water supply.  The same held good in regard to buildings that are not dwellinghouses.  They did not come under the provisions of previous Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 26 in Part III provides a valuable aid to the improvement of sanitation.  It gives powers to the sanitary authorities to improve or contribute to the improvement of existing small water supplies.  Everybody coming from a rural constituency will realise that that may be very valuable in the future.</P>
    <P>In Section 27 power is given to a local authority to analyse water belonging to a private water supply.  That power has not hitherto been available and it should result in the provision of purer water supplies in many places in the country.  So much for Parts II and III.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>It concerns an absolutely private water supply.  Part IV of the Bill makes provision for the regulation of camping.  The only existing law on the matter is contained in the section of the Local Government Act of 1925 framed to deal with itinerants.  In recent years camping has increased in popularity and it appears likely to develop more and more.  The Bill proposes to empower sanitary authorities to make by-laws in regard to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 34 makes special provision in regard to semi-permanent camping grounds to which large numbers of campers resort, and requires the landowner who lets ground for this purpose to secure a licence from the sanitary <Col N="1895" /> authority.  The licence must include conditions in regard to the matters set out in Section 34 (6).  Section 34 will have force only in areas to which it is applied by Order of the Minister; in other words, the Minister will have some discretion in preventing licensing which might be required because of some busybody.  The matter will be examined with great care in order to ensure that there is good reason for enabling the sanitary authority to provide licensing of this kind.</P>
    <P>Even when the section is applied it will be open to the landowner to allow his land to be used for camping without a licence for 18 consecutive days or for shorter periods aggregating 36 days in any year.  The House will appreciate that this will not prevent those people who like to wander in lonely places from camping in caravans and tents far from the madding crowd and far from tourist resorts.  Those people will still have reasonable liberty to do that because it is very unlikely they will ever arrive at a place where a farmer has allowed camping to take place over the period of 36 days in respect of a number of other campers.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for a licence direct to a camping organisation recognised as such by the Minister, so that if reputable camping organisations desire licences to camp in a certain place the Minister can provide them with that facility.</P>
    <P>Part V relates to bathing places and represents a completely amended and consolidated code.  Here we have effected a very large measure of consolidation. The existing law is based on such old Acts as the Baths and Wash-houses Act of 1846, the Town Improvement Act, 1854, and the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1907.  Part V will confer powers to provide public baths on all sanitary authorities and will enable the sanitary authorities to establish these amenities at a convenient distance outside their own districts.</P>
    <P>This power will also facilitate the provision of open-air swimming pools. The House will agree that such a measure is desirable at the present <Col N="1896" /> time.  The Bill also gives power to provide and maintain life-saving appliances and for the employment of life guards and the construction of swimming pools.  The sanitary authorities will also be able to arrange for instruction in swimming and rescue from drowning and to contribute to societies which include in their objects the rescue of persons from drowning.  The House will recollect the tragedies and fatalities that have occurred around our coast in recent years.  This Bill will enable sanitary authorities to have full powers to take all the measures necessary in this regard.</P>
    <P>The provision in relation to swimming pools is rather costly and we feel that the resources of town commissioners would be generally inadequate for the provision of these services. This is mentioned in the Bill.  Provision, however, is made in the Bill to enable town commissioners who have already provided baths to continue to maintain them.  For others, the cost will have to be met from the larger area of the authority.</P>
    <P>Part VI consolidates the existing law in relation to burials but it introduces no substantial or far-reaching changes in the present position.  The provisions are intended to remedy flaws and shortcomings to which notice has been directed and to clarify obscure points.</P>
    <P>Part VII contains a number of miscellaneous provisions intended to remedy a variety of defects or gaps in the existing sanitary laws.  The various sections can best be discussed in Committee.</P>
    <P>This Bill is proof of the intention of the Government to raise standards of living throughout the country and may be regarded as being in line with the Health Act and the Housing Bill now passing through this House.  It is unnecessary for me to stress to members of the House the importance of installing efficient drainage systems and also adequate water supplies wherever possible.  The powers to be conferred by this Bill, we believe, will simplify administration and hasten the provision of amenities and conveniences of many kinds.  The Minister is very anxious that the Bill should become law as soon as possible and, as I have said, <Col N="1897" /> it is only a first step.  It will probably be followed by more comprehensive measures later on but it does represent a considerable advance.  There are at this moment in many towns houses not connected with the public water supply or with the sewerage installed in the town.  This Bill will enable that position to be remedied.  The cost to the owner in the ordinary way will not be very great and if the work is carried out by a sanitary authority, the owner having refused to take the necessary steps, under an arrangement whereby there is a private improvement charge levied in addition to the rates upon the owner concerned, the expenditure can be paid over a period of 30 years at an interest of 5 per cent.  Those people who know the cost of connecting drainage will realise that that is not an undue charge for the average house-owner to bear.</P>
    <P>In any event, there are ample appeal provisions in the Bill which should make it possible for sanitary authorities that take a reasonable attitude, at the same time, to give to the owner of the ground opportunity of appeal if he considers that he is unfairly treated or if he considers that his private water supply or sewerage is adequate and that he need not be connected with the public supplies.  I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With a great deal of what is in this Bill I am in agreement. With some of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, I am also in agreement, particularly when he said that the law in regard to drainage and so forth was so chaotic that he was not going to answer any posers on the subject. Quite frankly, it would be just as difficult to put the posers as to give the answers.  The law in that respect is so unsatisfactory that it is desirable, and has been desirable for a long time, that it should be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that this Bill is an interim Bill and therefore it, perhaps, can be dealt with slightly differently from the way in which you would deal with a Bill that was going to be an entirely permanent measure. I have some considerable doubts about the method in which the Parliamentary <Col N="1898" /> Secretary proposes to get over some of his difficulties.  I agree with him that it is entirely undesirable that where, for example, a local authority goes to all the expense of putting in a water supply and a drainage system in a town, that there should not be a method of providing that that supply would be properly used.</P>
    <P>I am not quite happy as to the manner in which the Bill proposes to deal with that matter.  However, that may be more a question for consideration in Committee.  I am not happy either about the effect of the section in the Bill dealing with combined drains on existing combined drainage agreements.  I would like to be assured by the Parliamentary Secretary that nothing that there is in this Bill can operate so as to alter in respect of any existing combined drainage agreement the position which is at present contractual as between various owners on the one hand and local authorities on the other hand.  I think it is desirable that it should be specifically made clear that that is so because I am not quite happy about it reading the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not agree, as the House is aware, with the system of having matters affecting a person's rights and property determined behind closed doors by Government Departments. The other night I had unfortunately to be away in Kildare on certain other public business.  I had contested that principle on the Bill that was then under review just as I propose to contest the principle on this Bill and I contest it as a matter of principle. I think at least the Parliamentary Secretary will have the manners not to suggest that it was in an effort to make more business for myself that I would make any such suggestion.  His colleague, the other night, saw fit, in my absence, to be entirely personal in a way that would be despicable if it were not typical of the person concerned.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate, Sir, that I was not able to draw your attention to it at an earlier stage.  It is desirable that when it is necessary to carry out, in the public good, an infringement of what are otherwise ordinary private rights of property, there should be a method by virtue of which the person who is affected should be able to state his case in public and to have the case that is against him also stated in public, in his hearing, so that he may have a due and adequate opportunity of seeing the justice of the case against him and of seeing that he has got a fair crack of the whip.  I think that it is desirable in every case where there is an infringement and perhaps a necessary infringement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is taking in regard to this Bill certain powers in respect of the disposal of bodies and cemeteries.  I would suggest that in that regard it would be very much more advantageous if the Parliamentary Secretary would try to galvanise his Department into doing something about these matters when they are requested.  If ever a charge of delay could be laid against the Department of Local Government it could be laid against them in that regard in respect of a Kildare case that I have in mind.  In 1933, the Kildare County Council asked for the closing of the cemetery in Kildare.  In 1934, a public local inquiry was held.  In the year of grace 1947, the Department of Local Government wrote to the Kildare County Council that, having considered the result of the inquiry held in 1934, they were going to close the cemetery. I suggest that if the Department of Local Government take 13 years to move on that, the addition of Part VII to this Bill is not going to do very much <Col N="1900" /> to assist the public health of the country.</P>
    <P>There is one final observation which I want to make.  It is that there is not the slightest use in enacting laws affecting sanitary services, or any other services, unless the people who are operating those services are contented and satisfied in their positions. It is greatly to be regretted that, in regard to sanitary officers all over the country, the Department have not been able to arrange satisfactory terms with them in view of the new and altered conditions under which people are now living.  It is greatly to be regretted, for example, that those men who, in certain respects, are qualified in a specialist way are in certain cases put in a category in which they are paid less than the clerk-typists employed in county council offices.  As long as the Parliamentary Secretary permits that system to operate he has very little hope of achieving anything real or useful out of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to draw attention to Section 7 which requires the Minister to table regulations made under the Bill when it becomes an Act.  I have searched the Bill thoroughly, and I can find only one instance in which the Minister takes power to make regulations. Everything else is done by Order, and these Orders will not be tabled under the provisions of Section 7.  Therefore, it is entirely illusory to imagine that the provision relating to the tabling of regulations will have any effect whatever except in the one instance where, under Section 47, the Minister will make regulations for the &ldquo;disposal of bodies otherwise than by burial&rdquo;. Should the Minister desire at any time to make provision for the &ldquo;disposal of bodies otherwise than by burial&rdquo;, he must proceed by way of regulation. That regulation will be tabled and may be annulled.  All the other activities of the Minister under this Bill will be by Order.  There is no obligation on him to table his Orders, there is no power conferred on either House of the Oireachtas to question these Orders or to raise any point in regard to them. I do not know whether that is a deliberate evasion or not.  If there is any <Col N="1901" /> sincerity in the provision regarding the tabling of regulations, I suggest that the honest way to proceed would be to take out Section 7 and insert a new sub-section in Section 47 saying that regulations made under the section will be tabled.  As I have said, Section 47 is the only section under which regulations will be made at all.</P>
      <P>Of course, there may be another explanation for this.  It will be recalled that, originally, this Bill was the tail end of a long measure introduced by Dr. Ward in 1945.  Subsequently, there was a change of mind on the part of the Government when three Departments were carved out of the then Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The tailpieces that we got were the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department of Local Government was left with the residue.  I assume that part of the legacy was this Bill which was a tailpiece of the original Public Health Bill, and that the explanation for having Section 7 here is that it was in the original measure, that nobody bothered to see what it meant, or whether it meant anything, and so it was carried into this new Bill placidly and calmly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point that I want to raise has reference to Section 5 of the Bill. This is surely one of the most contradictory provisions that ever was inserted in a Bill of this kind.  We are told that under this Bill the laws in relation to sanitation, drainage, public health, etc., are being codified. We proceed later in the Bill to apply the whole of the 1907 Act and 1890 Act to the whole country, but in Section 5 we have this gem that &ldquo;Sections 219 to 223 of the Act of 1878 shall apply in relation to by-laws made under this Act.&rdquo;  It would not have taken the draftsman ten minutes to draft a provision to replace these sections which are adopted in this Bill.  If one turns up the Public Health Act of 1878 and reads Sections 219 to 223 one finds that they make nonsense.  The old lady, Queen Victoria, ran all over them. With her acquiescence the Chief Secretary for Ireland and the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland might do the various things set out, and all that is being shoved into an Act to be passed <Col N="1902" /> here in the year 1947.  Would it not have been a simple matter for the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to take out provisions which are now to be found in hundreds of other Acts passed by the Oireachtas relating to by-laws&mdash;the provisions, for example, inserted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Harbours Act&mdash;and insert them in here, and in that way let us know exactly the methods by which by-laws are made in relation to sanitation under this Bill?  It is a slovenly thing, purely and simply, in the tailpiece of a Public Health Bill to throw them in here without the slightest attempt at alteration.  That should not have been done when bringing this forward as a separate and independent measure.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that this Bill is not quite so clear as the Parliamentary Secretary made it appear to be. For instance, certain provisions will apply where the local authority consider that action should be taken to secure a proper drainage system.  I have been unable to find out whether the action will lie against the owner or the occupier.  Section 12, for instance, enables the sanitary authority, by order, to require the owner of separate premises to execute certain drainage works relating to the premises.  I am not quite sure against whom the proceedings will be taken. The old Public Health Act of 1878 contemplated proceedings being taken against the owner.  I am not sure whether that is so under this Bill, but I should like to draw attention to the fact that under this Bill a sanitary authority is not merely an urban council or corporation.  It also includes a county council and, therefore, power is conferred on a county council to proceed against the occupier of a lonely farmhouse requiring him to provide sanitation.  It is probably an ideal thing that that should be done, but let us make up our minds that we are conferring power on the local authority which enables them to require a farmer in an isolated area to provide drainage under Part II.</P>
    <P>It is true that, under sub-section (3) of Section 12, a sanitary authority about to make a drainage works order <Col N="1903" /> in relation to any premises must have regard to the character of the area in which the premises are situated.  I do not know what that means.  It may mean anything the Minister cares it should mean, but, in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, it is stated that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the provisions of this Part of the Bill are directed towards securing the connection of premises with sewerage systems, where these have been provided by the local authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That may be so, but I do not know any restriction in the Bill limiting the provision of that Part of the Bill to areas in which a sewerage scheme is provided by the local authority.  I do not think it is delimited in that fashion at all, and, while I have the greatest admiration for the aims of the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department in endeavouring to secure a high level of social amenities in rural Ireland, I want to draw attention to the grave difficulty which will be experienced in getting compliance with a provision of that kind and the enormous cost which will be imposed on poor people who are unable to find the money to provide even septic tanks in parts of the country. It is deplorable that it should be so, but we live in the country and we know the facts, and there is no use denying that there are thousands of small-holders in Ireland who could not afford to provide even a septic tank, if required to do so under the authority of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the provisions of Section 18.  That section is a complete departure from the existing law.  I think the existing law will be found in Section 51 of the Public Health Act, 1878, which section enables the local authority to open a drain which is a nuisance, but only on the complaint of an aggrieved person. Should it be found that the drain, when opened, is in proper condition&mdash;in other words, if the local authority has been misinformed or has acted on a defective or a malicious complaint&mdash; the costs incurred by the sanitary authority in having the drain opened <Col N="1904" /> and closed again will fall on the person making the complaint.</P>
    <P>Section 18 short circuits all this procedure. It provides that, where a sanitary authority becomes aware or suspects that a drainage system is defective, it may, after notice, open up and examine the system without further ado.  If it is found, on being opened up, to be defective, the council under this Bill may proceed at once and at the expense of the owner of the property to put the system into good condition. That is a very considerable departure from the existing practice, but what it leaves unsettled is the question as to what responsibility rests on the local authority, if, when the drain is opened up, it is found not to be defective. It is clear what will happen if the council opens up a drain which it suspects to be defective and it is found to be defective, but there is nothing to show what responsibility rests on the council should it be wrong and should it open a drain on somebody's property which, on examination, is found not to be defective.</P>
    <P>The only other section I want to refer to is Section 29, which relates to charges by sanitary authorities for supplying water.  Section 66 of the Public Health Act, 1878, authorises a sanitary authority providing a water supply to charge a water rate or it may enter into agreements with other persons for the supply of water, and so forth.  That section empowers, but does not oblige, a sanitary authority to charge water rates or water rents to persons supplied with water from a public system.  The Public Health Act, 1896, renders it obligatory on the local authority to charge rates or rents if a certain number of ratepayers ask that it should do so.  The provision in Section 29 is a complete departure from that practice.  It enables the Minister to make an Order on the application of a sanitary authority to modify the provisions of any enactment regulating the charges to be made for supplying water&mdash;that apparently applies to the supply of water to a private householder or to the local authority&mdash;or to modify the provisions of any award or agreement which determines the price to be charged for the supply of water. <Col N="1905" /> The provisions of Section 29 are very far-reaching.  They authorise a Minister by Order, which will not be tabled under Section 7, to modify any existing statute in relation to charges for water rents or water rates, to modify agreements made between one sanitary authority and another in relation to rents charged for water service.  It is true that there is one redeeming feature of this section&mdash;if the Minister thinks fit, he may hold a local inquiry before making this Order.  That is not adequate security that the section will be operated with regard to existing conditions and former practices.</P>
    <P>We have here an instance where a Minister may make an Order, deliberately called an Order so that it will not be tabled under Section 7, and, therefore, will not be capable of examination or annulment by either House of the Oireachtas, an Order which may have the effect of modifying an existing statute or an agreement made between local authorities and householders or between one sanitary authority and another.  These points require serious consideration.  We ought to see whether the Bill in its present form does not require substantial amendment, to ensure that the intentions of Parliament will be supreme and that they shall not be set aside by a Departmental Order which is incapable of annulment.</P>

      <P>This is a relatively small Bill compared with others before us lately.  Even though it may have some defects and not go as far as desired, if it did nothing more than bring about the effective control of camping it would have been justified. However, it does more than that.  We know that the growth of camping in the country has been rapid and it must be admitted that the conditions under which camps have existed up to now have been a perfect disgrace.  I am delighted to see that, under this Bill, there will be some definite control over permanent or semi-permanent camps. Again, the Bill will, I hope, stimulate the provision of public swimming baths and ordinary public baths and that in itself justifies a Bill of this kind.  It goes <Col N="1906" /> further than that.  It makes provision that the sanitary authority may provide for games.  In general, there has been a lot of complaint about the lack of amenities for our young people, particularly in the country.  This Bill, under these headings I have indicated, can make life far more attractive to the young people, apart from being far more healthy.  There is great need for properly supervised and controlled camps, with adequate bathing facilities and adequate facilities for games.</P>
      <P>There is one clause in this Bill that really puzzles me.  Section 47&mdash;and now I come from something bright to something very gloomy&mdash;provides for the disposal of remains otherwise than by burial.  As far as I know, that is taboo to the overwhelming majority of the people and I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary just what is meant.  If the section indicates provision for cremation or other forms of disposal of human remains, we should be told it in far more definite language than is contained in the section.  The Bill otherwise has tremendous attractions and I think it deserves to be welcomed.</P>

      <P>One aspect of the Bill I would like the House and the Minister to keep in mind is the conditions that exist in most small towns. I know them well, as I owned a small town.  When the Minister talks of increasing the standards, the amenities of civilisation, does he realise that he is placing on owners of a certain class of property obligations altogether out of proportion to the revenue they derive from that property?  Does he realise that, in a number of small towns, a large number of what we call the working-class houses of the older type are let at rents of 3/- and 2/- per week?  Those rents are stabilised and controlled under the Rent Restrictions Act and it may very easily take ten years' gross rent to make the necessary sanitary connections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, very heavy repairs are needed in that class of property.  The effect of this Bill is that that class of property is bound to fall into greater neglect.  I am not in a position to suggest the remedy, <Col N="1907" /> except that there should be some regard to the element of control in houses of that class.  It is reasonable enough, perhaps, to control houses when rents run into an appreciable figure, but houses with these microscopic rents should be approached by a more generous form of control. Otherwise, the properties will get into worse repair&mdash;and that is happening at present.  Some owners I know derive so little income from this class of property that they throw in their hands and make them over on nominal terms to the occupiers.  I know one case where they were handed over at a loss. This is a serious matter and deserves serious consideration.  I admit that some concession has been made by allowing the cost of these connections to be spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Do bear in mind, when we talk somewhat lightheartedly, somewhat in a crossroads spirit, of rapacious landlords in these rural areas, that many of them are striving to maintain property of a certain class which gives them no income whatever and that it is altogether out of balance to expect them to make heavy expenditure on up-to-date water and sewerage for property of that kind.  If you ask me what the remedy is, I say, do not remove the ceiling in its entirety, but put on a much higher ceiling, in view of the increase in wages and the general depreciation in money and in the rents that may be derived from that class of property. One must realise that a rent of 2/- or 3/- is utterly absurd in these days and that it would be impossible for a landlord to maintain a property at such a rent.</P>

      <P>I think that most of the Senators will disagree with Senator Duffy's disparaging remarks in regard to this Bill and his opinion that this is the tail-end of the previous legislation to combine the health services and the sanitary services and the division of the Ministry into separate Ministries for Health and for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to Senator Sweetman's remarks regarding the amenities provided under this Bill.  It <Col N="1908" /> provides for proper camping facilities, for sanitation and for, shall we say, aesthetic conditions where camps are in operation.  We have made provision for better facilities for inland and sea bathing.  I think that these are very commendable services and that we should be glad to provide for them under this Bill.  As far as the country generally is concerned, surely to allow the local authority to provide facilities for games and for the acquisition of land where games can be played is an addition to our legislation.</P>
    <P>I did not refer to the Senator's remarks about the disposal of bodies, as in the case of very infectious diseases, such a provision would have to arise and there is a clause in the section by which the provisions have to be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary's consideration of the position which will arise in large local authorities as a result of the provision for the alteration of the conditions of service of some of the authority's officers.  There is a considerable number of sanitary officers in the City of Dublin at the present moment and I fancy that most of these officers will now become health officers while some of them will continue as sanitary officers.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary's consideration of how these services will be divided and what changes will be adopted for the division of the services.  Some will be health officers and some sanitary officers, and could the one person still operate as a health officer and as a sanitary officer and carry out duties relating to both Ministries?</P>
    <P>The question of the combined drains legislation has been very involved and complicated and has caused considerable litigation up to the present.  Will the provisions of this Bill increase the cost of building?  I think that the tendency will be to provide separate drains for each house and that will mean separate connection from the drainage of each premises to the public sewer. That will, to my mind, probably increase the cost of building in urban, municipal and rural areas.  The system has been that there was a combined drain which took the drainage from a <Col N="1909" /> terrace of houses and one subsequent connection with the sewer, and I think that that would be a much cheaper system of sanitation for a terrace of houses.</P>
    <P>The trouble would be, however, that an individual householder on a terrace would be liable for damage or stoppage or any other defect in the combined drain.  I fancy that the tendency now would be to have a separate connection from each house to the main sewer, and that, to my mind, would increase the cost of building.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to enlighten me as to whether that will be a sequel to the legislation which we are passing in connection with the abolition of the combined drain system.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I require to pass any further remarks, only to commend to the House these main sections which are a great advance on any legislation which we had to cover these matters up to the present.</P>
    <P>With regard to camping sites, I think that this commendable provision should be made.</P>
    <P>The public and public representatives have often expressed the need for the provision of swimming facilities, and I think that this proposal to provide bathing facilities is a very good one, and also the power to appoint lifeguards in all sea-bathing places around the coast.  I think that Clare was first in this matter of providing lifeguards, before any other portion of the country, even the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We should congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on bringing this in, even though, as Senator Duffy remarked, it may be the tail-end of the legislation which provided for combined public health services.</P>

      <P>I rise to welcome this Bill.  My only regret&mdash;as a tail-end has been mentioned&mdash;is that this Bill has come at the end of the session.  It is a very far-reaching and comprehensive Bill, and it would take me a considerable time before I could grasp all its meaning and all its implications.  Such of them as I understood will go far to solve the many problems in urban and local sanitary affairs.  There are so <Col N="1910" /> many things locked away in it that it is hard to know where to start, but I think that Senator Donovan mentioned that the individual householder to be responsible for 100 feet of sewerage or water supply was considered bad, though, of course, in small towns it never amounts to that distance because houses are built convenient to the road.  The road runs right in front of the houses and it might be 20 feet.  I am afraid there will be some little objections to that.  I welcome the Bill. I am very pleased to see that we are making provision for swimming baths and life-saving and various services of that kind which do so much good to the public and which, in many instances, save lives.  The health of the young people will benefit a great deal by the addition of suitable swimming pools.  They are rather expensive for a local authority but, with the help of the Government, I am sure that they will become very general.</P>
      <P>This Bill is so comprehensive that I cannot refer to as many matters as I would like.  I shall simply content myself by congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on it and I hope that it will be a great success.  I should like to point out, however, that the success of this scheme, as of all other schemes, depends to a great extent on the efficiency of the service given in the engineering branch of the local Government Department.  There were times when that service was not as efficient as it might have been.  On occasions, there has been considerable difficulty in my town.  For instance, on one occasion, a plan was passed by the Local Government Department, but we found that we had to have two or three plans before the matter was finally completed.  In that regard I feel sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will see to it that, if there are any cobwebs in the boards of the Local Government Department offices, they will be brushed aside.</P>

Tá cuid mhaithe leasaithe de dhíth ar na seirbhísí poiblí seo, agus ar son sláinte an phobail is dóigh liom go mba chóir scrudú a dheánamh níos minicí orthu.

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important advance made in this Bill is that it empowers the local authority to have a sewerage and water supply within a certain distance of a house.  In the old days the principal trouble we had was that a local authority putting in a water supply or a sewerage scheme had no power to compel houses to join together unless the house was within 100 yards of the sewerage system or the water supply.  Now the local authority can bring it to within <Col N="1914" /> 100 yards and, if the owner owns six or eight houses, to within 100 yards multiplied by the number of houses.  I think that is a considerable advantage and very necessary.  It was certainly very badly required.  It is a good thing, too, to have the difference between a sewer and a drain clarified to some extent.  Under the Act of 1890, an attempt was made to combine drains for certain purposes.  I do not know that the Parliamentary Secretary has entirely solved the problem.  The difficulties may not be apparent at the moment, but I am sure that they will arise, particularly when one comes to consider the question as to what is or is not a combined drain.  You may have a terrace of houses which may drain on to another terrace and continue from that to a sewer.  The question then is as to when does that drain become a sewer or when does it cease to be a drain.  A certain amount of headway has been made under this Bill, but I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary admits that a further supplementary Bill will have to be introduced. Probably by the time it is introduced we shall have had some experience of the working of this Bill and we shall know what alterations to make with regard to both sewerage schemes and water supplies.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Sugrue's statement, I do not think he has dealt quite so much with this Bill as with other Bills.  I think the Public Health Bill has already dealt with the question of restaurants and lodging-houses to which he made reference.  With regard to games, whether they are professional or not and irrespective of whether they are played for gain or for exercise, it is a good thing that local authorities should be enabled to supply playgrounds for the public.  If playgrounds are supplied games will be played.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in thorough agreement with most of the remarks made by Senator Sir John Keane in regard to the tendency of this Bill to throw additional burdens on to the landlords.  I own a certain amount of house property and I am naturally, therefore, interested in this aspect of <Col N="1915" /> the Bill.  The tendency to increase the burdens placed upon the landlord is really reaching the point of absurdity, because the time is rapidly approaching when the landlord will find himself unable to make all the improvements. This question of public drainage has been a contentious subject for quite a long time.  As far as I can remember, where two or more houses were connected to a public drain or sewer, as the case may be, the local authority was liable.  As far as I can gather from the Parliamentary Secretary now that will not be the case in future and the burden will be thrown upon the landlord as one further addition to the already heavy load he carries.  The time is approaching when we shall be faced with the question as to whether or not we shall expropriate house property.  Are we going to reach the stage when private ownership will cease to be part of our economy?  A minority of people is interested in this property.  In order to please the majority must that minority be compelled to bear burdens out of all reasonable proportion?  Complaints are being made at the present time all over the country with regard to the shortage of houses.  The most pitiable cases occur.  What is the primary cause of that shortage?  In my opinion it is due to the legislation dealing with house property passed by this House over a number of years.  Nobody now wants to build houses to rent because the tendency of legislation is to increase the burdens more and more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having expressed my views with regard to that part of the Bill that affects me personally, I would like to say that there are many points in the Bill which call for congratulation and the Parliamentary Secretary will have my full support in securing the passage of those into permanent legislation.  I would, however, like to point out one or two curious anomalies that exist at the moment.  In the residential portion of my town a curious situation exists. I personally am paying something like £40 in rates.  What is the position?  I might as well be isolated somewhere in the middle west.  No connection exists with the public sewer and we <Col N="1916" /> are compelled to sink sumps.  The ground around those sumps over an area of 50 to 100 yards has become contaminated. When those sumps become full&mdash;as they occasionally do&mdash;we have to clear them at our own expense. Until the sanitary services are comprehensive enough, I think there should be some understanding about cases like that; that the public authority, when they are not in a position to enable these people to dispose of this, matter should provide for the drainage and clearing of these things at intervals. Why should people like that be paying rates for services which they are not getting?</P>
    <P>Section 49 of the Bill deals with rivers.  To my mind, it is a pity that this section is not a little bit more comprehensive.  In many cases, rivers are only glorified sewers; they are a scandal and a disgrace to any civilised community.  Everybody is allowed to pour crude sewage into these rivers and, instead of a source of health and enjoyment, they are a source of danger. Some time ago, when the question of infantile paralysis was mooted, many doctors were of the opinion that it would be very dangerous to bathe in some of the rivers immediately below towns in any case, because it was considered that they might be a source of infection.  The general feeling is that that is so, and in some cases rivers are a terrible danger to health.  It seems to me a pity that this Section 49 has not been made a little bit more comprehensive.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to provide for people who want houses at a cheap rate, instead of increasing the burdens upon the houseowners, facilities should be provided to enable such people to erect things like septic tanks, instead of compelling them to erect them at their own expense.  As things go on, it will be a case of presenting houses to people.  It would be a much cheaper thing to do than to go to the expense of putting in any of these improvements.</P>
    <P>I should like again to emphasise the fact that our housing shortage, in my opinion, and in the opinion of a number of people who ought to know, <Col N="1917" /> is due entirely to the tendency of legislation adopted by this House.  We will arrive at a stage when no houses will be erected, except by public authorities, and then we will have a peculiar form of State organisation which will differ very little from the system which we seem to be so much afraid of at present, namely, the Russian system.  Everything will become a matter of public ownership. There will be no such thing as private property if some brake is not put upon this tendency.</P>

      <P>It seems to me a very great pity that this Bill has to be rushed through the House sandwiched amongst a number of other Bills, for this reason principally, that the public needs a great deal of education on the matter of sanitation, and that the debate, if it were sufficiently wide and everybody had an opportunity of discussing the details of the Bill in which they are specially interested, could do something towards that public education.  We know that you may bring a horse to the pond, but it is not easy to make him drink.  What I am very much afraid of is that a good many of our people&mdash;it is regrettable and lamentable, in fact&mdash;have no appreciation of proper sanitation or the proper use of the facilities or amenities which this Bill proposes to put at their disposal.  One is sometimes quite shocked at the condition of certain places.  It is very important, therefore, that sanitation in the schools should be provided and that the pupils should be taught how to use it properly.  From the schools that might spread to other people.  At present it is really a crying scandal to see the ignorance of the people and the barbarism in certain respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not time to talk about other aspects of the Bill in which I am interested.  It is a Bill in which women are bound to be interested, as it is fundamental to the health of the community.  I should like, however, to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his thought in providing public wash houses.  Of course that was done before, but I think the drying and ironing facilities which can also be provided <Col N="1918" /> under this Bill will contribute very largely to the efficiency of women-kind in the running of their homes.  It is very hard in certain homes, especially in small flats and in other places in cities, to do washing and drying and ironing and all that is necessary to keep clothes clean.  If a sort of public laundry is provided which can be used by the inhabitants of flats, it will be a very great help.  That is one of the things I should like to stress in thanking the Parliamentary Secretary for piloting this Bill through the House.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senators in general have approved of the terms of this Bill and I should like to make one or two observations on what has been said.  So far as Senator Duffy's accusation that the Bill has not included sufficient consolidation is concerned, I agree with him.  But this Government will never hesitate to go ahead with new legislation for the benefit of the people at large solely because of any temporary inability to give sufficient time to the consolidation of the law.  Although from one standpoint consolidation is a good thing, when a Department such as the Department of Local Government brings into law a very large number of measures it is a sign of enthusiasm, of vigour and of interest in the well-being of the community. I have no apology to make in that regard, except to say that there will be another Bill later on when the effect of this Bill has been examined and when the whole question of sanitary services has had further investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sweetman referred to private contractual arrangements in relation to drains.  If he refers to Section 11 (3) he will see that private contractual arrangements are not altered by the terms of the Bill. Reference was also made by Senator Sweetman to the delays in dealing with applications for the closing of cemeteries.  I understand that recently these applications have been more expeditiously examined and, therefore, for some considerable time past there should have been no cause for complaint. With regard to the remuneration of sanitary officers and caretakers <Col N="1919" /> of cemeteries, if local authorities make recommendations for a reasonable increase, particularly where such persons have responsibility for maintaining burial grounds in good order, they will be sympathetically examined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy referred to the usual problem as to whether the Minister should lay Orders made under this Bill before the House.  The Orders referred to are in connection with the licensing of land for use by campers, increased charges for water services and arrangements for making it easier, from the legal standpoint, to provide for areas-in-charge in respect of new sanitary services.</P>

      <P>I do not believe it is necessary for the Minister to lay such Orders on the Table of the House, nor do I believe the House would have time to consider such Orders if they were so laid.</P>
      <P>Senator Duffy also asked what the &ldquo;character&rdquo; of an area meant in the section which states that regard should be had to the character of an area in making a provisional Order for sewerage. In general, sanitary authorities will have to consider the conditions obtaining in any particular area.  One condition essential to the making of a provisional Order for sewerage is that there should be a public water supply and that automatically limits the effect of the sections of the Bill dealing with sewerage.  Sanitary authorities, we expect, will act intelligently in this matter, will foresee so far as possible all the difficulties that may arise, and will not make a provisional Order in an area where great hardship would arise or where it would be undesirable.</P>
      <P>In regard to a case where the sanitary authority opens a drain for the purpose of its examination, if they find that there is no defect in the drainage system which they are examining, they will have to restore the drain to its previous state at their own cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 29 only enables the Minister to sanction increased water charges <Col N="1920" /> under a provision which up to now has been part of the Expiring Laws Act. There is no other change in connection with Section 29.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane and Senator O'Reilly referred to the difficulty experienced by owners of small houses rented to workers in carrying out a Drainage Order.  As I have already said, if the sanitary authority does the work, payment can be effected over a period of 30 years at 5 per cent. Members of the House will realise that if there is a charge of £20 for work of that kind, it would be possible to bear such a charge without great difficulty. Again, the sanitary authority will act in a reasonable manner in regard to the making of the order.  It is possible for local authorities to acquire property of this type which is already virtually uneconomic, put it into proper repair and then carry out the necessary drainage.  In fact, in a certain number of areas where there are houses of this type, local authorities have been making such acquisitions.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to the housing shortage.  I can only reply to that that the Government has been doing all it can in regard to the housing shortage.  It has introduced a Bill recently which will give increased grants and facilities for house building.</P>
    <P>The pollution of rivers comes under the River Pollution Acts.  Sanitary authorities have certain powers to prevent the pollution of rivers, but the general question of river pollution is not a matter for consideration under this Bill in the ordinary way.  There are no facilities for the public cleansing of cesspools as were suggested by Senator O'Reilly.  That is a matter we might look into, but I can foresee difficulties there as well.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan raised the question whether sanitary authorities should have a right to enforce the making of a combined drain in cases where individual owners of houses might wish to make separate drains so as to avoid costs.  Sanitary authorities may enforce the making of a combined drain under Section 12 (2).  The owners will be responsible for the making of 100 feet of the drain and the sanitary authority will be responsible for the remainder.</P>

      <P>Yes, they have power to insist that an adequate combined drain shall be made.  Senator Ó Buachalla referred to the necessity of providing water supplies for schools. I have every sympathy with his suggestion that schools should have sewerage and water supplies.  So far as I know, the Minister for Education will sanction grants for improvements of that kind and for the inclusion of these facilities.  Senator An Seabhac referred to the question of sanitary conveniences which should be provided by transport companies.  We shall look into that matter to see how far it is a matter for this Department and how far it is a matter for the Minister for Health.  In regard to the provision of grants for housing, the Senator asked whether it would be necessary to provide water supplies and sewerage services in houses for which grants were given.  The answer in the case of individual houses in the country is &ldquo;no&rdquo; but the grants will be higher where water supplies and sewerage are included.  I think I have answered all the questions that were raised in the course of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has, briefly, three objects, first, to provide financial assistance to persons building for themselves houses within certain standards as to size, secondly, to revive on a large scale the efforts of local authorities to eradicate bad housing conditions and, thirdly, to provide satisfactory houses for workers in town and country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing problem of the middle income group is mainly a product of the recent war, with its aftermath of insufficient materials, shortages of skilled manpower, and abnormally high <Col N="1923" /> building costs; these forces have intensified the housing scarcity as it affects workers, but the working-class housing problem is of older origin than the war of 1939 or even than the war of 1914. It is the outcome of generations of neglect, of insufficient replacement of houses which fell into decay through age or misuse, of the almost complete withdrawal of private enterprise and capital from the sphere of workers' letting accommodation, and of a number of other factors less individually decisive perhaps, but whose cumulative weight so aggravated the problem that towards the close of the last century State intervention became imperative.</P>
    <P>From 1883 onwards the story has been one of increasing public concern with the question of housing.  It may be said to have, so far as the Government are concerned, culminated in the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 1932.  The result has been that out of a total of some 600,000 inhabited houses in the country, more than one-third have been built or reconstructed with State assistance. The magnitude of the housing programme undertaken since 1932 as compared with the preceding 35 years may be gauged from the fact that of more than 200,000 State-aided or State-built houses, about 140,000, or 70 per cent., were built or reconstructed since 1932. This great achievement coincided with, and was an integral part of, the first real attack which had ever been made in this country on the slum problem.</P>
    <P>The housing drive which was then begun made tremendous strides during the years before the war and had results which were unparalleled in the same sphere in any other country in the world.  The recent war, however, brought about a disastrous change. While building was not altogether suspended, the rate of output of houses rapidly diminished until it fell below the wastage rate, or the minimum rate at which new houses must be built or old houses reconstructed if the national stock of dwelling accommodation is not to decrease.  The emerging deficiency, accentuated by population movements, family growth and other factors, is estimated <Col N="1924" /> to have reached 100,000 dwellings, of which 60,000 represent the needs of rural and urban workers for whom local authorities normally cater, and 40,000 those of other classes.</P>
    <P>The immediate objective of the Government's housing policy must, therefore, be to get 100,000 houses built in the shortest time possible.  This task, formidable and onerous as it would be even in normal times, is infinitely more so in a period like that which we are passing through, of insufficient building materials, and inadequate supplies of skilled labour.  There is a continuing shortage of soft timber; the demand for cement has outrun production; rainwater goods and other materials and equipment are difficult to obtain.  An acute bottleneck has developed in the labour force available for house-building, by reason of wholly inadequate numbers of bricklayers, carpenters, plasterers and other skilled tradesmen. These are serious checks to the expansion of the building industry, which can cope at present with only a fraction of the work crying out to be done.  Local authorities are finding it hard to get contractors to undertake their housing schemes; in Dublin especially, schemes under contract are being held up by scarcities of materials and labour.</P>
    <P>Resumption of the housing drive on a scale which will offer the prospect of a permanent solution of our national housing difficulties must, therefore, depend, in the first place, on the recruitment of greater numbers of skilled tradesmen, on a stronger and more regular flow of essential materials and equipment, and on the concurrent expansion and improvement in the organisation and technique of the building industry.</P>
    <P>The present Bill must be considered against that background.  It provides an interim measure of aid to meet the immediate needs of certain classes on which the general housing scarcity presses with more than usual severity; the classes I refer to are the intermediate or middle-class everywhere, and newly married persons in large urban centres.  The Bill also effects a number of improvements in the administrative machinery for the provision <Col N="1925" /> by local authorities of workers' dwellings.  I shall deal first with those parts of the Bill which are concerned with private building.</P>
    <P>Under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932-1946, grants ranging from £40 to £150 have been payable hitherto to public utility societies and persons building or repairing houses.  The Bill proposes to replace this scheme with one more nearly related to present-day conditions, particularly in regard to cost. The new grants will vary from £80 for reconstruction work to £400 for a house built for letting.  They will be payable in respect of houses both in rural and urban areas, and will not be confined except in the case of rural reconstruction grants, to particular classes.  They will be limited, however, to houses built or repaired in a particular period, within certain limits of size, and built either for owner-occupation or for letting.</P>
    <P>The grants are not being offered to persons building immediately and directly for speculative sale.  Builders, speculative or otherwise, who build for sale are making adequate profits in the present circumstances and there is no reason why the Exchequer should be called on to subsidise their activities. Grants to builders for sale are made with two main objects in view: one is to stimulate building, the other is to effect a reduction in cost for the ultimate occupier.  As to the first, house building, as I have pointed out, is already proceeding to the limits of our resources of materials and manpower and, as to the second, the payment of the grant to the ultimate occupier is a surer method of abating the net cost to him than paying the grant to the builder.  By proposing the withdrawal of the grants to builders who build to sell&mdash;I would like to make this clear&mdash;I do not discount the value of private enterprise as a factor in the solution of the housing problem.  Private enterprise, however, takes many forms.  Certain forms of it, such as persons or companies building for letting, or public utility societies&mdash;which are, in effect, co-operative housing associations&mdash;building houses for members, I have thought it <Col N="1926" /> best to encourage directly; others, such as the builder of houses for sale, I have decided should make contact with the scheme indirectly, through the purchaser of the house, who has arranged with the builder to have it built, and who occupies it when built.</P>
    <P>In response to many requests from Deputies when the Bill was before the Dáil, reconstruction and new house grants at about 70 per cent. of the proposed new rates will be payable in respect of houses begun but not occupied in the period from November, 1945, to November, 1947.</P>
    <P>The grants for houses built for owner-occupation will be differentiated on the basis of the presence or absence of piped water supply and sewerage.  The higher grant will be payable where the owner has installed his own system of water supply and sanitation as well as where the house is connected with the public water and sewerage system.  I think it is important to emphasise that if the owner puts in his own piped water supply and sewerage system he will get the grant at the higher rate because that was not clearly apprehended in the other House when the Bill was being discussed on Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Reconstruction grants in the case of small farmers and agricultural labourers are being doubled in amount, and the valuation limit in the case of the former is being raised from £25 to £35.  Grants up to £60 may be paid in respect of work begun but not completed between November, 1945, and November, 1947.</P>
    <P>The usual rates remission will attach to grant-aided houses, where the grant is made by the Minister alone, that is to say, when there is no contributory grant from the local authority.</P>
    <P>Senators will find full details of the new scheme of grants in Part III of the Bill, and in the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Schedules.  The grants are generous, and will mean a considerable addition to the housing commitments of the Exchequer, and to a less extent, to those of local authorities.  They are a measure, however, of the Government's awareness of the seriousness of <Col N="1927" /> the housing needs of a class which is being pushed to the wall in the scramble for houses which the current dearth of accommodation has produced. I refer, of course, to the &ldquo;whitecollar&rdquo; worker, the better-paid artisan, the small farmer, and the middle-income group generally.</P>
    <P>The class or classes to which I have referred will also benefit from the extension of operations under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, to which Part VI of the Bill should open the way.  Section 38 will enable me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to adjust, as conditions may require, the market value of houses for which advances may be made under these Acts.  It is my intention, as soon as the Bill becomes law, to raise the limit from £1,000 to £1,750, and I have the assurance of the Minister for Finance that he is prepared to concur in this proposal.</P>
    <P>Section 39 will enable operations under these Acts to be resumed in certain areas where they have become suspended through local authorities having exceeded the rating limits set out in the Act of 1899.  Section 40 provides that the interest rate at which local authorities may lend under the Acts will be adjusted automatically to the rate at which they may borrow.  I should, perhaps, mention that the general interest rate on advances under the Acts was reduced last year from 4¾ per cent. to 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>I turn now to those parts of the Bill which affect the powers, duties and responsibilities of local authorities in relation to housing.  Part II of the measure contains a number of important provisions dealing with the regulations of tenementing, control of the demolition or diversion to other uses of dwellinghouses, the making of bye-laws respecting certain single-family dwellings, and the procural of certain information from the tenants or prospective tenants of local authority houses.  These powers, I believe, will materially strengthen the hands of local authorities in their struggle against bad housing conditions in their areas. They are, in the main, powers of preventive <Col N="1928" /> action, designed to forestall or arrest the decline of good houses to slum levels, and to prevent the destruction or misuse of habitable houses.  The power to secure information is a power which local authorities will find extremely useful in the operation of systems of differential rents, or in considering the introduction of such systems.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Bill embodies a principle new to Irish housing legislation. The section will authorise certain major urban authorities to provide dwellings to be reserved for a particular class.  What I have in mind in this connection is the erection of special houses for newly-married couples, a class which in recent years has suffered more severely than others from the prevailing shortage of housing accommodation.  Though local authorities generally, and especially urban authorities, have undertaken very great commitments with regard to the rehousing of badly-housed workers, I have not hesitated to impose this additional burden upon them on behalf of a class of persons for whom good housing has an importance transcending its immediate utility or convenience.  From the point of view of the future of our people, and for other reasons, it is in the highest degree desirable that young couples should begin their married life in a good, healthy environment, and in houses which, so far as mere physical surroundings can achieve it, will foster habits of neatness and cleanliness, and an attitude of responsibility towards the community of which they are both the benefactors and the beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>I have in mind that under this provision two types of house will be provided, each to have two bedrooms and the most up-to-date equipment.  The rent for one type is to be an economic rent of about 30/- weekly; for the other it is to be about £1 a week, the loss being met by a lump-sum grant from the State.  The two categories of houses would be allotted amongst applicants according to their economic circumstances.  The tenants of these houses would have to vacate them after a specified period of, say, five years. After long consideration, I have come to the conclusion that it would not be <Col N="1929" /> possible to operate the scheme otherwise, since the houses would rapidly become overcrowded if no provision of this kind were made, while, if childless couples or couples with one or two children were allowed to remain, the houses would in the course of time become permanently occupied by such couples and cease altogether to fulfil the purpose for which they were designed.</P>
    <P>The tenants going out from these houses, however, are to be given the option of transferring to ordinary local authority houses.  It is intended that all these special houses, or reserved houses, to be built should, for the present, be restricted to about 15 per cent. of the annual output of houses in the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and the borough of Dún Laoghaire.  In the other areas the figures will be fixed according to circumstances.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 35 of the Bill will enable the Minister for Local Government to frame comprehensive regulations with regard to the letting and management of local authority houses. It is proposed in this connection that regard should be had in making lettings to the character and industry of applicants, as well as to their occupations, family circumstances and existing housing conditions.  Moreover, in allotting the tenancies of labourers' cottages, priority must be given under the Bill to farm workers. The Bill, incidentally, provides that agricultural workers on the family holding shall in future be eligible for cottages provided by county councils. Thus, the son working on his father's farm who wishes to get married, or the farmer who leaves the family dwelling to his son, can then be given the tenancy of a cottage, and this provision may help to overcome what is recognised to be one of the major obstacles in the way of early marriages in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, all of which are designed to assist local authorities in the work of getting houses built. Section 23, for instance, will extend the period for which housing subsidy in the form of contributions to annual loan <Col N="1930" /> charges may be paid.  The period, which was limited to 35 years in 1932, is now being extended to 50 years. This change will enable local authorities to take full advantage of the new terms which, as announced by the Minister for Finance in May, 1946, apply to loans from the Local Loans Fund.  These terms, as I think Senators may be aware, comprise an interest rate of 2½ per cent. and a repayment period of 50 years.  This section also provides that major or slum clearance subsidy will be payable in respect of the rehousing of persons living in dangerous buildings, or persons displaced by the collapse or destruction of their former dwellings.</P>
    <P>Section 41 will enable me to free local authorities wishing to engage in house building by direct labour from the restrictions imposed on them by the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, in connection with the making of contracts. Sections 42 and 43 provide, in effect, for the division of compulsory purchase Orders under the Labourers Acts into unopposed and opposed parts with a view to cutting down procedural delays.  As the law stands, a single objection may hold up the acquisition of a large number of sites for months; in future, the objector will be entitled to oppose a compulsory purchase Order only in so far as it concerns his own property.  The Bill also provides for entry on lands in course of acquisition for rural housing purposes; reduction of the rate of interest on compensation money where a local authority enters on land before compensation is paid; remuneration of solicitors for work done under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts; and for a restatement of the borrowing powers of county councils under the Labourers Acts.</P>
    <P>The list of repeals contains two which may be of interest: one is the proposed repeal of Section 17 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, which involves removal of the existing limits on the rate which may be levied for rural housing purposes.  There is no corresponding limit, I may mention, in connection with urban housing.  The other repeal is that of sub-section (2) of Section 1 of the Housing (Ireland) Act, <Col N="1931" /> 1908, which will put urban housing authorities on a par with rural so far as borrowing from the Local Loans Fund is concerned.  At present an urban authority need not repay to the fund any part of the principal of a loan during a period of two years from the date of borrowing.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to give the Bill a quick passage, so that I can get down at once to the work of translating its provisions into action. Senators may, perhaps, be inclined to complain of the fact that the Bill does not include a greater degree of consolidation of the long series of enactments dealing with housing.  I may say at once that I sympathise with that view but that it has proved impossible, in the limited time at the disposal of the Government and in the fluctuating circumstances of the day, to have a codifying measure prepared.  The transition period through which we are passing is hardly an opportune time for the enactment of a comprehensive statute, that is the statute drawn up to meet current needs which might be very ill-adapted to the requirements of a highly problematical future.  It is better, I think, to continue for the time being with <i>ad hoc</i> legislation aiming, at this stage, at flexibility rather than permanence, and striving to fulfil the immediate and urgent needs of a rapidly changing situation rather than endeavour to prepare an ideal housing code <i>in vacuo.</i>  There are, I admit with apologies, some traces of legislation by reference in this Bill, but it will be found, I think, that most of its important provisions are new and stand by themselves.</P>
    <P>I would again repeat my request and trust the House will see its way to let me have this Bill expeditiously.  It is a Bill mainly conferring benefits upon the mass of the people, and the longer it is delayed the more the enjoyment of these benefits will be deferred and the more also will attempts to meet the existing deficiency in housing be impeded. Therefore, while I appreciate very keenly the demand which I am making on the House, I think it would be in the public interest if the House would forego on this occasion its right <Col N="1932" /> to consider this measure closely and in great detail, and see its way to allow me to have not only this stage of the Bill but the other stages with the utmost expedition.</P>

      <P>In view of the hour at which this stage of the Bill is being taken, I do not propose to take up the time of the House on it beyond saying that this is a Bill of very considerable detail.  In general we welcome it.  It is essentially what one may call a Committee Bill.  Almost all the points on it would arise in Committee.  For that reason, I propose to confine myself to one or two general remarks.  I think it is rather regrettable that the Bill keeps to the floor space of 1,250 feet which is contained in the Act of 1932. To my mind that is too small for a house with five or more rooms.  I think it is a pity, if the Government want to encourage building, that they should encourage the building of the cramped type of house.  There is also the point, which I suppose it would be extremely difficult to meet, that, in view of the changes made in the Bill, quite a few houses which are being constructed and which were designed during the period in which there were no grants, if the floor space happens to be two or three feet over 1,250 square feet, will be debarred from any grants.  It is a nice point whether, in 1932, that floor space was sufficient, but it seems strange that when dealing with a different type of grant for houses with three, four, five or more rooms, the old maximum limit of 1,250&mdash;I think it ran from 500 to 1,250 &mdash;should be maintained.  Otherwise, in general terms, I approve of the Bill and any points I want to raise I propose to raise on Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that there was a certain note of insincerity or lack of candour in the Minister's appeal for a quick passage for this Bill when he based it on the need for a rapid provision of new houses.  It would have been much more in accordance with the facts if he had said that he wants this thing cleared up before the Christmas holidays and before the election.  I personally could not agree, although I am only one individual, and a very humble one at that, to any change in <Col N="1933" /> procedure which would deprive us of the right to examine this Bill in detail on Committee, because it is there that most of our criticisms are pertinent.  The Minister himself has said that there are a number of new provisions in the Bill, and, on that very account, it needs to be closely examined.  At this stage, I propose to deal only with certain general aspects.</P>
      <P>In the first place, this housing need is so acute that I rather question if the Minister should not do more, in fact, should not do all he can within the material available, to supply houses for the moderate income groups.  I doubt if this Bill does all that could be done. We have only to look at what has been happening during the last three or four months when houses, perhaps rather beyond the character contemplated by this legislation, have been built on the outskirts of the city at inordinate profits to the builders.  The Minister for Finance said that builders were getting up to 100 per cent. profit and he seemed to be satisfied with that as the working of the profit motive.  I am personally very much inclined&mdash;I might say, biased&mdash;to the profit motive, where the underlying factors apply, but I am afraid that one has to modify one's view about it when conditions of acute scarcity exist.  In relation to essential commodities like houses, the profit motive has to stand aside to a very large extent in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Houses are capable of control in a rather more effective way than general commodities, because we start from the point that no house can be built without a licence, and, presumably, no material obtained without a licence.  I want to ask how certain people manage to get material which is in such short supply in order to build houses to sell at an enormous profit, when houses are so badly needed by the people we have in mind, the moderate and lower income groups.  That has to be answered, because if a local authority had that material&mdash;and, presumably, a local authority should have first charge upon it&mdash;they should have been able to provide houses for the people most in need of them.  People will say that none of these £6,000 houses&mdash;that is about the figure I have in mind&mdash;should be built at all, but, in <Col N="1934" /> Great Britain, they managed to operate a pretty effective rationing system, based on one such house for every eight built by a local authority.</P>
    <P>I know that the answer will be: who will get these houses when they are built at, say, a prescribed profit?  The Minister, no doubt, will say that he might agree that builders should be satisfied with a reasonable profit &mdash;a profit of, say, 25 per cent., which I should have thought would be ample, and ask who will get the house then.  I do not think it beyond the power of authority to control the applicants for houses of that character, just as there is a priority list in respect of corporation houses, and certainly anybody who gets a house is not entitled to sell it almost immediately at an enhanced profit.  As we all know, a certain amount of that has gone on.</P>
    <P>Then, again, I am not satisfied&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, because this is all a very complicated question&mdash;if he will have effective control over the smaller class of furnished flats.  There is a certain group of people who are living on pensions, the purchasing power of which is very much reduced, who are being very hardly put upon by the increased rents of their flats.</P>

      <P>I rather anticipated that I would be told that that did not arise under this Housing Bill, but surely it arises indirectly from the power of the Minister to allow the creation of multiple dwellings.  Surely the Minister should be enabled in some way to protect the occupants of such multiple dwellings as are authorised. I do not want to embarrass the Chair by seeking a ruling on this point but there is in the Bill the ratio as between the rent of the furnished flat and the whole rent of the dwelling, so that it is not as if the whole aspect of rent was outside the purview of this measure, although it does come in, perhaps incidentally, in the form of a definition.  It is a matter which I am prepared to get to closer grips with on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1935" /> Again, what is the future policy of the Minister with regard to the speculative builder?  I know he is not going to get a grant, but is he to be allowed to get material&mdash;how he does it, I do not know&mdash;and to continue to get the ceiling price for his building?  I am told that that class of building is reaching saturation point.  I hope that is so, but at present it is a very great hardship.  The income groups of £800 to £1,000 a year, who are only on salary and who cannot raise capital, or only very small capital, find it hard to borrow within their means to get a house at all under these speculative building schemes.  I feel there is an obligation on the Government to help them, just as there is to help those who occupy corporation houses.  I gladly agree that this Bill is well-intentioned, but I would like to see more done to deal with this crying need, which affects family life, the health, and generally the moral welfare of the whole community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard of people who built their own houses at a certain time and are not entitled to any grant. Some of them have a very definite grievance and I am hoping to put in an amendment on the Committee Stage. Speaking generally, housing is largely bound up with decentralisation and attention will have to be given to that, if we are ever to solve the housing problem in this city.  The city contains one-sixth of the entire population of the 32 Counties and is getting a bit top-heavy. The cry is still for more houses. At what stage will we be in a position to satisfy the requirements, if the crowding in continues?  Anyone who remembers Dublin 30 years ago and who looks now at Crumlin, Drimnagh, Marino and the other great centres of modern building, sees that to-day the housing shortage is just as acute as ever it was.  One begins to wonder if the demand will ever be met completely. If we are to go on concentrating every form of industrial activity in and around Dublin, the people must come here and consequently there will be need for more houses.  Therefore, the housing question is very largely bound up with decentralisation, if we <Col N="1936" /> are not to have an even greater proportion of our population concentrating in Dublin, and consideration will have to be given to that aspect of the matter.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Sir John Keane is well known.  A builder builds a terrace of houses, a speculator comes and buys them before they are finished and someone else comes in and buys after that, so that sometimes they change hands three times before the tenants come in.  People who have money and prefer property to money are able to get them.  Until serious attention is given to decentralisation, we can never completely satisfy the demand for housing in and around Dublin.  Decentralisation would make rural life more attractive and give greater inducements to the rural areas. More houses should be built in the rural areas, comfortable houses with every type of modern convenience. Also, it should be possible to establish some industries there, in order to give employment.  That aspect of the matter will have to be considered seriously in the immediate future.  It means a revolution in building in this city, which is now at one end on the borders of Méath and at another end on the borders of Kildare, and is still extending.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is not enough attention being given to town planning, which is very important and is closely related to the housing problem. I hope to have an amendment down on the Committee Stage dealing with the grievance which I have mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHayden" hpid="Mr. Hayden Mr. Hayden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayden</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority for 27 years, I must congratulate the Minister on this Bill. Our local authority has been hampered in the past, up to the time this Government came into power.  This Government has done a great deal for housing, to give them the credit they deserve.  At the same time, in my own county, we are in a very bad position for houses at present.  I know that a war has come and gone and that materials have been scarce.  I come from a small town of 1,800 population, where we had a very good housing scheme.  A number of old people were <Col N="1937" /> taken from small houses and put into labourers' cottages.  If some of those small houses could have been repaired &mdash;and repairs can be done under this Bill&mdash;we could have used a large number of those small houses for the people and put large families in the labourers' cottages to relieve the housing shortage.  However, we had not got any provision for that in the past.</P>
      <P>We have found difficulty in getting sites for labourers' cottages in the country near towns, where there is demesne land.  About two months ago we were looking for sites for 53 houses for my town.  We got sites for 30 out of the 53.  There was a big ranch there and we could not touch that and so we had to go and take land from a man who had four acres or five acres. I think that is most iniquitous and that we should have a law whereby we could go and take land from a big demesne and not deprive a farmer with ten or 15 acres of his livelihood.  It has retarded our scheme that we have had to wait and see what we were going to do.  We cannot get land adjacent to the town, except by going in on the land of small farmers and I am very much against that.  I hope that the Minister will do something to rectify that.  I am in entire agreement with the rest of the Bill, and I think that is a long-felt want supplied.  I believe it is going to be a big boon for houses in the near future, and with these few words I conclude.  I must say that this Bill has my wholehearted support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas has mentioned a point which has given myself a great deal of concern, the fact that we have retained the limitation upon floor space in the building of houses.  I think that there are very strong arguments in favour of extending the existing limitation, but also, I think that on the other side there are overpowering arguments against doing that in the present circumstance. The fact that there are restrictions in the supply of material and the general supply of materials and labour is insufficient to enable the local authorities to go ahead to their utmost capacity to plan is admitted.  In those circumstances, we must remember that the <Col N="1938" /> larger we make the house, the fewer houses are going to be built out of available supplies.  The deficiency and shortage of accommodation are so great, and the number of people who are crying out for accommodation is so large, that I think we should proceed on the basis that we should provide the greatest number of houses we possibly can out of existing supplies of material. That is the case for retaining the existing limitations.  Having regard to the hardships inflicted on people who are looking for houses and who cannot get them, I do not think it would be right to allow the more fortunate few who can afford&mdash;for that is what it comes down to&mdash;to build larger houses to get a grant at the expense of the others who cannot afford to build large houses or who cannot even afford to build small houses or have small houses built for them unless they get the grants. There is no restriction on any person, provided he gets the necessary building licence, to build the largest house he thinks desirable for himself and his family if he is prepared to bear the whole cost of it.  What we are concerned with is whether, in subsidising the building of houses, we are to use that subsidy to build the greatest possible number of houses within the limitations imposed by the restricted supply of labour and materials.  The housing shortage is so acute that it is necessary to ensure that those materials&mdash;as far as the Government subsidy or Government assistance can do it&mdash;are used to provide the greatest possible number of houses.  That is the argument for retaining the existing restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Senator Sir John Keane went much too far in ascribing either insincerity or lack of candour to me in asking for a speedy passage of this Bill.  I want undoubtedly to have it at the earliest possible date.  I would be asking for it at the earliest possible date irrespective of whether there was to be a general election or not.  The fact that the Dáil is going to be dissolved within a few weeks and that during that period a great deal of work will naturally have to be deferred&mdash; work, for instance, which requires the personal attention of the Minister&mdash; makes me doubly anxious that we <Col N="1939" /> should get this Bill through and enable the people who are looking anxiously for these grants and looking anxiously to secure the benefit of the other provisions of this measure to get a definite assurance that we are going ahead, that the money will be forthcoming and that the other things will be done.  It is natural in these circumstances and having the responsibilities which I have, that I should like to see this Bill law before the Dáil is dissolved.  The position is, if there is going to be a prolonged discussion on the Committee Stage of this Bill, if we are going to have many amendments giving rise to acute points of difference or controversy, I fear that the Bill will not go back to the Dáil in time to enable it to be completed before the general election.  I hope to avoid that and I think I am justified in asking the Seanad to do what it can to avoid it, because, as I have already indicated, it is not the last Housing Bill.  More comprehensive measures are in contemplation and we would be able, in dealing with the succeeding Bills, to cure, perhaps, any of the defects that may exist in this Bill.  I do not claim perfection for it and it is not the last word.  I am contemplating an even wider, perhaps, and more comprehensive review of the existing housing code and I am contemplating other methods for attempting to deal with the housing problem than those hitherto consecrated by time.</P>
    <P>I think that with a great deal of what Senator Foran said naturally we must agree.  The problem of housing in Dublin is inseparably linked up with the fact that the population of Dublin has increased and tends to increase.  I do not know what measures we are going to be able to take, in addition to those which the Government has already taken, to try to ensure that the flow or tendency of the people to congregate in large urban areas will be discouraged.  We have already, as the Senator knows, endeavoured to decentralise industry, but that, on the other hand, has created many problems, as well as the fact that decentralisation has not always made for efficiency, nor has it been without very serious disturbing effects upon the general rural community. <Col N="1940" /> It is not a matter that one can deal with briefly, but the Senator, who has great experience and great knowledge of the factors which are involved in the question of industrial development, knows as well as I do how serious those problems can become.  I agree that we should find a way of getting the people to stay on the land. If we could get them to live in small towns and provide the people who live on the land or in small towns with all the interests and amenities which are enjoyed here in the City of Dublin our problem would be solved.  No other country has been able to solve that problem and I doubt whether, human nature being what it is, we shall be able to solve it either.  The problem to which Senator Hayden referred as to the difficulty of getting sites in rural areas in the neighbourhood of towns arises from the prohibition which exists in the existing housing code, that one may not take the main lands or home farm lands for the purpose of housing. I do not propose to deal with a fundamental question like that under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides a new superannuation code for persons in the service of local authorities.  It is in general mandatory in respect of officers and adoptive in respect of servants.  It will apply to all pensionable officers entering the service after the commencement of the Act, and also to such existing officers who, not having attained the specified age of <Col N="1941" /> 60 years, may opt to accept it.  Local authorities may under Section 5 adopt Part III of the measure which makes the measure applicable to servants. Existing pensionable servants will have the same right of option, subject to age, as existing officers are to have.</P>
      <P>The main provisions relating to officers will be found in Part II of the Bill; and those relating to servants will be found in Part III.  Part IV contains a number of miscellaneous ancillary provisions applicable in the main to both classes.  Part I contains the definitions and the usual preliminary and general provisions.  It is provided that Part II shall come into operation when the Minister makes an Order to that effect.  Part III, however, only comes into operation when the local authority concerned passes the necessary resolution under Section 5.</P>
      <P>To qualify for pension reckoned on the full period of actual service an officer must have served with diligence and fidelity.  The condition requiring service with general diligence and fidelity will be found in Sections 23 to 49.  To become eligible for a pension an officer must be in the permanent employment of a local authority, and, with certain specified exceptions, he must devote the whole of his time to the local service.  The exceptions are set out in Section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next salient feature of the proposals is the contribution which will be required of new entrants, whether officers or servants.  This contribution will be 5 per cent. of the annual remuneration or earnings for officers and 4? per cent. for servants.  Provision is made for a refund of contributions in certain circumstances under Section 32 and Section 57.  These contributions will not defray more than one-third of the aggregate cost of pensions and other allowances which will be obtainable under the Bill.  The balance will be met in general by the local authorities or, in the type of case to which Sections 18 or 84 apply, by the Minister for Finance and the local authority concerned.  In the case of officers the pensions and other allowances will take the form of lump sum payments and annual allowances approximating to those granted to civil servants.  The lump sum will be at the rate of 1-30th <Col N="1942" /> of the officer's retiring salary for each year of pensionable service, but will be limited to a maximum of one and a half times that salary.  That is provided under Section 24.  The annual allowance will be at the rate of 1-80th for each year of pensionable service but will not exceed one-half of the retiring salary.  That is provided under Section 25.  This limit will not, however, apply to allowances to be granted under Section 77 to officers or servants of local authorities whose retirement may be due to injury incurred in the discharge of their duty or to certain specified dependents in the event of death from such injuries.  In the case of servants, there is much to be said in favour of making the annual allowance as large as possible in relation to the retiring pay.  Accordingly, servants will not receive a lump sum on retirement, but their pensions will be calculated at the rate of 1-60th for each year of pensionable service instead of 1-80th as in the case of officers, and the maximum amount, except in cases of retirement due to injury in the discharge of duty, will be two-thirds, instead of one-half of their wages.  The reference is Section 50.</P>
    <P>The Bill also permits the payment of gratuities to the legal personal representatives of deceased established officers and servants as will be seen in Sections 28 and 53.  Sections 29 and 54 provide that where a retired officer or servant dies before the total amount received by him in the form of a lump sum and annual allowances is equal to the pensionable remuneration at the date of retirement, the local authority may grant to his legal personal representative such a gratuity as will make good the difference between the deceased's retiring pensionable remuneration and the total of the sums paid to him on foot of the lump sum and the annual allowance paid up to the date of death.  Female officers or servants of local authorities, who retire on marriage or with the intention of getting married, and who have not less than five years' pensionable service, will be entitled to a gratuity, calculated at the rate of one-twelfth of their pensionable remuneration multiplied by the number of years of pensionable service, subject to a maximum of a <Col N="1943" /> year's pay.  The reference there is Sections 30 and 55.</P>
    <P>Section 82, sub-section (1) provides that an officer of a local authority with not less than ten years' pensionable service who is appointed in future to an established post in the Civil Service can reckon for the purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Acts his period of pensionable service with local authorities.  Sub-section (2) of the section deals with past cases of movement from the local service to the Civil Service since 1922 and enables the appropriate Minister to issue certificates after investigation of the facts. The ten years' minimum local service will not be necessary in these cases.</P>
    <P>In the case of a civil servant becoming an officer of a local authority the consent of the Minister for Finance and the local authority must be obtained to the application of similar benefits to his case (Section 18).  These specific consents will not be necessary, of course, to cover past cases.</P>
    <P>An established officer of a local authority who moves from the service of one local authority to another will be entitled to aggregate for pension purposes his separate periods of service with the local authorities concerned (Section 14).  There is, however, an important reservation in this regard; if he served with another local authority for less than two years then that service will not count for pension unless he resigned from their service with the written sanction of the local authority concerned, and with the consent of the appropriate Minister.  This provision should do much to avoid the disturbance of local administration caused by frequent changes of staffs.</P>
    <P>Great difficulty was experienced in framing Part III of the measure, the part which relates to the servants of local authorities.  Although we have established some measure of uniformity so far as pay is concerned, tenures of employment of servants still vary very greatly as between one local authority and another.  The problem was to devise a scheme which would be generally applicable to all conditions.</P>
    <P>This brought up in an acute way the problem of the road-workers and similar outdoor employees, whose service <Col N="1944" /> may be interrupted by the weather. I think it will be conceded that pensions for merely casual services could not be granted nor pensions for employment on relief works out of the public bounty unless the employees were already permanent servants whose services are utilised in a supervisory capacity.</P>
    <P>Yet it would have been invidious to debar employees who in general were in fairly constant employment but who were subject at intervals to recurring interruption of their employment because of weather, cessation of grants, etc.  These workers, though not in a factual sense permanently or continuously employed, are described very often by local custom as permanent men.  This difficulty has been met in Section 42 (1) (h) and sub-section (4) in Section 63 by providing that if a servant having acquired pensionable status is employed for at least 200 days in any year, the period worked will count for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>To secure pensionable status a servant of a local authority must have been in its permanent service for a continuous period of 3 years.  His name shall then be entered in the local register of established servants, if the maximum number of established servants prescribed by the local authority under Section 5 has not been reached (Section 38 (2)).  If during any of the three relevant years the aggregate temporary absences of a permanent servant of a local authority being of the kind specified in Section 61 do not exceed 60 days he will still be entitled to have his name entered on the register.</P>
    <P>An officer or servant of a local authority may, under Sections 23 and 49, on attaining the age of 60 years, if he so elects, retire on pension, provided he has not less than 20 years of pensionable local service to his credit, and has fulfilled the other conditions prescribed.  In the case of officers and servants of fire brigades, the age for voluntary retirement on pension is 55. These provisions do not, of course, compel the person concerned to retire at 60 years of age.  In fact, the normal age for compulsory retirement of pensionable officers, as fixed by Order under Section 23 of the Local Government Act, 1941, is at present 65.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> The cases of officers of vocational education committees who had previously held posts as national teachers or as secondary teachers are dealt with in Sections 72 and 90; while Section 36 deals with the position of established officers who, prior to 1924, had given whole-time service as teachers of Irish under the Gaelic League.</P>
    <P>Under Section 77, power is taken to make regulations which will enable gratuities or allowances to be paid to officers or servants, whether in the pensionable class or not, who may be compelled to retire through injury caused in the actual discharge of duty and specifically attributable to the nature of such duty.  Should an officer to whom this provision applies die within seven years after the date of his injury, and as the direct result of such injury, then gratuities or allowances may be paid to his widow and children and to his mother or father if they had been wholly dependent on him.</P>
    <P>Representations have reached me that provision should be made for gratuities to the legal personal representatives of officers and servants who died before the commencement of the Act.  I have endeavoured to meet that in Sections 37 (9) and 63 (6), which will enable local authorities to grant appropriate gratuities in cases where a pensionable officer or pensionable servant died on or after 1st January, 1947, and had not attained the age of 60, or 55 in the case of fire brigade officers and men, on that date.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of sections granting rights of appeal to established officers and established servants.  The general principle of Ministerial responsibility as regards appeals is that the particular Minister concerned in questions of status shall decide appeals on failure to register the name of an officer or servant. Appeals against the removal of a name from the register of pensionable officers or servants will be dealt with on the same principles.  Appeals against failures to grant lump sums or allowances or to return contributions or against the amount of lump sums, allowances or gratuities will be dealt with under Section 73 by the Minister <Col N="1946" /> for Local Government who is the Minister responsible under the Bill for sanctioning lump sums, allowances and gratuities.</P>
    <P>The position of officers or servants who retired after November 1st, 1946, is dealt with in Section 79.  Under this section local authorities may increase the allowances to such extent as may be sanctioned by the relevant Minister. The justification for this provision is that the age limit has operated to retire a number of officers before the post-emergency adjustment of their pay could become fully effective for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 79 also enables other existing pensions to be increased.  Pensions carrying cost-of-living bonus can be adjusted to a cost-of-living bonus of 270 as from the 1st November, 1946.  This applies to all pensions of this kind irrespective of the date of retirement. Inclusive pensions granted in respect of retirements between 1st July, 1940, and 1st November, 1946, may also be revised.  Provision is made under Sections 68, 69 and 75 for the cancellation, reduction or suspension of pensions in special circumstances which arise rarely but which nevertheless have to be provided for.</P>
    <P>The financial implications of a Bill of this kind are important and will no doubt be carefully examined by the representatives of the ratepayers, as well as by the officers and servants affected.  In the absence of a special review of the service of every employee it is not possible to give precise figures, but if all local authorities give effect to the measure, I think it is safe to assume that the additional cost is unlikely to rise above £100,000&mdash;a figure which will not of course be reached for a number of years.  At present, if we exclude mental hospital staffs, which are in a special category, having their own schemes, the local authorities pay out about £228,000 in retiring allowances and gratuities.  The additional expenditure will depend entirely on the elected representatives of the ratepayers in each case.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, Part III of the Bill merely gives power to local authorities to provide for the <Col N="1947" /> superannuation of their servants in the manner specified in the Act.  If a local authority desires to avail of that power then, in accordance with Section 5, it must decide by formal resolution to adopt Part III of the Act as from a specified date.  Due notice of their intentions must be given in writing to the Minister and to every member of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the resolution must declare the maximum number of persons who, for the purposes of the Act, may be employed as permanent servants by the local authority.  The resolution, of course, may be amended on due notice.  The adoption of such resolution will be a reserved function of the elected members who will have to consider, not only the claims of their servants but the taxable position of ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of new basic principles as regards servants which have not so far been contained in superannuation law and I have no doubt that local authorities will in due course give the matter equitable consideration having regard to their own position and also that of their servants.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Seanad if it could see its way to expedite the passing of the Housing Bill and I would ask it to pass this Bill as it stands without amendment.  The Bill represents an agreement between many interested authorities, more or less.  It was in grave danger of being jettisoned by reason of the approaching general election but I decided that I should endeavour to have it passed into law, if that could be done without undue delay or undue difficulty.  It has involved a very serious strain not only upon me but upon the members of my staff.  It is a far-reaching code and I think it is generally regarded as a very satisfactory code.  It was passed through the Dáil on the basis I have outlined, that is to say, that the Government having considered all the requests that had been made to it, and having discussed these requests with other interests concerned, decided to make certain amendments to the Bill which, if they were accepted by the House, would <Col N="1948" /> assure its agreed passage through Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Seanad to consider the measure in that light for this reason.  A considerable number of officers, who retired early this year and in the latter part of last year, and who in the normal course, had it not been for their retirement under the Age Limit Order, would have been continued in the service of local authorities, would have been entitled to secure pensions based upon the present rates of remuneration prevailing.  Because they retired before these rates of remuneration were accepted and agreed upon, they retired upon pensions which were considerably lower than those which they could otherwise have enjoyed.  There are also, of course, a considerable number of officers who were affected by the operation of the Standstill Order and whose retiring allowances were accordingly based on the salaries which they were in receipt of at the date of retirement. All these people are vitally affected by the Bill and if there were to be any grave difference of opinion about it, such a difference of opinion as would involve a re-summoning of the other House or a prolonged discussion on the Bill, I could not accept the responsibility of asking the other House to meet to consider it.  For that reason I would plead very strongly that the Bill should go through in its present form.</P>

      <P>I have not been in a position to examine this Bill as carefully as I should like.  I know this important matter of the superannuation of local officers has been discussed for a considerable number of years.  The Bill is a complicated one and, no doubt, in its main terms is satisfactory.  I want to raise two matters&mdash;one a general matter and the other a particular matter.  It has often struck me that there should be an interchange between local government officers and civil servants.  I take it that, under Section 18, if a civil servant leaves the Civil Service and enters the service of a local authority his former service will count for pensionable purposes.  Is the reverse the case at all?</P>

      <P>That is a very important improvement in the general situation as between officers who may leave the Civil Service and enter the service of a local authority and <i>vice versa.</i>  There is one other point which relates to Section 79.  A similar point was raised on the Civil Service (Superannuation) Bill. The Minister, as the Bill was originally drafted, went back as far as 1946.  I think in the other House he accepted an amendment to go back to 1940.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point, but it seems to me that since the argument is almost the same&mdash;not precisely the same&mdash;as in the case of civil servants, this must necessarily be a small class of persons, a class, in the nature of things, over 70 years on the average, who are therefore dwindling and who, since they had fixed pensions, were hard hit by the rising cost of living during the war.  Now, at an advanced age, they find other persons are getting an increase and they will get nothing.  From the point of view of justice and from the point of view that the charge in the beginning will be small and will decrease annually by the law of nature, so to speak, I feel that these people should be included.</P>
      <P>I have been given a number of examples, at least one of which strikes me as being very remarkable indeed. A person retired in February, 1931, with a fixed pension, plus the cost-of-living bonus, and I compare that case with the case of a corporation employee retiring in the same year with a fixed pension.  The fixed pension was £900.  It has not been increased and will not be increased by this Bill, whereas the pension of the other officer, with less onerous responsibilities, will be increased now to something over £1,000.  That is a matter well worthy of consideration on Section 79.  It can be raised there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister concluded by telling us <Col N="1950" /> that if this Bill is not accepted in its present form those who would benefit by it may lose their benefits entirely. That is a familiar argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, generally speaking, the House will gladly welcome the introduction of this Bill, inasmuch as it meets a demand which has been pressed for a number of years &mdash;to my own knowledge for ten or 12 years&mdash;on behalf of the employees of local authorities who hitherto were not entitled to a retiring allowance.  It will bring that section of the community entitled by statute to a retiring allowance to fairly substantial proportions. On the whole, the Bill is a very satisfactory one and one that we can all welcome.</P>
      <P>There are defects of a serious character in the Bill which, I hope, notwithstanding the appeal of the Minister, this House will do something to remedy.  For instance, at this moment, before the Bill becomes law, practically all the servants as distinct from the officers of the Dublin Corporation are assured that if they become incapable of carrying on their work they will get an allowance of some kind from the corporation.  Under the Bill a considerable proportion of these men will be deprived of something to which they are now entitled.</P>
      <P>When this Bill becomes law the Dublin Corporation will be called upon to determine whether or not they will adopt Part III.  If the corporation decide to adopt Part III they will be called upon under this section to pass a resolution fixing the number of persons who may be registered as pensionable servants of the corporation.  Once they have determined that the number shall be 1,000 or 2,000 or whatever the number may be, the corporation will then be precluded from altering that figure for five years.  Each decision fixing the number of persons to be regarded as pensionable servants remains for five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, however, the number of pensionable servants is limited in another respect.  It is limited in this way, that under the Bill nobody can commence to count his period of service until he reaches the age of 18 <Col N="1951" /> years, so that if he starts at 16 years there is no credit given to him for the two years until he is 18 years.  He must be at least two years in the service of the corporation or, of course, of any local authority, before he can go on the register of servants.  You have this kind of limitation, the waiting period first and, secondly, the waiting for a vacancy to arise on the register. Men may be 20 years in the service of a local authority like the Dublin Corporation and still fail to become registered servants.</P>
    <P>Once this Bill becomes law and Part III is adopted by the local authority and the register of servants is created, from that moment the local authority has no power to grant to people any gratuity or allowance, things they are entitled to at this moment.  Rights they have now will disappear to the detriment of the employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator forgets there is nothing in this that compels the Dublin Corporation to adopt this scheme instead of the scheme already in existence.  He is overlooking that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I said that if the corporation adopts Part III of this Bill the consequences which I have enumerated will follow automatically and the Minister will take power under another Bill to ensure that the membership of the corporation will be so altered in character as to comply with the intentions of this Bill.  I say quite frankly that the people with whom I have contact in the service of the Dublin Corporation are genuinely anxious about the provisions of this Bill.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is setting out deliberately to deprive certain people of rights which have accrued to them during the period of 20 or 30 years, but I am suggesting that he has not taken into account fully the effects which are likely to flow in certain circumstances from the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I have been approached concerning the kind of case to which Senator Hayes has referred.  It is an anomaly, no doubt, but it is hurtful as <Col N="1952" /> well as unfair to certain old employees of local authorities, particularly old employees of the Dublin Corporation. I have in mind the case of a man who was asked by the Government of this country to leave the service of the corporation to perform work of national importance at a time when there was some difficulty in getting men of capacity, training and competence to undertake work of that kind&mdash;1924. The person concerned has been out of the service of the corporation since 1924, doing work which he was requested to undertake on behalf of the community for a period of years.  From 1931 he ceased to be in the effective service of the corporation.  He retired with what is called a fixed pension.  As Senator Hayes says, his pension is not capable of adjustment under this Bill. He gets no increase in his pension. Other servants of the corporation who are differently situated, who retired with minor rank and lower pensions will, when this Bill becomes law, have a pension of £200 per year more than the person to whom I am referring.  I think Senator Hayes and I are referring to the same person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the person to whom we are referring belonged to a big class, I would hesitate to ask the Minister to review the circumstances of his case.  I see great difficulty in asking the Government to review a decision, particularly where finance is concerned, affecting large numbers of people, but I made some inquiries regarding the case in point and the information I have is that there are altogether concerned in this suggestion of Senator Hayes' and mine, 38 persons.  Six of them have a pension of less than £75 per year, that is, something less than 27/6 per week.  Every one of them is over 70.  With possibly one exception, I think they are all over 75.  We are dealing here with a class numbering in all 38 persons, between the ages of 75 and 80.  As I have shown, six persons at least have pensions of 27/6 per week or less.  Only seven out of the 38 have a pension of £500 per year or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest that the Minister might allow his sympathies to be affected by the plight of people <Col N="1953" /> belonging to the category to which I am referring.  Again, I say that I recognise the difficulty where large bodies of people are concerned.  This Bill, however, in Section 79, makes a distinction between two classes, between the persons who retired with a fixed pension and the persons who retired with a variable pension.  If they retired with a variable pension, as the great majority of these officers did, they are entitled to increments under this Bill.  If they retired with a fixed pension, as a small number of them have done, they are entitled to nothing under the Bill.  The anomaly exists in the one case I referred to of the man who retired in the circumstances I have described, who will, when the Bill becomes law, be receiving a pension of £200 per year less than a junior officer who during his service had a less responsible position and who retired on a smaller pension.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would direct the Minister's attention is this: the contribution prescribed in the case of registered servants is, in my opinion, unreasonably high.  I admit that the argument could be put up that a valuable concession is being given to the servants of local authorities, at what is, after all, a modest rate of contribution&mdash;4?th per cent.&mdash;in other words, a halfpenny per shilling of wages.  Let us see what that means in pounds, shillings and pence in relation to Pat Murphy, one of the people concerned. Let us assume his wages are £3 per week&mdash;and that is a higher rate of pay than the great majority of registered servants of local authorities would have, apart from County Dublin. Let us assume he is a County Dublin road worker.  On a wage of £3 per week, his contribution would be 2/6. Whatever 4?th per cent. may mean in relation to a pension, 2/6 a week contribution out of a wage of £3 is more than the workman can reasonably bear.  The rents of the cottages have increased enormously in the past ten or 15 years.  I remember when you could get a decent county council cottage in County Dublin for 2/- a week, including rates.  The rent of a similar cottage to-day is about 7/- a week.  On top of that there is 2/6 contribution, on top of that, additional <Col N="1954" /> taxation on beer, tobacco and everything else.  These are factors which ought not be ignored.  They are factors which should be considered by the workers concerned in deciding whether or not this Bill is to be of any use to them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister did not go to the trouble of introducing this Bill unless he intended that it would be of use to the employees of local authorities and that he intended that the local authorities would adopt it and that the employees in the main would derive benefits under the Bill.  I accept that right away, but I am trying to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there are these impediments which will deprive him of the pleasure of having introduced an acceptable, comprehensive pension scheme for the employees of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Again, the question arises of broken time.  A person whose name is added to the register of registered servants, that is, an ordinary wage earner employed by the local authority, may find himself removed from the register and his qualifying period for a pension curtailed by reason of the fact that he has worked less than 200 days in the year.  I calculate that the total number of working days for the servant of a local authority is 285, deducting Sundays, Catholic holidays and annual leave.  If at any period a man is laid off for 85 days or more, he loses entitlement to be continued as a registered servant of the local authority.  We do know that there was a number of cases in the past where local authorities were obliged to lay off large sections of their workers during financial crisis.  That is going to have the effect of depriving them of their entitlement to remain on a pensionable status.  I would urge the Minister to consider these points, to consider whether he desires that this Bill should, in fact, become the charter of the servants of local authorities.  If he desires that, then I suggest he should examine the provisions to which I have drawn attention, and some others, so as to ensure that the Bill carries out his intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been sought by the representatives of <Col N="1955" /> local authorities and by the direct representations of local government officials, whether classified as officers or servants, over a period of 15 years. In fact, in 1933 the then Minister for Local Government who, happily, now is President of this country, promised to take up this matter and deal with it as quickly as possible.  There were immense difficulties then, due to differences in the conditions of employment under the various local authorities of officers and what are classified as servants. Those difficulties have been straightened out, and I am glad that in the year of grace, 1947, this Bill has seen the light of day and has been brought before us by the present Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>It is a pity, in a way, that it should be before us at this period, at the end of the life of this House, when we have not sufficient time to consider it in all its detail, and to suggest amendments to the Minister.  As I have said, a demand was made for it by those to whom I have referred, not entirely on their own behalf or because of the benefits that would accrue to themselves during the period when they would be on pension, but rather to meet the difficulty that would face their dependents if anything should happen to the breadwinner while still in active service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A big difference obtains as between the position of the officials of a local authority and those in the employment of the State.  If a State servant dies while on active service, his dependents will receive a payment from State sources which will help to tide the family over the sudden cutting off of the breadwinner's income.  On many occasions I have brought that position to the attention of the House although we had not then an actual Bill before us.  We have this Bill now, and I wish to suggest amendments to it on behalf of local government officials and of municipal employees.  There is not much use in my doing so if the Minister will not agree to accept them.  It may be suggested that their acceptance would have the effect of putting an additional charge on the Exchequer.  I do not think that would be so because any increase given would fall not on a <Col N="1956" /> central authority but on the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to sub-section (1) of Section 37, which provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where on the commencement of this Part of this Act a person is a pensionable officer of a local authority and, on the 1st day of January, 1947, he had not reached&mdash; (a) in case he is a fire brigade officer, the age of 55 years, or (b) in any other case, the age of 60 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should delete all the words from the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 11 down to the word &ldquo;years&rdquo; in line 15.  If he does it will mean that it will be possible for any officer or employee of a local authority, whether he is over 60 years or not, to opt in or out of this pension scheme.  I think the argument is used, in the case of these officers or employees, that when they had reached the age of 60&mdash;in five years they would be retiring on a pension of two-thirds of their salary&mdash;the majority of them would opt to remain as they are. I think that is an additional argument in favour of giving them the right to opt.  They are deprived by Section 37 of opting into this pension scheme and, presumably, the idea is that the majority of them would feel that they would be better off by not opting into it.  I think it is reasonable to give an officer or an employee the right to say: &ldquo;Well, I will choose the new scheme even though my pension will be less than what it would be if I lived to the age of 65 and were to go out on pension under the conditions obtaining at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said in the course of my introductory remarks, the thing that will weigh mostly with an officer or an employee is that if he dies between the age of 60 and 65 his dependents will have nothing to get.  No civil servant and no local authority officer ever dies rich.  The majority of them will die in debt.  That applies especially to the officers and employees of local authorities who, during the emergency period, were subjected to much greater privations than civil servants.  In the case of the former there was what may be described as a ceiling prohibition, so that they got no increase in their salaries.  The position of the civil servants <Col N="1957" /> was different because they had a cost-of-living bonus and got a sectional rise every time, and an additional rise in salary after that.</P>
    <P>During the emergency period, the officials of local authorities had to pledge their insurance policies in order to educate their families and help them over that very difficult time.  They did not protest to any great extent against that.  They shouldered their share of the burdens during the emergency period as most citizens did.  They modelled their lives on whatever salaries they had at that time, but the position to-day is that every one of them is in straitened circumstances. What weighs with most of them is that if they were to die between the age of 60 and 65 their widows and families will have nothing to compensate them for the consequent loss of their incomes.  It is reasonable that the Minister should give to the fire brigade officer, if he has passed 55 years of age, and the ordinary officer, if he has passed the age of 60, the right to opt for the new system, or to remain as he is.  The person with no dependents, such as the bachelor who has only himself to take care of, will naturally choose to remain and will get two-thirds pension when he reaches retiring age, but the much more important officer, the officer with the wife and family to provide for, will say that it is to his advantage to have some provision made for his widow and orphans, if he should die in harness, on the basis of his having a lesser pension when he reaches retiring age and will opt for the conditions offered by this Bill.  I appeal to the House to try to induce the Minister to accept this suggestion, even if it does mean bringing the Dáil back after Christmas.  What harm is there in bringing the Dáil back?  It will have to come back to deal with amendments passed yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not.  The Dáil is not being called back to deal with these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if it is not, I appeal to the Minister to call the Dáil to consider this after Christmas, because the Dáil did not consider these <Col N="1958" /> provisions to the extent to which we would have liked the Dáil to do so, or to the extent to which I should like this House to consider them now.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (9) of Section 37 deals with the semi-retrospective application of the section.  I suggest that members of the House put themselves in the position of officials looking forward to the introduction of this Bill for years, with a view to getting some satisfactory system of compensation for their years of faithful service to a local authority and provision for their widows and orphans.  Years passed, and an official died, leaving six, seven and eight of a family, as happened in many cases, with no provision.  Another year passed and another died, and we were still looking forward to the introduction of the Bill.  The ultimate result is that the dependents of any official who died since 1st January, 1947, will be provided for, but that will apply only where the official was not over 60.</P>
      <P>From 60 to 65 is the vital period to which the Bill should apply, because it is the period in which the greater number of officials fall by the wayside. Members of the House know the very sad circumstances involved in the cases of officials and employees of the bodies in this city, the corporation and the county council.  There would be a greater number of officials involved here than in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be some similar cases in the country of which we are not aware, but I personally know some very sad cases of officials of the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council who died in harness and whose dependents are in very bad circumstances.  These dependents will get no satisfaction under the terms of this clause, because the deadline is 1st January, 1947, and my appeal is based on the fact that these officials waited so long for these provisions and we now find that it applies only to officials who died since 1st January, 1947.  No matter how far we go back, unless we go back to the period in which none of these dependents was born, somebody will be aggrieved, but I suggest that we go back to 1st January, 1945.  There may be somebody who will not be covered then, but we should, at any rate, go back two years so as to cover some of <Col N="1959" /> these people who are in very bad circumstances.</P>
    <P>My third point is the point dealt with already by Senators Hayes and Duffy. The difference between the officials who retired on a pension based on a sliding cost-of-living bonus and basic salary and those who retired on consolidated salaries will certainly be accentuated by this legislation.  It would not be so bad if it applied to everybody, but the clause as it stands will allow the people who retired on a cost-of-living bonus and basic salary pension before 1940 to get an increase, and some of these people will have their high pensions further increased, while people who went out before 1st July, 1940, on £70, £80 and £100 a year cannot have their pensions increased. Only one increase is allowed and that is at the option of the local authority. Naturally, a local authority will be as conservative as a Minister or anybody else about giving a further increase to people who went out on a pension based on a fixed salary, but in the case of a person who went out on a cost-of-living and basic salary pension, the increase cannot be stopped.  It has to be given under the Bill.</P>
    <P>That is perpetuating a difference which should not be perpetuated and I suggest that the limit set out: &ldquo;after the first day of July, 1940,&rdquo; should be deleted, so that the same conditions will apply to those who went out on a pension based on a fixed salary as apply to those who went out on a pension based on a cost-of-living bonus and a basic salary.  As the Bill stands one section will get an increase whether they went out before 1940 or not&mdash;going back even as far as 1930&mdash;because they went out on a salary and bonus basis, and if they have a bigger pension at present than those who went out on a pension based on a fixed salary, that bigger pension will be increased, while the person with the fixed salary pension will get nothing.  It is reasonable and fair that the clause: &ldquo;after the 1st day of July, 1940,&rdquo; should be deleted.  It will not compel the local authority, but will give them the right to choose. Most members of local authorities are democratic enough to rectify the <Col N="1960" /> position of the person on a low pension and leave others as they are.  If the Minister does not accept this point of view, he will be spoiling the ship for a ha'porth of tar.  He will be spoiling a fine Bill, which has been looked forward to for so many years, by including these conditions, which will be irritating to the officials and cause hardships to the dependents.</P>
    <P>It is a great hardship on the officers if they are not allowed to choose.  It is not their own personal conditions they will be thinking of, but the conditions which will obtain for their dependents, if they are stricken down while still employed by a local authority.  The same thing will weigh with them as would weigh with people in considering the alleged hardships of the recent Budget.  The Budget was brought in to relieve the household and to impose a tax, not on necessaries but on luxuries which we need not consume if we do not wish.  The officials here will be thinking, not of themselves but of their dependents if they happen to die in harness, who will have no redress and no gratuity to help them over the trying period after the death of the breadwinner.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter and on his own behalf to bring in amendments to rectify it.  I am prepared to put down amendments myself and debate them on the Committee Stage, but it would be far easier if we could convince him that the case is sound and that he should accept the arguments which I have put up in favour of it.  I draw special attention to these three sections because they are just the blemishes that still remain on the conditions of employment of local authority officials or servants. This proposal is really only bringing local government employment into line with the conditions which obtain in the Civil Service.  We have been looking forward for so long to the introduction of this legislation and we had hoped that everybody would be satisfied, but everybody cannot be satisfied unless these three sections are amended.  I appeal to the Minister to do that, even to the extent of calling back the Dáil to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. Patrick J. O'Reilly Mr. Patrick J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>When people <Col N="1961" /> in my locality approach me for something depending on the good graces of the Government, I generally advise them to see one of the Government's official supporters.  I am delighted to find that, in this case, the section to which I intended to devote great attention has been ably dealt with by Senator O'Donovan.  It is a great thing to see agreement on both sides of the House and I must compliment him on the remarkably able statement he has made regarding Section 37.  My notes read exactly as if they were a copy of his remarks and, by a curious coincidence, I selected also the year 1945.</P>
      <P>In Section 79, the Minister decided to go forward three years in order to give certain living officers the full benefit of this Bill.  If it is permissible and right to go forward, it is still more equitable to go backwards some distance.  We could not go back far enough to remedy all the cases of hardship, but a three-year period is already chosen by the Minister and is a reasonable period.  We may presume that other cases of hardship have flattened themselves out, that the people who suffered have by now devised some way of getting over the difficulties; but if I thought there was the remotest chance of getting the Minister to accept a period of five years, I would be inclined to press it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree fully with Senator O'Donovan's suggestion about removing the 60 age limit.  Two of the cases I have in mind would be automatically excluded if that limit were retained in Section 37.  I suggest that the Minister should, at the end of the second line of Section 37 (i), delete all the words following &ldquo;and&rdquo; down to the words &ldquo;60 years of age&rdquo;, that is, the two paragraphs (a) and (b) and in sub-section (9) put in &ldquo;1945&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;1947&rdquo;.  That would bring in some of the more urgent cases that have happened within recent years.  I put up a case to the Minister myself on behalf of a member of my staff and received the official reply that the Minister had included this section in the Bill.  I would like to express my gratitude to him for the kind thought which suggested this particular retrospective <Col N="1962" /> clause.  It was an admirable thing on his part to have gone that far.  I quite realise that he has responsibilities, as we all have, with regard to the finance of all these measures.  But the number of cases, really, that would be added if we were to go back a year or two more would not be very considerable.</P>
    <P>In connection with that, and with the question of financial responsibility, I would like to remind the House that there is a common misunderstanding about the body or interest which I represent.  I represent in this House every vocational education committee in Éire and there are 38 of them in all.  I represent the four county borough committees, the seven scheduled urban committees and the 27 county committees.  I do not represent the officers of those committees specially, but I represent rather the employers or the members of the committees.  Speaking as the representative of that very representative body, I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the amendment to Section 37 suggested by Senator O'Donovan.  I could assure him that, should he adopt this, I do not think there would be the slightest murmur of dissent as a result, but rather a chorus of praise.</P>
    <P>Two of the cases which I have specially in mind are concerned with two of the southern counties.  One of them is the largest county in Ireland which is known to the majority of people, that is the County Cork.  Another case occurred in Kerry.  It was the case of a very cultured man, a highly gifted man who had not that material outlook which seems to be growing at the present day.  In his dreams of a greater Ireland he neglected to a great extent his worldly condition and left a position to his dependents which was a rather difficult one.  The other case was of a man who spent himself in the service of a vocational education committee. He had to deal with an enormous area and in the early days he incurred a great deal of private expenditure in making the contacts necessary for the success of his work.  He got no special recognition for that, nor could it be given him, but now that he has passed away, I would ask the Minister <Col N="1963" /> to give some little consideration to this particular case.  I could mention some of the most pathetic cases imaginable and I have mentioned one or two to the Minister himself.  In one case if a man ever suffered torture in this life it was this man; his wife is in hospital; two of his children are dead and some of them are threatened with disease, but there is absolutely no provision made for them unless some provision is brought in now.</P>
    <P>Having said so much in regard to Senator O'Donovan's amendment, I would like to point out that the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act introduced conditions which are in direct conflict with the promises given in the Vocational Education Act of 1930.  A condition in regard to retirement age was brought into that Act and that particular condition has been introduced in the present Act in a somewhat different form and applies to the officers.  We all thought, as Senator O'Donovan stated, that when the Superannuation Act came along, our wives and children would be safe, whatever happened to ourselves, but now we find that a condition in regard to 60 years has been brought in for the purpose of excluding those who should get more consideration.  In my opinion, this is unfair.</P>
    <P>Let us take what happened in regard to the cost-of-living Act.  The first time it became an Act, the index figure was 185.  In an amending Act it was raised to 210 and in more recent years the figure 270 was mentioned.  The cost-of-living Act was, as it were, circumvented by the consolidation arrangements and this way of getting round the Act was definitely unfair and unjust.  Consolidation was brought in based on a figure or index of 270 and there is great uneasiness on the part of a number of people connected with the service of vocational education in regard to the whole matter.  Senator O'Donovan and, I think, Senator Duffy also referred to it.  Recently the Minister issued a circular to all vocational education committees and according to this circular which is dated the 27th November what should be done is this: All the component parts of an officer's <Col N="1964" /> remuneration should be integrated and his average remuneration for the previous three years calculated.  This circular is dated the 27th November. Undoubtedly the present Act contains a section which enables vocational education committees to increase the allowance beyond that which is contained in the circular, but why the circular was issued at this moment is more than I can comprehend.  For if the committees wish, they may interpret the circular as laying down what they must do regardless of Section 37 of this Bill, which is in itself a vague construction.  I do not say that it was the intention of the measure, but it is reasonable to conclude that officers were tricked into agreeing to the consolidation arrangement.  I was present on a deputation to the Minister for Education and we were given a definite assurance that our pension rights would not be prejudiced if we accepted the consolidation arrangement, but as soon as we agreed to accept it, we find a circular issued which on the face of it seems to be a flat contradiction of this assurance.</P>
    <P>It can be said that you can increase the pension allowance under Section 79 but some committees may not think that they are under any obligation to do so, particularly in view of this circular. Therefore, these different interests which I represent asked me to make sure that something should be put into the Act itself which will clarify the position in regard to officers.</P>
    <P>I received a letter recently from the chief executive officer of a vocational education committee who spent some time in the service of the Board of National Education.  He gave a total period of 19 years' service.  That particular officer, in spite of the provisions of this Act, has been informed&mdash;or, if you like, with the provisions of the Act before him has been assured&mdash;by a responsible officer&mdash;that the longest period of service he can be given credit for is ten years, instead of the 19 years to which he would appear to be entitled.  If we are enthusiastic about the revival of our national language and if we are anxious to make provision in regard to the advancement of our national language and the welfare of those who were engaged in it in its <Col N="1965" /> pioneer days, we should consider this example which is that of a man who was enthusiastic for the revival of the language and was in the service of the national board for that period.  An example of a man who sacrificed himself more than any man in the country, I may say, in his advocacy of the national language movement at a time when it was not a popular one; at a time when there was no material advantage to be gained, this man stood out and lost his position as a result, or rather, when the school in which he was teaching was subsequently closed he found it impossible to get another post and spent a number of years wandering from one job to another until eventually he got into the vocational education service as a teacher.  He is now assured&mdash;not perhaps in writing, but by a responsible official&mdash;that the longest service which he can claim is ten years and I suggest that something should be done in this particular case.</P>
    <P>Another matter requiring attention is the case of officers employed by Cork City Vocational Education Committee who were employed on a temporary whole-time basis in connection with the provision of the Vocational Education Act of 1930, what might be called the experimental implementation of Section 5.  These officers were appointed on a temporary whole-time basis and they themselves believe, and have assured me, that there is nothing in this Act to protect their interests with regard to service amounting in all to eight years.  My attention has been drawn to the fact that while the servants of the vocational education committees of the City of Dublin and of Dún Laoghaire are protected, the Act excludes the servants of the cities of Cork, Limerick and Waterford. At least, their cases are not mentioned in the Act and in that way they are apparently automatically excluded.  There would appear then to be a case for the Act being amended in these respects.  These, I think, are the principal matters on which, at the moment, I would like to dwell.  The Minister, in his opening announcement, said that this measure had been passed by the Dáil and, as such, should then be accepted by this House.</P>

      <P>The Dáil has not men of the calibre of, say, Senator O'Donovan who is in direct touch with officers.  May I say also with all modesty that they had not a member of exactly my own particular status, qualifications and experience inasmuch as I represent employers as well as employees?  I represent employers, i.e., members of vocational education committees throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  I am familiar with the views of all the servants and the officers concerned. I am, therefore, in a position to say that there is great dissatisfaction with certain parts of this Act.  I could say a whole lot more, but I do not want to delay the House and I will concern myself with only a few other matters.</P>
      <P>My attention has been called to the fact that by the use of the word &ldquo;fidelity&rdquo;, and so forth, an officer might find at the end of his service that his pension is reduced by, say, 50 per cent.  Of course the remedy is quite clear.  If, at any stage in his career an officer is found to be unsatisfactory, the proper thing would be to deal with him there and then.  There does not appear to be any case for putting this arbitrary figure of 50 per cent. into the Act.  Take the case of two men&mdash;one with two years' service and the other with 30 or 40 years' service&mdash;whose pensions are reduced.  There is no parallel between the magnitude of the penalties in these two cases.  These are details which I can assure the Minister are causing very great uneasiness in the minds of many officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of Gaelic service, I should like to say that I am not sure that the Act provides properly for teachers who were pioneers in the Gaelic League.  I have one particular case in mind at the moment.  I am wondering what way the case of this officer will emerge after the Civil Service experts have put their hands on it. I am hoping for the best.  I should imagine that the Act should be drafted in such a broad comprehensive way as to give the maximum credit for service of that kind.  I have some recollection of the period myself.  I am not as fluent a speaker of Irish as I should be having regard to my early associations. <Col N="1967" /> In the early days I had the privilege of working for years with a brother of the late Father O'Growney.  During that period I was acquainted with the conditions under which Gaelic teachers taught.  I actually had the temerity to teach Irish under the local Gaelic League for some years.  Having quite a number of magnificent Irish speakers on my staff I can say that they are deserving of every possible consideration having regard to the hardships and rebuffs they suffered in the early stages when very few people were inclined to take the movement for the revival of the Irish language anyway seriously.</P>
    <P>With regard to the death penalty&mdash; the Minister is a hard northern sort of man&mdash;though I have heard that if you can get under the skin of the northern people they are not quite as hard as they seem.  There is the saying: &ldquo;Dark and true and tender is the North,&rdquo; and let us hope that the Minister now, in this holy season, will get into the appropriate mood and think the matter over seriously to-night.  Even if it means postponing the Bill until early in January, it would be worth it in view of the great deal of pleasure it would give to many people.  I suggest that he should not force the Bill through and that we should make it, as Senator O'Donovan said, as nearly perfect as possible.  Undoubtedly, it goes a long way to meet the views of officers generally.  I have agitated for many years about the question of a lump sum, but I am now one of those who are not in a position to avail of it after having done so much to try to put the case for it before the Minister.  For the sake of the few thousand pounds involved, the Minister should cut out the question of the 60 years' age bar.  If he does that, it will be only a matter of a few years when all the creases will be ironed out and people, generally, will feel so pleased that they will forget any expenditure involved.  I would join with Senator O'Donovan in asking the Minister to remove some of these difficulties and I make a special appeal to amend Section 37 so as to bring under it cases that occurred during the last few years.</P>

      <P>Happily most of the <Col N="1968" /> points I had in mind were more ably dealt with by previous speakers&mdash; especially by Senators O'Donovan and O'Reilly.  I have one point to make in connection with the local authority officer.  While civil servants and others may retire at 60 years of age on full pension, a local authority officer&mdash;I have a particular individual in mind&mdash; may not retire until 65 years of age.</P>

      <P>That is not the grievance. His grievance is not that he may retire at 65 but that he will have 40 years' service when retiring next year and that he will not come within the provisions of the Act.  He considers it a terrible grievance that, having attained the very fine service of 40 years, he should not derive the same benefits as other officers who may come out at an earlier date.  Perhaps there is an explanation.  The matter is so absurd that there is, possibly, an explanation and if there is, of course, that will settle everything.  We have heard amongst other things a case made in relation to the hardships that accrue when a pensioned officer dies very soon after the time he retires.  I think we should adopt a system, which has been adopted in some other countries, that there should be an alternative scheme of pensions whereby a pensioner may accept a lesser sum than the sum granted to him so that his wife or dependents would continue to receive the pension after his death, should he die within a certain period. It is very sad when an officer after many years' work, and shortly after being granted a pension, dies.  His wife and his dependents are left without anything.  In other countries the system has been adopted by the big services whereby, on a purely actuarial calculation, they may expect a reduced pension if the officer should die within a certain specified period.  That is something which deserves consideration. I hope that in some future Bill provision will be made for an alternative scheme of pensions.  I do not want to repeat that any more, but I think that idea is worthy of consideration by the Minister in addition to the other specific points.  I have mentioned. <Col N="1969" /> That is all with which I shall trouble the House at the moment.</P>

      <P>I am afraid this has been rather a one-sided debate in which the only interest that has been considered by those who have spoken has been the interest of the beneficiaries under the Bill.  Their spokesmen have contented themselves with adopting the position of Oliver Twist and asking for more.  I am not going to be a tyrannical Bumble, but I am going to point out that other interests are involved in this.  Other interests are involved, namely, the interests of those people who have to pay for these benefits.  It is in that capacity that I and the Government have to stand over this Bill as presented to this House.  We think we have, after giving careful consideration to all the aspects of this problem, met the position of the officers of the local authorities very fairly having regard to the fact that we have responsibilities also to the taxpayers and to the ratepayers of this country.  That does not seem to be generally recognised.  The only thing we have heard about this Bill here is its imperfections because it <Col N="1971" /> has failed to meet the special case of this or that particular individual.  We are told that it does not matter if the Dáil has to be called back, or if Ministers have to turn their attention to more important matters, provided the position of a few officers of the corporation is dealt with.  I think that is a most unreasonable suggestion.  This House does not exist solely for the benefit of a few individuals and it is not at the disposal&mdash;at least as far as I am concerned&mdash;of a few individuals to utilise it for the purpose of passing legislation which, while it might benefit them, would impose added burdens on others.</P>
      <P>We must approach this Bill with one very significant fact in mind.  What has been asked for and what has always been demanded by those who have been hitherto the spokesmen of the local authorities is that they should be given the same pension terms as those accorded to civil servants.  They are getting that in this Bill.  They are getting things in this Bill that they never dreamed they would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding all the time and thought and labour that have been spent in endeavouring to bring in this Bill&mdash;and Senator O'Donovan has told you that the Bill was first promised 15 years ago and that promise has been repeated many times since&mdash;no time is found for or no attempt is made at any constructive criticism of the Bill.  That promise made 15 years ago would have been fulfilled had it been an easy matter to do it.  I think some consideration and some recognition should be given to the fact that it was an extremely difficult matter to draft this Bill, extremely difficult because of the action of this Seanad who would impose burdens upon people not directly represented here in the Seanad.  The officials of the vocational education committees have the advantage of having Senator O'Reilly here.  The officers of the Dublin Corporation and other local government officers have the advantage of having Senator O'Donovan here.  I suppose the servants and officers of the Dublin Corporation also have the advantage of having Senator Duffy here.  I am <Col N="1972" /> the only person so far who has spoken for the great body of the public&mdash;for the people who will have to foot the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect, I do not want to interrupt the Minister but I do want to keep the matter right.  I said the officer concerned was asked by the head of the Government of that day to take another position under the Government.  I understand he accepted a salary in that other position.  Payment from the Dublin Corporation was discontinued but he did not cease to be an officer until 1931 when he left the other employment and took his pension from the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the circumstances of this particular case are.  The general practice is that if an individual resigns on pension from the service of a local authority and does not enter the service of another local authority, but is again employed, unless there is some statutory bar he draws both his pension from the local authority and his salary in respect of the post he holds.  I understand that is the general position.  I do not think there is any special exception in this particular case.  That is the first thing. The next thing is that this officer apparently retired on a fixed pension. He must have been in receipt of a fixed salary.  His case is now being compared and contrasted with that of an officer who was employed upon a basic salary plus a cost-of-living bonus.  If an officer of a local authority remunerated in that way retires his pension consists of a <Col N="1974" /> fixed sum plus cost-of-living bonus. That is his contract.  His cost-of-living bonus would increase with an increase in the cost-of-living index and decline with a decrease in the cost-of-living index.  That has always been in force except during the period of the standstill Order.  This particular Section 79 to which reference has been made deals mainly with the position of officers, first of all, who retired during the period of the standstill Order, having previously been in receipt of salaries carrying a cost-of-living bonus.  In normal circumstances they would have been entitled to secure a pension consisting of a fixed sum plus a cost-of-living bonus.  That was their contract.  The other officer mentioned retired with a fixed pension which, I assume, was based upon a fixed salary.  If the pension was fixed and did not vary that was the contract. What I have been asked to do here is to amend and alter that contract to such officer's advantage.</P>
      <P>I understand that is the type of case with which the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice were called upon to deal in this House in regard to other Bills that have been before the Seanad.  It has been decided, for good or ill, that it is not in the public interest to do that, particularly where no compassionate grounds can be advanced for doing it.  I can quite see that if pensions were miserably inadequate there might be a special case for special consideration to a particular class of persons, particularly if that class was so large and numerous that hardship would be widespread.  As a matter of fact, I think that has been done in Great Britain, but it has been done with a very rigid limitation&mdash;a limitation imposing a comparatively low disqualifying figure over which the persons in receipt of salaries or pensions would secure no benefit at all. But, in general, the position that has been taken up and has been maintained continuously is that, once a person retires upon a pension which would be normally regarded as sufficient, then that pension will not be revised to his advantage after his period of service has long since terminated.  That is a position which I must maintain in regard to this class of persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of Section 79 were, <Col N="1975" /> in the main, brought in to deal with three types of cases.  First of all, two classes of persons who retired during the period of the standstill Order: (1) those who normally would have been entitled to have their pension carry a cost-of-living bonus by reason of the fact that their salary consisted of a fixed sum plus a cost-of-living bonus; (2) those who retired during the period of the standstill Order who had fixed salaries and in respect of whom we were prepared to concede that, if it had not been for the operation of that standstill Order, they probably would have secured some compensating allowance for the increase in the cost of living.  The third class of persons dealt with under Section 79 are those people who held their office with no age limit applying and whom we compelled to retire at the age of 65 on the 1st April this year.  If the contract of service of these people had not been more or less interfered with in this way, they would naturally have been in the service of the local authority when it was agreed that an increase of remuneration of officers of local authorities should be conceded. Accordingly, we are prepared under Section 79 to give to these people the benefits which they would have enjoyed if they were permitted to serve for a full period of three years after the new scales came into operation.  These are three classes of people who have, in some way or another, either absolute contractual rights or rights almost equivalent to contractual rights.</P>
    <P>That does not apply to a person who retired in the year 1931, or who retired prior to the imposition of what is known as the standstill Order.  Therefore, I am not prepared to consider any amendment of the Bill which would propose to bring such persons in, whether, in the case of the Dublin Corporation or any other local authority, they would be a small class or not, because to bring them in would be to concede something which the Government as a whole have decided is not in the public interest and which other members of the Government are not prepared to concede in respect of those officers for whom they have immediate responsibility.  That is a matter which has been fully considered, and it would <Col N="1976" /> be quite vain to put down an amendment of that type in the Seanad because&mdash;I am speaking frankly&mdash;I would try to induce the Seanad not to accept it and, if they did accept it and the Bill had to go back to the Dáil, I should use all my endeavours in the Dáil to ensure that it would not be accepted.  Therefore, it would be, so far as you can foresee, of no practical effect.</P>

      <P>With regard to Section 79, I think there is a difference between the local authority officials and the civil servants in favour of the local authority officials in regard to retirement.  But I understood the Minister to say that this would apply to all persons irrespective of date of retirement if they were on a cost-of-living basis.  There is, I think, favourable consideration for local authority officials in comparison with civil servants so far as these people are concerned, but there would be a corresponding victimisation of the basic salary class.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator misunderstands the position.  This section is based upon the actual rights which servants of the local authorities enjoy. In the case of civil servants, when they retire their pensions are based upon their basic salary, plus the cost-of-living bonus, with an overriding maximum that, while their pensions can be reduced if the cost-of-living index figure falls, their total inclusive pensions will not be increased above the figure at which they retire.  That is part of the provisions of their code. On the other hand, in the case of local authorities that has never been enforced.  There is no such provision, and therefore we are not interfering with their rights in that regard.  We are not victimising any other class of local authority servant.  On the contrary, we are going out of our way to ensure that they will be treated equitably.  However, if the Senator thinks we are doing anything wrong, I can ask somebody to put down an amendment to restore Section 79 to the form in which it stood in the original Bill.  That might be a way out of the difficulty; perhaps it might be the best <Col N="1977" /> way if anybody thinks we are victimising anybody in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>I understood that it would go through without any amendment except Government amendments because people were anxious to get it on the Statute Book.  If they are not anxious to get it on the Statute Book, it will remain in abeyance so far as I am concerned.  I do not know whether Senator Duffy was confused about the situation or not.  There is nothing to compel the Dublin Corporation to accept this Bill.  If the officers and servants of the Dublin Corporation feel that they are better off under the old Act, they can ask the Dublin Corporation to continue the existing superannuation code and, therefore, they would have no grumble about any of the imperfections which Senator Duffy saw in this Bill.  He did not ask me to give it to them both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The power of adopting the Act is reserved for the Dublin Corporation and the employees have shown on previous occasions that they are sufficiently powerful to ensure that, if they do not want the Act, they will not have it, because the Act can only become applicable to the servants of the Dublin Corporation when the relevant resolution is passed by the corporation under Section 5.  I do not see what there is to grumble about. They are being left a free choice.</P>
      <P>The Bill is intended to apply to the country as a whole and not merely to the officers and servants of the Dublin Corporation.  It deals with municipalities everywhere.  It is a Bill which will have to be operated by small and poor local authorities like the Leitrim County Council and by small urban authorities like those of Athy and Naas.  We cannot give everybody everything that some officers and servants of the Dublin Corporation are fortunate enough to enjoy.  At least we cannot give it to them without due consideration to the interests of rural communities and the ratepayers of small communities.  As I have said, the Bill is of general application but no local authority is compelled to adopt it in respect of its servants. Certainly the Dublin Corporation is not, and if the servants of the corporation do not feel that it is giving them enough, let them move the members of the corporation not to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also complained about the size of the contribution which will be paid by workers.  That was a matter which was raised at length in the other House and I think I satisfied Deputies there that it was a fair and reasonable contribution.  So far as the workers were concerned, I did reduce the contribution from 5 per cent. to 4? per cent., making it, for the purposes of convenience, a halfpenny in the shilling. The Senator says that a halfpenny in the shilling is a heavy contribution. I suppose it is, if we consider only the contributor's side of it, but that is only one side of the account. He says that it is going to mean 2/6 <Col N="1979" /> from a man in receipt of £3.  The actuarial cost of the scheme, so far as the officers are concerned, will work out at 16 per cent. or even more.  So far as the authorities are concerned, the very generous provisions which are inserted in the scheme governing the question of pensionable service, the contributions will probably be a great deal more than 16 per cent.  It may even be four times or five times that.</P>
    <P>The scheme will mean that the benefits to be given to servants will require a contribution of 10/- per head in respect of each servant.  The servant who has a wage of £3 a week will pay 2/6 out of the 10/- and the local authority will pay over 7/6.  So that in benefits the servant of the local authority is going to get 10/- worth for every 2/6 he contributes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But the pension, if he gets it, will go on week after week. Look at the other side of the account. I have to look at both sides.  I would be just as anxious as the Senator to be generous to everybody were it not that I have to advert to the very hard fact that somebody has to pay for it all and that in general, when you are trying to give benefits to everybody, one narrow section has to pay in the end. There is no use in being very discursive on that because I think the Senator sees the point as well as I do, and I think the Seanad ought to come to the same decision as I have&mdash;that we have tried to be fair and just and that having arrived at a solution, which we think is fair and just, we ought to <Col N="1980" /> stand by it because there is no honour and no kudos to be gained in running away from it.</P>
      <P>The question of the right of option given to persons who have not reached the age of 60 has also been very severely criticised.  I wonder if those who are urging me to waive this condition altogether would try to put themselves in my position and see what they would do if they had to carry the responsibility for doing what they suggest. Let me remind the Seanad again that the demand of the officers and servants of local authorities has been to give them Civil Service pension terms. When the 1909 Pensions Act, which is the code which now governs Civil Service pensions was introduced, there was a similar proviso to this, with however this condition: that before a civil servant could opt for the terms of the 1909 Act he had to undergo a medical examination.  We are not asking that.  We give the option without the medical examination so that, in that regard, we are doing something better, for whatever it may be worth, than was done for civil servants under the 1909 Act.</P>
      <P>There is the other point that if I were to omit the conditions of (a) and (b) it would be open for any officer who had attained the age of 60 years to walk out to-morrow with his lump sum in his pocket, even if he were a completely insurable life.  I do not know what the members of local authorities would say if I put their senior officers in the position that if they wanted to go off and engage in some business, or if they felt it was time to go for some other reason, they could simply walk out with the lump sum in their pockets.  Then, of course, these members would say: &ldquo;It is that Minister for Local Government up in Dublin; he did it for the highly paid officers of the local authorities.  Is it any wonder that the cost of living and that rates are so high when we have a Minister in Dublin who will allow officers of local authorities to do that sort of thing.&rdquo;?  I do not propose to allow that position of affairs to occur. There will be hard cases undoubtedly under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to hear that Senator O'Reilly, who is so zealous in looking <Col N="1981" /> after the interests of the vocational officers, will be excluded by the terms of the Bill.  Let me amend any other sections of this Bill in the way it is desired and I will still be faced with hard cases.  We have to draw the line, and I think the line has been fairly drawn here in Section 37.  We give all officers of local authorities who do not attain the age of 60 years the right of option.  That is as much as is given to civil servants and we should not be asked to give more.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will not defer the enactment of this measure by putting down amendments which I cannot accept.  It is not a light matter to summon the Dáil at any time.  It is an expensive matter.  It is not an easy matter to summon the Dáil during the period of the Christmas holidays, and it is a much more inconvenient matter to summon the Dáil in the circumstances of the present time.  It is all very well for members of the Seanad, who can deal with these matters in a leisurely way, to suggest that we should summon the Dáil.  I ask the Seanad not to take up that attitude.  I am sure most Senators will have a reasonable understanding of the difficulties of the present situation and they will not do anything which would make it necessary to summon the Dáil without any very solid hope that there will be any change in the Bill.  I think this Bill ought to go through in the form in which it is and I ask the Seanad to do that.  It will for one thing give a considerable number of people a feeling of greater security over the holidays. They will be able to enjoy the holidays because they will know their increased pensions will be coming to them at the end of the year.  That will case a great many family and household problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing very much at stake.  Whether or not amendments are made in the Bill is another question, but the suggestion made yesterday was that we would adjourn the remaining stages of these Bills until after Christmas and the date mentioned was 7th January.  My view is that all these Bills can be disposed of on the 7th January.  If there are amendments, I urge the Minister to consider favourably calling the Dáil so as to put the amendments before it.  I do not want to keep butting in every five minutes, but it is really not reasonable to come to the Seanad with a spate of Bills at the end of a session. This happens year after year, not this year alone.  This particular Bill is one which had its First Reading in the Dáil on 1st May, 1947, seven months ago, so I do not think it is reasonable to say now to the Seanad that the Government are in a terrible hurry with the Bill and that they must have it.  I ask the Minister not to press that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that this Bill passed its Second Reading a considerable time ago and it is true that there has been delay, but that delay has arisen very largely by reason of the fact that we were receiving representations from people interested in various provisions and we were endeavouring to meet them.  It cannot be alleged, therefore, that we unreasonably delayed with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite prepared, if the Seanad will not give me all stages to-day, to have the Bill put back.  If Senators cannot give me all stages now, that is their own concern.  I have not pressed for all stages of the Housing Bill, although I think it would be urgent and desirable that we would get them. We have not pressed for all stages of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Bill or all stages of the Rates <Col N="1983" /> on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill.  But I am pressing for all stages of this Bill, if I can get them, for this reason, that if this Bill becomes law people who have been living on, so to speak, short commons for the past 12 months or so will get a substantial bounty on the 1st January.  Others who are in receipt of lower pensions than, perhaps, they normally might have received over the whole period from 1940 to 1946 will get increases in their pensions dating as from 1st November, 1946.  I am in the hands of the House in this matter.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was not in a position to discuss this matter with the Seanad last night or I would urge, as I am now urging, the considerations to which I have referred.  If the Bill cannot be taken, it cannot be taken, and then it is in grave danger it will not be passed until after the general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not seem to be any liaison between Ministers and the members of their own Party here. If these considerations were put up even yesterday they might have been considered, but nothing was put up in any conversation yesterday so far as I remember.  I do not know if there was anything put up to Senator Duffy either.  I do not want to delay either this Bill or the general election, but the real trouble in this House is that there is no leadership in the House and there seems to be no connection between Ministers, Government business and the people in the House who support the Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sweetman's statement put quite accurately what we agreed to yesterday, namely, that the items on the paper should be cleared to-day and the business in relation to this particular Bill was the consideration of the Second Stage.  The Minister suggests that it is important to have this Bill passed so that people can get paid.  He says that the Bill cannot and will not be amended, but that is another question. I do not want to stand between anybody and the payment he will receive.  The Minister indicates, whether merely casually or with any reality I cannot say, that the Dáil will not be called upon to meet and therefore the Bill will not become law until <Col N="1984" /> either a certain period of time elapses or the new Dáil passes a resolution. I do not understand that; I do not know about it and I could not, in the nature of things.</P>

In view of the urgency of this matter and the fact that the Minister cannot reasonably be expected to accept any amendment, the House should give all stages of this Bill to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse, in part at any rate, the statement made by Senator Hawkins.  What happened yesterday was that those of us who informally discussed the business of the House did say, &ldquo;Let us meet to-morrow&rdquo;&mdash;that is to-day&mdash;&ldquo;and dispose of the business ordered for the day's sitting.  We shall then see when we will meet again.&rdquo;  It was clearly a question of when we would meet again, indicating that there was agreement amongst us that we would not dispose of all stages of the several Bills ordered.  I would suggest to the Minister and to Senator Hawkins that if the Committee Stage of this Bill were taken now it could not be completed to-night, in my judgment.  Every section and every line in the Bill is open for discussion.  I have given an undertaking to people who interviewed me in regard to this Bill that I would put down certain amendments.  I am not tied to anything in relation to the amendments except to put them down. If the Minister can convince the House that the proposals which I desire to insert are unreasonable, he knows quite well that I am probably one of the easiest people in the House to induce to withdraw an amendment.  I do not boast of that.  I do not even apologise for it.  But I think it will be observed that in the last few days, where I had strong feelings about amendments, in view of representations made by the <Col N="1985" /> Minister, I withdrew amendments.  In relation to the Merchant Shipping Bill I withdrew an amendment when the Minister concerned put up a certain point of view.  I accepted that point of view.  I am prepared to be influenced very largely by the case put up in respect of an amendment.  I feel morally bound to point out that certain points of view will be debated on the Committee Stage.  I do not think the Minister will be inconvenienced very much by the postponement of the Committee Stage to, say, 7th January.  Any other date would suit me just as well. But I want the Minister to understand clearly that I am not putting up these proposals for the purpose of delaying the passage of the Bill.  I think he realises that fully.  I am as anxious as he is that if there are people who will derive advantages from this Bill, they should not be deprived of these advantages for one hour and in the long run I do not think they will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to acquire sites for Garda stations.  The position is that throughout the country there are many Garda stations that are quite unsuitable for the purpose and which are inconveniently located.  It will be necessary to get new barracks.  Every effort will be made to get them by <Col N="1986" /> agreement but if agreement cannot be reached this Bill proposes to give compulsory powers.  All sorts of things arise.  Sometimes there are delays about establishing title.  The main thing is to give to the Commissioners of Public Works, where they cannot get agreement, compulsory powers and if the owner is not satisfied with the price or the terms offered the matter can be referred to arbitration.  The arbitrator will be a person appointed by the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the President of the Surveyors' Institute.  I understand that is the way an arbitrator is appointed in the case of local authorities acquiring sites in the same manner.</P>
      <P>Another thing that is hampering the administration of the Garda Síochána is the fact that when a married guard is transferred, the landlord of the house in which he has been living is very often unwilling to let the house; he wants to sell it; and the result is that Guards are being kept longer in these houses than would otherwise be the case.  There is nothing in this Bill interfering with any rights the landlord possesses under the Rent Restrictions Act.  Of course, the landlord, while the Guard is in the house cannot get possession, any more than he could get it from any other citizen. What happens very often is that where a Guard is transferred, the owner of the house in which he has been living is not prepared to let the house to another Guard, with the result that Guards are kept longer in the same place than the Commissioner would wish them to remain.</P>
      <P>The only remedy for that is to acquire sites to build houses&mdash;not to take possession of a house that a Guard is occupying.  That provision applies only in the case of barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the Bill&mdash;not a house that a Guard is occupying.  It is only sites for houses.  The provision applies to premises for Garda stations, not to houses that Guards are occupying. There is a very big difference. There is a very immediate problem as far as that is concerned.  There is one particular case in Bundoran.  The <Col N="1987" /> lease is running out and there is no possibility of getting a Garda station in that particular place unless we are able to retain possession of the present premises.  I think Senators will agree that it would be most undesirable in a place like Bundoran, which is a big holiday centre, if there were not a Garda barracks.  It would be an impossible situation.  In this case the Bill authorises the Commissioner to retain possession of stations after the lease has run out.  It is hoped that the landlords and the Commissioner will be able to agree but, if not, there is provision made, on the same lines as local authorities have, for arbitration.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to an article that appeared in one of the daily papers on this matter.  The writer apparently was under the impression that we intend to take houses occupied by Guards.  He must not have read the Bill rightly if he thinks that because that is not the intention.  I am pointing out that, for a number of years past, the Commissioner has been most anxious to make certain changes.  That may be due to some reason or another. He simply cannot do it.  Until we build new houses, no progress can be made. For the last four years, at least, when my Estimate is in the Dáil I am pressed on every side to get houses built as quickly as possible for Guards, apart altogether from the convenience of the Commissioner in administering the affairs of the Garda Síochána, for the convenience of the members of the Garda Síochána.  Very definite steps are now being taken.  Everything is ready to proceed with building houses, now that materials have become available, and it is most desirable that we should not be held up for want of a site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out again that there is nothing unusual in this.  The same principle applies in the case of the acquisition of sites for local authorities' housing, and there is, of course, the Rent Restrictions Act, which certainly does impose hardships on owners of houses.  We are not interfering with that.  I would stress that.  As far as <Col N="1988" /> the owners of houses which are occupied by Guards are concerned, as long as the Guard stays there, as everyone knows, the Guard as an ordinary tenant has his rights under the Rent Restrictions Act.  But, if he leaves, the landlord need not let it to the incoming Guard.  He very often wants to sell it. I just want to clear up that point.  I think the arbitrator ought to be a fair person.  He is not, as was suggested in another article that I saw, I think, in the <i>Leader,</i> a bureaucrat.  He is not a civil servant.  He is a person appointed by two judges and the President of the Surveyors' Institute.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and insert instead the words:&mdash;&ldquo;the Seanad declines to give a Second Reading to the Garda Síochána (Acquisition of Sites and Retention of Premises) Bill, 1947, until the two Houses of the Oireachtas re-assemble after the forthcoming general election.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I put down the amendment is that it seemed to me that this Bill contained a new principle.  Whether it is a new principle or not, I am still of the opinion, in spite of what the Minister says, that it is an extremely bad principle.  He says it is to be found in other Acts.  I do not think he is right about the Rent Restrictions Act.  I am not sure about certain Local Government Acts but the principle is to be found in Section 2. In Section 2 there are compulsory powers to seize land.  If I understood the Minister correctly, the intention is to seize land either for the building of barracks or of other accommodation for Guards.  Now, I have no objection <Col N="1989" /> on principle to the right to seize land if it cannot otherwise be obtained for stated purposes.  I certainly have no objection to it for the purpose of maintaining an adequate service for the Guards.</P>
    <P>The new principle in this Bill is that there is no statutory provision for the payment of compensation.  There is a provision that the Commissioners of the Board of Works may make an order, and that order may include any of the provisions of the Acquisition of Land Act.  The Bill does not say that they &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It says that they &ldquo;may&rdquo; include such modifications as the commissioners think proper of any of the provisions of the Acquisition of Land Act and of the Lands Clauses Act.  That gives the commissioners, in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land, power to decide in their order what will be the basis of any compensation that may be paid.  As far as I can read the sub-section the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; cannot possibly be held to be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, because the sub-section says &ldquo;may incorporate&rdquo; any of the provisions of the two Acts set out.  You would not say &ldquo;shall&rdquo; incorporate.  The sub-section says may incorporate and &ldquo;with such modifications as the commissioners think proper&rdquo;.  Therefore, I hold that in their order the commissioners will have complete power, without reference to Parliament, to decide what compensation there is to be.  I have no doubt it is intended that compensation should be paid, but this seems to me to be a vicious and a wrong principle.  I am astounded when the Minister assures me that it is not a new principle to give such power to the Commissioners of Public Works&mdash;the power to make an order acquiring land, and the power to state in their order how much, if any, of the provisions of the Acquisition of Land Act and of the Lands Clauses Acts will be included in that order.  I think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>The reason why I put down this motion was because I believed that to be an extremely wrong principle, and one to which the attention of the public and of this House should be drawn.  I have not anything like the same objection to the other sections of the Bill, though in regard to Section 5, I am not <Col N="1990" /> quite sure that even there the Minister is not going a bit too far.  It may be necessary, for a short time, to prolong a letting, but it seems to me that the individual who lets a house for a fixed term of years should, as against the State, be in practically the same position as he would be under the Rent Restrictions Act.</P>
    <P>I have not got that Act at my finger-ends, but I believe that, where a man requires a house for a member of his own family and satisfies the court on that point, he can get possession under the Rent Restrictions Act. He certainly can get possession before it is handed over to another tenant.  I could see a case where, in abnormal circumstances a house is occupied by a Guard, the owner would have to wait a year before he could get it for his family, but the provision in this Bill is that the house can be held as against the owner under a yearly tenancy until such time as the commissioners see fit to end it.  The owner has no redress in that case.  I think that is going too far.  I do not say there is any new principle involved in that because there is the element of compensation, and if there is not compensation there is arbitration as to what the rent should be.</P>
    <P>I have heard of some cases where men wanted houses for the use of their own families.  They may want them for some legitimate purpose, but under this Bill they cannot get possession. They must let them to the commissioners, and the tenancy will not be terminated until such time as the comsioners give three months' notice.  I think that is going too far.  I would be prepared to recognise special circumstances. If the position is so bad that the State cannot get accommodation for Guards then it should requisition property and pay an agreed figure for it.  To leave a man without compensation, or without the use of a house which he requires for himself and his family is, I think, exercising the powers of the State as against the individual to an extent which, I think, is unjustified.</P>
    <P>I know that some wild statements have been made about this Bill.  I am not speaking on behalf of anybody. <Col N="1991" /> Before I read anything about the Bill I was of opinion that Section 2 conferred powers on the commissioners that are altogether too wide.  I realised later, from a letter that was sent to a friend of mine, that there are other parts of the Bill that also go too far.  We must be extremely careful to see that, as between the State and the individual, there is scrupulous, fair play.  I do not like the idea that the State can come in, when a present tenancy is up, and continue it as a yearly tenancy.</P>

      <P>I think that a period of five years would be far too long in the circumstances that I have mentioned. If a man is pernickety and is trying to take advantage of the State by getting an abnormal rent, I would have no objection in such a case to the rent being fixed by a tribunal, but if, on the other hand, he is doing what he is entitled to do under the Rent Restrictions Act and wants the house for his family and can satisfy a court on that point, then I think he should be entitled to get the house within a reasonable time.  If the State says &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that, it should buy the house from him so that he will have his money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to understand the phraseology of this Bill.  I endorse very strongly the objection made to it by Senator Douglas and especially to the principle incorporated in sub-section (3) of Section 2.  If a local authority decides to acquire land compulsorily for housing or any other purpose it has to follow the procedure which is laid down in the two Acts referred to in sub-section (3). Under that procedure, the person whose land is being acquired has the right to make certain representations to the inspector holding the inquiry on behalf of the Minister.  If I have read this Bill correctly, a person whose land is being acquired will have no right whatever to plead that his land should not be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill, the commissioners <Col N="1992" /> can make an order stating: &ldquo;We want to take your field.  We are going to apply the provisions of the 1919 Act in respect of compensation to that field, but we are not going to apply it at all in respect of the provisions by virtue of which you would have a chance of making your case before an inquiry as to whether that field should or should not be taken.&rdquo;  That can, and, I have no doubt whatever, will happen under this Bill, because we all know that when a little power is given, more power than is perhaps necessary, it is always the extended power which is used.  I say that that can and will happen, but I say further that under the Bill the commissioners could make an order saying: &ldquo;We are going to take that field and we are not going to give you a penny piece of compensation for it, because we are not going to apply any of the provisions of the 1919 Act, except the provision by which, when we make an order, <i>ipso facto</i> from that date, we take over possession.&rdquo;  I am not trying to make political capital out of it.  I think the Minister will admit that it is very bad indeed to vest that power in the Commissioners of Public Works.  That is the situation with regard to land as a site for a Garda barracks or as a house for a member of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister, of course, that it is and must be entirely desirable for the public good that there should be a provision by virtue of which sites for barracks and houses for the Garda can be acquired.  We are all agreed on that, but I want some chance of the individual getting an opportunity to point out at an inquiry that the acquisition of site A will inflict tremendous hardship on him and that site B, the acquisition of which would inflict no hardship on anybody, is available.  That provision is not in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said already, there is an additional power, a power which should never be given, in the words included in lines 38 and 39 to acquire land without compensation.  That is the effect of the words &ldquo;with such modifications as the commissioners may think proper&rdquo;. I am not charging the Minister with intending to do that, but, whether he intends to do it or not, the power is <Col N="1993" /> there and it is a power which should never be given.</P>
    <P>I come now to Section 3.  I do not understand to what premises Section 3 is intended to refer.  In section 2, the premises referred to are a Garda Síochána station or a house for a member of the Garda Síochána, but in Section 3 we have a new definition&mdash; premises to be used for the accommodation of members of the Garda Síochána. Is that intended to be a Garda station? If so, why is the same wording not used as is used in Section 2?  Is it intended to refer to houses for members of the Garda?  If so, why is the same wording not used?  As I understand the situation, the only purpose for which a house could be wanted for the Garda is either as a Garda station or for the members of the force.  If that is so, why is different wording used in Sections 2 and 3?  It does not appear to make the matter as clear as possible and I should like the matter to be made clear before we come to discuss Section 3 on another occasion.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision at the end of paragraph (b) sub-section (2) of Section 3 which has perhaps been overlooked. It not merely takes the position as it is to-day, but the position as it was back as far as 1st October, 1946. As I read the Bill, if a notice has been given, a valid notice in the then existing state of the law, by which premises were to be given up prior to to-day, as a result of this Bill, that notice is thrown on one side and is no longer valid and any arrangement the owner may have made arising out of that notice is completely and absolutely upset.  I suggest that is not fair and that where a person complied with the law as it existed and made certain arrangements on the basis of his conception, his correct conception, of the law at the time, the law should not be altered to upset his plans in that way.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that the point made by Senator Douglas in one respect is unanswerable, namely, that if premises have to be kept on by the commissioners in pursuance of the provisions in Section 3, to whatever premises they refer&mdash;and I do not know yet&mdash;the person who owns the house should be given the option of saying: &ldquo;Very good: you are going to <Col N="1994" /> keep on my house.  We will have the rent fixed, if we cannot agree, by the referee,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I ask the State to purchase the house so that with the value of the premises I can obtain alternative accommodation and utilise it for the purposes for which I would have used these premises if they had been given to me.&rdquo;  There should be an alternative and it should be at the option of the individual rather than of the State.</P>
    <P>It appears to me, therefore, that these points raise principles of such importance that it would be highly undesirable that the Bill should be considered in the atmosphere we are in at the moment and highly undesirable that the Bill should be rushed through before the dissolution of the Oireachtas.  As between now and next March, or whenever a Bill could be put through, there is nothing to be gained with regard to the building of additional stations and nothing to be gained in regard to the acquisition of sites for houses for the Gárda and everything to be lost by the Bill going through in present circumstances and with the difficulties which I see in it and which must be apparent to anybody who closely construes its provisions.</P>

      <P>Senator Sweetman said it was very difficult to distinguish between the premises mentioned in Section 2 and those mentioned in Section 3.  The Bill is very clear in that respect.  Section 2 deals with the acquisition of a site for a Garda Síochána station or for a house for a member of the Garda Síochána.  Sub-section (1) of Section 2 clearly refers to a Garda station or to a house for a member of the Garda Síochána.  Then we come to Section 3 which applies to accommodation used by members of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>No, it must be a house held for the accommodation of the Gardaí and the tenancy must be with the commissioners.  It does not apply to any house which a Garda may hold in his own name.  Senator Sweetman is uneasy and says that land can be acquired without compensation.  He is also perturbed because the owner will get no excuse for objecting to the acquisition.  I am sure he is thinking of the Labourers Acts, where in former days an inquiry had to be held as to whether the land should be acquired or not and the owner was entitled to say why it should not be acquired. Very few reasons were given why it should not be acquired.  What purpose did that serve?  When was the owner entitled to say: &ldquo;You are not to acquire that land.&rdquo;  It was a perfectly useless protection and had no meaning. The only advantage it had was that compensation was generally fixed about the same time as the inquiry. Senator Sweetman further says there need be no compensation given at all. If you go into the powers given for compulsory acquisition, it will be found that under the Act of 1919, and the Land Clauses Act which was incorporated in it, the person acquiring <Col N="1996" /> could not go into possession until he had lodged compensation in the Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <P>There is no good in arguing, as it seems absurd to make these small points, suggesting that the commissioners or the Minister would not compensate for the property, for some very wrong or dishonest reason. I do not think that should be suggested, or that there is any power to acquire in that way under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have sympathy with the Minister in his desire to acquire suitable premises or sites.  I do not think Senator Douglas or Senator Sweetman has accused either the Minister or the commissioners of the desire to get something for nothing, but there is a great gulf between that and getting something on terms which the commissioners may think proper and the owner may not.  If I wished to acquire Senator O'Dea's case which he has in front of him, for what I regarded as suitable compensation and he did not, he would have a distinct grievance if I were the person to fix the compensation.  That is what is here.</P>
      <P>I have received several letters from people who have Gardaí in occupation of their houses and who believe that this Bill will fasten the Gardaí in their occupation, so that the Gardaí cannot be put out.  That clearly is not so. This Bill does not apply to a tenancy held by a Guard as an ordinary citizen. The Minister made that clear and it should be emphasised for the benefit of those who are worried about it.  A Guard who has an ordinary tenancy is protected by the Rent Restrictions Act, but not further or otherwise.</P>

      <P>Therefore, on this point the non-practising legal person scores over the practising legal person.  At any rate, I can hand a bouquet to the Minister.  Land may be acquired by the commissioners for a site for a station or for a house, under Section 2. Then in Section 3 what appears to be a station is called &ldquo;premises for the accommodation of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo; Why, as Senator Sweetman asked, is it &ldquo;station&rdquo; in one and &ldquo;premises&rdquo; in the other, when in Section 3 we are to assume that it is &ldquo;station&rdquo;?  It is clear that it is not a house occupied by a Garda that is meant, because it is the commissioners who hold the premises or the Minister who holds the premises, and that excludes a house occupied by a Garda as an ordinary tenant.</P>
      <P>What is, to my mind, the objectionable thing in this Bill is that under Section 2 the commissioners may acquire the land and having acquired the land, they are themselves the people who are solely permitted to make the arrangements under which the person from whom the land has been acquired may get compensation. If I am wrong in regard to this I will be delighted, but can we say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me come to the Act of 1919.  Let us, for the sake of argument, assume that Section 5 is satisfactory. Let us suppose that the provisions of Section 5 dealing with the acquisition of premises are satisfactory in so far as they provide for an appeal to an arbitrator of a non-Government source.  Why does not that apply to the acquisition of sites of houses?  For in spite of Senator O'Dea's argument it does not apply.  I know that the Commissioners of Public Works are honest people and I am not accusing them of any turpitude, if that is the word.  According to Section 2, sub-section (3):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An Order under this section may incorporate, with such modifications <Col N="1999" /> as the commissioners think proper any of the provisions of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the Land Clauses Act so far as they are not inconsistent with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean that the 1919 Act must apply?  If so, why not say so?  I have heard a good deal of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; has been going on steadily since I took the Chair in the Dáil in 1922.  It has gone round about and inside out and upside down and I do not understand at all how the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; comes into the context &ldquo;an Order under this section may incorporate with such modifications as the commissioners think proper any of the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.&rdquo;  From that I take it that they need not incorporate any of the provisions of the 1919 Act unless the English language is being used in a very extraordinary manner.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works can do what they like in fixing the method by which a person deprived of his land shall get compensation.  It is quite different in Section 5 where it is stated that any person may appeal to a referee.  If the provisions of Section 2, sub-section (3) were made as clear as the provisions of Section 5, then I think there would be very little talk about the matter at all.  Why does it not state that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Dea seems to assume that I do not understand this thing at all but I am not so bad as he thinks.  It ought to be the same people but it need not be the same people.  According to sub-section (3) of Section 2 it is not mandatory on the Commissioners of Public Works at all to apply the Act of 1919.  If there is any doubt on the matter, the Minister <Col N="2000" /> could easily get a wording to put sub-section (3) of Section 2 on all fours with Section 5 and settle the matter for once and for all.</P>
      <P>All this business of acquiring powers for Government Departments proceeds piecemeal.  It proceeds slowly and bit by bit.  What we are asked to do here is to trust that the commissioners will always behave in a perfectly fair manner.  Perhaps they will and perhaps they will not.  It seems, therefore, to me, Sir, if the acquisition of sites were clearly placed on the same footing as the retention of premises from the point of view of arbitration, it would settle one particular flaw in the Bill.</P>
      <P>One particular point which Senator Douglas made was not dealt with at all.  If a man has a premises occupied by Guards, he cannot terminate the tenancy of the premises for a period of five years.  Why should Senator O'Dea, if he owns a premises occupied by a Guard, while I own a premises occupied by somebody else, be in a worse position than I am in, simply because of the accident that he has taken in Guards while my premises is occupied by Patrick Murphy and Son and Company, Limited?  As Senator O'Dea's premises is occupied by a Guard he has not the same right to dispose of his property as I have.</P>
      <P>I recognise the necessity to have accommodation for Guards but if you are going to accommodate Guards you are dealing with the State and the State should not be in a better position than anybody else.  The owner should have the option of selling the premises under a proper system of arbitration.</P>

    <P>The object of the Bill is to house Guards and I have the greatest sympathy&mdash;we all have the greatest sympathy with that, whether it is from the point of view of stations or the point of view of the accommodation of individual Guards and the families who are in a peculiar position because they are moved around.  I have personal knowledge of this, not only from the point of view of Guards, but of officers of the Guards as well.  The provisions of sub-section (3) Section 2 make it appear that there need be no compensation at all in regard to sites acquired if the section were pushed to extreme limits. <Col N="2001" /> The fact that it does not apply to the premises of individual Guards should be made clear as it would allay a considerable amount of anxiety among owners of houses.</P>

      <P>The point which I originally intended to raise has been covered to some extent, but with regard to the notice in writing in relation to the termination of tenancies I do not know whether the Minister is satisfied that the owner of a house could give notice to the commissioners in accordance with the agreement and that having given that notice about the house it can go back to the owner. Is the Minister satisfied that the commissioners could not claim the benefits of the Rent Restrictions Act?</P>

      <P>There are millions of agreements in existence according to which tenancies may be terminated by either side.  In actual fact the tenancy can be terminated by the occupiers, not by the owners.  I want no ambiguity about this matter. I would like to know whether it is the policy in future to provide living accommodation for Guards rather than the accommodation provided in the ordinary barracks.  I know of a case which occurred thousands of miles away where a certain Guard wanted accommodation for greyhounds.  As a result of that desire a certain very important local body was put to untold trouble for almost ten years and that trouble is still existing because of that desire.  If this compulsory power is given I am wondering if the attitude of the Gardaí and the commissioners of public works will be still more autocratic. I think the Minister knows the case to which I refer.  I mentioned it to him one time but I do not want to say anything now which might give a clue to show where it occurred.</P>
      <P>I take it the Minister's policy would be to provide living accommodation for Guards in future and that these buildings which should be State buildings will not be associated with domestic matters in future.  I take it the Minister is satisfied that the owner of a premises, if he wishes to terminate the tenancy, can do so under this agreement and that the Rent Restrictions Act will not qualify this in any way.  What about the termination of the tenancies in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 4?</P>

      <P>I am aware, with regard to the acquisition of sites, that the value put on sites by owners when local authorities or anyone else of that kind are looking for sites is very much higher than the real value.  I myself spent a considerable time trying to get landowners in County Longford to see reason in that regard.  As those of us who are members of public bodies are aware, there is provision for compulsory acquisition and for an arbitrator to fix the price.  I am not going to enter into the lawyers' realm but if the Bill provides for compulsory acquisition and if there is provision for the fixing of compensation by an impartial person I am satisfied.</P>

      <P>That the same rates apply to the acquisition of lands as to premises.  The commissioners are a <Col N="2004" /> public body and public servants.  If they do anything of that kind they can be very soon made answerable and we shall all hear about it.  Surely the provision of premises for a Garda Síochána station is as essential, and even more so, than the provision of private houses.  We all know what would happen if we had no Garda Síochána stations.  I am satisfied, on the assurance of the draftsman, that the provisions for compensation apply equally to land and premises.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised about the 1st October, 1946, it is merely for the purpose of seeing that it continues under the Supplies and Services Order.</P>
      <P>With regard to the right of an owner to sell premises I would say that, where a person has tenants, unless he can get them out by legal means we know how difficult it is to sell the house.  We all know that it is difficult, but that is how it is.  It is the same in regard to owners of Garda stations. The reason why the commissioners will not buy them is that very often the stations are not suitable and the intention is to substitute proper stations for these places as soon as the commissioners can do so.  It is very seldom that the old stations they occupy suit them.  I still say that there is no new principle in this.  I think the whole trouble was that it was taken for granted that this Bill applied to actual dwelling-houses.  That was not made clear in the beginning.  It went through the Dáil rather quickly and it was not brought out.  I am satisfied that the members of the Opposition in the Dáil looked through the measure to make sure that it was on all-fours with other Acts of a similar nature.  Otherwise, with all due respect to the vigilance of the members of the Seanad, it would not have gone through so quickly.  We have plenty of very keen watch-dogs in the other House, too.  We were in a hurry at the time because we all wanted to get down to trying to get back again.  Nevertheless, the members of the Dáil did look into it or they would not have let it through.</P>

As a matter of fact, all sides of the House had been pressing me to provide accommodation for the Guards. Now, the Commissioner says his position is becoming difficult because he wants to change some Gardaí.  He cannot do so unless he has a house to give to an incoming Guard.  It was moved that this House should not pass this Bill.  I suggest that we will be unduly held up if we do not do so.  We are in a hurry to get this measure through.  I do not want to face the Dáil and I do not want whoever may come after me to have to say that we are still considering this matter.

While that remains in its present form I am strongly opposed to it, and I think an effort should be made in Committee to make some amendment.  If the Minister says it need not be there and is not required the reply can be made that it is the same as what has happened in the acquisition of land over a great many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides essentially for the amalgamation of districts <Col N="2007" /> and the function of amalgamating districts is entirely one belonging to the Minister.  I take it that the local authority does not come into this at all.  The Minister is taking power here to amalgamate districts for the purpose of enlarging them; it is not merely for the purpose of redistributing the area to make the coroner's work more convenient.  I think it is important that the House should be told what exactly is the Minister's intention.  Originally in County Galway there were three coroners.  Is it the intention that there should be only one coroner in the future?  Cork City and County had three coroners at one time&mdash;I think they still have three.  Is it the intention that there should be only one coroner in Cork in future? Under previous Acts some amalgamation has already taken place.  The two districts into which Dublin County was divided were amalgamated and we now have one coroner for the entire county.  I am informed that such amalgamation can easily lead to abuse. I understand the salary of a coroner is not a very excessive one and, if we are going to save merely a few hundred pounds under this Bill, that can hardly justify inadequate performance of the work.  I do not know whether the proposal is wise or unwise.  Would the Minister tell us what is the intention under Section 3 of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really no change there, except the transfer of authority from the Minister for Local Government to the Minister for Justice. Now, the council or the Minister may require to amalgamate an area.  Generally the reason for that is that because the area is too small it is not worth while from the point of view of salary.  There is no fundamental change except the transfer from one Minister to another.</P>

      <P>Under Section 3 the local authority has power to amalgamate districts. I have in mind a particular district. <Col N="2008" /> I remember years ago there was a coroner for West Galway and the area over which he acted was quite a small one, but meantime West Galway as a whole is a very big area.  There may not be very many suicides or murders in that area.  Senator O'Dea looks after it very thoroughly and the people there lead very normal lives.  Is it to be understood that the Minister may of his own volition, irrespective of the views of the local authority, amalgamate the districts of that county into one so that a coroner might find himself responsible for an area running almost from Athlone to Clifden?  Although the population is sparsely distributed and although the number of inquests may not be great, there is still a vast area to be covered.  If it should happen that two inquests had to be held at the same time we can easily see the disadvantage in an area as big as County Galway.  I would be content if the Minister would give us an assurance that in this process of amalgamation he will be guided by the local authority.</P>

I would, therefore, ask the Minister, having regard to the changes that have taken place in the <Col N="2009" /> value of money since these salaries were originally fixed, to exercise his functions under this Bill to make the salaries reasonably adequate.</P>

He seems to take exception to the fact that in the Bill I am proposing to make it impossible to work any hatchery or incubator without a licence.  He objects to the method that I propose to follow by making a regulation excluding from the general scope of the Bill a certain type of hatchery.  The distinction between the amendments which he is asking me to accept and what is in the Bill is so fine <Col N="2010" /> that I can barely see it.  I think my method is the best from my point of view and I cannot, therefore, accept either of these two amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, Section 10, sub-section (2), line 7, after the word &ldquo;intention&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;together with his reasons therefor&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is my last attempt to get some very slight element of justice into this power to revoke licences.  I am sorry to say that we failed in this House to relate the revocation of a licence to a conviction.  In trying to do so, we stood on good ground.  We had a good precedent in the Milk Prices Act whereby the board, in effect, must have a conviction before it can revoke a dairy licence.  There are certain formal cases such as bankruptcy, debt and so on, but the only substantial ground for revoking a licence which is likely to cause hardship, has to be supported by a conviction.  I tried to embody the provisions for a conviction in the amendment, but it would be too complicated and I failed to do so.  It is only reasonable that the Minister should give his reasons if he is going to revoke a licence, which practically means ruin to a man.  He has not to produce evidence.  He is not bound to hear counsel on behalf of the party.  I know he does hear representations, but he only announces his bald intention. He does not say: &ldquo;I am going to revoke your licence because you have done this and that.  I told you about it on two occasions and you refused to obey.&rdquo;  There is nothing of that kind.  There is simply the bald statement: &ldquo;You are to have your licence revoked.&rdquo;  The object of the amendment is that, accompanying the Minister's intention, should be his reasons for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the point made by the Senator and I would be inclined to say that, in most cases, in the ordinary way I would give the <Col N="2011" /> reasons on which I had based my decision.  But I would not like to accept the amendment for this reason.  I admit that in saying this I am perhaps putting into the hands of the Senator a weapon which he can use against me in argument.  There may be just one case in a hundred in which it might not be easy to give the reasons on paper. If I were asked to cite the type of case I have in mind, I confess that I would find some difficulty in citing it.  I have a notion, however, that there are some such cases.  While I do not want to appear to be headstrong, I think it is not a wise policy to accept amendments, not because you believe in them, but because you want to give the impression that you are meeting those who move them.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary course of the discussions which will take place between the owner of a hatchery and the officials of the department, there is bound to result from the conversations evidence as to the reasons why the Minister will take action.  It is much easier to convey these reasons in that fashion than to proceed to set them down on paper. It is because I fear that occasions would arise in which it would be desirable to revoke licences while at the same time it might be desperately awkward to state the reasons on paper, that I feel obliged to resist the amendment in this case also.  It will be the practice in the ordinary way to make the possessor of the licence in most cases conversant with the reasons.  It will be possible to state these reasons in writing but I do not want to be obliged to do that because, as I say, cases will arise in which that will not be possible.  You are only limiting in an unreasonable degree, by an amendment of this kind, the freedom that a Minister and his Department should have in handling a very complicated problem of this nature.</P>

      <P>All I can say is that it is not freedom the Minister is concerned about but absolute, complete power.  Here he admits that only one case might arise in a hundred where he could fail to give his reasons.  He allows that to tip the scale against <Col N="2012" /> elementary justice.  I am very disappointed at the Minister's outlook and the Minister's lack of a sense of proportion with regard to the administration of pure, elementary justice.  I can only leave it there.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Agreed to take the Fifth Stage now.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>One word, if I may, on the Final Stage.  The House may feel that I have been very persistent with regard to this Bill.  I feel, especially in these times, a strong obligation to watch these encroachments of Government power.  The tendency nowadays is increasingly to take power away from the people and give it to the Executive.  I used the word &ldquo;totalitarian.&rdquo;  I am going to use it again and I am going to explain the sense in which I mean it because I am not using it loosely, with a sort of East European application.  In a free country the functions of political power are divided into three sections&mdash;legislative, executive, and judicial.  They are by old-established custom, each to provide for the protection of the citizen.</P>

      <P>We have by Order largely abrogated this power of control of the people over legislation.  We know how slender is the control which can be exercised by Parliament nowadays.  Its power has been largely whittled away. I leave the section of the Executive; that is the proper function of Government. What about the judiciary? The functions of the judiciary to hear a citizen and to give a fair trial on evidence are gone now too. Here we have the Ministry in this Bill empowered to give far greater punishment than would probably be imposed by the courts.  That is why I used the word &ldquo;totalitarian&rdquo;.  I used it for <Col N="2013" /> good reasons stated.  I must say that I am very disappointed at the opening appearances of the Minister in this House.  He has shown, no doubt, a commendable zeal but I am afraid he has shown a desire to have his way and to push his schemes through irrespective of the people he is there to serve.  I do think that it is an unhappy omen for the future of agriculture that the Minister is so lacking <Col N="2014" /> in conciliation in his first legislative measures.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Ordered: That the Bill be returned to the Dáil without amendment.</P>
