    <Title>Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the customary annual Bill which, in the first place, provides that the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts shall continue in force for another year.  This year, in addition, the Bill contains a number of provisions regarding the Naval Service. As Senators are no doubt aware, a Marine Service was established during the recent emergency and, as a result of the experience gained during the emergency, it has been decided to maintain the service permanently as a component of the Defence Forces and to rename it the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>The terminology of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts is, naturally, military, and now that a permanent Naval Service is being maintained, it is desirable, for administrative and other reasons, to adapt this military terminology to naval usage.  That is mainly what is being done in the present Bill.  The two longest sections &mdash; Section 3 and Section 5&mdash;repeat the provisions of Sections 17 and 18 of the No. 2 Act of 1940, the only change, in so far as the Naval Service is concerned, being the substitution of the word &ldquo;naval&rdquo; for &ldquo;marine&rdquo; wherever it occurred in Sections 17 and 18.  Section 8 of the Bill adapts a number of expressions of a military nature which occur throughout the Defence Forces Acts, and Section 9 provides that references in existing legislation to military Defence Forces shall be construed as including references to the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>At reference No. 5 of the table to Section 3, provision is made for a new rank of lieutenant-colonel, and Section 4 provides that existing majors shall, when this Bill becomes law, be lieutenant-colonels.  This matter was the only one which gave rise to particular discussion in the Dáil and, for that reason, I think it well to refer to it specially here.</P>

      <Col N="801" /> The remaining sections are self-explanatory and call for no particular comment from me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Bill by virtue of which the Army is retained in the coming year.  If it is to be retained as a satisfactory Army, it is essential that its personnel be satisfied and happy and not feel that they are labouring under any injustice.  It follows, too, that not only must the present personnel be satisfied and happy but they must be satisfied and happy in regard to the precedent created by the way in which their former comrades have been treated.  I want to refer to two net issues on this Bill, as I think that as long as the men who have left the Army recently have a grievance, it will not be possible for the present personnel to be as happy and as satisfied as they should be and as every member of this House would wish them to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early in 1945, the Government decided on demobilisation and issued a White Paper showing what was in their mind and showing their intentions. The White Paper indicated, amongst other things, that the Government proposed to dispense with the services of those who had been in the Army for a sufficiently long period to qualify for full pension rights.  That was indicated quite clearly in the White Paper.  Following its issue, an order was given &mdash; whether by the Department or by the Chief of Staff I am not in a position to say, and I do not think it makes very much difference&mdash;to commanding officers to explain the White Paper to the men under their command and in that explanation to advise men to whom this demobilisation referred to get out of the Army as soon as possible.  They were instructed to advise them to seek civilian employment as soon as it was possible so to do.  Presumably, those commanding officers were so instructed for two reasons &mdash; first of all, so that the men concerned might be set up in civilian employment, and, secondly, so that, once the need for their retention had passed, the State could avoid the burden of paying them and keeping them in the Army itself.  Without any question, that was a very wise, a very prudent <Col N="802" /> and a very proper instruction to give to commanding officers.  It was carried out, and the Government, of course, were fully aware that it was so carried out.  Demobilisation was quite deliberately arranged in various stages so as to ensure that, in its impact on ordinary civilian life, there would be the least harm done and it would be dealt with in a gradual way.  Again, that was an entirely proper thing to do.</P>
    <P>Then suddenly came an entirely new decision.  The men with the initiative, with the ability, with the drive and foresight, with the desire not to be a burden on the State any longer than was necessary, had left the Army in pursuance of the instructions and orders given to them and had got civilian employment; but the people who were left there to the very end, who had not taken the advice given to them by the Government through their commanding officers, were the people who came in and, because of the Government decision, got the increased pensions.  The Government decided that only the people who were in the Army after the 1st September, 1946, would get pensions at the increased rates.  I suggest that that was a gross injustice, after the Government had advised people, in the national interest &mdash; and very properly so &mdash; to get into civilian employment as soon as possible. Any person who left the Army as a result of those instructions, who resigned before he was bound to do so, should be treated just as well as the people who stayed on until the last moment and did not heed the instructions given.</P>
    <P>In consequence of this, there have been very grave injustices indeed in the pensions which have been granted. I suggest it would be only fair play for the Government, even at this late hour, to decide that in regard to the increased rates of pension there should be a retrospective clause, so that those pensions would be payable in respect of anybody who resigned after the date of the White Paper.  Those who did what they were told, what they were asked to do, should not be penalised for having carried out the instructions. I do not propose to weary the House with exact details as to the amounts involved, but it may be taken very <Col N="803" /> roughly that at least a 25 per cent. loss is being suffered by those men by reason of their having carried out the instructions and orders given to them.</P>
    <P>It would have been better if the increased pensions had been announced at the same time as the White Paper but, perhaps, it would have been impossible to correlate the two.  However, since it has been done in that way, I appeal to the Minister and the Government to remedy this injustice, to ensure that those men who went out readily to do what they were asked to do, to seek employment in civilian life, may not be penalised, for that is the way they are being penalised.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter which appears to have caused some very considerable confusion and dissatisfaction. There appears to be great difficulty in understanding the way in which the boards for disability pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts operate.  Time and time again, members of both Houses of the Oireachtas have brought to their notice cases in which men have been discharged from the Army as being physically unfit and when they are heard before the board it is found that their disability does not arise from Army service during the emergency.  I fully appreciate the medical difficulties; I fully appreciate that for a board to arrive at a decision in respect of illness is entirely different from the problem that is before that board if it is to consider the disability arising from wounds; but I would suggest that the approach is wrong.</P>
    <P>We understand that during 1940 a great many people were taken into the Army very quickly and, therefore, perhaps they did not get the severe medical examination which would have been possible if their entrance to the Army were not coincident with the high pressure of Army work in those difficult days of 1940.</P>
    <P>There have been cases in which long-term soldiers during the emergency suddenly got ill.  These soldiers as a result of that illness were declared physically unfit and were discharged from the Army on that basis.  Then when the medical board came to <Col N="804" /> examine them, they were told that it could not be shown that their illness arose out of service during the emergency period.  I have before me one letter from the Minister's Department dealing with the case of a man who joined the Army in 1924 and who, during the course of his service, was examined by a medical board on numerous occasions.  During his service he got frequent recommendations for sports and other feats calling for physical fitness.  During the manoeuvres of 1942 he got pleurisy.  Up to that time, he had never been sick in the 18 years of his Army service, but having got pleurisy in 1942 on Army manoeuvres, his health began to fail, and finally in May, 1946, he was discharged as physically unfit.</P>
    <P>I am not a doctor but I find it very difficult to understand how it can be alleged that a case such as that &mdash; there are other cases which I have heard of myself and of which I have heard other Deputies and Senators speak &mdash; did not arise out of Army service.  It all appears to turn on the fact that it is essential for the soldier himself to prove that his disability arose out of service during the emergency period. These men joined the Army when they were required, they joined in the hour of the country's need and I suggest it is entirely wrong that they should be put on this very difficult matter of proof.  The proper way to approach the situation where a soldier is discharged from the Army because he is physically unfit is to grant him a pension unless the State is able to prove that his disability arises from some reason outside his Army service, in other words the burden of proof should lie on the State.  It would be the duty and the job of the State to show that if a man did become unfit he was not entitled to a pension because the disability did not arise out of his service. The onus of proving that would be on the State instead of being, as it is at present, on the soldier concerned.</P>
    <P>Certainly, judging from what I have heard in respect to these claims and the manner in which demobilisation is carried out, I think I can say that if a similar emergency were to arise in future, some of these people would <Col N="805" /> hesitate before stepping into the breach, knowing that they were going to be treated again in the way that they have been treated in the past. There is a considerable number of cases in which I suggest injustice has been inflicted and I think the House should suggest to the Minister that these injustices require to be remedied as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much that has been said by Senator Sweetman but he confined his references to the Army that was called upon to defend the country during the recent emergency. He did not refer to even greater men who preceded this Army, namely the members of the Old I.R.A.  A number of these men applied to this board for pensions and I have no hesitation in saying that they did not get the consideration they deserved.  I know a number of these men in my own area and I am prepared to certify that they were actively engaged in the struggle with the foreign enemy.  They did not get the slightest consideration when they came before the board here in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. McCabe Mr. McCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to put myself in order as I merely want some enlightenment on this question.  I think that the Army officers who received a certain sum of money some years ago when they first left the Army and who were recalled during the emergency, and got a further substantial sum when leaving the Army for a second time, have been treated very fairly by the Government.  It is, I think, the duty of the people generally to see that these men should get first preference in the filling of any vacant positions. I think the people have tried to extend that preference to these men fairly well up to the present.  The Government has treated these men fairly and they have received sufficiently large pensions, much larger than the pensions to be given to the young men who are coming into the force to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Senator Sweetman is suffering under a misconception of the exact position in respect <Col N="806" /> to the matter which he discussed a few moments ago.  First of all, if we take the question of pensions, the pension code could not in any circumstances apply to the soldiers the Senator had in mind because they were only emergency soldiers.  These are the people who were advised to take an early release from the Army.  Even there, of course, the earliest release was dependent on the date upon which demobilisation was begun.  In no circumstances that I know of, could these people be affected in the manner suggested by Senator Sweetman because they were short service soldiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of long service soldiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator mentioned that the particular soldiers in whom he was interested were advised to get out of the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>But a soldier under a contract cannot leave the Army until his time has expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to long service soldiers whose term of service expired during the emergency and who were kept on because of the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the position the Senator had in mind, but even in the case of the long-service soldier, there comes a time when his period of service is completed and he automatically leaves the Army.  That man is entitled to a pension but the pension is governed by the pay which he is receiving. He cannot receive an increased pension on that pay.  The position in respect to the soldiers in whom the Senator was interested was that when demobilisation was completed, a number of soldiers found that their time had expired.  They left the Army in the normal way receiving the pension to which they were entitled. When demobilisation was completed, we had to set out to reorganise and almost to establish another Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to do that one of the first things that we had to do was to provide more attractive conditions, and among these was an increase in pay.  The pension automatically increased in proportion <Col N="807" /> to the pay.  That applied to every individual in the Army on the date on which the pay was increased. It did not apply to the men who left before that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of a request from the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I must get the Senator down to earth on this.  He is not on the earth at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is that I am on a very cold earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say that I am like the Senator in that respect. The fact of the matter is that the soldier I am talking about could only leave the Army when his time had expired. No appeal that we could have made to that man could have got him out a day sooner.  The appeal would have to be the other way &mdash; that the men would have to appeal to the authorities to be released rather than that the authorities would have to appeal to the men to go out.  As I was saying, one of the attractions which we thought might induce a number of temporary soldiers to remain, men of a very excellent type, was an increase in pay.  With the increase in pay the pension automatically increased, so that if there were a number of individuals who were due for release from the Service one or two days after the decision was taken, then the new pension would apply to them but not to the men who, if you like again, went out one or two days before that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Senator suggested that we should take the date as being the date on which the White Paper was issued.  We could take that date, but it would also be a border-line date. But if you had a number of people who were entitled to be in on this side, and, on the very fringe of the line, a number who were out, then there would be an attempt to bring the date to the only date which would satisfy everybody &mdash; the date on which pensions were first introduced.  That was away back in 1937, and, of course, if that were adopted it would open the door so that it would be very difficult to close because it would affect not only military pensions but practically all <Col N="808" /> the pensions that are at present being paid&mdash;pensions to national school teachers, to the police and to the Army.  For that reason, it would be quite impossible to accept the suggestion made by the Senator.</P>
    <P>As regards people who suffered disabilities and hardships and to the Army Pensions Board's decision in respect of them and the Senator's statement on them, I want to say that the board in my opinion is a reasonably fair board.  It is composed of individuals who are as human and just as we are.  They give every possible consideration to the claims that come before them.  I know for a fact that they encourage applicants to produce every particle of evidence which is likely to be of any benefit to them. When all that evidence is produced it is carefully examined by the members of the board, who then come to their decision.  The board has a duty to perform so far as the taxpayer is concerned. It has to see that pensions are not paid to people who are not entitled to them.  The members of the board, in the course of their inquiries which sometimes carry them very far afield, have to unearth the history of individuals.  Their decisions are based on the investigations they carry out, but, as I have said, their leanings are always towards the applicant.  Their decisions are based on the evidence which they get together in respect of each particular case.  I am satisfied, from my knowledge of the members of the board, that in no circumstances that I can conceive, would they knowingly do an injustice to an applicant. Therefore, all that I can say is that the men who make these claims have not been able to develop them to the point at which they could satisfy the board that they were entitled to pensions.</P>
    <P>Senator McCabe referred to a matter that comes under a different Act, the Military Service Pensions Act.  In that case, too, it would be unfair to say that the individuals are not given every opportunity of proving their case.  They have been given every possible opportunity. In the early days, a lot of the delay that took place was due to the number of appeals which were allowed by the Military Service Pensions <Col N="809" /> Board before an applicant was eventually told that he was not a person to whom the Act applied.  I am glad to say that that particular phase of things has now almost come to an end.  I think I have covered most of the points that were raised in the course of the short discussion which has taken place on this stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not correct in thinking that the long-term soldier who was continued on because of the emergency did not have to get out of the Army until the 1st of November last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that a number of long-term soldiers were held during the emergency, but they were released at the earliest possible moment.  That, however, does not alter the position of the case, because the men whom the Senator has in mind, if they were not held on, would have gone out several years before, with the pension then due to them.  The fact that they were held on for an additional period meant that they got a higher pension because of the extended service which they gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the question that I asked.  The question I asked was, did the Government not indicate that these men should go out before the final date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make myself quite clear?  The situation, as I understand it, was that there were long-term soldiers who contracted for a period of service which would expire during the emergency but, as a result of the emergency, the contract period was continued for the duration of the emergency. So far as the Army was concerned the emergency was declared to terminate on November 1st last, and on this date everyone whose contract of service expired at any time during the emergency must get out.  That is as I understand the situation.  What I want to know is, whether the Department was entitled to say that these men should get out before that date.  If I have not made myself clear to the Minister <Col N="810" /> perhaps we could leave it over.  I think I can raise the matter again on Section 2.  It is an operative section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;must&rdquo; that the Senator referred to was governed by the manner in which the men were demobilised.  We were not able to take the bottom out of the Army and let the men drop out.  We decided on releasing a number of men per month. It was worked out in such a way that it would take, I think, 12 months to release all the men.  Then we had to take another decision to ensure that individuals who were going out to assured employment were amongst those who were released early.  Individuals who had large family commitments were allowed to continue on to the last possible date.  There were several minor matters of this kind, I cannot remember them all, which governed the manner in which men were released.  There was no question of anyone being compelled to leave.</P>

      <P>The object of this Bill can be stated, I suppose, to be to safeguard the public from dishonest auctioneers.  Luckily, there have not been many of them.  It is really to keep undesirable people out of the business of auctioneering.  There have not been many cases of dishonesty, only about 12 or 13 during the past 12 or 13 years.  The position now is that it is possible for anyone simply by getting an auctioneer's licence to become an auctioneer.  That is an undesirable state of affairs and it is to remedy it that this Bill was brought in.  There are two principal points in the Bill: a certificate of qualification must be obtained from the court each year, and each auctioneer will be required to take out a certificate of qualification and deposit £2,000 or a bond to that amount in the High Court in case of defalcation. Auctioneers themselves have been trying for a long time to get a sort of council which would be a statutory body that would give them power to control the business.  Certain people had proposed this but it was not acceptable generally and I think the auctioneers themselves realised this and did not press for it.  There were certain difficulties in the way.  There are a variety of things which auctioneers have to deal with and there would be great difficulty in training an auctioneer to become expert in regard to all the things that auctioneers deal with. Several points were raised in the Dáil and amendments were put forward which I think have improved the Bill. I think it is a very acceptable Bill from the point of view of the auctioneers and the public.  It is not complicated: on the contrary, it is rather simple, and if there is anything the Seanad can <Col N="812" /> suggest to improve it I will be happy to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very rarely heard a Bill condemned with so much faint praise as the Minister has given it.  I hope it is really as simple as he makes it out to be.  There is one thing I would like to say at this stage and it is this: when the kind of Bill such as we have here comes before either House of the Oireachtas only one consideration should be present in the minds of the members and that is the public interest. It is not a Bill for auctioneers. It is a Bill for the public.  That is the Minister's point of view too and I am sure the Minister agrees with me that the only point to be considered is the public interest.  It does not matter whether we are dealing with auctioneers or architects or accountants, the matter must be considered from the point of view of the public.  We must see whether the public needs to be protected and whether the steps proposed to be taken will protect the public.  I do not profess to have an intimate knowledge of the auctioneering business but that is the first principle.  I would like to mention another principle and that is that as few closed corporations as possible should be created. There is a great tendency for people who get into certain positions no matter how humble their origins may have been, to try to make it harder and harder for other people to get into the same circle.  Nothing should be done in this Bill to prevent the small man from making a living, the small man of integrity and industry well known in his own area, from going into this business and making an honest living in it. I do not know whether this £2,000 fee is too big or too small for Dublin.  As the Minister has said, this house agents' and auctioneering business is a very complicated one and it causes a great variety of objections.  I do not know whether this amount of money&mdash; the fidelity bond&mdash;could be got in the country.  I do not know whether it could be issued to protect the whole public against an individual.  I know if I am working for an employer I can get, by paying a certain amount of insurance for a fidelity bond, a guarantee against my defaulting against my employer but I do not know whether <Col N="813" /> you can get a fidelity bond which may guarantee against defaulting against the general members of the public.</P>
      <P>The principle we should consider is whether it is good for the public or whether it does put an undue restraint on the poor man or the small man who has integrity and ability and wants to get on.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said here one time, it is very difficult to protect all classes of the public.  You cannot get legitimate measures to protect every, so to speak, <i>amadaun</i>, and prevent him making mistakes with his money.  I think it is worth while that anybody who is endeavouring to get this kind of protection for his profession should know that he must be able to prove it is for the good of the public before he can get any legitimate protection for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a notoriously strong agitation carried on for a number of years by the Association of Auctioneers and House Agents for some charter to regulate the conditions of the trade or business.  This Bill, so far as I understand it, does not purport to meet the demand made on behalf of the organised body of auctioneers and house agents.  Personally, I think the Minister was justified in saying he was not going to meet that demand, because it seemed to me entirely unjustified.  I think I agree with Senator Hayes in saying it is wrong to set up a code of law which has for its purpose the object of preventing the ordinary worthy man doing the kind of thing that he is competent to do.  There is probably some difficulty in regard to this Bill in relation to that type of man. I have in mind the ordinary man down the country who calls himself an auctioneer, who pays his £10 licence and is engaged mainly in auctioneering meadows, grazing, conacre and all that kind of thing.  The proceeds&mdash;the commission which he earns &mdash; would probably do no more than pay his auctioneer's fees.  There is a number of people in this House who are familiar with the country and know that that type of man is found in various places &mdash;the man whose whole business consists of putting up meadows and conacre <Col N="814" /> and things like that for sale and gets a very small revenue from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I think we must face this: that where auctioneers and house agents are handling large sums of money there must be protection for the public.  In that connection, I do not know whether the sum of £2,000 is in fact adequate protection.  I was speaking to an auctioneer recently who told me that people in a very small way of business as auctioneers handle vast sums, sums much in excess of £2,000 and that if one of these auctioneers or house agents were to fail or default, then in fact the public would be losers to the extent of several thousands of pounds; that this figure of £2,000 does not cover the case at all. I draw attention to this fact that there are two distinct types of people concerned in this Bill.  There is first and foremost the small businessman, the man with very small turnover, who handles no money at all in fact, because I think the auctioneer who puts up for sale the meadows and conacre of his neighbours never handles money.  He simply collects a few shillings for doing the neighbourly turn for his fellow-farmer and the matter ends there so far as he is concerned, whereas, on the other hand, in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, you have people handling very large sums of money in respect of deposits paid on foot of sales conducted by them.  There is then another type of auctioneer and I feel that there is nothing at all to regulate his business or protect the public in relation to it.  I speak now of the type of auctioneer who opens a place down on the quays or in a side street in Cork and Limerick, imports furniture, buys furniture locally and puts it up for sale, and side by side with that offers for sale the furniture of somebody who is giving up house. There is no check as to what is being done in relation to that business, and I understand that the public who utilise that form of sales room are being mulcted in very large sums of money.  I understand the auctioneer charges 10 per cent. to the vendor, 5 per cent. to the purchaser, in other words, 15 per cent. commission on his transactions.  That, I think, is excessive. In fact, I would say this, that <Col N="815" /> the outstanding defect of this Bill is that it makes no attempt whatever to regulate the charges of auctioneers and house agents.</P>
    <P>I made some effort to find out to what extent the auctioneer is remunerated as compared with, let us say, a solicitor, in relation to the same kind of transaction.  According to the scale of fees in the Solicitors' Remuneration Act, 1881, First Schedule, the solicitor's fee for all charges, including charges for negotiation by solicitor connected with the sale of property by private contract or by auction, including preparation of contract and conditions of sale, deducing title and furnishing the necessary certificates and completing the conveyance is, if the property affected is £25,000 &mdash; which is the price now fetched by an ordinary publichouse &mdash; limited to 12/7 per cent., realising £158 15s.  The auctioneer who sells that property privately is paid £625 in fees.  If it is sold by public auction his fee is £1,250.  I think that the Minister in introducing this Bill ought to have taken some steps to regulate fees chargeable by auctioneers and by house agents in the same way as the fees charged by solicitors are regulated as I have already said by the First Schedule to the Solicitors' Remuneration Act of 1881.</P>
    <P>This opportunity should not be let pass without that being done.  I would urge strongly that the Minister would in fact introduce in this House an amendment to the Bill regulating or helping to regulate the fees which are charged in respect of auctioneers and house agents.  I want to refer to one other aspect of the Bill&mdash; the exceptions mentioned in Section 6.  The Minister proposes that no person shall, after a certain date, carry on the business of auctioneer or hold himself out, or represent himself, as carrying on the business of auctioneer except he has a licence.  In one case a licence can be granted under Section 8 and in another case under Section 10.  It will be noted that this section requiring the auctioneer to provide himself with a licence does not apply to a considerable number of persons likely to be engaged in the auctioneering business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> An officer of customs and excise acting by direction of the Revenue Commissioners is not required to have a licence.  What is &ldquo;an officer of customs and excise&rdquo;?  Is he the gentleman who makes a list of the goods he is to offer for sale or is he a specially appointed officer?  If he is specially appointed, that should be set out in the Act.  The only two places in which, I think, those auctions are carried out are Dublin and Cork.  What happens is the local customs officer seizes goods; he makes a list of those goods and holds himself out as an auctioneer for the purpose of selling them.  I think that that is a serious abuse.  I saw a couple of those auctions carried on and I am of opinion that they were not conducted in the public interest.  I do not desire to enlarge on the matter beyond saying that I think it is a gross public abuse to permit an officer who has seized and listed goods to offer them for sale without any obligation to show that he is acting <i>bona fide.</i>  Then, we have the provision that a sheriff, an under-sheriff or a county registrar or an officer of any of these functionaries can carry on an auction without a licence.  Again, what is an &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in this case?  Is he a clerk or a messenger?  I do not know what is meant by the term.  Is a bailiff entitled to carry on an auction of seized goods?  If so, I protest against it.  I think that there should be a regulation in this case, as in every other case, to ensure that the person carrying on the sale is a properly recognised auctioneer.</P>
    <P>In the same section, we have a reservation in favour of a collector of income tax or his deputy.  A collector of income tax is not a public servant at all.  He is not an established civil servant.  The Revenue Commissioners may appoint anybody to the office of collector of income tax and an exception is here made in favour of the person so appointed.  The collector may claim the right to seize the goods of some person alleged to owe money in respect of income tax.  He can list those goods and offer them for sale without any obligation to apply for a licence or to apply for a renewal of a licence, <Col N="817" /> which would provide an opportunity for revealing his imperfections.  The public are offered no protection whatever. It is a gross abuse of the public interest to exempt officials in this way, some of them established civil servants and others unestablished.  Then, we have an exemption in respect of an auction relating to distress as regards rates.  A rate collector or any person authorised by him may conduct such an auction without a licence.</P>
    <P>What is the aim of this Bill?  It is not a Bill to promote the public interest. It is, I think, a Bill to satisfy some of the demands of the Auctioneers' Association.  The Minister, I presume, said: &ldquo;There is an agitation for a charter.  I shall not give them a charter but I shall give them this Bill instead.  It will, at least, prevent some people coming into the auctioneering business, but I shall take very good care that anybody authorised to sell goods on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, rate collectors and sheriffs will have a free hand.&rdquo;  Not only is a rate collector exempted from the obligations imposed by this Bill but any person authorised by a rate collector to carry on a sale by auction is exempted. There is also an exemption under subhead (h) in favour of an officer of the State who is selling State property. What is an &ldquo;officer of the State&rdquo;? What rank must he hold?  Is he to be a junior clerk or a senior officer?  I think that there should be some definition of &ldquo;officer of the State&rdquo;.  He ought to be a responsible officer and his rank should be mentioned in the Bill. Then we have an exemption in respect of the selling of fish.  The information I have as regards the selling of fish is that the manner in which it is done is disgraceful and is not in the public interest. I am informed that, in certain places, a foreign trawler bringing fish to a port chooses the auctioneer, who may be a Swede or a Frenchman; he is hardly ever a local auctioneer.  That practice is to be continued under this Bill.  The Minister imposes no obligation on the person selling fish by auction to have a licence.  I am told that, except in one port, all the auctioneers so appointed are foreigners and represent foreign interests.  The points I have made are, I think, of <Col N="818" /> substance and should receive the attention of the Minister before he finally disposes of the Bill in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I agree with Senator Duffy in what he says about customs and excise officers carrying on business as auctioneers.  There may have been an argument for such a procedure many years ago, when, owing to the situation that existed, an auctioneer would not accept such sales. Now that a native Government has come into power, that situation no longer exists.  Generally speaking, auctioneers would be more than willing to accept auctions of that kind, particularly at present.  We have passed from the stage when auctioneers, for one reason or another, would not accept such auctions.  In certain cases, they might have been afraid to do so.  That situation no longer exists and a great deal can be said for Senator Duffy's argument.</P>
      <P>While I agree with Senator Duffy in certain things, I do not agree with him in other things.  He referred to the &ldquo;agitation&rdquo; carried on by the auctioneers to obtain a Bill.  I am one of those who took a small part in the so-called agitation and I am the son of one of those who started the agitation. My father was the first President of the Auctioneers' Association many years ago and I do not see anything wrong with what the Senator referred to as an &ldquo;agitation&rdquo;.  All that is wrong is that, having agitated for a number of years, we find the Minister for Justice telling us that he has given nothing to the auctioneers but has produced a Bill to protect the general public against the auctioneers.  The Minister is notorious for his candour and I think that he has not let himself down on this occasion. Taking it on that basis, I do not think he has gone far enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <P>To protect the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>To protect the public against the auctioneers.  Somebody may make some use of that statement but I say that the auctioneers, as a body, have been less guilty than the members of most other professions of malpractices.  The number of auctioneers <Col N="819" /> who have defaulted is much less than the number of the members of other professions who have defaulted. You will always have a few persons here and there who will fall down on the job.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the auctioneers have given very good service to the country.  Senator Duffy compared the rate of commission with the rates charged by solicitors, but surely he must know that auctioneers generally take a greater risk than a solicitor takes.  While I do not say that solicitors are charging too much, I certainly say that, if an auctioneer did not get his regular commission as laid down by the Auctioneers' Association, he would not be very long in business or causing anybody very much trouble.</P>
      <P>With regard to differentiation, I think it was Senator Hayes who said he was not sure that the same thing should apply to the city auctioneer as to the country ones.  I quite understand people thinking on those lines, but I can assure the House that it would be quite impossible to differentiate. While there are auctioneers in the city doing what may be considered a fairly good business, there are auctioneers in the country whose names are practically never heard of in the daily papers but whose business would far exceed that done by city auctioneers and it would be quite impossible to differentiate between one and the other.</P>
      <P>Regarding the bond, I am quite sure I will be accused of backing up the big man when I say I think it is too small. Any man really doing business at all and calling himself an auctioneer would certainly have more than £2,000 of the public's money in hands, or he would have no business worth talking about. Besides the bond, there should be some qualification.  It may be said that at present the bond is a protection to the Auctioneers' Association or to the public generally, but it is very small protection, as any man of standing can provide for that bond.  I do not know what it takes to provide it by way of insurance, but there is some method by which it can be got over for a very small sum.  Some qualification should be insisted on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> There is no qualification at present. A man comes before the court and, if there is nothing against him by the superintendent, he is all right.  It is only a question of his integrity.  If he comes under the heading of a fairly decent fellow down the country, he can go into the business.  I do not think it necessary to tell the House that any man in the auctioneer's business is likely to be asked a dozen or so extraordinary questions inside the space of an hour.  He must have a fairly good knowledge of law and accountancy and a good knowledge of businesses of various kinds which normally do not come under the heading of auctioneering business at all.  Someone says he should have a glib tongue.  It seems to me that one of the things he must learn is to keep his tongue in his cheek.</P>
    <P>I believe that the auctioneers as such welcome the Bill.  As one of them, I welcome it as a step in the right direction. If anyone thinks that the Government have given anything to the auctioneers under this Bill, I would like to disillusion them.  It is a step in the right direction, but I do not think it has gone far enough, either on the basis the Minister set out in his opening remarks in giving protection to the public or in the matter of satisfaction to the Auctioneers' Association, but it might improve later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported the principle of an Auctioneers Bill, with what has been described as a charter for auctioneers and house agents, some years ago and I am still of the same opinion.  I am not enamoured of this Bill and it does not impress me very much.  Like most half measures or quarter measures, it may achieve some good or it may do some harm.  I agree with one thing which Senator Quirke said, that is, that £2,000 is not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the danger, when you mention a sum of £2,000, that the public will think that because So-and-So is a licensed auctioneer he is perfectly safe with their money, as there is a deposit. If they knew that the deposit was only £2,000 and that in the ordinary course of business he would have anything up to ten times that amount on many <Col N="821" /> occasions, they would not be by any means so sure. £2,000 without integrity is no protection to the public&mdash; that is the plain truth of the matter. Probably it is better that there should be some bond or deposit and I can understand why the Minister starts in a small way, and he may be wise to do so; but I would like as much publicity as possible given to the fact that it only means that the particular person has £2,000.</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with other trades &mdash; as the auctioneers claim to be a profession, they may despise the term &ldquo;trade&rdquo;&mdash; in manufacturing and distributing, there is considerably more capital required.  While it is not always easy to know exactly, one can obtain a fairly good idea from the look of a business as to what capital is employed in it, and it is not very difficult to find out through moderate inquiries what the situation is.  In the case of the professional man, it is very different, as he may go into business with no capital.  Probably that is one of the reasons why the Government thought fit to introduce this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Senator Duffy's remarks regarding the principle of a closed shop and I have a good deal of sympathy with them, but we must face the fact that the day in which every man was free to be just what he liked has practically gone.  If the State does not introduce restrictions, someone else will.  Probably there would be a trade union of auctioneers which would make it impossible for anyone to be an auctioneer &mdash; and that could almost have been possible without the Bill at all, if a little more organisation and a little more money were spent.</P>
    <P>If there is to be control and if there is to be a charter with certain privileges, one cannot expect those privileges from the State unless one pays for them.  With the privileges, there must be very definite restrictions. The difficulty in having any test as to qualifications is that the only way you could register an auctioneer or a house agent because he was qualified would be by taking an examination, presumably of the Auctioneers' and House Agents' Association.  I do not think the <Col N="822" /> State could take that, unless it first introduced some form of regulation as to the nature of the examinations and the tests and what body would control them.  Therefore, it seems almost impossible to go very much further than the Bill suggests, except by way of having a larger deposit, unless the Government is prepared to introduce something in the nature of a charter.  The Government might have been wise in starting this way.  If I were to prophesy, I would suggest that it will not stop there, as it is almost certain that, with some experience, further legislation will be necessary.</P>
    <P>In regard to prices, I think that someone in addition to Senator Duffy should voice the comment, which may be grossly unfair &mdash; as a great deal of comments in regard to prices are &mdash; that there is a generally accepted principle that, in an inflation period where prices have doubled, a smaller percentage should be sufficient.  I find it hard to believe that 5 per cent. on a £7,000 house does not bring considerably more to the auctioneer, even with more expenditure, than 5 per cent. on the same house at £3,500.  I can imagine that would be a matter for the Prices Commission if it occurred in any other trade and great care would be taken to have the rate of profit reduced.  The auctioneers do auction certain commodities also &mdash; they auction a lot of rubbish as well and a great many things which are not absolutely essential.  It may be extremely difficult to draw the line but there is some comment abroad on the fact that 5 per cent. on the inflated price of a house is very high particularly in the City of Dublin.  I am not in the business, I have never examined into it and I do not feel competent to pronounce judgment upon the accuracy of that opinion but I feel that in a debate of this kind someone should mention it.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in regard to which I should like in particular to ask some information from the Minister. I agree with Senator Hayes that our principal function is to see that the public are protected and that we should not give to a body of persons who are described as auctioneers and house agents any exclusive powers which they ought not to have.  I do <Col N="823" /> not know enough about the matter to make any comment in regard to the definition of an auctioneer, but when we come to the definition of a house agent I am not by any means so sure, and I should like to put a specific question to the Minister.  The definition of house agent says that &ldquo;the expression means a person who, as agent for another person and for or in expectation of reward, purchases, sells, lets or offers for sale or letting or invites offers to purchase or take a letting of&rdquo;.  So far, I think, that is probably all right, but the definition goes on &mdash;&ldquo;or negotiates for the purchase, sale or letting of a house otherwise than by auction or attempts to effect such purchase, sale or letting&rdquo;. It seems to me that there is no reason why an architect should not be allowed to negotiate on behalf of his client, and I think he is debarred from doing that by this definition.  I think it is a fairly common practice &mdash; I have certainly done it myself &mdash; to get an architect to examine property which one may desire to purchase with a view to seeing what repairs, if any, are required. Then, after he has reported, he is sometimes told to go to the house agent and to arrange a price.  He will probably arrange with the house agent what his fees are to be, but then he will be acting for reward, and as a result, he is committing an offence under this Bill.  I think if a person employs an architect&mdash;in some cases it may be an engineer &mdash; to act on his behalf, that architect or engineer should be permitted to negotiate for the purchase of the property on behalf of his client.</P>
    <P>Another point upon which Senator Sweetman, perhaps, could put me right, deals with the position of a limited company.  I presume that a limited company for the purposes of the Bill is a person in so far as the definition of house agent is concerned.  A limited company might appoint one of its directors or managers to carry out negotiations.  He would do that for a profit.  I think he will not be allowed to do that if the definition is taken too rigidly unless he first qualifies as a house agent.  The suggestion I make <Col N="824" /> to the Minister is that the definition of house agent requires some examination and possible amendment.  I do not see why an architect should have to be registered as a house agent to negotiate for the purchase of property on behalf of a client.  Sometimes the negotiation is carried on through a solicitor, but of course the case of a solicitor is covered by the Bill.  I think that the definition of house agent is one that requires to be examined by the Minister before the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might begin at the wrong end, I think that the last point raised by Senator Douglas does appear to be of considerable importance because though provision is made in the Bill for the case of a company carrying on business by means of an auction permit, there does not appear to be the same provision in the Bill for a company carrying on business as house agents.  It may be that the Minister does not visualise any company carrying on a house agency business apart from auctioneering.  Of course the definition of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; does not cover the particular point made by Senator Douglas. It appears to me that the discussion on this Bill is notable for two contributions. First of all, there was the contribution of Senator Duffy to which Senator Douglas has already referred. It is indeed a breath of fresh air, in these days of restrictions and controls, advocated by the Labour Party, to find Senator Duffy coming out so openly and so strongly against the closed shop and in favour of everybody being given a free hand.</P>

I quite frankly welcomed the provision in Section 6 which says that an auction of State property by an officer of the State would not be considered one of the things for which a permit is necessary because I hoped that one of the effects of that will be to wipe out the jealousy created during the past 12 months because of the fact that certain State auctions always went to one particular firm.  If auctions are to be held by civil servants, then I think there will be no justification for that jealousy because one firm alone will not be selected for State auctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hoped particularly that the officer who would be selected to conduct these auctions would be an officer of the Department of Defence because it was mostly in respect of auctions by the Department of Defence that great jealousy was created.  I also hoped that if State auctions are going to be conducted by an officer of the State, then there would not be the same inducement or necessity for auctioneers to have their advertisements displayed in Government Departments.  I think it is nothing short of a disgrace that any auctioneer should be allowed&mdash; mind you, I am not hitting at any member of this House in that respect, nor am I hitting at the Senator who is now coming in &mdash; to advertise in any Department of State by means of calendars. I object very strongly when I go to the Department of Industry and Commerce to transact public business <Col N="826" /> with an official to see up on the wall beside me a calendar advertising any particular auctioneer.  It is entirely wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I remarked earlier to the Minister for Defence that we could do with a little bit of warmth to-day.  I quite agree with Senator Quirke that the vast body of auctioneers have rendered really good service to the public, and that among the number of auctioneers practising there has been an extraordinarily small percentage of defalcations. It is only right that, on every occasion when we discuss restrictions on the members of this profession or the question of security for the public, we should express frankly the view that there has been only this very small proportion of defalcations.  It is only in respect of this very small number of auctioneers that we are anxious to have regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the provisions in the Bill which aim at providing security against defalcations.  They are neither adequate nor reasonable.  The proper method of providing that security is not by means of a fidelity bond or a deposit, but rather by ensuring that those holding other people's money must <Col N="827" /> segregate that money from their own. I am quite certain that if the Minister were to furnish us with a return from his law officers relating to all the cases that have come before the courts in which there was default on the part of a solicitor, an auctioneer, or any other person dealing with public money, it would be found that in almost all cases the defalcations started off by the person concerned not knowing where he stood.  His own money had got mixed up with other people's money.  He was spending more than he was earning, and he gradually got into the position that he was utilising other people's money. Then, suddenly, he one day woke up as to how things were, and he found that he was in the position that he was not able to pay.  I suggest that the real safeguard for the public in regard to trust moneys, such as we are speaking of, whether they are held by a solicitor, an auctioneer or any other person, is that they should be put into a separate banking account, and that it should be made a criminal offence for the person entrusted with such moneys to use them for any purpose unconnected with the trust.  What I mean is that, if I have £2,000 belonging to Senator Hearne, I must put that into a separate banking account.  I must use it for his business only, and if I utilise any of it for my own purposes, then I am guilty of a crime for which I can be sent to jail.</P>
    <P>That, I suggest, is the ultimate protection for the public.  It is the protection that the public is entitled to have. On the Committee Stage of the Bill I propose moving an amendment on these lines.  If an auctioneer is bound by law to keep separate banking accounts, such as I suggest, he will know where he stands at any particular date.  It will be a protection for him against going down a slope, which is sometimes very slippery, without any bad faith on his part, and then suddenly finding that he has overdrawn himself.  I do not think that the provisions in the Bill with regard to a bond or a deposit provide sufficient cover, nor would they protect the public against the man who wants to be deliberately fraudulent.  At best, they will do so only to the extent of £2,000 If an auctioneer or any other <Col N="828" /> person holding trust funds knows that, if he ultilises them for his own purposes, the result for him is going to be not merely bankruptcy but that he is going to go to jail, he will think twice before he will do so.  That, I suggest, is the only protection for the public that is of any use.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, when replying, will give the House the figure which he must have ascertained which it is proposed to charge on the bond in the case of the £2,000 deposit.  Obviously, in considering the reasonableness of the amount of the deposit, we must also consider the amount of the premium that is going to be charged.  We should make every effort to see that the ordinary person is not prevented from carrying on business under the conditions which I have suggested. If separate banking accounts must be kept there will be a far greater degree of security for the public than under the provisions of the Bill, and the new man will not be prevented from coming in.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy made a comparison between the commission which auctioneers receive and solicitors' charges. While I appreciate very much the point of view that he put forward, I am afraid that his figures were not quite accurate.  For the sake of accuracy, it is just as well that the correct figures should be given.  The Senator suggested that, in the case of a £25,000 sale, the solicitor's charges were £158, and the auctioneer's commission £1,250 in the case of a public sale, and half of that sum in the case of a private sale.  I want to tell him that the correct figure for the solicitor is £237 and not £158 as he stated.  The comparison is, I think, a fair one in spite of what Senator Quirke suggested.  I should like very much to have heard the Senator continue on what was the heavier responsibility &mdash; that of the auctioneer or solicitor &mdash; for which the former should be paid the higher fee. In regard to the auctioneer's commission, I think that where the public have a grievance is that it is not graduated on a sliding scale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Who said there was a grievance?</P>

    <Col N="829" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly prepared to say that there is a grievance, and I am going to say something on these lines that may surprise Senators. I do not think that in the vast majority of auctions, country auctions particularly, the auctioneers get the full percentage that they are supposed to claim in accordance with their own regulations.  What happens in effect is, there is bargaining with several sets of auctioneers and, finally, the client concerned tries to get one who will accept the lowest commission.  Clients generally consider that the flat fee from the bottom up, no matter how high the property goes, is not reasonable.  If the fees were graded fees it would in the long run be beneficial to the auctioneers themselves because there would not be any request to them to cut their charges.  It is common property that in cases of substantial sales it is considered unreasonable for an auctioneer to stand out for his full pound of flesh and in fairness to the auctioneers I must say that they do not do that.  It would be much better if the grievances were removed by graduating the fees.  Efforts would not be made then to have them altered one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing commission is 2½ per cent. on a private sale and 5 per cent. on a public sale irrespective of whether it is £100 or £100,000.  The solicitor's commission is £3 per cent. on the first £1,000, £2 5s. per cent. for the next £2,000 and, I think, 30/- per cent. for the next £4,000 and after that it is 11/3 per cent.  I would consider unfair, even having regard to the big transactions and the greater responsibility involved, for the solicitor's fee to be 3 per cent. flat.  The graded scale is fair and I think that a graded scale is required here and it would in the long run be of benefit to the auctioneers if they decided to adopt it as adopted in the Solicitors Act of 1881.  I would very seriously suggest to the Minister that between this and the Committee Stage he should reorientate his mind on the question of separate accounts and adopt some provision to ensure that those of us who handle large sums of money put that money into a special trust account, a separate bank account, and to provide that if we use that <Col N="830" /> money for private purposes we commit a criminal offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. McCabe Mr. McCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill but I am not entirely in agreement with the suggestion that the bond should be £2,000.  I would much prefer that it would be £5,000.  A good deal has been said about auctioneers and their work but I have noticed that in the last two or three years nearly every door in every little village and town in the country has a sign or notice outside denoting that the owner is an auctioneer. I regret to have to admit that, in a number of cases there are auctioneers who should not be trusted and I think the Minister is doing a very good act at the moment in introducing a measure that will ensure that only old-established auctioneers and men of integrity and honesty should be permitted to engage in this trade.  Senator Hayes referred to the question of bonds.  I think the charge for a bond from any insurance company at the moment is 10/6 per £1,000.  That would be £5 5s. 0d. for a bond of £5,000.  Such a bond would be a guarantee to the people giving their business to auctioneers that no matter what happens they would be repaid.  Rate collectors throughout the country are covered by bonds.  We must guarantee to the public that they will not suffer.  No matter how good a man may be he may fall and for the benefit of the State and the individual whose money he is handling this guarantee should be asked for.  As I said before I welcome this Bill and I think it has been brought forward at a most opportune time.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill, but I am rather sorry that it does not go further.  I would like to have seen a Bill brought in here which would amalgamate the professions of valuers, house agents and auctioneers and provide for a course of education and some diploma at the end of it, and I would like to see members of the profession more closely under the control of the profession itself.  I do not know whether this is coming or not.  I had hoped it might be in this Bill.  There is a great deal to be said for it.  Subject to those remarks I think that this Bill is an advance in <Col N="831" /> the right direction and I extend to it the welcome that other members have given.</P>

      <P>I have been always interested in definitions and in trying to understand what things mean. The first definition in this Bill is of an auction and there is reference to a Dutch auction.  I cannot discover exactly what a Dutch auction is, and after inquiries I made it is still double Dutch to me.  I think this should be clarified so as to avoid confusion when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator tell me what a Dutch auction is?  I must confess that I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to enlighten the Senator.  I have stated it was double Dutch to me and I am not going to make it treble Dutch for the Senator.  It is not clear to me at any rate.  I did not get the definition from a dictionary, by the way, in case the Senator might ask me afterwards. The word &ldquo;auctioneer&rdquo; is confusing, too.  Can an individual auction his own property under this Bill and is the public protected against an individual auctioning his own property?  At one time a considerable amount of business was done by people going around to fairs and markets auctioning their own goods from their own vehicles.  It did not amount, I am sure, to a whole lot, but still there is the fact that an individual can auction his own property and possibly deceive the public under the terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We come then to the exemptions.  I would like to look for some reason as to why sub-section (2) of Section 6 and Article G were included here.  An auction of fresh fish is included or excluded as the text applies.  I wonder how would it apply if the fish were stale?  Could he auction stale fish, if the fish were bad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No one would buy the fish if it were bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>People will buy it and it is auctioned.  The goods have further use as manure.  That brings us to the question as to how auctioneers are to function in public markets like the corporation fruit and vegetable <Col N="832" /> market and the fish market under the terms of the Bill.  In the fruit and vegetable and fish markets of the Dublin municipality, there is a large number of stallholders to auction the products of the farmers individually every day.  I cannot see that these actually come under the terms of the Bill.  If they do, it will be pretty hard on some of them to lodge £2,000.  It will be quite easy for others who have big businesses outside the market to make a deposit of £2,000.  Really the £2,000 is not necessary for certain stallholders within the markets, because I do not think the nature of the trade would ever amount to anything in excess of £2,000&mdash;that would be from week to week at any rate, when if there were defalcations it would become apparent. I would like to have that position clarified as to whether the stallholders who auction goods in these markets will come within the terms of the Bill. They do not seem to be excluded.  So far as I can see there is just one other point which, in trying to interpret the Bill for myself, I find difficult.  It is in Section 7, sub-section (11), para. (c): &ldquo;A person acting as agent for the Minister of State, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, the Irish Land Commission, or any person authorised to acquire land compulsorily.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the wording of that paragraph is clear because it says at the start: &ldquo;This section does not apply to a person acting as agent for a Minister of State&rdquo;.  It does not apply to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland &mdash; if that would be the interpretation, it means that it only does not apply to them and does not include their agents; it does not apply to the Irish Land Commission or any person authorised to acquire land compulsorily.</P>
      <P>If I can make myself clear, the wording seems to me to indicate that the section does not apply to the Irish Land Commission.  That does not mean anything really.  I think at least that it is not clear as the draftsman has given it, and I would like that matter to be considered by the Minister and his staff before the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is all I have to refer to relative to the Bill.  They are <Col N="833" /> mainly matters of clarification and I am endeavouring to understand them on my own behalf, and I think I may speak on behalf of Senator Sweetman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a number of speakers who here stated this Bill is an advance and an advance in the right direction.  I think it was Senator Moore who said there should be a charter.  Personally, I think that should be the ultimate ideal.  In connection with that object there is at present, so far as I know, a course of training at the Bolton Street Technical School for auctioneers &mdash;let us say, apprentices &mdash; and I take it that course is under the aegis of the Auctioneers' Association and that it was on their initiative that it was organised.  That would seem to indicate an intention on the part of the auctioneers to achieve this charter ultimately.</P>
      <P>The profession is one that does really involve a very considerable technical knowledge.  An auctioneer is very little use unless he is able to value things.  I take it that the variety of goods and types of things an auctioneer has to deal with from time to time is very great and it would be impossible for any one man to be able to give a useful opinion regarding them all.  As a rule they specialise.  One man would be good at furniture, another at cattle, another at houses and so on.  I take it in that connection that an incorporated company would be entitled to employ specialists and to nominate such specialists.  It is not clear to me whether the company would be at liberty to nominate several different specialists in connection with such work.  I take it, it would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that always worried me about this auctioneering business is the vast number of people who have come into it.  They spring up from nowhere and the next thing we find them advertising themselves as auctioneers and house agents and so on.  I have not had time to study the Bill very closely and perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to state when replying if a person must be a national of this country before he can get a <Col N="834" /> licence, or may any person, foreign or otherwise, become a licensee.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree also with those who stated that £2,000 of a guarantee is not enough &mdash; that £2,000 is an insignificant amount.  I would be inclined to advise the Minister to increase this amount for the reason that it is common knowledge that so many irresponsible people come along.  I do not know whether the provision which applies to ordinary contracts would apply in this case.  As a rule double the amount of the contract has to go into the bond and that might perhaps be an additional degree of safety.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Sweetman who referred to the fees and said that it is a matter of very common knowledge that there is a bargaining, a kind of touting system, if you like, and the successful tout will get business where the man who is inclined to adopt a professional attitude and insists on professional etiquette will fail.  That is a matter of common knowledge. Auctioneers are quite well aware of it. I do not think anyone could reasonably deny it.  Senator Quirke referred to the fact that very few auctioneers fail.  That is quite true and I think he was hinting at other profesisons where failures of late years are becoming very frequent.</P>
    <P>These professions would be rather closely allied to the auctioneering profession. I think that Senator Quirke's statement is two-edged.  It seems to indicate that the auctioneer's remuneration is so very substantial, compared with that given to other professions, that auctioneers are not likely to be guilty of defalcation &mdash; that there is no necessity for that because their fees are so substantial.  That reply could well be made to the Senator.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress the vocational organisation side of the matter.  I find it difficult to reconcile Senator Duffy's statement, to the effect that anybody should be entitled to set up in this business, with the commonly held view that you may not set up and call yourself a mason or a carpenter or a member of any other trade without undergoing a certain training, which is <Col N="835" /> recognised as a qualifying training.  I think that the same thing should apply to auctioneering as to all the other professions. Once we recognise that generally, then we shall have that very large measure of agreement regarding vocational organisation which is so desirable and which would, ultimately, result, I am sure, in inducing the Government to endeavour to implement the recommendations of the very important commission on the subject which were issued some years ago.</P>
    <P>This Bill, then, is a move in the right direction.  It is only a beginning and I hope that, in the not far distant future, the Minister will be bringing in another Bill to put the auctioneering business on a really professional basis and, in that way, forge a further link in the chain which will, ultimately, result in vocational organisation being the system of the country generally.  The adoption of such a system does not necessarily mean that each closed organisation will be able to fix its own charges and tyrannise over others.  That system will require some general control so that the interests of the general public will be safeguarded.  The idea of the &ldquo;closed shop&rdquo; need not, therefore, alarm us in the slightest degree, because that &ldquo;closed shop&rdquo; will itself be subject to general control, in the interests of the public.  The Minister is there to see that such control is exercised, if not by a system which is part of a general system of vocational organisation, then as a matter arising out of the Minister's own functions, as protector of the general interests of the public.</P>

      <P>What happened in the other House has happened in this House.  There has been a difference of opinion on a number of points. Senator Hayes suggested that the deposit required was too large for a country auctioneer.  A Senator from the country &mdash; Senator McCabe &mdash; urged that it was not large enough.  Seeing how things went in the other House and in this House, I think that we were about right in fixing upon the sum of £2,000.  That is not supposed to be a complete safeguard but we <Col N="836" /> think that it will meet most of the cases which are likely to arise.  In the few cases of defalcation which have occurred amongst auctioneers, the defaulters were generally persons who were just starting off.  It has to be remembered that the money lodged with the auctioneer is merely a deposit amounting to about 25 per cent. of the purchase price and that that sum remains in his hands for only a limited time.  A question was raised as to what the cost of the deposit which the auctioneer will be required to make will be to him.  That will be a matter for the insurance companies, but I understand that the cost will be somewhere between £10 and £15.</P>

In the case of solicitors, there is a committee, I think, which fixes the fees.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to the operations of what he described as the &ldquo;tout&rdquo;.  We were all aware that that was happening.  I do not think that, on the whole, it is a bad thing.  From the professional point of view, it may not be advantageous but, from the point of view of the public interest, which we most consider, there is something to be said for it.  If there is a great deal of profit to be made, there will be a great deal of competition and the matter will regulate itself. I examined the whole matter and I came to the conclusion that there was no necessity to take action&mdash;that the matter would settle itself.  Senator Duffy referred to the exemption of customs officers, sheriffs, rate collectors and others from the necessity of taking out a licence.  I do not see why they should not be exempt.  I am not prepared to admit that the time has arrived when goods seized by a sheriff would be sold by an auctioneer.  These officers are <Col N="837" /> acting for the Government and they do not hold any deposit moneys.  We are trying to guard in this Bill against the deposits of purchasers being embezzled by auctioneers with whom they are lodged.  There is no such lodgment in the case of those public officials; consequently, I see no reason to interfere with the practice which at present obtains.  The reason why fish auctioneers are not included in the Bill is that the Minister for Agriculture proposes to deal with the whole matter in a Fishery Bill.  As to the difference between fresh and other fish, the fresh fish have just been landed and the other fish are salted.  As to the rotten fish, they might be sold as manure but I do not think they would fetch a big price, though they might.</P>

      <P>As to the qualifications, an applicant has not to go to court and show what his qualifications are but an opportunity is afforded to anybody to object to an applicant on the ground that he is not a proper person to hold a licence.  For instance, the Garda could make such an objection.  One of the complaints made at a meeting of auctioneers &mdash; and I think they had every reason to complain &mdash; was that a man who had just come out of jail could, by taking out a £10 licence, become an auctioneer.  It will not be possible for that to happen when this Bill is law.  That is why this certificate is necessary.  It gives an opportunity to the superintendent of the Garda, or to somebody else, to object to a man obtaining a licence on the ground that he has defaulted in some respect. Senator Douglas was not sure about the definition section and he thought that the use of the word &ldquo;negotiate&rdquo; might prevent an architect from acting on behalf of a would-be purchaser.  We do not think that that would happen. If we had not the word &ldquo;negotiate,&rdquo; there might be a loophole.  People might negotiate, take deposits and yet maintain that they were not acting as agents.  There is no question of interfering with an architect who is simply giving professional advice as to the structural condition of a house.</P>

      <P>I referred to the case of an architect who is directed by his client to go down the country, examine a house and, if he found it suitable, negotiate with a view to getting it for his client.  I think that he is debarred from doing that.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of selling.  It is quite a common practice for a man who does not know much about the value of property to get an architect to examine it, decide on its worth and endeavour to effect a purchase on his behalf.  That is a perfectly proper procedure; that is negotiating for purchase; the architect had nothing to do with selling.  That is a different proposition.  The other point I made was that where a limited company wanted to buy, it would have to appoint one of its own people to act and do the purchase.  It is only a small point for examination, and I am not going to press it.</P>

      <P>We will examine that. Senator Douglas thought the deposit too small, while others thought it too large, and I have dealt with that. Senator Sweetman spoke of a separate account.  I suppose that is desirable, but it would be very difficult.  I personally was anxious to have it, as I knew of a case where a salesman put the money into his own account.  He was quite honest as far as I know but the bank closed on him that day and all that money was held and the man who actually got the cheque from him, who had sold his cattle, found the cheque returned.  To enforce that, one would require some sort of public audit and where an auctioneer was becoming shaky you would have no way of enforcing it until the damage was done. If he holds on to money, he is guilty of an offence, and the only safeguard I see is to have a deposit.  If he is likely to hold on to the money, he is just as likely to put it to his own account and take the chance, unless we have the audit.  I know that the solicitors object to something of that kind, to requiring solicitors to have <Col N="839" /> audited accounts, including costs and all the rest of it.</P>
      <P>There is also the point that, in the case of auctioneers, they do not hold the money for as long a period as solicitors do.  They generally hold it until the sale is completed, a matter of a few weeks, sometimes not as long, and in some cases it may be only for a day or two, as in the case of salesmen. I was most anxious to have this included, on account of cases that came to my notice, but I am afraid it would not work.  In regard to the premium, as far as we can find out, it would be from £10 to £15.</P>
      <P>In regard to Dutch auctions, I understand that the auctioneer starts at a high figure, perhaps three times what he hopes to get, and goes down until he gets someone to take what he considers a satisfactory price.  If this provision were not there, there would be someone trying to evade the law by carrying out Dutch auctions.  In regard to auctioning your own property, that cannot be done either, as the difficulty would be to prove a thing was not the person's own property. Anyone who wants to auction his own property could sell it all right but not auction it, as there would be too much evasion there.  The fruit and vegetable salesmen must be licensed and the fish people would have to take out a licence also, only that the Minister for Agriculture intends to legislate for them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of nationals, there is nothing to prevent a non-national being an auctioneer, but in the case of an ordinary alien, first of all the Minister for Justice has to admit him into the country and he cannot come without permission, and when he is in he cannot take up employment <Col N="840" /> unless the Minister for Industry and Commerce allows it.

    <Title>Customs-Free Airport Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as the House is aware, is to provide the legal basis for the establishment of a customs-free airport at Shannon.  The Bill is of rather a technical character, but the explanatory memorandum which was made available with it will have explained to Senators its main provisions.  The establishment of a free airport at Shannon is a logical development of the aviation policy which has been followed since the decision was taken some ten years ago to build an airport at Shannon.</P>
      <P>A main feature of the policy has been to provide there all the facilities which the international civil aviation organisation considers necessary at a main transatlantic airport.  In accordance therewith we are building runways which will accommodate the largest aircraft in commercial operation, providing the most up-to-date navigational aids and putting up a terminal building which will be capable of accommodating all the traffic which the airport may handle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now proposing to make Shannon the first customs-free airport in the world.  The idea of a customs-free airport is new.  I think it can be <Col N="841" /> said to be an Irish idea.  It was our representatives at international conferences who took the initiative of securing that the various international conventions for the regulation of civil aviation should be so framed as to permit of the operation of customs-free airports.  The original convention, that which was signed at Paris about 25 years ago, contained no such provision; but when a conference was held at Chicago in 1944 for the purpose of framing a new convention, our representatives there took the opportunity to secure international recognition in principle for the establishment of a customs-free airport.  At a number of meetings of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation at Montreal, our representatives also took the initiative in defining the requirements for a customs-free airport, and participated in the work of a special division which was set up by that organisation to consider that matter and other measures for facilitating international air services.</P>
    <P>Having secured international agreement for the concept and requirements of a customs-free airport, we proceeded to make specific plans for the Shannon and this Bill is designed to put those plans into action.  It provides that goods and passengers in transit through Shannon Airport will not be subject to customs examination.  Goods brought by aeroplane through Shannon will be free from all customs restrictions so long as they remain within the boundary of the free airport.  There will be no customs officials within the airport, and compliance with any regulations that may still remain in force will be secured, not by officers of the Customs and Excise, but by officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>There will have to be some restrictions in force.  As Senators know, the staff of the Revenue Commissioners enforce restrictions other than customs restrictions at airports, seaports and land frontiers, such as the restrictions which are designed to safeguard the public health and to prevent the spread of animal and plant diseases.  There are also certain articles the importation of which is prohibited in pursuance of <Col N="842" /> international conventions to which this State is a party.  We must carry out our obligations under these conventions. There is, therefore, provision in the Bill for the making of regulations reimposing these safeguards and prohibitions at the free airport, as well as for continuing the present currency control so long as it may be necessary. The regulations to achieve that result will be made in consultation with the Ministers who are directly concerned, and compliance with the regulations at the airport will be enforced by officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce appointed for that purpose.</P>
    <P>While the establishment of a free airport confers great benefits on air travellers and those sending goods by air, it also offers opportunities and temptations to those wishing to defraud the revenue.  It is, therefore, necessary to provide for powers of search and these powers are provided in the Bill.  One of the chief difficulties experienced in framing the Bill related to internal traffic passing through the airport and to visitors at the airport.  It was not desired to impose customs examination on sightseers or on people travelling by air from Shannon to Collinstown.  The problem has been met by setting aside as a customs area a portion of the terminal building and part of the landing field adjacent to it.  There will therefore be, in a sense, two airports at Shannon, a customs airport and a free airport.  Persons travelling by air from Dublin to Shannon airport will disembark in the customs area and will not have to undergo customs examination unless they wish to enter the free airport to join an aircraft for a foreign destination.  Visitors coming to the airport as sightseers or to meet their friends arriving by air will be permitted to enter the customs area without examination.  The accommodation in the customs area will include a lounge, a restaurant and an open space from which the operations can be seen. In order to prevent possible evasion of customs it will be necessary to segregate transit passengers from disembarking passengers and from local visitors.  The confining of visitors and disembarking passengers to the customs <Col N="843" /> area will achieve that purpose.  It will, of course, be possible to make special arrangements for persons who have particular business in the free port area to pass from one section to another.</P>
    <P>Passengers or goods entering or leaving Ireland via Shannon will pass through the customs as at present.  As goods may be brought free of duty into the customs-free airport from abroad and stored there, it will be of advantage to commercial interests to set up depots at the airport from which delivery made be made by air to meet orders from any countries in Europe or North America which have direct communication with Shannon.  To facilitate such a development, a suitable transit shed is being constructed at the free airport.  It is hoped that some manufacturers may find it desirable to undertake within the free airport the packing, processing and rehandling of goods.  Any development on these lines will be facilitated.  Already there is a fair amount of freight passing through Shannon, although it is yet difficult to forecast the prospects of the carriage of freight by air.</P>
    <P>Our aim is to be ready to cope with any developments that may occur.  As I have said, Shannon Airport is equipped to take the largest aircraft at present engaged in freight service or that are likely to be engaged in the service in the immediate future.  The developments which are contemplated there will ensure that it will be able to cater for any type of cargo aircraft that is likely to be employed on the transatlantic service.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill that is, to some extent, experimental.  There is no similar legislation in any other country and, consequently, we are submitting it to the Oireachtas in the clear knowledge that in the light of its experience some of its provisions may have to be modified. The problems which arose in the drafting of the Bill were not inconsiderable and they have been surmounted only because of the general desire to help it forward shown by all parties concerned.  I should like particularly to say that all the airline <Col N="844" /> companies operating through Shannon have been most helpful in working out a satisfactory scheme.  When the Bill is passed, we shall have secured that air traffic passing through Shannon will be relieved of most of the restrictions which air travellers all over the world are desirous of having relaxed.  It is, therefore, I think a very necessary step in the general policy of developing Shannon as a main transatlantic airport and for that reason I feel confident that the Oireachtas will pass the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, this is a Bill to which I give my unqualified support.  The Minister says that it is an experimental measure and that he does not know how exactly it will work out.  That being so, obviously I am not going to pretend that I know how it is going to work out.  I suppose it must be 20 years ago or more since I made an effort to persuade some people that a customs-free port in Ireland would be of very considerable advantage to the country and that it might contribute a considerable amount in the way of shipping to the business of the country.  I quote that because, whether the idea was good or bad, it appealed to me as one that could be of very considerable value to this country. A small country can achieve prosperity only by giving facilities and services to other countries from whom it obtains a very considerable amount of assistance. I very much hope that this scheme will be a success and I also hope that it will lead to the granting of facilities for the storage of a very large number of articles which Europe and the world needs and which we also need.  If they could be stored somewhere in this country, they would be of very considerable advantage to our manufacturers.  Of course, we know it will not be done for that purpose alone; it will be done only if it is of advantage also to other countries.  This is not a Bill which we can usefully criticise because we know very little about the system which it proposes to initiate. Although we may have some experience of free ports, we have no experience of free airports.  The Minister, however, has established a sufficiently strong case <Col N="845" /> for the experiment and I am strongly in favour of the principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I am very glad to see this Bill, although I have still the same doubt I expressed earlier when the Harbours Bill was before the House as to the advantages of a free port over the other form of control which has been adopted now, I think, in most countries of Europe, that is to say, the transit shed, the drawbacks and all those things which are associated in the shipping world with the development of a mercantile marine. Actually, the idea of a free port for shipping purposes was considered in England many years ago, but nothing ever came of it.  Subsequently, it was adopted by other countries, but one by one they abandoned the idea of a free port and set up instead transit sheds, custom houses and all the other paraphernalia associated with the shipping world.</P>
      <P>I agree at once that there is a distinction between a free airport and a shipping port.  I wonder whether the distinction is so great as to suggest an advantage in the establishment of a free port, unless it is intended that industry and commerce will operate within the free port.  If the port is to be used merely for the handling of goods, the unshipping and reshipping of goods within the port, then all the facilities which are required would be available in the transit shed without the difficulties which are going to be created by the establishment of a free port.  Let us bear in mind that there will be a wall, so to speak, erected round this free port.  It is foreign territory in the fiscal sense, so far as we are concerned, and there is bound to be interference with the people entering and leaving it, people who break their journey at Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, therefore, wondering whether there is a case for the free airport unless the Minister is satisfied that industrialists will find it desirable to establish certain industrial plant there, or that commercial firms will consider it desirable to have warehouses within the territory of the airport.  If that development were to take place, it is obvious that there must be a free airport <Col N="846" /> of rather large dimensions in contradistinction to the bonded warehouse and the transit shed which serve their purpose in territory in which no manufacturing or commercial processes take place.</P>
    <P>My next point is that this is a Revenue Bill.  I am wondering, therefore, why it should be presented to the House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The officers who will operate under it will, in fact, be doing the work of the Revenue Commissioners and not work proper to the Department of Industry and Commerce. Provision is made in the Bill for conferring upon those officers all the functions of revenue officers.  Why not use the term &ldquo;revenue officers&rdquo; in the Bill?  In looking up this matter I find that in the legislation of most countries the officer who, for instance, enforces the Aliens Act regulations is a revenue officer, and that the officer in most ports who enforces the public health laws is a revenue officer.  I am just wondering whether there is some special reason here why the officers to be engaged in administering this measure, in relation to a free port, should be officers not of the Revenue Commissioners or of the Department of Finance but of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I take it that people will be leaving this port in large numbers.  The work people engaged in operating the port will be leaving its frontiers every day, and probably two or three times a day. Who is going to do the search in their case, because the people leaving the confines of the free airport will be liable to search?  Is that search to be carried out by a revenue officer, or an official of the Department of Industry and Commerce, or a member of the Gardaí?  These considerations suggest to me that there must be some reason for presenting the Bill in this manner, a reason that has not been explained so far to either House.  It seems to me that it is one that we should understand more fully before we subscribe to a provision which transfers the functions of the Revenue Commissioners and of the officials of that Department and of the Department <Col N="847" /> of Finance to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Questions will arise within the airport in relation to the importation of goods where that importation is prohibited by law.  There will also be cases in which goods will be imported in excess of permitted quantities &mdash; that is to say where we have a quota system. Under that system we are entitled to import, say, so many gross of gramophone needles, but double the authorised quantity arrives at the airport. I want to know what happens then.  Bear in mind that the importation does not take place until the goods leave the free airport.  As I understand the Bill, the importation is assumed to take place only after the goods cross the frontier of the free airport and enter the domain of this country because the free airport is foreign territory in the fiscal sense. There is no provision in the Bill for dealing with the two cases that I have mentioned.  Goods, say, are imported in excess of the permitted quantity. What happens?  They are presented at the barrier for importation into this country.  If they are refused, do they lie at the airport and, if so, under whose control?  Is the importer, if he lives in Dublin or Cork, to be called up to deal with them?  If there is no means of storing the goods at the airport, what happens?  Likewise, what happens in the case of the importation of explosives?  Their importation is prohibited by law.  Assuming that explosives are carried to the barrier for importation to this country, what exactly happens?  The Bill gives no clear picture of what the situation is going to be like when the free airport is established.</P>
    <P>I am not offering these criticisms for the purpose of finding fault with the idea behind the Bill.  I am anxious that the Bill should provide for this country what it sets out to provide: that is to say, that it will offer greater facilities than are available now in this or any other country to the free flow of goods through the airport, and to the free movement of passengers using the air services passing through Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> I am, therefore, anxious to raise this point that it may be considered. The Minister may indeed have dealt with these points in some way that escaped my notice.  If he has dealt with them that is the end of the matter.  There is only one other matter to which I want to refer.  I have no means of knowing the minds of the people using transatlantic airlines, but I have been reading the views of people who profess to know something about this matter and I gathered from what I read that Foynes is likely to be used for the transport of goods as well as Rineanna.  I take it the free airport will be Rineanna.  I do not know whether this point has been considered or not, namely, whether provision will be made to deal with the transit of goods passing through Rineanna for European countries as well as dealing with what may pass through Foynes. Beyond raising this point I have nothing to say except that I welcome the Bill and believe that this House should facilitate its enactment as rapidly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The official name of the airport is Shannon Airport.  Shannon Airport includes not merely the landing field at Rineanna and the flying boat base adjacent thereto but the flying boat facilities at Foynes.  It was never intended that it should be called Rineanna.  It was, I think, newspaper reporters who discovered that Rineanna was the name of the place and they popularised it.  It was never my intention that the airport should be called anything but Shannon Airport and that, in fact, is the official title.  The purport of the observations of Senator Duffy in regard to the Bill is not quite clear.  So far as the first of his points is concerned, I cannot attempt to forecast the extent to which industrialists may use the free airport facilities for the purposes of processing goods for re-export.  If any such development should appear likely we will be glad to facilitate it.  Primarily the establishment of the free airport is designed to facilitate the transit traffic in passengers and goods.  Shannon Airport is primarily a transit airport.  The bulk of the traffic is going on to other destinations.  On this account it is desirable that we should facilitate this traffic by the removal of customs and other regulations.</P>
      <P>If there should develop in consequence of the existence of free port facilities a type of industrial processing such as is associated with free seaports &mdash;well, that will be all to the good. But even if we do not ultimately have such a development I think it would be still well worth while enacting this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> There will be no customs officers in the free airport.  To the extent that officers of the customs and excise perform duties other than revenue duties, such as enforcing public health Acts or supervising the imports of plants and animals that might bring infectious diseases, or other restrictions of that character, these restrictions, in so far as it is considered essential to keep them in force, will be made effective by officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The customs officers will be on the perimeter of the airport and movement in and out of the airport of goods and passengers will be supervised in precisely the same way as movement across the land frontier.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy asked about the possibility of goods being brought to the perimeter of the airport for import which would not be allowed in.  That may happen.  It happens regularly at the land frontier and the method of administration which the Revenue Commissioners will follow will be modelled on the practice at the land frontier. We would have preferred that all these restrictions on traffic should be removed but it will be clear that while we can go a great distance in freeing traffic from customs formalities and similar restrictions, the bugs that might bring infectious disease or affect plant life would not respect our regulations, and the restrictions which are necessary at seaports will be equally necessary even at a free airport.</P>
    <P>Similarly we could not claim to have fulfilled our obligations under international conventions regarding certain articles if we permitted them to be imported into the country, even into a free port and, consequently, we must have officers on the spot who will ensure that our international obligations are carried out, within the free airport area.</P>
    <P>But all the restrictions which are removed by this Bill will be re-enforced only to the extent which experience shows to be necessary to protect our own interests or fulfil our international obligations.  The revenue officers will be outside the airport and will be conducting their duties there in precisely <Col N="851" /> the same way as on the land frontier. Let me make it clear that beside the custom-free airport there will be a customs-airport and visitors coming to see the airport and to meet friends arriving from across the Atlantic will not ordinarily enter the free port at all.  They will go through into the customs port and will not be liable to customs examination unless they, for any reason, want to enter the free port.  Normally they will be only allowed to enter the free port if they are themselves travelling to some destination outside the country or for some special reason.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in respect of which powers have to be retained for the Revenue Commissioners in administering the airport.  In some free ports all dutiable goods are sold duty free.  We did not regard that as a desirable position at Shannon and, consequently, no goods can be imported into the airport for sale in the airport, nor can any goods be sold in the airport that have not previously been imported into this country and customs duty paid on them.  That will mean that such goods as whiskey and cigarettes will not be sold cheaper inside the airport than outside it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A provision prevents the sale of goods brought into the airport otherwise than across the perimeter of the airport.  Section 6 of the Bill so provides.  That particular section of the Bill might be worth reconsidering after a while.  At one time it was suggested there might be an advantage in permitting the sale of perfumes and certain other commodities of that kind which are subject to duty at the airport and permitting the goods to be brought in there and purchased by people in transit and taken out again.  I would not like to agree to such a provision until we see precisely how it works out.  Clearly in the present circumstances you could not have a situation in which our whiskey and cigarettes would be sold at cheaper prices inside the airport <Col N="852" /> than outside it.  I do not think the traders in Limerick would do very much business and if we were to try to keep people out of the customs-free airport the risk of smuggling would be very great and the difficulties of administration increased.  I think the safest course is to ensure that within the airport area, goods which are subject to duty will not be allowed to be sold except that duty has been paid on them.  At some future date we might reconsider that decision.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhí an Bille um Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Atha Cliath os comhair an Oireachtais roinnt blian ó shoin, míníodh gurbh é cuspóir a bhí leis ná rannóg eile a chur le foirgneamh oideachais na tíre ionnas go bhféadfaimis ár gcion a dhéanamh chun cúrsaí léinn a chur chun cinn.  Bunaíodh an Institiúid chun go bhféadfaí Ardstaidéar agus taighde a dhéanamh i mbrainsí speisialta eolais trí bhíthin comhscoileanna de na brainsí éagsúla. Soláthraíodh an fráma chuige sin &mdash; an comhlucht corparáideach, Comhairle na hInstitiúide, i mbun rialuithe is riaracháin ghinearálta, agus comh scoileanna a raibh a bhord rialúcháin féin ag gach ceann acu i mbun obair speisialta na scoile sin ar leith.  Bunaíodh dhá scoil mar thús oibre, Scoil an Léinn Cheiltigh agus Scoil na Fisice Teoiriciúla. Do léiríodh an uair sin ná raibh sa dá scoil sin dar linn ach sompla ar an eagar a measadh a cuirfí ar an Institiúid do réir mar fhásfadh sí ar ball. Rinneadh socrú chun comh scoileanna <Col N="853" /> eile a bhunú dá gceapfadh an Rialtas go mbeadh sé sin inmholta.  Tá beartaithe ag an Rialtas anois gurab é an leas poiblí comh scoil eile a bhunú, Scoil na Fisice Cosmaí, agus do réir Mír 4 (2) den Acht um Institiúid Ard-Léinn, 1940, ní foláir toiliú an tSeanaid d'fháil i bhfoirm rúin sar a mbunaítear an Nua-Scoil seo.</P>
      <P>Ach a rithidh an Dáil agus an tSeanaid rúin toilithe déanfaidh an Rialtas Ordú Bunúcháin.  Leanfaidh an tOrdú sin sompla ginearálta na nOrdú a rinneadh cheana lenar bunaíodh Scoil an Léinn Cheiltigh agus Scoil na Fisice Teoiriciúla.  Beidh sé d'fheidhm agus de dhualgas ar an Scoil scúdú teoiriciúil agus scrúdú trialach a dhéanamh ar fhadhbanna na fisice cosmaí, agus na hastrofisice, gaethe cosmacha, geoifisic, meteoraíocht agus muir-eolaiocht d'áireamh; toradh an scrúduithe sin do chur i bhfeidhm más féidir é, ar fhadhbanna na heconomaíochta náisiúnta; nótaí geoifisiceacha Éireannacha do bhailiú, do scrúdú, agus más inmholta é, iad d'fhoilsiú, sa mhéid nach a ndéantar soláthar trí sheirbhís Stáit chun a leithéid do dhéanamh; mic léinn árd-chúrsa d'oiliúint i modhanna taighde bhunuil; agus comhoibriú i dtaighde institiúidí thar lear.  Tá socair Teach Faireacháin Dunsink a chur ar fáil don.  Institiúid le haghaidh na NuaScoile agus sa chás sin féachfar chuige go dtabharfaidh Bord Rialúcháin na Scoile cead isteach chun foirgintí, úirlisí agus leabharlann an Teach Faireacháin do bhaill faoime acadamhúla agus do mhic léinn Choláiste na Trionóide Bhaile Atha Cliath agus Choláiste Ollscoile, Bhaile Atha Cliath le haghaidh a gcuid staidéir réalteolaíochta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh an t-eagar céanna ar an Nua-Scoil agus atá ar na scoileanna atá ann cheana.  Beidh Bord Rialúcháin ina bun ar a mbeidh Cathaoirleach, na hollamhain sinsearacha agus roinnt ball a ceapfar ná beidh a n-uimhir faoi bhun uimhir na nollamhan sinsearach. An tUachtarán a cheapfas iad uile ar chomhairle an Rialtais.  Ceapfaidh an Bord Rialúcháin duine de na hollamhain sinsearacha ina Stiúrthóir ar an Scoil.  Beidh na coinníollacha <Col N="854" /> maidir le ceapadh, sealbhaíocht oifige agus cur as oifig ball an Bhuird, an Stiúrthóra, na nollamhan sin searach agus na foirne acadamhúla, agus maidir le stiúrú coiteann gnótha na Scoile ar aon dul leis na coinníollacha a bhaineas leis an dá scoil atá ann.  Ceaptar go bhféadfar triúr eolaí den aicme is aoirde cáil d'fháil le na gceapadh ina nollamhna sinsearacha sa Nua-Scoil chomh luath agus a bheas sí bunaithe.</P>
    <P>Níor cheart a cheapadh gur eolaíocht í eolaíocht na Fisice Cosmaí a bhaineas le habhair acadúla i bhfad ó ghnáthshaol na ndaoine agus ná cuireann éinne suim iontu ach na heolaithe sin atá ar tosach na cine daonna ag iarraidh teacht ar an bhfírinne.  Ní mar sin atá.  Is beag brainse eolaíochta atá chomh luachmhar do shaol náisiúin leis an bhFisic Chosmaigh, fiú an toradh teoiriciúil, is féidir feidhm phraiticiúil a bhaint as go luath.  Is féidir a rá go ginearálta go bhfuil dhá roinn mhóra sa Fisic Chosmaigh, Geoifisic agus Astrofisic.  Baineann Geofisic le próiseasaí fisiceacha na talún ar a mairimid, na mara atá timpeall orainn agus an aeir atá inar dtimpeall agus os ár gcionn.</P>
    <P>Roinntear an Geoifisic, Fisic an Domhain, ina trí ranna de ghnáth: fisic na talún ar a dtugtar Geoifisic (sa chéill chumhaing den fhocal), fisic na Mór-Fhairrgí ar a dtugtar Muireolaíocht agus Fisic na ngás, ar a dtugtar meteoiraíocht.  Baineann an Gheoifisic, sa chéill chumhaing den fhocal, le constitiúid, gluaiseacht, teocht agus Tarraing na Talún; le Seismicí, Adhmainteas na Talún Eleictreachas na Talmhan agus Radio-ghníomhacht. Baineann Muireolaíocht le hairdheana fisiceacha na bhfairrge, le cuilithe mara, le tonna agus le taifeach agus réimhinsin na dtaoide.  Baineann meteoraíocht le cumasc agus le próiseasaí fisiceacha an atmosféara agus le haimsir agus aoráid.</P>
    <P>Tá dlúbhaint ag na cúrsaí sin le feabhsú an tsaoil.  Chun é rá go simplí, sé aidhm na Fisice Cosmaí gach uile eolas a chur ar an domhan seo againn agus an t-eolas sin do chur chun leasa saol an chine daonna.  Beidh sé de dhualgas ar an Nua-Scoil seo a bheith páirteach san tóraíocht sin an eolais, agus a mheas cé an chaoi ab fhearr <Col N="855" /> chun a bhfuil d'eolas faighte cheana agus chun a bhfaghfar fós de le cúnamh Dé, a chur chun tairbhe d'ár muintir féin.</P>
    <P>Tá fás mór faoin eolaíocht sin le céad bliain anuas.  Agus is iomdha slí in ar chabhraigh an fás sin go mór agus go tábhachtach le saol an chine daonna i gcúrsaí leighis, tionscail, tráchtála agus talmhaíochta.  Tá an eolaíocht sin chomh hóg sin fós agus oiread sin mór-shaothair le déanamh nach féidir a rá roimh ré céard iad na fionnachtana atá rómhainn ná cén tairbhe d'fhéadfaí a bhaint astu dár muintir féin.  Tá rud amháin cinnte, áfach: má bhraithimid an chumhacht atá ag an Eolaíocht ar chúrsaí daonna, tuigfimid gurab é leas an náisiúin a bheith páirteach le náisiúin síbhialta an comhain i gcomhthaighde an eolais.  Tá brainsí áirithe taighde as ár raon ar fad, mar chosnóidís an iomarca chun gléasanna agus foirne do chur ar fáil. Ach sa brainse seo na Fisice Cosmaí, féadfaimid súil a bheith againn go gcoinneoimíd suas le gluaiseacht an eolais i gcoitinne agus go mbeimid páirteach inti ar chostas réasúnta íseal.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar déanta le haghaidh slí do bhrainsí éagsúla na scoile nua i mBaile Atha Cliath agus Dunsink.  Tá an Rialtas tar éis Teach Faireacháin Dunsink d'fháil agus tá beartaithe é chur ar fáil chun úsáide ag an Scoil Nua.  Is cosúil go gcaithfear roinnt atharú a chur ar an Tigh Faireacháin, á chur in oiriúint don obair nua agus ag soláthar breis feisteas teicniciúil. Ach ó caithfear an t-ullmhú sin a dhéanamh faoi stiúrú Buird Rialúcháin na Scoile, ná féadfar a cheapadh nó go mbeidh an Scoil ar bun, tuigfear nach féidir an costas do mheas go cruinn fós.  Chomh fada agus is féidir a fheiceál roimh ré, ba cheart gur leor £15,000 mar bhun-chostas tosaigh agus tuairim is £9,000 mar chostas bliantúil ina dhiaidh sin, agus costas riaracháin do chur san áireamh.</P>

      <P>This is a motion for setting up another school in the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies. It should be said in the beginning that nobody can have any objection to our engaging, even though we are a small country, in reasonable research and in international co-operation with regard to the advancement of scientific knowledge for the improvement of the world generally and, if possible, for the improvement of our own particular circumstances as well.  I might perhaps advert, without quoting, to the debate on the setting up of the Institute for Advanced Studies in 1940.  I indicated then &mdash; and this particular motion proves that I was quite right &mdash; that the institute was not merely to help Celtic studies or to advance theoretical physics but that what was happening under the Bill setting up the institute was that we were erecting a new educational superstructure, with new overhead costs, with Civil Service control, and with ample opportunities for Parliamentary debate and so on.  When that kind of thing starts, it always keeps on growing and this is an example of the growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question that strikes one is that this matter can be divided into two parts about one of which every one of us who has given any thought to the matter at all would be in agreement. Dunsink Observatory is a necessary part of our equipment and I think it is work which requires to be done.  It requires to be done all the year round. It requires to be done day and night and very considerable argument can be <Col N="858" /> made for making that a Government service, a Government service which will be connected up with the other meteorological services, with our air service and perhaps with our Army. It would have a position analogous in certain directions to that of the Ordnance Survey which carries out many duties for, and which is very closely connected with, the military. Now on the other hand, apart from Dunsink which might reasonably be taken over as a Government institution and run by the Government, there is the School of Cosmic Physics.  In spite of the Minister's explanation I am not very clear about the precise limitations of the words &ldquo;cosmic physics.&rdquo;  Indeed the word &ldquo;cosmic&rdquo; implies that there are no limitations of any kind whatever but I am not sure that astronomy is included in cosmic physics although it is a very old science.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In cosmic physics there are two divisions, one theoretical and the other practical.  The theoretical part requires no apparatus.  I wonder is the Minister right in saying that the only apparatus required for cosmic physics will cost no more than £500?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the annual cost apart from Dunsink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if that is so? I wonder if any practical work at all can be done for such an insignificant sum as that?  This new school must start from scratch.  It must create and equip a laboratory.  One wonders what the equipment is, where it can be obtained, what its nature is, what its cost and maintenance will be?  What strikes me in this respect, as it struck me in the case of the School of Celtic Studies, is whether this work could not be connected with one or other of the university colleges or even with Trinity College.  The answer given in part by the Taoiseach when we were discussing the Bill was that there were jealousies between the university colleges and between the two universities. I think that can be very much overrated and overstated.  As a matter of fact, certain work is at present divided <Col N="859" /> between them.  We must remember that the overhead expense of establishing a new research department in a university is very small by contrast with the cost of setting up Civil Service machinery to administer a service of this kind.  For example, at the present moment you have a certain division of functions between the university colleges and even between the universities. You have the Dairy Science Faculty in Cork and the General Agricultural Faculty in Dublin.  These are quite separate.  You cannot do General Agriculture in either of the university colleges in Cork or Galway.  You must do it in Dublin.  You cannot do Dairy Science in Dublin; you must do it in Cork.  Again you cannot complete Mechanical Engineering in Trinity; you must go to the College of Science which has been transferred to University College in Dublin.  One of the conditions attached by the Government who was responsible for the transfer of the College of Science to University College in Dublin, was that the students of Trinity College must get facilities to do Mechanical Engineering there.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, it is interesting to place on record that the professors, lecturers, demonstrators and students from Trinity College and University College are working, as far as I know &mdash;and it is not my bailiwick&mdash;without any friction whatsoever, working satisfactorily, in the College of Science.  It could be argued that you could not possibly supply in duplicate all the machinery necessary to do mechanical engineering for the number of students in Trinity College or in University College.  For that reason, one wonders why this particular research department could not be set up in one of the university colleges.  It might be argued&mdash;I think it is an entirely false argument&mdash;that research must be divorced from university work and university teaching.  As a matter of fact, unless I am greatly mistaken, the best English advances in cosmic ray researches have been achieved by a professor in Manchester University, named Blackett.  I remember seeing him at University College some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> He is a working professor of experimental physics in an English university and, at the same time, was able to make discoveries in the cosmic ray.  It seems to me that there is some forgetfulness of that, and that the notion that research is something which has to be divorced from the universities and from university teaching&mdash;and from the university atmosphere which is an important thing&mdash;is a new and a wrong idea. Of course, with the development of atomic power, Governments may set up special departments now to make discoveries for military purposes, but it must be remembered about this, as about industrial research, that ultimately all this kind of research is based upon pure scientific research the training for which must be obtained in the universities.</P>
    <P>It would have been true up to a few days ago to say that that kind of research is starved&mdash;and so is medical research starved&mdash;in the universities. There is going to be now a better arrangement about that, but the only way in which we can provide ourselves with scientists who can do honour to our name and bring benefits to the country is by the encouragement of scientific research in the universities and in university laboratories.  I think the Minister will agree that there is no other method.  As we are at present, foreigners will have, I think, to be brought in to do this work.  One wonders whether, that being so, Irishmen will get the training that they deserve, and would certainly get in a university if the same provision were made in it.  One wonders whether arrangements will be made to impart the necessary knowledge to Irishmen to enable them to go ahead with that kind of work.  One wonders also whether we should not take first things first: whether this particular development should not be preceded by a more liberal endowment, and with the experience of several years of that liberal endowment of pure research in the universities in, for example, experimental and theoretical physics, particularly experimental physics and in medicine also.</P>
    <P>We have a great habit of not putting first things first.  We have the situation in which the Minister makes a speech <Col N="861" /> this evening in Irish on cosmic physics while two weeks ago a Blasket islander died on an island off the coast because there is no telephone sufficiently good to reach the island so that no boat, and no priest or doctor reaches it.  One wonders whether that sort of thing should not be remedied before we proceed with a more elaborate but a less fruitful and less profitable operation.</P>
    <P>This is a motion for extending the scope of the Institute of Advanced Studies.  It involves an extension of State activities, and a new burden on an already overstrained and sprawling Civil Service.  I say that without making any reflection on civil servants. There is a great deal of work which they have been called upon to do which they are not fitted to do.  The supervision of research of this particular type, and even the administration of this research&mdash;I doubt if that is a suitable job for the Civil Service which is already over-burdened.  It also imposes new responsibilities in detail upon Ministers.  It also burdens us with new and unascertainable costs.  The cost of Dunsink Observatory could, I think, be measured and predicted, but I doubt whether the cost of research in cosmic physics, in relation to all the matters which the Minister mentioned, is measurable, and whether any real estimate can be given as to what all this is going to cost in two or three years' time.</P>
    <P>There is no proof whatever that a suitable endowment to the universities or to university colleges would not produce better results in the long run than the setting up of this body for the carrying out of research.  It adds, as I said in the beginning, a superstructure to our educational edifice, and I doubt very much that it is necessary.  While I have no objection to the motion, and while I have no doubt it will be passed, I do think that a good deal of this work could be done here in the universities, just as it has been done in England and elsewhere in the universities, had the money, the laboratories and the building facilities been provided.  If the facilities can be afforded for the Institute of Advanced Studies, then obviously they could be afforded to the <Col N="862" /> universities, and if they were, the overhead costs would be very much less and the atmosphere itself for the prosecution of the work might, in fact, be a better atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The fact that in research we ought to have international contacts is admitted.  Could we not have these international contacts just as well within the universities?  This is another example, as I say, of added responsibility by the State which, Heaven knows, has undertaken too many responsibilities already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to give my blessing to the general purpose of this motion.  At the same time, I must say that if I thought it would have the effect of in any way impairing the quality or the volume of the research which is being done and which will continue to be done in the two universities I, for one, would not be sympathetic to it.  I think there is room for research and more research in the universities on many different subjects.  It will be an ill day for the universities if ever the spirit of research disappears from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain kinds of research which involve a great deal of time and study and which do not necessarily produce tangible results, but yet may eventually produce results of the greatest importance, which must be done by means of a special institute and which, I think, are not quite proper for the work of a university.  Therefore, I think there is a case for a special State-endowed institution to facilitate research of this highly abstruse and highly difficult kind which is not intimately associated with the teaching duties of professors anywhere, but nevertheless might, in due course, produce results that would be gladly absorbed in the various universities. While the Institute for Advanced Studies is a thing apart, it is also closely associated with the two universities. I must say that our experience of the institute&mdash;I am sure it is also the experience of the other university &mdash;has been an entirely happy one.  It plays a useful part.  One of its most valuable functions is that it does provide a common meeting place for the <Col N="863" /> experts of the two universities in which they can pursue matters in which they are interested with the minimum of overlapping and certainly with no friction.</P>
    <P>There is an Irish saying: &ldquo;Do chun gloire De agus onora na hÉireann.&rdquo; It is a phrase that is entirely characteristic of the Irish outlook and that is entirely creditable to the Irish national character.  It is to the honour of Ireland that it should create and foster institutions for the study of cosmic physics and of astronomy which is part of cosmic physics.  We have the highest authority for saying that the heavens declared the glory of God and the firmament showeth His handiwork. While we should always keep our feet firmly planted on the ground, nevertheless I think it is also appropriate that we should have our heads in the clouds and even above the clouds, and that we should encourage the highest flights of the human intellect.  In such regions, highly-gifted men pursue studies with reference to which human nature is assimilated almost to the Divine, and so I am not unduly perturbed whether a particular institution gives tangible results or not.  The important thing is that it should provide facilities for the development and extension of the different kinds of human studies.  It may be useful to put this matter in some historical perspective because I think that we have come to some kind of watershed in the history of scientific studies and I hope that Dunsink which has a great historical past will have just as great a future.  Dunsink was established as an observatory by Provost Andrews who was provost from 1758 to 1774.  He was a very interesting type of person.  He was not only a wit but a politician, a person interested in the arts and an admirer of the famous actress Peg Woffington.</P>
    <P>He was good company at dinner and had certain interests in architecture, in fact, the characteristic appearance of College Green owes everything to Provost Andrews' taste.  This reminds us of the debt we owe to history.  He died in 1774 leaving £3,000 and certain lands at Dunsink for the building of an <Col N="864" /> observatory.  The observatory was built between 1782 and 1786 in one of the very best times of 18th-century architecture. This building in some ways bears comparison with Arus an Uachtaráin. It is a most noble building set in beautiful rural surroundings and its passing into the ownership of the State is something we should regard as a matter of considerable national importance. This observatory had a long and even brilliant history as part and parcel of our activities in Trinity College, Dublin.  Of course, the greatest and most outstanding name connected with it is that of Sir William Rowan Hamilton and I would like for the purpose of having it on the records of the House to give some information about him.  On the resignation of John Brinkley in 1826 he was succeeded by a lad who at 17 years of age had paid him a visit bearing with him two mathematical papers entitled &ldquo;Osculating Parabola to Curves of Double Curvature&rdquo; and &ldquo;On Contacts between Algebraic Curves and Surfaces&rdquo;.  At 22 years of age William Rowan Hamilton, still an undergraduate, was elected to the chair and at once gave himself to that series of profound researches which culminated in the discovery of the system of quaternions, and place him among the greatest mathematicians of any age or country.  The marvellous genius of Hamilton in the realm of abstract science was combined with a singular personal charm and with a deep love and considerable aptitude for poetry.  He became the friend not only of men like Herschel and De Morgan, but of Coleridge and Wordsworth, and was visited by the latter poet at Dunsink where a shady avenue still bears his name.</P>
    <P>Before Hamilton's death, the present magnificent equatorial, with its 12 inch object glass, was erected, and an equally fine meridian circle was added in 1873, during the tenure of the chair by his successor, Dr. Francis Brunnow. There were other famous names connected with Dunsink, but this is of outstanding importance.  Senators will remember that in 1943 Hamilton's discoveries were celebrated by the issue of a special postage stamp.  Astronomer royals succeeded one another at Dunsink right down to 1921.  I remember <Col N="865" /> personally the last one, Professor H. C. Plummer.  He left us in 1921.  At this time, after the first World War, a situation had come into existence in which it was financially impossible for Trinity College, Dublin, to continue the study of astronomy in the way that modern conditions required.  The equipment required a certain amount of modernisation and we had not the money. Consequently, for a decade or two we had Dunsink, but not an astronomer royal, and we were not happy about the position.  We felt that we could not adequately maintain and equip it for its original object.  This situation, which was quite unsatisfactory from our point of view, continued for a couple of decades, until the idea occurred to those concerned to have the observatory transferred to the institute at a valuation.  There was some difficulty about arriving at a fair price, as observatories do not come on the market every day.  From one point of view the observatory was a white elephant and worth little or nothing, but from the point of view of the racket that has been going on in property, it might have been possible to sell it for a greyhound-racing track or a cinema at £15,000 or £20,000.  The idea of selling it for such purposes was never considered by the governing body of Trinity College, Dublin, and if the idea had been suggested I am quite sure it would have been rejected out of hand.  We were conscious of our moral obligations with regard to it.  It was a happy solution to the whole problem from our point of view when it was possible to transfer Dunsink to the institute for a merely nominal consideration. We are glad that in this way the original purpose of this foundation is going to be fulfilled and under more ample auspices than we were able to provide.  I would like to emphasise that we are transferring to the State not a derelict building, and it is not a derelict building, because recently the college spent £1,000 in installing electric light and water supply.</P>
    <P>It is occupied by a tenant and it is a habitable structure.  We are not <Col N="866" /> transferring to the State a mere building. We are transferring something precious and of long standing associations in the realms of learning and culture. From one point of view it may appear that the State is gaining what we have lost.  That would be a wrong point of view for, after all, whatever we may have been in our origins, history has long since made us an organic element in the structure of the Irish nation and, therefore, the nation's gain is also our gain.  We are quite satisfied that the future of Dunsink is safe in the hands of the institute. And yet we do not part from Dunsink without a pang.  I think the poet, Wordsworth, said apropos of the fate of the Republic of Venice:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Men are we, and must grieve, when even the shade of that which once was great, has passed away.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dunsink once was great, but there is no reason in the world why, under the new and ampler auspices, it should not recover and even, perhaps, excel the limits of its former greatness and we look forward to a revival of that greatness under the new régime.</P>
    <P>I hope that the nation will fully appreciate the great significance and importance of this valuable acquisition. If I might make a suggestion, I think it would be an admirable place in which to hold public functions such as garden parties and the like, to which not only Senators and Deputies might be invited, but representatives of learned bodies from all Ireland and from neighbouring countries might also be invited on suitable occasions to grace such assemblies with their presence.  The weather at the moment does not suggest that kind of thing, but we may have a summer again and whether or not that suggestion is adopted I hope that Senators will make it their business to pay a visit to Dunsink, because it is one of the least known places in Dublin and one of the places that deserves to be best known.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have only got to say that in spite of one's mixed feelings on an occasion such as this I nevertheless wish well to the future of Dunsink under the new auspices and I say in the official language &ldquo;Bail ó Dhia ar an obair.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, as a heretic in regard to these subjects make a very few comments?  I will not keep the House long.</P>
      <P>I must confess that when I was listening to the discussion on this, I first of all threw back my mind about 16 years.  I remember coming out on one Sunday morning after having performed my duties, and hearing&mdash;it was in the month of June, 1931&mdash;certain speeches being made outside.  The theme of the speeches was that this poor little country was being run on a great and imperial scale and as well as I can recollect on that particular day &mdash;I was not at my own church, I think it was down in Kilcullen&mdash;and as well as I can recollect the speech being made in that by-election was by Deputy Derrig.  We have travelled a long way from that to 1947 and it appears to me that if ever there was a case of considering whether we want to run this island on an imperial scale or on a scale according to its size and wealth that this is one.</P>
      <P>There are, as Senator Hayes pointed out, two very definite and distinct aspects of this situation.  There is the aspect of the Dunsink Observatory, the only aspect which was dealt with by Senator Professor Johnston, and I might point out, perhaps, to the Senator that everything he said stressed the case that was made by Senator Hayes.  Everything he said in talking of the glories that were Dunsink, stressed the point made by Senator Hayes that the proper method to deal with this was as an appendix to the university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Hamilton was working at Dunsink it was working with a university. Senator Professor Johnston's whole argument would have been better stressed, I would suggest, if he had drawn the point that it would have been more fitting for a grant to have been given to the university to carry on the work rather than that it should be carried on by a new Civil Service Department.  That is only one aspect. The next and the other aspect of this is what I regard as being on the imperial scale.  I believe this is a case in which we should consider first things first.  If this school that is going to be <Col N="868" /> set up is going to make any appreciable contribution, it is going to do so at tremendous cost.  If the cost is not going to be tremendous, then it is only going to tinker with the subject and it would be far better that the cost of tinkering would be given to some university.</P>
    <P>An Tánaiste is very fond, when there are discussions here about social services, children's allowances and so forth, of referring the matter to allowances that are paid in other countries and of calling on us to remember the size and the wealth of our country in comparison with the wealth and size of Great Britain.  It appears that his advice in this respect would have been better heeded by the Government in this suggestion of opening a new Department of the Civil Service.  I must confess quite frankly that I see in regard to the School of Cosmic Physics, no advantage that can be gained to us that would not be gained a thousand times more if the money that is being spent on this were allocated where it is so badly needed&mdash; to the funds for medical research, which would be of some use to common humanity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a pity that there has not been some little propaganda among the people regarding this cosmic physics.  In the local and other papers I have seen letters from time to time which indicate, in the first place, that people do not understand what cosmic physics means; and, in the second place, they do not seem to realise the cost of this development could be described as infinitesimal compared with expenditure in other directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was looking through the National Income Return recently and I find there the expenditure for 1944&mdash;that is the latest I have available&mdash;on tobacco and drink, amounted to £35.4 million: on amusements the expenditure was £2.9 million, practically £3,000,000.  While I must confess I am not quite sure of the estimated total expenditure I understand it is estimated&mdash;the annual expenditure&mdash;at round about £9,000.  £9,000 out of a total expenditure such as I have <Col N="869" /> quoted is after all a comparatively small sum.  As far as I am concerned I intend to support the development of this subject.  I am not going to enter into the merits of the School of Advanced Studies as compared with the universities.  There is, I am aware, a very big volume of opinion in the country which thinks that the university would be the proper place for this and other studies.  One thing that could be said in favour of the university is that the professors who undertake research work would be more closely in touch with their students than those engaged in the School of Advanced Studies.  That could be said in favour of the university. On that aspect of the matter, I shall not say more.  I should like, however, to make a couple of points in favour of the subject from a purely educational standpoint.  Influenced by a number of enthusiasts here in Dublin who are members of the Dublin Astronomical Society, I arranged some lectures on astronomy down in Tipperary.  One of the leaders of the movement here was good enough to give those lectures. What surprised me most was the wonderful interest taken by the people in such lectures.  The subject seemed very remote from their ordinary life.  They were lifted up in the heavens as it were studying the motions of the planets and the stars, but country people even from the most remote areas took a very great interest in the lectures.  On looking into the matter more fully, I found that we had been merely linking up with something that had been in existence practically a century ago.</P>
    <P>A parish priest from near Clonmel gave me a manuscript some time ago which had been written in a hedge school about four or five miles from the town.  The remarkable thing about the notes kept by the student were the wonderful diagrams indicating a very perfect notion of planetary motions of a complex character.  He was able to calculate the Golden Number, the Epact and other quantities of that kind, which the majority of people at the present day know little about.  There was an old tradition there and I <Col N="870" /> began to wonder whether that tradition might be in any way linked with Dunsink Observatory, which had been established some time before.</P>
    <P>I am looking forward then to a time when, as a result of the development of this School of Cosmic Physics, a similar interest will be developed throughout the country, particularly in the rural areas.  The rural areas are being depopulated, according to the statistics, and we must all agree that there is a tremendous change as regards the population.  The people are drifting towards the towns.  I submit that anything that can add interest to rural life will help to stem that movement, to some degree, at least.  If we could revive the old interest in this rather remote subject of astronomy, it would make one little contribution towards the movement formerly described as &ldquo;back to the land&rdquo;, but which might be more correctly described as a movement for getting people to remain on the land.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston mentioned two very eminent men associated with Dunsink&mdash;Sir William Rowan Hamilton and Mr. Brinkley, who was an 18th century astronomer.  We are all familiar with the wonderful reputation as a mathematician of Sir William Rowan Hamilton.  Before passing from him, perhaps I might mention a lesser-known person, the Earl of Ross, whose name is associated with the famous telescope.  At Ballingarry, a County Limerick man, named Baggott, ran a school and his mathematical attainments were such that he was in constant correspondence with the great French astronomer, Laplace.  That school was in existence in 1809, some time about the date of the school in the neighbourhood of Clonmel, to which I have referred. Cosmic physics has a very mysterious sound, and Senator Hayes inquired from the Minister whether astronomy could be regarded as part of it.  On looking into one of the most recent American textbooks, written by three professors attached to Princeton University&mdash;Russell, Dugan and Stewart&mdash; I find that they divide the subject of astronomy into seven different <Col N="871" /> branches.  We are immediately concerned with astrophysics and this part of the subject deals with the physical characteristics of the heavenly bodies, their brightness and spectroscopic peculiarities, their temperature and radiation, the nature and condition of their atmospheres, surfaces and interiors and all phenomena which indicate or depend upon their physical condition.  That is the particular branch of astronomy with which we appear to be concerned.  I should like the Minister to give his views regarding the other six branches of the subject named in this textbook&mdash;practical astronomy, astronomy of position, celestial mechanics, descriptive astronomy and nautical astronomy.  I think the Minister did mention something about nautical astronomy.  These are all branches of one subject, and I presume that there will be an impulse in the direction of those branches in addition to the one directly associated with cosmic physics.</P>
    <P>Listening to some recent lectures, I heard some things that rather surprised me and which would, probably, surprise some members of the House.  The density of some of the stars is so very great that even a thimbleful will weigh about two or three tons.  We find it hard to believe that but it is fairly well established.  Then, we begin to wonder how we know these things.  We must know something about cosmic physics and we must understand mathematics and something about the spectroscope before appreciating the reasons which lead to this information. Although these bodies are so very far away, it is possible to examine their condition, their temperature and their chemical composition and, in that way, we are able to keep abreast of the most modern developments in science. Since we are now merely linking up with something that had been in existence many years ago, we are not doing anything really new.  I think that this proposal is entitled to all possible support and, so far as I am concerned, I shall support it.</P>
    <P>I might, perhaps, quote from this fairly recent book by way of explanation for members who had not, perhaps, <Col N="872" /> the time to go into the matter. The book states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no sharp boundary between astronomy and other physical sciences.  It is so intimately related to physics that it is often quite impracticable to say whether a given piece of work should be regarded as belonging more to one science than to the other.  Its relation to mathematics is almost as close.  In problems concerning the formation and constitution of the earth, astronomy overlaps the field of geology.  In questions dealing with the structure of atoms, it comes in touch with chemistry.  In discussions of the length of time during which the earth has been habitable and the possible habitability of other planets, astronomy meets biology.  In the consideration of those errors of observation which are personal to the observer, it utilises principles of physiology and psychology.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not so remote from our lives as might appear at first sight.</P>
    <P>The weather is still bad and we are inclined to get a little bit depressed as a result.  Accordingly, I may be allowed to be a little facetious for the moment.  Down in Tipperary, people have been surprised that a man like Senator Quirke should attach his name to a motion such as this.  The Senator is well known to be a man who keeps close observation on the things of the earth.  As we grow older or become anxious about our health, we lift our minds heavenwards and think of charitable donations or the disposal of our property or, as it is sometimes put, increase our fire insurance.  Many people asked me what was wrong with Senator Quirke that he was beginning to act in this way.  I assured them that there was nothing wrong with Senator Quirke, that his name was attached merely to comply with the Standing Orders of this House.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of discussion on this subject. It is regarded as being something ridiculously remote from everything practical.  It is only necessary for Senators to give the matter a little attention to see that it is not by any <Col N="873" /> means so remote and that it has a practical importance for the future of this nation.  We cannot afford to be left as a sort of by-wash away from the great scientific movements of the day.  This will not cost such an immense amount of money and, even if it does, and the pressure is being felt, I would suggest that some little pressure might be put upon the people who can afford to spend such immense sums on various frivolities for which this nation is becoming famous.  For example, we have great schools of dancing going on every night.  One can scarcely pass through the streets of the city without hearing the strains of the waltz, and the same applies to country towns.  Then there are the great industries of horse-racing, dog-racing and the pictures; and on top of all this you have vast sums spent on drink and tobacco.  The expenditure involved here is really infinitesimal.  The subject is a very important one from the educational, the purely scientific and the industrial standpoint.</P>

      <P>It should not be, and it is not, necessary for anybody to urge on this House the desirability of spending such a small sum as it is anticipated will be spent on investigating the nature of things that are and in improving our knowledge of the world that is around us and venturing somewhat further into the unknown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, as has often been observed, a nation whose physical assets are small and, like other small nations, we <Col N="875" /> must seek to supply that deficiency by the greater use of our brains and our mental industry.  I think we should welcome, as I do welcome, what I consider to be the imaginative concept of this School of Higher Studies and its latest development.  Believing that it is unnecessary to say anything more in favour of the project, I shall turn to one or two of the reasons which have been urged, not so much against it as in a partial and hesitant criticism of it.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we cannot expect any great good to come out of these particular schools because modern physics are largely a matter of expensive equipment&mdash;some branches are.  Over a large area of modern physics, advance is probably not possible without a very vast expenditure of money but that does not apply to all branches.  I wonder whether this House would agree with me when I suggest that what are now regarded as commonplaces but what were at one time prime discoveries of the nature of cosmic physics, could be and were accomplished, entirely without instruments?  Would the House agree with me that perhaps the most cardinal discovery in the field of cosmic physics was the diurnal rotation of the earth and that the next most cardinal discovery was the fact that the planets and the earth went round the sun in an ellipsis yearly?  How were these facts discovered? They were discovered without a single instrument, except the human eye.  They were discovered and established in the fourth century before Christ by two Greeks and these men had no money and no expensive equipment.</P>
    <P>Turning to geophysics, one of the most elementary but still one of the most important discoveries was the fact that the earth was round and that its circumference and diameter could be measured.  Yet the measurement of the circumference and the diameter of the earth within 4 per cent. of accuracy was discovered in the third century B.C. by another Greek, Eratosthenes, merely with the aid of a sun dial and through his own observations of a deep <Col N="876" /> well.  If these epoch-making discoveries could be made by the human brain, without the aid of instruments I think we may well anticipate that when the results of physical experiments are published by all the great investigators of the world and by all the astronomers, the human brain in Ireland, working on these results will be able to make discoveries which are not less important and not less far-reaching.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested also that the immediate results of these particular lines of research may not prove of practical benefit.  If the emphasis is laid on the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;, one may be disposed to agree with that. The immediate result of the discovery of radium by Madame Curie was not its use as a potent weapon in the cure and treatment of cancer and the immediate results of the discovery of the science of bacteriology was not the revolution in medicine which has happened since. It may be taken almost as axiomatic that things which have turned out most useful in the development of human knowledge have had their origin in the discoveries of those who were stimulated by the desire to engage in research in pure knowledge and not in the work of people who were interested merely in mechanical developments which could be turned into ready cash. I think we may anticipate, however, that there will probably be a practical outcome to these researches.  Although geology has shown us pretty conclusively that we cannot hope to get coal, iron or oil in this country, yet the research of geophysicists may tell us something more about the under-layers of our island and may, perhaps, put us in the way of researches into sources of power, whether they be tidal, whether they be radiant or whether they be rare minerals which may show a very pleasing dividend upon the money expended.  While that should not be our object alone, in this as in so many other cases, the by-product of idealistic research is often a practical good.</P>
    <P>Lastly it has been suggested that this institute will be in conflict with our universities.  Again, if I may agree with my colleague, if I thought that were going to be so, I would have to <Col N="877" /> consider whether it was not an exceedingly serious objection to this motion but the type of study which will be pursued in this school is one which ordinarily would not form any portion of the curriculum of even an honours student in a university and would not ordinarily be taught by any professor in a university.  In so far as postgraduate work is concerned, in so far as professors and lecturers themselves may be interested in these subjects, I think the school will be found a convenient centre for those who do not wish to be absorbed too much in what I might call the lower branches of the various investigations.  They will be able to meet together and carry out their work in an atmosphere which, of course, should exist in every university research department but which is sometimes very much disturbed by the necessity of taking pass classes and demonstrating to pass students.  When I find that as a whole, the members of the university welcome the idea I think we need not lay too much emphasis upon the possibility of some kind of&mdash; the word &ldquo;friction&rdquo; would be quite unsuitable&mdash;conflict arising.  If it did occur, we would be safe in leaving it to the staffs of the universities and of the new school to find a way of resolving it, and of making a contribution between these various elements that would be helpful, each to each.</P>

      <P>When I first saw this motion I confess that, in my ignorance, I did not know what it meant.  After listening to the lengthy and very informative statement of the Minister, and the subsequent addresses of Senator Hayes, Johnston and other speakers, I have learned quite a lot this evening as to what this School of Cosmic Physics proposes to do when set up.  I agree, however, with Senator O'Reilly that, before launching on this project, it would be desirable that some propaganda should be carried on throughout the country as <Col N="878" /> to the necessity for this particular school and the good that its research work would effect in so far as the national economy is concerned.  Until that has been done, I think that the establishment of such an institute at the present time, even with the arguments that have been advanced in favour of it this evening, will not be accepted by the majority of the people as a national necessity, particularly at the present juncture.</P>
      <P>My approach to this proposal&mdash;in my ignorance, if you like&mdash;is quite different from that of other Senators who have spoken on it.  My approach to it is this, that at the present time, when the majority of our people are put to the necessity of having to exist on less than half rations of food and other essential commodities, such a discussion is not appropriate.  The people in the greater part of the country at the present time are suffering through the absence of fuel.  I would not like to be amongst the party that while such is so at the present time, would try to bring them the cold comfort of talking to them about such questions as astrophysics, geophysics, oceanography, and so on.  The time is quite inappropriate for talking to the people on such questions.  I quite understand that the Government and public representatives are only too anxious to do anything they possibly can to bring relief to the people of the country generally, and not only to them but to their own homes as well, because at this particular time every section of the community is suffering.  When I say that I consider the present time is most unsuitable for the introduction of this motion, it is not because I do not realise that much good can come out of it, but rather because I hold that it affords very cold comfort and very poor sympathy for our people who are now suffering great privations.  I think that the majority of them will say that instead of discussing such subjects we ought to be busy about matters of more vital concern to them.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Senator Ruane need permit his anxiety about other matters that should be attended to to make him feel that these <Col N="879" /> matters are being neglected just because we propose to set up this school and spend a certain amount of money upon it.  If we were to wait until every possible problem confronting the country were solved before we made provision for education or learning or scientific research we would have to wait indefinitely.  I see no reason why the present time should not be as appropriate for that&mdash;perhaps it is more appropriate&mdash;as any other time.</P>
      <P>As Senator Johnston reminded us, we are at a watershed of history at the present time.  It is quite obvious that we are entering on a new phase so far as the bearing of science upon the world generally and the lives of the peoples is concerned.  In this, as in the case of aviation, we have to make a choice.  We had to make a choice as to whether, having regard to our resources, we would take part in the development of aviation and make this country a centre for international aviation.  Now, we are presented with the same choice, that we are asked to spend money on a project of this kind. I have no objection whatever to the expenditure being queried or to questions being asked as to whether the country is going to get value for it or not.  I think Senator Kingsmill Moore reminded us that it might very well be that an investment in research, or for educational purposes, might have a value that could really be described as an investment, even though it may not have practical results in the very near future.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, practical results are not at all excluded.  Senator Ruane asked whether the country should not be told what the practical value of this work may be.  He suggested that it is really through lack of knowledge perhaps that people are critical of the setting up of the school. I should say that the different branches of cosmic physics include, for example, such matters as climatology&mdash;information regarding, for example, rainfall, which is necessary for various State activities, not to mention private ones. It also includes meteoro-biology, which has an effect on meteorological phenomena on human beings and plants.</P>

      <Col N="880" /> Obviously, this has a bearing on such diseases as tuberculosis and rickets which may give us knowledge regarding the incidence of epidemics.  Tuberculosis research centres exist elsewhere and are connected with meteorological observatories.  Weather forecasting is obviously most important for such matters as agriculture, tourism, the building trade, transport, flood and frost warning, warfare, etc.</P>
    <P>Aeronautical meteorology is of special importance for us in this country at the present time since we have taken our place, as I have mentioned, on the cross-roads of the world air routes.  A good many of our young men will be finding their way into the meteorological service.  The world airfield will grow in extent and importance. One of the things that will result from the setting up of this school will be that we shall be in a position, please God, to train our own meteorologists. If matters develop in a favourable way, it well may happen that our universities will be able to take these young men who have pursued higher studies in cosmic physics and appoint them as lecturers, and, later, perhaps as professors within the university, and so give a good deal of attention to this work, if it should happen that this particular branch of science extended in such a way as to make it feasible for the universities to consider it worth while.</P>
    <P>There is agricultural meteorology. The importance of that need scarcely be stressed.  We know how important weather forecasts are in the case of agriculture.  There is oceanography. This is an island, and the study of cosmic currents, and matters affecting navigation will undoubtedly be of great importance to us.</P>
    <P>Even in Finland there is an Institute Thalassologique the staff of which according to information received as late as October 18th, 1945, consists of the director professor, three chiefs of sections, two scientific collaborators and the necessary clerical staff.  Then there is the analysis of geographical periodic phenomena which has been found to have a bearing on the economic life of peoples and has been <Col N="881" /> studied by people like Sir William Beveridge who has found that it has a bearing on his economic studies.  At present it is being studied in the United States.  There is terrestrial magnetism and the question of a national magnetic survey of the country is as important and is as necessary as its geodetic survey and cartographic representation.  It is possible, by it, to do prospecting for minerals and oil and this is a branch that has been developed in other countries.  So that practically at every turn we find that some branch or other of cosmic physics has a direct bearing on the social and economic life and on the earth and air about us.  Astronomy has been known as having an important bearing not only on navigation but on agriculture as well, for thousands of years.  Senator Kingsmill Moore has given us examples of this.  If we only made ourselves acquainted with these things I do not think that there would be such criticism on setting up this school of cosmic physics.  It is not suggested that the expenditure is very great.  I congratulate the Seanad on having approached the subject in a sober and serious and not unsympathetic way.  We have had statements made that the expenditure is very great.  Senator Sweetman referred to &ldquo;the grand imperial scale&rdquo; and mentioned that Hamilton worked in a university.  The Senator suggested that we would only get value from the Institute of Advanced Studies at tremendous cost.  I am informed that at one of the most successful observatories, at Kapteynolo, Groningen, Holland, there is very little in the way of astronomical apparatus but the work there of observers and astronomers is done largely by pencil and paper and a certain number of calculating machines. Small countries not able to provide equipment necessary for all the branches of physics are certainly able to provide, for a limited expenditure, all that is necessary for this branch of both theoretical and cosmic physics. That expenditure is very small indeed.</P>
    <P>If we require proof of this we should look at countries like Norway, Austria, Denmark and Finland, where facilities for the study of cosmic physics already <Col N="882" /> exist.  So far back as 1890 cosmic physics were taken up for study in. Austria and there were no less than six institutes there, in Vienna, Innsbruck, Graz, Prague, Czaernowitz and Leimberg, besides the already existing meteorological, hydrological, geodetic and other State services.  Soon other States followed, States large and small, which correctly grasped the educational and economic value of this branch of science.  One may mention the small country of Norway with its 2.8 million inhabitants which, for decades, besides having an excellent meteorological State service, possesses the &ldquo;Geophysical Institute&rdquo; in Bergen and the &ldquo;Institute for Cosmic Physics&rdquo; in Oslo.  So far back as 1926 pioneer work had been carried on at Bergen Observatory with the result that every single weather forecast in the world to-day, including those by our own meteorological service, is based on the work done in Bergen. And to-day, after five years of occupation and reduced to poverty by a most cruel war, Norway maintains, in addition to its meteorological State service in Oslo, the famous forecast centre in Bergen, the Geophysical Institute in Bergen and the Institute of Cosmic Physics in Bergen.  There must be lacking there the criticism of the type we have grown accustomed to in this country both inside and outside the Oireachtas, because the Norwegians, for reasons which must seem good to them, are maintaining those services. Speaking on the London Conference Extraordinaire des Directeurs, Professor Hesselberg, Director of the Norwegian Meteorological Service, stated, about 12 months ago:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Norway we continued the publication of our <i>Year Book</i> during the war.  We also continued to issue the scientific papers.  We started a new scientific series&mdash;&lsquo;Meteorogiske Annalers&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Similar conditions with respect to the high standard of cosmic physics studies exist in Denmark, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia, to mention only the small States.  The case of Turkey deserves special mention.  This Asiatic State, which for decades was called &ldquo;Europe's sick man&rdquo;, has since 1916 <Col N="883" /> a modern meteorological service, and in 1933 took advantage of securing the services of dismissed German scientists. A modern university was established in Istanbul which included the study of astronomy and geophysics. A modern astronomical observatory was erected and a textbook on astronomy in the Turkish language was published.  Occupation with cosmic physics is widespread with nations great and small, and even in those countries which have to economise in matters of national expenditure.  There is an International Commission for Agricultural Meteorology, and the intensity of research on this subject is proved by a publication of the Research Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in London for the period of 1924 to 1936 which contains no less than 1,100 references.  Senator Hayes suggested that the school we propose to establish here will be under Civil Service control.  I do not know why he thinks this.  So far as the administration of the institute is concerned, it is entirely self-contained.  The Government does not interfere in the administration. It is completely autonomous and independent and I trust it will remain so.  Appointments on the governing body and to the senior professorships are made by the President on the advice of the Government.</P>
    <P>When we speak of this work being done by the universities we must have regard to the burdens which have been thrown on the universities not alone by the enormous increases in the number of students&mdash;we have 3,000 students, for example, at University College, Dublin, which is said to have accommodation for really only about one-third of that number&mdash;and side by side with that we have to have regard to the fact that during the past 100 years, since the time of Rowan Hamilton, science has expanded enormously. For example, physics at that time included all this branch&mdash;cosmic physics&mdash;but in the same way as the electrical branch of science was taken apart in the course of time, it was found that cosmic physics was growing at such a rate that special arrangements <Col N="884" /> would have to be made to deal with it.  We had separate institutions, as I have pointed out, set up all over the Continent for many years past to continue research in that branch.  If it is suggested now that this work should be handed over to the universities, I should like to ask how our universities are in a position to make provision for the equipment of the school, the provision of professors of the calibre of men like Professor Schroedinger who has brought such lustre to the school with which he is represented.  How will that be possible? Where is the disadvantage so far as expenditure is concerned in having an additional institution?  Was it an advantage to the country, for example, that the College of Science was absorbed and swallowed up by University College, Dublin?  Would it not have been better, perhaps, if it had been preserved as a separate institution? At least there are two opinions on that matter.</P>
    <P>The expenditure in regard to these schools is at the very minimum so far as equipment is concerned.  It depends very largely, then, on the men who we are going to get in there.  We are fortunate in regard to the new school, in being able to get three men of first-class European reputation.</P>
    <P>This school will be a centre, as was pointed out, where the universities can meet on common ground.  We have three university colleges on the secular side of the National University, and Trinity.  The four of them can meet and have met on common ground there for years past.  Is it not an advantage both to the universities and the institute that that should be possible?  Cannot the institute benefit by getting young scholars in from the university, from the graduates who show special qualifications for higher research work? Will not the universities benefit&mdash;as they certainly have benefited, and as I think they would be glad to acknowledge&mdash;by the seminars held by professors in the institute to which university professors and lecturers may go to refresh themselves and where they are brought into contact with men who, as it has been said, are working on the <Col N="885" /> frontiers of knowledge?  Will they not go back to the universities and will it not be to the advantage of the universities? Have these professors time&mdash; having regard to the number of students they have to deal with, the calls that are made on them for examinations and for their ordinary teaching work&mdash;to give the benefit of a considerable part of their time to research work?  And if they are able to do so, would they have the opportunity? Would they have the facilities for examining a particular problem as the professors in the institute certainly would have?  They will be free from day to day, and from month to month, and year to year, to continue the application of their minds to special problems.  They will be entirely free to co-ordinate their work with the work of scientists elsewhere and in that way they will be able to give an amount of time to pure research and, if necessary, to indicate methods of application of their work to the practical problems of life that I suggest the university professors at one of our universities at present are not in a position to do.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator Johnston refer to the history of Dunsink Observatory. I think it is right that attention should be called to the scientific history of that institution, the great men that have been associated with it.  It is only proper that the university for which the professor <Col N="886" /> spoke should take pride in its association with the observatory and I am glad to reciprocate his good wishes for the success of the observatory and the new school which is being founded. The authorities of Trinity College were fully conscious of the sacrifice they were making in handing over Dunsink Observatory which had been an honourable part of the equipment of the record of scientific work in the university over such a long period.  I fully appreciate the feelings they had and the wrench it must have been to them to part with it but they did it because they believed that it was a good thing in the national interest and I think it is a good augury for the future that they have shown that attitude.  I would like to say their attitude generally in the negotiation and in the transfer of Dunsink was marked by understanding.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there are any other matters to which I might refer. I have tried to deal briefly with the points which have been raised.  I know that Senators are not anxious to stay too long here and I can only hope they will be satisfied with this rather brief statement.</P>
