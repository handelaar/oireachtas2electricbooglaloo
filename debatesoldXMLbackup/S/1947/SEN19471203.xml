      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;Section 19 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution therein for sub-section (2) of the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) a member of the harbour authority who is absent from more than six consecutive meetings of such harbour authority shall vacate his office unless the harbour authority decides that there is good reason for such absence</P>
      <P>and the said section shall have effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope, Sir, I am not interfering with the atmosphere of the House in asking that this small amendment be inserted in the Bill.  The amendment is of rather trifling importance but it seeks to deal with a matter which has caused some difficulty in the case of harbour authorities and I take it the Minister will not have any strong feeling against accepting it.  I want to draw attention in the first place to the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 19 of the Harbours Act, 1946.  That sub-section provides that if a member of a harbour authority is absent from more than half the meetings of the harbour authority during any period of six consecutive months he shall vacate his office unless the harbour authority decides that there is good reason for such absence.  Normally, one would say that that would not create much <Col N="1322" /> hardship but in fact it creates a rather undesirable situation, both from the point of view of the officials of the harbour authority and from the point of view of members of the harbour authority.</P>
    <P>You will observe that disqualification arises where a member is absent during any period of six consecutive months from the majority of the meetings of the harbour authority.  In order to keep track of the attendance of members, the secretary of the harbour authority after every meeting has to check the attendances to see whether during the past six months a particular member was absent from the majority of the meetings.  Let us say there were nine meetings in six months.  If the particular member was absent from five he is automatically disqualified from membership unless, of course, the harbour authority decides that there were adequate reasons for his absence.  In practice, what has happened in the case brought to my notice is that a member of a harbour authority who was absent from more than half the meetings over a period of six consecutive months was notified that he was no longer a member.  It is true that his absences were due to his interest in other public works.  He was attending meetings of Dáil Eireann.  If he were to write a letter to the harbour authority explaining that his absences were due to that cause there is no doubt, of course, that the harbour authority would be entitled to reinstate him to membership.  But it is an unsatisfactory position that a man who is performing public duties as a public representative should be notified in these circumstances that he has ceased to be a member and should have to make that appeal.  I am not quite sure but I know that at one stage he decided that he would not make any appeal to be restored to membership.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the amendment is simple and straightforward and is in keeping with the practice in respect of most local authorities. It seems to me much more intelligible that the absences should refer to absences from consecutive meetings rather than to isolated absences spread over any six consecutive months because, bear in mind, the six months period does not <Col N="1323" /> necessarily run from the 1st January or the 1st July.  For the purpose of the Act it has been held that the six consecutive months may run from any date.  It may be the 1st January, the 1st April, or the 1st November.  It is obvious that the arrangement I suggest is preferable and more easily understood.  It is easy, too, for a person who has occasion to absent himself from meetings of this kind for good and sufficient reason, to follow his position in relation to attendances and to know when in fact he has missed six consecutive meetings.  That is preferable to the position of not knowing at any time how he stands in relation to attendances until he is told by an official of the harbour authority that he has ceased to be a member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is a desirable amendment.  A similar amendment was moved in the Dáil by a Deputy who, I understood, based his case for it on his own experience but, when it was clear that he was under a misunderstanding, he withdrew it.  It would be foolish, I think, to consider the rule that it is desirable to have in this connection merely upon the basis of the experience of an individual who happens to be a member of the Dáil and is necessarily absent from harbour board meetings when the Dáil is in session.  I think we should have in mind primarily the case of the individual who is elected as a representative of a particular interest to a harbour board and pays no attention to his duties there and whom it is desirable to remove so that the particular interest concerned can substitute a more attentive member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is desirable and I undertook in the Dáil to consider urging secretaries of harbour boards to adopt as a practice the sending of a notification to each member when he had reached the position that absence from the next meeting would render him liable to disqualification.  I will undertake to do that.  It would be obviously a desirable practice to establish, but I would ask the House to keep in mind that in any event the decision rests with the harbour board.  If they consider <Col N="1324" /> that the absence of a member from half of the meetings in six consecutive months is due to causes which are explainable and understandable, then disqualification does not follow. It is only where there is no such explanation satisfactory to the harbour board that disqualification takes place.</P>
    <P>I think also that Senator Duffy is basing his case upon one instance, and is assuming that the circumstances of that case could apply in other cases. The rules laid down by the Harbour Acts for harbour boards apply to all harbour boards, large and small.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board meets weekly and has always had a rule that any member absent from half of the meetings in a period of six months is disqualified, and possibly the Limerick Harbour Board also meets very frequently.  But, there are smaller harbour boards that meet only once quarterly.  If we were to substitute the Senator's amendment for the position in the Act, one could conceive a member being absent from every meeting for 21 months before being liable to disqualification.  I do not think the rule in the Bill is a harsh one.  It has been the practice of a number of harbour authorities up to this, and I think it should be retained, subject to the desirability of establishing the practice of notifying a member that his continued absence would render him liable to disqualification if he misses the next meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister does not feel very convinced that the present arrangement is a good one.  His argument certainly is self-destructive in many points.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board will meet weekly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1325" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the harbour authority decides there is a good reason for such absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>His colleagues, then, decide whether or not he will vacate his office.  In the case of the smaller authority meeting quarterly, there are only two meetings in six months.  If the member is absent from one, in other words, if he attends one meeting in six months, he is entitled to remain a member of the board.  In the case of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, if he attends five he is disqualified.  Therefore the suggestion contained in the amendment is more straightforward.  It is a better arrangement to provide that a person who is absent from six consecutive meetings, whether weekly, monthly or otherwise is disqualified.</P>
      <P>I quite agree that it seems a very long time to permit a member who is absent from six meetings to remain a member, if they are quarterly meetings; but it seems to me that the harbour authority that meets once a quarter is not charged with a very heavy responsibility and that its members as a whole do not consider themselves a responsible body if they are satisfied with quarterly meetings.  I understand that, in many cases, the larger harbour authorities meet fortnightly or at least once a month.  The harbour authority which does not meet once a month is simply leaving the whole management in the hands of a permanent official and they have no check over his work.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to say that my amendment is similar to one moved in the Dáil.  It is quite different.  That moved in the Dáil was to the effect that a person would not vacate his office unless he were absent for six consecutive months.  My amendment proposes six consecutive meetings.  It is similar to the provision in the Local Government Acts, so I think the Minister may have a sound reason for opposing it but he has not stated it.  If the practice in regard to local authorities as a whole is satisfactory, it cannot be unsatisfactory in the case of a harbour authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>An ounce of practice <Col N="1326" /> is worth a ton of theory.  Another member, as well as myself, is an active member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Under Senator Duffy's proposed amendment, it would be possible for a man to lose his seat, though he may be a most assiduous member of the board.  For instance, there are many sub-committees and I am a member of three.  I attend those meetings and also the statutory meetings of the board, but if for some unforeseen reason I was debarred from attending the statutory meetings on a Thursday &mdash;though I might have attended a subcommittee meeting the day before&mdash; under this amendment I would be disqualified. It is on actual practice that we must base our action and I submit seriously, from my experience, that the present situation is better than that suggested in the amendment. The Dublin board is very active and many of us attend the various sub-committees. There have been cases where men have forfeited their position on the board because of their absence, but the board then considered the special circumstances in at least two cases and reinstated the persons concerned, on the production of evidence which satisfied the board as to the reasons for absence.  The present position is a satisfactory one and should not be disturbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this hare gets further, let me catch him right now. The Senator is completely misinformed as to the purpose of the amendment. The present position in the Dublin Port and Docks Board is that a member can attend 40 sub-committees in any period of six months but if he is absent from more than half the regular fortnightly meetings during that six months he ceases to be a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just said so; but it is at the discretion of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case the Minister referred to, a Deputy of Dáil Eireann was disqualified by the Limerick board because of Section 19 (2).  In that same period of six months there were 19 committee meetings at which he was entitled to be present and I think he attended 15, yet he was disqualified <Col N="1327" /> under that law as it stands, no account being taken at all of attendances at the sub-committee meetings.  I am not proposing to change that in the amendment&mdash;I simply want to take a clearcut issue and say that, if he is absent from six consecutive meetings, he is disqualified, rather than if his attendance is less than half the regular meetings of the authority.  It is really a question of whether or not you want the present complicated method of calculating attendances.  I am endeavouring to substitute a straightforward method, clear to every member of the local authority, for the present system which is not straightforward and in respect of which each individual member has a six months' period of his own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am honestly convinced that the amendment is undesirable. The present rule is quite workable. It has been the rule in the Dublin Port and Docks Board for 75 years and has not caused any serious upset to that organisation.  Frankly, I think that, if a member accepts election to a harbour board, he should be expected to attend a reasonable proportion of the meetings and if he does not do so those who sent him there&mdash;whether they be cattle traders, shippers or others&mdash; should be given an opportunity of replacing him.  In any event, I want to emphasise that the final decision rests with the harbour authority and if it decides that the absence is justifiable there can be no disqualification.</P>

      <P>I do not want to divide the House on an amendment of this kind, but I do think the present position of the Act of 1946 is a bad one.

The question of consecutive absences is distinct from this in-and-out method which has to be calculated by the officials of the board in respect of each person separately.

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I want to ascertain from the Minister <Col N="1329" /> what method is adopted for scheduling the assets which the State may hold in commercial undertakings.  I raised this question with some difficulty on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill. When I look at the Schedule to the 1925 Finance Accounts, I see there set out most of the advances which I know the Government made to a number of undertakings or businesses of a commercial character.  We have set out there the advances made to the Alcohol Company, to the Shipping Company and to the different aviation companies.  I can find no mention whatever of the advances made to the Minerals Company which would appear to me to be in the same category as those other companies.  I think this is an important matter because it raises the principle of setting out these assets as well as the prices set against them.  I notice that is done in the case of the Alcohol Company, the shares in which are of a very doubtful value.  In the case of the Minerals Company, the fact that no particulars are set out would seem to be an admission that there are no assets there.  I think something should be set out to show the assets and their realisable value.  We know now from this section of the Bill that the assets are very much below their actual cost.  I would be glad if the Minister would deal generally with this point.  I think it is important, in view of the extending ramifications of the Government's participation in commercial enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not deal with the general question which the Senator has raised.  So far as I know, it is the practice to record in the Finance Accounts advances made to companies of this kind as Exchequer assets at their nominal value.  In this particular case, because of the circumstances under which the company had to conduct its operations during the war, and because it was known that these operations were involving the company in losses, losses which were being met by renewed advances from the Exchequer, the advances were not recorded as assets, and for that reason were excluded from the Finance <Col N="1330" /> Accounts.  The fact that this Bill is being introduced now for the purpose of wiping out these losses, thereby releasing the company from the obligation of repaying advances, justifies that course.  When the company commences its operations on the new basis, and when all these past advances have been written down to the present value of its assets, then it will be for consideration whether these assets, so determined, of the company will be recorded in the Finance Accounts as Exchequer assets.</P>
      <P>The answer to the Senator's question concerning this company is that, it being known that the company was making losses and was unlikely ever to repay the advances, or even to pay interest on the advances, they were not reckoned as assets to be included in the Finance Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really satisfied with the Minister's answer. According to his answer, it seems to be entirely arbitrary as to what shall be included in Table 20 of the Finance Accounts and what shall not be set out. Apparently, if I understand the Minister aright, advances made for producing commodities during the war which did not seem likely to realise their value were to be excluded.  I think that this matter should be handled by the Government on a clearer basis than that.  That procedure would seem to leave it entirely to the Minister for Finance as to what should be included. We ought to know whether all advances made are to be included in our assets, and if they are not why not.  We ought to be told about the matter.  Merely to be told that advances made during the emergency are to be excluded, and that advances made before that are to be included, seems to me to be entirely unbusinesslike.  That is a point that I have been dealing with for a long time &mdash;&mdash;the absence of business methods in all these commercial activities in which the Government has embarked, and is embarking on to an increasing extent. I do not see that any purpose would be served by pursuing the matter further, but I do hope that, at some time, the Government will examine deliberately this method of making advances to such undertakings as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1331" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points on which I should like to correct the Senator.  I did not draw a distinction between advances made by the State to companies before the emergency and during the emergency.  I made a distinction between the advances made to this company and to other companies. This company was engaged in operations which necessarily involved it in losses.  If it was working on commercial principles it would, as I told the Senate on the Second Reading of the Bill, have suspended work until the war was over, because it could not get either equipment or skilled workers or any of the facilities it required for proper commercial working.  It was told by the Government to go on working, even in the difficult position in which it found itself, because of the necessity of getting the products in which it was interested.  It was told to go on producing, irrespective of financial considerations.  The Minister for Finance knowing that that was the situation, and knowing that these advances were really made to meet the day-to-day losses of the company, and knowing, further, that the company was unlikely at any time to repay these advances, or even the interest on them, did not reckon them as assets.</P>
      <P>In the case of all the other companies to which the Senator has referred, the repayment of the advances has been made as arranged, and the interest is paid on them as it falls due, and, therefore, it is proper for the Minister for Finance to reckon them as Exchequer assets.  His decision in this particular case is justified in the event. Now we are wiping out these losses.  It is the only practical course to take.  The new company will have no earning power at all.  It will be engaged in exploration work and could not possibly hope to make a profit out of its future working which would enable us to recover its past losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point raised by Senator Sir John Keane is one of some importance, even though I think the Minister's statement has made the position perfectly clear.  I think the matter is one that requires consideration. In this case, I think that from the commercial point of view, the <Col N="1332" /> assets might have been put down and marked as having no estimated value.  I certainly think they should appear as long as they were a legal liability.  I imagine they are so until this Bill becomes law.  I do not think that the point is of very great importance in this particular case.  There is, however, a principle involved which might very well be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I again draw the Minister's attention to what I said on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I referred then to the statement which was made by his predecessor when speaking on the original Bill that was passed to develop the Slievardagh collieries.  The Minister's predecessor then said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These facts in themselves do not, of course, make certain that large returns in the way of dividends may be expected for any money invested in the establishment of the colliery at Slievardagh. All they do is provide sufficient justification for saying that there is a very good chance that the undertaking can be made self-supporting in a reasonably short time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On that basis, the taking of these assets into the Finance Accounts would surely seem to have been justified.  The Minister now says that the advances had to be made in order to meet the situation created by the emergency. There is a distinct conflict between the hopes then expressed by the Minister's predecessor and what the present Minister says was in the mind of his Department.  I do not intend to pursue the matter further.</P>

      <P>There is another matter of principle that I want to raise in this section.  I know that the section deals only with the prospecting activities of the company which, I agree, should not be published.  I feel that I am in order in referring to what was prescribed in the Principal <Col N="1333" /> Act passed in 1941.  Under Section 14 of that Act, there was to be furnished by the company a profit and loss account and balance sheet, and after a period of 90 days the accounts were to be laid on the Table of the two Houses.  Failure to do so imposed certain statutory penalties on the directors. So far as I can ascertain, the last accounts furnished by the company relate to 1945.  I can find nothing later than that, even though the company carried on operations in 1946 and 1947. Perhaps the Minister would be able to explain that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the appropriate section for me to raise what is in my mind.  I am not quite clear whether I should raise the matter on this stage or on the Fifth Stage, but no doubt I will be pulled up quickly if <Col N="1334" /> I am transgressing.  I object to the Minister acquiring these shares in this company, not because of the company itself, but because the company is being utilised to control other commercial enterprises.  The Minister and I had an argument&mdash;and I return to it in respect of one particular point&mdash; on this matter on 16th April last at column 1582 of the reports of this House.  The Minister in that debate stated that the shares of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, Limited, which were held by Irish Shipping Limited were shares which were transferred to Irish Shipping Limited from the Industrial Credit Corporation.  I challenged the Minister at the time, but he said he did not agree with me. Immediately after that debate, I had an opportunity of ascertaining the facts, and the facts are as stated by me, namely, that a holding of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, Limited, shares, sufficient to create a majority and to control the company, were specifically created and given to Irish Shipping Limited, in consideration of the transfer of the marine insurance.  That is the fact, and I want that fact to go on the record, in view of what occurred on the previous occasion.  I do not see now why, particularly having regard to the present condition of the Irish Stock Exchange, in which there is a complete shortage of suitable industrial holdings, when it is without question a market in which the Minister could get rid of these shares at an advantage to the State, it is necessary for Irish Shipping Limited to retain control of a purely commercial and industrial undertaking like the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us also on that occasion that having the secretary of his Department as chairman of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland was a purely temporary arrangement. Apparently the Minister's view of the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; and mine differ, because six months have passed, and, so far as I am aware, the position is still the same.  It appears to me quite clear that it would be to the advantage of the State, to the advantage of the public, in pursuance of the powers <Col N="1335" /> taken in this Bill over Irish Shipping Limited, if the Minister directed the company to place on the market, with such restrictions as may be desirable &mdash;with a provision that the shares should be held only by Irish nationals; I would not object to that in the slightest&mdash;for disposal amongst the ordinary Irish investing public the control at present exercised through Irish Shipping Limited by the Minister over what should be an ordinary commercial undertaking.  If that were done, I feel that it would redound to the credit of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I cannot see the point of that.  Irish Shipping Limited, as I explained, went into the marine insurance business because nobody else would do it and it served a most useful purpose by its action.  It was considered undesirable, and I think it will be agreed for obvious reasons to be undesirable, that a shipping company should be in the marine insurance business, and, consequently, the company was urged to dispose of that business in such a manner as would not impede the growth of the business in this country, because, up to the advent of Irish Shipping Limited there was no marine insurance market here. Now there is such a market, a market of growing importance which is already producing an income from abroad of significant size and an income which is expanding rapidly.  Irish Shipping Limited carried out their decision in that regard by transferring that business to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland in consideration of the transfer of shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should Irish Shipping Limited sell these shares?  They are worth probably a lot more than their nominal value because of the business which Irish Shipping Limited transferred to the company.  There is also the problem of reinvestment.  The only reason advanced why they should sell these shares is that somebody else wants to invest in them&mdash;that is what Senator Sweetman is arguing.  If Irish Shipping Limited sold the shares, they would have the problem of reinvesting the money in something else and it is <Col N="1336" /> obviously far better to leave the money as it is.</P>
    <P>With regard to the arrangement whereby the secretary of my Department is chairman of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, I want to say that I do not desire that arrangement to be continued and neither does he.  I have been urged by the board to allow it to continue for a further period because of the importance they attach to it in promoting the growth of this insurance business, but obviously the arrangement will have to be terminated because the individual in question has far more work to do than he can reasonably carry and I have notified the board of the company that it will have to be terminated, despite their wishes to the contrary.</P>

      <P>The first part of the Minister's argument, that Irish Shipping Limited would have difficulty in reinvesting, would be very sound and very good, if it were not for the fact that Section 2 is in the Bill.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to give Irish Shipping Limited more capital.  That is the purpose of introducing this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to make one point clear.  Section 2 provides that the capital of the company may be increased to £5,000,000.  The amount involved in the discussion which the Minister and I have had is roughly £500,000, because there are about 225,000 shares which could be put on the market at between £2 and £2 10s. 0d. per share.  With regard to the further funds of this company, the extra £500,000 would be of the greatest advantage, but even apart from the fact that Section 2 and the necessity <Col N="1338" /> for it demolish the Minister's argument, the Minister demolished it in another way, because he most specifically started off by saying that he did not desire Irish Shipping Limited to dispose of its insurance holding and then turned his argument to suggest that, when further capital was required, they would dispose of it.</P>
      <P>We must remember that, in regard to a matter of policy, it is the policy of the Minister at the time which will operate and his policy apparently is to ensure that, through his control of the shares of Irish Shipping Limited, control of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Limited will be kept and effected.  I regard that as an extremely bad thing.  I regard it as a control which may lead to very undesirable results, no matter who may constitute the Government at a particular time.  I feel that the investing position of Irish Shipping Limited should be an investment in ships and that the other capital&mdash;what I might perhaps describe as working capital&mdash; if it needs temporary investment should not be held in a lock-up investment such as the type the Minister visualises.  That is not going to increase confidence in Irish enterprise. It is going to mean the spreading of the tentacles of the Department into every activity of commercial life.  The Minister may, as he does, pay lip-service from time to time to private enterprise, but when he gets the opportunity, he does the exact reverse.  He encourages State regimentation and control in commercial enterprise and I think it would be a good day for us all if that ended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that Senator Sir John Keane would have intervened in this debate but I was surprised by his silence.  If Senator Sweetman, as a lawyer, is taken as an authority on finance then Senator Keane knows nothing about it.  Senator Sweetman's argument is that because Irish Shipping Limited has certain reserves invested in a profitable undertaking these reserves should be put on the open market for the man in the street to buy, thereby depriving Irish Shipping Limited of a very valuable source of revenue.  He goes on to say that this <Col N="1339" /> should be in the hands of private enterprise the reason being of course that it is a money spinner and a profit-making industry.  There was no mention by Senator Keane that Slievardagh should be in the hands of private enterprise.  Oh, no.  The people, and by that I mean the Government, should hold the baby when there is money to be lost but when there is profit to be made, when there is something valuable at stake, it should be handed over to private enterprise.  Senator Keane was very critical of the Government's management of Slievardagh but he had nothing to say about Irish Shipping Limited which is a very valuable asset to the nation not only from the financial point of view but from the point of view of service rendered during the emergency.  It has proved itself during the emergency.  Now let us exploit it in peace time.  The Minister told us that it was considered entering into the field of cross-Channel shipping.  There is an opportunity for investment in the very near future but by disposing of its shares in the insurance corporation, Irish Shipping Limited will be so much the poorer.  I am amazed by the silence of Senator Keane on such an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator need be amazed no longer, but why he wants to tie Irish Shipping Limited up with Slievardagh is beyond me.  They are two totally different matters.  I agree with Senator Sweetman.  I accept that Irish Shipping Limited is only a synonymous term for Irish Government. It is not an independent commercial enterprise.  It is a company in which the Government owns all the shares and over which the Government has effective control, and I do object to the Government, through Irish Shipping Limited, owning a controlling interest in the Irish Insurance Corporation.  If the Senator thinks my silence implies agreement he is mistaken.  Certainly it does not.  I am fully in agreement with the attitude that Senator Sweetman took up and I am largely apprehensive of the ramifications of a Government enterprise through a company in which it has a controlling interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping Limited is investing its reserve funds in new ships as rapidly as it can.  At the present time, as people in the business know, it is not possible to buy ships. No country will agree to transfer the registration of existing ships, and, consequently, it is only by getting new ships built that Irish Shipping Limited can expand its fleet.  It is getting those new ships built and we hope that by expanding its operations it will absorb not merely its financial assets but will be required to call on the capital that this Bill provides.  For the first time the company is being given a basis in legislation.  It was originally started under an emergency powers Order with a capital of £200,000 and that is probably worth 20 times its nominal value now.  When it is being given a basis in legislation it is proper that the nominal capital of the undertaking should be given some relation to the assets of the company as well as providing for further advances from the State if the growing activity of the company requires it to get new capital.</P>
      <P>With regard to the company's investment in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland I want to say one thing which I think is important.  I have mentioned that a growing market for marine insurance business is being established in this country.  That market is not growing except at somebody's expense. The business that the Insurance Corporation of Ireland is getting and the business that other insurance companies, following its lead, are getting is business that other companies would have got.  I certainly would advise Irish Shipping Limited that in no circumstances should it dispose of its shares in these companies until it was satisfied that this business was firmly established here.  I would not regard a mere provision that the shares could only be sold to Irish nationals as a sufficient safeguard for protecting this business because there are people who may have very substantial interests in destroying it.  Until that risk has disappeared it would, in my view, be better to have the company call upon the capital for which the Bill provides rather than to dispose of its shares in the Irish Insurance Corporation.</P>

      <P>This Bill is promoted at the express wish of the Incorporated Law Society. It is empowered to increase the annual fees from £1 to £2.  Apparently they have only power to charge poor solicitors £1 a year and this gives them power to charge them £2.  There is another provision dealing with Section 1 (b) of the Solicitors Amendment Act, 1923, in which English and Scottish solicitors were allowed to practise here.  The idea of putting that provision in the Act was on the understanding that there would be a reciprocal arrangement made between the two countries but that did not happen and now the Incorporated Law Society wishes the facility to be withdrawn. There is a provision in another section to cover the case of a person who has already applied for permission to practise here and he will be allowed to go ahead.  I believe there is only one such application and it happened to be from a national here who qualified in England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is quite correct.  I thoroughly agree with him in regard to Section 1 of the Bill which provides for the increase in the registration fee but my view of the situation arising out of Section 2 is entirely different.  I agree the provision was originally inserted in the 1923 Act on the assumption that there would be similarity between our law here and the law in Britain but that did not happen by reason of the Conveyancing Act of 1925 and the Companies Act of 1929 in England.  The difference is so great that no English <Col N="1342" /> solicitor could be properly acquainted with our basic system here.  The provision of this 1923 Act, so far as I am aware, has been availed of by only one solicitor.  He was an Irish national who had qualified in England and desired to come back here and practise and he has already been admitted here. So far as this Act is concerned, therefore, it does not apply to him.  Sub-section (2) of this section was introduced into the Bill for the purpose of dealing with a further application and I would like the Minister to assure me satisfactorily that he is inserting this sub-section at the request of the Incorporated Law Society.  I understand that the position was that the Incorporated Law Society were not, at one time anyhow, favourably disposed towards this application.  I would like to be certain that the person concerned for whom a specific exeception is made is an Irish national and that steps are being taken to ensure that he has a knowledge of the law as enacted and administered here and that we are putting in a specific saving clause for the purpose of getting something right that should be right and not for the purpose of permitting the entry of a person who should not be permitted to enter because of the old provision in the 1923 Act.</P>

The Incorporated Law Society are opposed to the one person who has applied and so far as they are concerned they have refused to consent to his admission as a solicitor in Ireland.  He can now apply to the Chief Justice but the Incorporated Law Society are recommending the Chief Justice that this person should not be admitted.  As the Minister told us, the provision was inserted in the 1923 Act on the understanding that a law would be passed in Britain giving similar rights to solicitors qualified in Ireland but that has not been done and there is no reason why we should continue to give these rights to English solicitors.</P>

Senator O'Dea will agree with me when I say that the present position is that a student of University College, Galway, pursuing a course of law and apprenticed to a solicitor in Galway, must come to Dublin to the Four Courts to lectures. The same thing applies to a student in Cork.  There is a good deal to be said for compelling students to attend lectures but it does seem rather absurd that apprentices from Cork, where there is a university college, or from Galway where there is a university college, have to come all the way to Dublin to attend lectures at half-past four in the afternoon given on, perhaps, three or four afternoons in the week.</P>

      <P>This Bill makes provision for the printing and publication of statutory instruments, these being instruments more commonly referred to as Statutory Rules and Orders.  The Bill will replace the Rules Publication Act, 1893, which is being repealed in its entirety.  Successive law officers have advised that the Act of 1893, although technically continued in force by the Constitution, was not fully adapted for application in this State and that it has, therefore, never been in really effective operation here.  The Supreme Court in 1941 endorsed this view to a large extent when it held that the Act did not apply to Statutory Rules and Orders made by the Government. While efforts have been made to secure adherence to the procedure laid down in the Act of 1893, the results have not been satisfactory or uniform. Some statutory Orders have been published outside the official numbered series, and, on the other hand, instruments of relatively minor importance have been included.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the present Bill is to remedy the existing unsatisfactory state of things.  The Bill proposes to establish a simple, uniform and reasonably flexible procedure to secure that, when statutory instruments are made, notice to that effect will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and the instruments themselves printed and published in the official numbered series and made readily available to the public.</P>

    <P>Having regard to the volume and <Col N="1346" /> variety of statutory instruments, it is not proposed to insist on the publication of all such instruments in the official series.  Provision is accordingly made in the Bill empowering the Attorney-General to exempt from inclusion in the official numbered series those statutory instruments which, because of their merely local or personal application, temporary operation or limited effect, or for any other sufficient reason, should not be published in the official series.  The Attorney-General is further empowered to exempt not merely individual instruments but classes of instruments, the object being to avoid multiplicity of references by rule-making authorities to the Attorney-General.</P>
    <P>Exemption from the printing and publishing arrangements provided for in Section 3 (1) of the Bill does not mean that the exempted instruments will not receive adequate publicity. The manner and form of such publicity may be left to the rule-making authority concerned.  Section 3 (5) recognises this by providing that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting the printing and publication of any statutory instrument which is not a statutory instrument to which this Act primarily applies.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I suppose we will deal with that when we are concluding.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (2) of the Bill provides that the decision of the Attorney-General will be final in determining whether the Bill when enacted applied to a particular statutory instrument.  This provision as at present drafted was the subject of some criticism in the Dáil on the ground that it was unconstitutional to vest such a power in the Attorney-General.  The Senate will have an opportunity of considering the point in more detail on Committee Stage and, in the meantime, I propose to have the point further examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the possibility that some statutory instruments to which the Bill will apply may inadvertently be <Col N="1347" /> omitted from publication in the prescribed series or may be so published but without an official number, provision is made in Sections 3 (2) and 4 (2) that the validity of any such instrument will not be affected by such an omission.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Section 3 (3) of the Bill to ensure that contravention of a statutory instrument will not be punishable as a criminal offence unless adequate publicity has been given to the instrument when made, and a defendant charged with contravening a statutory instrument must be acquitted unless it is shown that reasonable steps were taken before the date of the alleged offence to bring the purport of the instrument either to the notice of the public as a whole or to the notice of persons likely to be affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this is a Bill to which this House should give very careful consideration.  It is a Bill to regulate the manner in which Orders made by Ministers, made by the Government, made by civil servants, become effective as if they were Acts of the Oireachtas.  The position in the past has been very unsatisfactory. Orders and regulations have been made which have the effect of a statute without adequate steps being taken to bring their effect to the public notice. I believe it was argued in court in one case that there was no obligation to produce to the court an Order under which the State was prosecuting.  The question to which the Minister adverted in his speech as to the application of the Rules Publication Act was raised in the Supreme Court on two occasions, of which I have some recollection. I referred to these two instances when I asked this House to appoint a committee, some time last year, for the purpose of examining Orders tabled in this House.  You will remember that in one case a judge of the Supreme Court said emphatically that the Rules Publication Act, 1893, was in full force and effect in this State. Another judge of the Supreme Court, at a later date, said exactly what the Minister has just said now, that the Rules Publication Act was never <Col N="1348" /> adequately or effectively adapted in this State.  It is a very unsatisfactory condition of affairs when two judges of equal status hold conflicting views in relation to an Act such as the Rules Publication Act, 1893.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to what the Rules Publication Act requires.  Sub-section (1) of Section 1 provides as follows:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At least 40 days before making any statutory rules to which this section applies, notice of the proposal to make the rules, and of the place where copies of the draft rules may be obtained, shall be published in the <i>London Gazette.</i>&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the position and is still the position in Great Britain in respect of the making of rules or regulations to which the Rules Publication Act applies.  The Rules Publication Act did not apply to all instruments made under authority of statute.  Sub-section (4) of Section 1 of the Act of 1893 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The statutory rules to which this section applies are those made in pursuance of any Act of Parliament which directs the statutory rules to be laid before Parliament but do not include any statutory rules if the same or a draft thereof are required to be laid before Parliament for any period before the rules come into operation nor do they include rules made by the Local Government Board for England or Ireland, the Board of Trade or the revenue departments or by or for the purposes of the Post Office nor rules made by the Board of Agriculture under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878 and the Acts amending the same.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of these reservations, the Act of 1893, so far as Great Britain was concerned, applies to all instruments made under authority of statute and the main effect of the application of the Act to any particular rule or regulation was that the rule or regulation concerned would be tabled 40 days before it became operative.  It has been argued that it would be impracticable to apply that regulation here&mdash;in other words, it would be impracticable in the generality of cases to have rules <Col N="1349" /> and regulations made under statute tabled for a period of 40 days.  That may be true but certainly this House has an obligation placed upon it to ensure that some equivalent provision shall be inserted in our legislation to ensure that the public who are affected by these rules and regulations will know of their existence and will have an opportunity of making themselves acquainted with rules and regulations which affect their daily lives.</P>
    <P>I want now to draw attention to what is substituted in this Bill for the Act of 1893.</P>
    <P>The operative section for the purpose of the point I am now making is Section 3, which provides:-</P>
    <P>(1)  The following provisions shall apply in respect of every statutory instrument to which this Act primarily applies&mdash;</P>
    <P>and the provisions enumerated are three in number.  The first provision is:-</P>
    <P>(a)  as soon as may be after it is made, it shall, notwithstanding that it is liable to be annulled, be printed under the superintendence of the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>What is meant by &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; I do not know, but it seems to me a very loose term and that it is designedly left loose so that there may be a good deal of elbow room in carrying into effect the provisions of Section 3 of this Bill.  The sub-section goes on:-</P>
    <P>(b)  as soon as may be after it has been printed, notice of the making thereof and of the place where copies thereof may be obtained shall be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>,</P>
    <P>(c)  as on and from the date of the issue of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> containing the said notice, copies of the said statutory instrument shall be kept at the place specified in the said notice and may be obtained there.</P>
    <P>That section seems to contemplate that, as soon as may be after an Order or regulation is made, it shall be printed, somebody in the Government offices determining for himself what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;; and then, as soon as may be after <Col N="1350" /> it has been printed, a notice to the effect that it has been printed will be published and that notice will set out the place where copies of the Order may be obtained.</P>
    <P>Then we have this gem, in sub-section (2) of Section 3:-</P>
    <P>Subject to sub-section (3) of this section the validity or effect or the coming into operation of any statutory instrument to which this Act primarily applies shall not be affected by any non-compliance with sub-section (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if, as soon as may be after it is made, the Order is not printed, or, having been printed, as soon as may be afterwards notice of its making is not published in the official gazette, and if copies cannot be obtained, that does not matter, as under this sub-section the instrument is still valid, subject to the provisions of sub-section (3) of this section&mdash;the sub-section to which the Minister referred a moment ago&mdash;which offers a defence to a person who is prosecuted for a contravention of an Order or regulation which has not been printed.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a person (in this sub-section referred to as the defendant) is charged with the offence of contravening (whether by act or omission) a provision in a statutory instrument to which this Act primarily applies, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the defendant proves that, at the date of the alleged contravention, notice of the making of the said statutory instrument had not been published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>,</P>
    <P>the charge shall be dismissed; unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that at the said date reasonable steps had been taken for the purpose of bringing the purport of the said instrument to the notice of the public or of persons likely to be affected by it or of the defendant.</P>
    <P>At best, it can be said that this is a halfhearted measure for the purpose of pretending that Government Departments <Col N="1351" /> and other authorities&mdash;it applies to more than Government Departments &mdash;are in fact complying with traditional practice, whereas in fact there are wide loopholes enabling them to avoid that practice.  We are dealing with something which affects the lives of every citizen just as intimately as would any statute debated in both Houses and subject to amendment by both Houses and which gets wide publicity in the process of enactment.  We are dealing with instruments, Orders and regulations made in Government offices, not always by a Minister.  Certain instruments may, under statute, be made by specified civil servants.</P>
    <P>I think it will be found that, in the case of the Supplies and Services Bill, which will probably come before us in a week or two, provision is made&mdash;certainly, provision was made in the Emergency Powers Act&mdash;enabling specified officers down to the rank of assistant secretary to make Orders having the effect of law, Orders under which State officers could institute proceedings, Orders which enable and authorise and, in fact, coerce the courts of justice to send men to prison.  These Orders are made without any publicity whatever. Under this Bill, publicity may or may not be assured.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion an Order affecting the unemployment benefits of thousands of people, made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, having actually expired before a copy was tabled in either House of the Oireachtas.  There was power to annul the Order had it been tabled, but the opportunity for its annulment had elapsed before it was tabled, as the Order had ceased to be operative, a period of eight or nine months having elapsed before it was tabled.</P>
    <P>There is another loophole here, in sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of Section 2. It commences:-</P>
    <P>Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it is proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, proposed by a Minister or a State Department or by any other authority entitled to make rules to which this Act applies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" />&mdash;&mdash;to make a particular statutory instrument, and</P>
    <P>(b)  a question arises whether that statutory instrument, if made, will or will not be, by virtue of sub-section (1) of this section, a statutory instrument to which this Act primarily applies,</P>
    <P>the question may be referred to the Attorney-General for his decision and the decision of the Attorney-General thereon shall be final.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept the view expressed by the Minister that there is a certain kind of Order of some local application or that it may be an Order made by the Defence Forces which should not be published.  The type of Orders which should not be published should be specifically set out in the Bill, so that this House may be conversant with the provisions relating to such Orders.  Above all, the Attorney-General is not a Minister and although he holds an independent position under the Constitution he is appointed at the will and pleasure of the Government, and I consider it to be most improper that he should be the sole person to decide whether an Order should be made public or not.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, a question arises at some time or other in relation to the publication of Statutory Rules and Orders.  That is more particularly true where the Order does not have effect until publication has been assured.  In Great Britain, where a short cut is taken in these matters, the Department concerned is obliged by statute to report the fact to the Chairman of each House of Parliament that the Order has been published.  The law on the matter in Britain now is set out in an Act of 1946, chapter 36 of that year, an Act which became law on the 26th of March, 1946.  I draw attention to Section 4 (1) which, although it is pretty long, I would like to quote :</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1)  Where by this Act or any Act passed after the commencement of this Act any statutory instrument is required to be laid before Parliament after being made, a copy of the instrument shall be laid before each House of Parliament and, subject as hereinafter provided, shall be so laid before the instrument comes into operation:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> Provided that if it is essential that any such instrument should come into operation before copies thereof can be so laid as aforesaid, the instrument may be made so as to come into operation before it has been so laid; and where any statutory instrument comes into operation before it is laid before Parliament, notification shall forthwith be sent to the Lord Chancellor and to the Speaker of the House of Commons drawing attention to the fact that copies of the instrument have yet to be laid before Parliament and explaining why such copies were not so laid before the instrument came into operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the great care which the British Parliament takes of the right of the public to know what is being done and the great care it takes to assert the supremacy of Parliament in making rules and regulations to govern the lives of the citizens.</P>
    <P>The ordinary practice in Britain is that no rule, order or regulation made under statute shall ordinarily have effect or come into force unless and until it is laid before both Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>If for some reason or other it is found necessary to have an order or regulation brought into force before it can conveniently be laid before Parliament &mdash;for instance, Parliament may not be sitting and it may be necessary to do something while Parliament is in recess &mdash;and in such circumstances Parliament specifically provides that the order may come into force before it is presented to Parliament.  In such a case notification must be given to the Lord Chancellor, in the case of the House of Lords, and to the Speaker in the case of the House of Commons, stating the reasons why the order was put in force before it was laid before Parliament.</P>
    <P>This Bill is concerned not merely with the numbering of statutory rules and Orders.  It is not concerned merely with the gathering together and the publication of these rules and Orders in an approved form, but is concerned primarily with ensuring that both Houses of the Oireachtas will be made aware of what is being done under the <Col N="1354" /> authority conferred by the statutes which we enact, and with the manner in which these statutes are implemented by the Orders made by Ministers, Government Departments, and public authorities.  The numbering, the gathering together, and the publication of these instruments is only incidental to the main purpose of the Bill, which, as I have said, is the measure by which we ensure that both Houses of the Oireachtas will have control over delegated legislation.  That control will be ineffective if we permit the Bill to go through in its present form, particularly having regard to the provision in sub-section (2) of Section 3 which specifically provides that, notwithstanding the fact that the law is complied with the Order remains in force.  There is no time table prescribed in relation to publication.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, the normal practice in Great Britain is that the order and the regulation must be tabled in both Houses before becoming effective.  In this case, it becomes effective automatically once it is made, and then it will be printed &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and, on being printed, notification of its existence will be published in the gazette &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  &ldquo;As soon as may be&rdquo; means 12 months, six months or three months, and during all that time this law is in force this regulation is effective, and this House has no authority over it, even where the power of annulment has been guaranteed by the statute.</P>
    <P>The appeal that I make to the House is that we ought to be jealous of the power conferred by the Constitution on both Houses of the Oireachtas, the power to make laws for the good government of this country, and the power to make laws in the interests of the masses of the people.  It is merely incidental that these laws prescribe punishment and penalties in respect of individuals.  The main purpose of all our law is to ensure the happiness and well-being of the people as a whole, and to protect them in their lives and property.  At the same time, in order to give that protection which is guaranteed by the Constitution it <Col N="1355" /> becomes necessary to prescribe penalties for those who neglect their obligations to the community and those who commit offences forbidden by the Oireachtas.  In applying these penalties we should be scrupulously careful to ensure that they are applied in a manner which has the approval of both Houses, and in no other manner. We can secure that our desires are complied with only in so far as we keep a close check on the making of rules and regulations by public authorities.</P>
    <P>There is one minor point to which I would like to refer before I conclude. Senators will remember that, in a debate last year, the question arose as to whether a regulation made under statute, if it were to be annulled, must be annulled in its entirety, or whether it would be permissible to annul a portion of the regulation.  Senators will observe that in all the Statutes that have been enacted here there is a common formula in relation to the annulment of rules and regulations which runs something like this: &ldquo;rules made under this statute shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by either House within 21 days after the Order is so laid.&rdquo;  About a year ago I made the point that, while a regulation might be acceptable to this House in all its aspects, except on one minor point, there is no alternative except to annul the whole regulation if we dislike any part of it.  It was argued against me by some members of the House that it is permissible to put down a motion for the annulment of a paragraph or a section of a regulation so made.  I doubt if that is so.  It has never been tried, and I cannot say what the ruling of the Chair would be if it was tried.  But here is an opportunity for the Minister to remove all doubt in the matter by inserting a sub-section in this Bill providing that a regulation capable of annulment, which is laid before both Houses, may be annulled in whole or in part.  I would urge on the Minister before this Bill leaves the House to have the matter examined for the purpose of considering whether it is not desirable that a provision of the kind I have mentioned should not be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this Bill raises a very much wider issue than appears on the surface.  It raises a question of extreme importance, the extent to which it is possible to maintain any kind of effective democratic control over the increasingly large amount of legislation made by Order, and not directly subject to discussion and control by Parliament.  The problem is not peculiar to this country. It is one of the most urgent problems of democracy as a whole.  I should like to see a commission or a committee set up which would have on it one or two experienced judges, a few members of each House with considerable legislative experience, and a few senior civil servants, who would make recommendations, as to the best way in which Parliamentary control might be maintained and, at the same time, recommend what was essential from the point of view of justice and fair play to individuals who might be affected by such legislation.  It is not a simple matter.</P>
      <P>As far as this Bill is concerned, when I read it, it immediately struck me that we were giving far too drastic powers to the Attorney-General.  I recognise that the Attorney-General's office may be the best place from which suggestions should come, as to the kind of statutory instruments which are law&mdash; although not passed through Parliament in the ordinary way&mdash;but need not be printed.  It seems to me that it is not sufficient to leave the question there.  I believe that in the other House the question whether this was within the provisions of the Constitution was raised.  That is a legal point upon which I will not express an opinion.  I understand the Minister expects to make a statement on the Committee Stage which I will be interested to hear.  Whether it is constitutional or not, I do not think it to be a desirable practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a provision in the Bill, where the Attorney-General makes an Order exempting from printing any specific type of Order or statutory instrument, that notice should be sent to every member of each House to the effect that he has done so.  That is the kind of Order to which the attention <Col N="1357" /> of members of the Parliament should be drawn, so that they could go to the Library to see it, and find out whether it was of importance, of purely local interest or of minor interest.  I suggest that if the Attorney-General is to have these powers they should be subject to ratification by Parliament, that Orders which are not going to be printed should be placed in the Library and notice sent out, mentioning the names of the Orders which the Attorney-General decided need not be printed.</P>
    <P>The effect would be to draw the attention of members to the matter so that it could be raised if necessary.  I expect that it would rarely occur where it was felt that the Order was one of relative unimportance, in which no one would be interested except a Department and a few other persons.  It is recognised that some such Bill as this is necessary because of contrary decisions in the courts.  I should like to see the Minister accepting an amendment limiting the duration of this Bill to one year, with a view to bringing it in after the election for discussion, when more time could be given to it.  It is a measure of very considerable importance and of great interest to those interested in the principle of legislation generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill requires a good deal of consideration, which I daresay it will get on the Committee Stage. There are some difficulties to which I wish to draw attention.  On the position of the Attorney-General, I say that that would be all right provided his decision would be given within a certain period of making an Order.  It would not do to suggest, if prosecutions were brought, that the Attorney-General had given his decision that it was not necessary to print a particular Order, to have that Order made evidence in a court of law, in which he would be the prosecutor.  If a decision were given in good time it would be a good idea.  We have too much printing of documents. It would be well to dispense with printing where they are merely of a temporary nature or refer to a particular locality.  The Bill states that primarily it applies to every statutory instrument <Col N="1358" /> which is made on or after the 1st day of January, 1948.  It refers to different Acts and states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Rules Publication Act, 1893, is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot see what provision is made for Orders that applied when the Act of 1893 was in force, which is now to be repealed from the 1st of January next. Section 3 (1) (a) reads:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  as soon as may be after it is made, it shall, notwithstanding that it is liable to be annulled, be printed under the superintendence of the Stationery Office,</P>
      <P>(b)  as soon as may be after it has been printed, notice of the making thereof and of the place where copies thereof may be obtained shall be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>,</P>
      <P>(c)  as on and from the date of the issue of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> containing the said notice, copies of the said statutory instrument shall be kept at the place specified in the said notice and may be obtained there.</P>
      <P>(2)  Subject to sub-section (3) of this section the validity or effect or the coming into operation of any statutory instrument to which this Act primarily applies shall not be affected by any non-compliance with sub-section (1) of this section.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person (in this sub-section referred to as the defendant) is charged with the offence of contravening (whether by act or omission) a provision in a statutory instrument to which this Act primarily applies, and,</P>
      <P>(b)  the defendant proves that, at the date of the alleged contravention, notice of the making of the said statutory instrument had not been published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the charge shall be dismissed, unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that at the said date reasonable steps had been taken for the purpose of bringing the purport of the said instrument <Col N="1359" /> to the notice of the public or of persons likely to be affected by it or of the defendant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why should it lie with the defendant to prove that it was not published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>?</P>
    <P>Is it not for the prosecution to prove that it was printed?  Is it not a fact that a statutory instrument cannot be used in evidence in court unless it is proved that it was published?  Here the defendant is asked to prove that it has not been published.  He would have to go through all copies of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> for years and be able to state that he had examined them and could not find the Order.  That seems to me to be wrong and to be changing the rules of evidence.  The law should be that it was the duty of the prosecutor to prove that the statutory instrument had full force and effect as soon as published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and that copies were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Very often a provision is made that an Order is laid on the Tables of both Houses for 21 days, during which it may be annulled.  Is it not after the expiration of the 21 days that publication should appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>? That would be evidence in itself that the Order had been laid before both Houses, and not been annulled, and had been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I should like the Minister to consider these points before the next stage, and to see if it will not be necessary, under this Bill, to provide for Orders made under old statutes subject to the Act of 1893, which is being repealed.</P>

      <P>I wish strongly to support Senator Duffy in emphasising the importance of this whole question. It has become a matter of very great importance in the Parliament across the water.  After all, I think we have a right to follow them in matters that are considered of importance in an old and long-established Parliament, which has served as a model for most of our Standing Orders and Parliamentary procedure.  What is this question we are dealing with?  We are dealing with law-making on an increasing <Col N="1360" /> degree in a form that is subject to little or no control by the Legislature.  That is very important.  I hold that an Order made in this way is, in effect, an Act of Parliament.  Who determines as to how it comes into being and the very important character it possesses? Let me give an instance of what in practice happens.  I am not concerned so much with the background of law as affecting this whole question.  I am concerned in the way it appears to the ordinary plain man and, in addition, to the experienced lawyer.</P>
      <P>We give power to a Minister to make a number of regulations, sometimes within a prescribed policy and sometimes within no policy.  Only last week, we gave a Minister power to make regulations on a matter which he regarded as insignificant, but which others regard as of great importance, with no indication of policy whatever.  What control would either House have over regulations which that Minister proposed to make?  I know that this House has the power of annulment. What have individual Senators got in their possession when they wish to exercise that power?  They have nothing in many cases but a single copy of the Order in typescript which can be feretted out in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only notice they have of that Order is an entry on the Order Paper which they get before the sitting of the House.  I have been watching with some interest the sequence of events connected with an Order, and I ask the Minister to tell us if there is any connection in time between the making of the Order and its tabling in the House, because, until the Order is tabled, nothing is known about it.  I understand from Senator Duffy, who has gone into this in more detail than I have, that there is no obligation to lay an Order within a prescribed time. When an Order is laid, there is notification to a select few, members of both Houses&mdash;and they are the only people who know&mdash;who are energetic enough, and, I might say, suspicious enough and knowledgeable enough to read between the lines of the very bald statement on the agenda and frequently these statements on the agenda make no reference even to the statute under <Col N="1361" /> which the Order is made.  On to-day's Order Paper, there is reference to the Tillage Order, 1947, with no indication of the enactment, the Wild Birds (County Kerry) Order, Onions (Regulation) Order, and so on.  In many cases, the information given on the Order Paper is very scanty&mdash;I suppose there are practical difficulties in the way of putting too much there&mdash;but you get after a time, an unstated period, an Order which you can if you choose to go to the Library, but surely the important point for us is when we get the print of the Order.</P>
    <P>If I want to annul an Order and I have nothing but the one copy of that Order in the Library, it is absurd to ask me to raise a debate on the subject on the basis of one copy which no member can see unless he goes to the Library.  It may be said that it is only a short period before the printed copy is circulated to every member.  A short time&mdash;I ask you!  I have here an Order dated January, laid on the Table, I do not know when, but received by me on August 14th, eight months after the Order was made.  The House has sat for 21 sitting days after its tabling and it would be futile to tell me that it is practical politics to seek to annul that Order.  By the time I knew of it, unless I chose to see it in the Library, 21 sitting days would have elapsed and the House would have lost all power to annul that Order which may or may not be important, but which is an Order, an instrument, which is an Act of Parliament.  It has been made by Ministerial direction.</P>
    <P>This subject is one of great and growing importance.  Here we are looking at it rather through the eyes of the Act of 1893, but a lot of water has flowed along the river since 1893. In 1893, there was a tiny trickle of legislation in this form; now it has assumed the proportions of a flood, and it is most important that the question should be looked at systematically in the light of present conditions and that the Houses of the Oireachtas, in their own interests, should put their heads together to see that they have effective control over these instruments, and indeed not only over these instruments but over the promptitude <Col N="1362" /> of the publication of Orders and of Bills as well.</P>
    <P>Lately, a question arose in a certain institution in which I am interested of getting Bills examined by lawyers with a view to having early information of measures that may affect the institution concerned.  We were told that they can only be adequately examined by members of either House.  Why? Because it is not possible to get from the Stationery Office copies of Bills within a reasonable time after their printing, and the same applies to Orders.  We are told that in some cases Orders are available in the Stationery Office in &ldquo;roneoed&rdquo; form, but they are soon sold out if they deal with important subjects and citizens cannot get them.  We know how the Chief Justice and officers of the courts were unable to get a particular Order and this whole question is put aside as a matter of minor importance.  It is a matter of very great fundamental importance, dealing with the rights of and the control by a democratic Parliament of its own laws and I hope that on the Committee Stage these various questions will be examined much more closely than they have been examined in the other House with a view to trying to get some clarity into the whole question.</P>
    <P>With regard to the phrases used in these Orders, it would take a person sitting in a judicial capacity on the Bench to interpret such a phrase as &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;, and I hope that Senator O'Dea will help us as to how a phrase of that kind would present itself to a district justice or a judge. The whole thing has become thoroughly loose and thoroughly dangerous.  It is the beginning of the supercession of Parliament by the bureaucratic authority.  What better authority on this point have we than Lord Hewart, who was Lord Chief Justice in England and who wrote a book on the whole subject of the dangers of a delegated legislation which he called &ldquo;The New Democracy.&rdquo;  There is also a most elaborate and voluminous publication of the Parliamentary body which inquired into this question in England. Incidentally, there is also the ambiguity <Col N="1363" /> of language which one finds in this whole procedure.</P>
    <P>You have a number of expressions used indiscriminately.  You have the words &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;rule&rdquo; without any distinction of meaning.  You have the term &ldquo;article&rdquo; also used indiscriminately and all this confusion tends to increase the power of the Ministers and their advisers and weaken the power of Parliamentary control.  I do hope that this matter will be gone into seriously by the House on the Committee Stage and that the whole question will be examined in closer detail.  There was raised in the Dáil the question of the constitutional power of the Attorney-General to circulate Orders.  I wonder what the Minister's view on that is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, I see you are not yet in the position to answer the point.  I think there are very grave dangers in giving power to the Attorney-General in that matter. There may be a small number of people affected but it may be just as important for the few as for the many. As a matter of fact the few are often much more important than the many when it comes to a matter of reality. I do not understand this question of the serial number.  Why cannot all Orders follow in sequence and why cannot the Orders not published be marked with an asterisk so that if there is a gap between Orders 150 and 153 we will know that these others were Orders that were made but were not published. It is far simpler, I think, to indicate the Orders that are not published by numbering all the Orders in sequence and putting an asterisk on the ones not published.  I think I have said enough to impress on the House the great importance of delegating legislation. It is very essential and long overdue to have some machinery for providing that we get those Orders as soon as they are published so that we can examine them.  While not asking the House to reject the Bill I certainly do ask the House to examine this Bill on the Committee Stage with scrupulous care.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>This Bill was introduced <Col N="1364" /> because the existing state of affairs is unsatisfactory.  As Senators are aware, it provides for the publication in serial order of all the various rules and regulations.  The points raised by Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Duffy should be taken up in connection with the Bills that give power to make these Orders.  This is a Bill to regulate the Orders which have been made, and the question of delegating legislation does not arise here at all.  With a view to remedying some, at least, of the unsatisfactory conditions referred to in the introductory note to the register of administrative law and so as to have Statutory Rules and Orders readily accessible, a number of sets of all Statutory Rules and Orders made in the years 1922 to 1938 were collected and bound in 23 volumes by the Stationery Office, and sets have been deposited in various libraries, including the Oireachtas Library, the National Library, the Law Library of the Four Courts, etc.  A comprehensive index to these volumes was also prepared and placed on sale. Separate copies of Orders and Rules listed in this index are available for purchase from the Stationery Office. Sets of Statutory Rules and Orders made in the period 1939 to 1945 have also been assembled in volumes and these are at present being bound.  An index to these Statutory Rules and Orders (made in the period 1939 to 1945) has been prepared and is at present with the printers.  When printed it will be put on sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also the intention to publish and place on sale volumes of Statutory Rules and Orders made in 1946 and subsequent years.  As from 1948 the volumes of statutory instruments will be published annually.  As, I say, this whole question is not one for discussion on this particular Bill.  It should be taken up on any Bill which empowers the Minister or officials to make Orders.  There are certain Orders which must be approved of by both Houses, others must simply be laid on the Table of both Houses and may be annulled within 21 days.  I do not know what particular steps are taken to bring these Orders to the notice of the Oireachtas. <Col N="1365" /> Whether they are sent to the members or not, I am not sure, but they are certainly placed in the Library and it should be possible for any member of the Oireachtas to get copies of them before the 21 days have expired.  I think that should be possible.  Now coming down to the Act of 1893, we had this question raised in the form of an amendment in the other House and I pointed out that in this country the Act was never observed.  In England, Section 1, which provides for 40 days' notice to enable authorities affected to make representations was side-stepped, I am told, by resorting to Section 2, which gives the right to make provisional Orders which have immediate effect.  That is probably what was responsible for this other Act quoted by Senator Duffy, the 1946 Act.  In this country it has to be put on the Table of the House before it takes effect.  The point about the Attorney-General having the right to determine what Orders should be printed was raised in the other House and it was suggested that it would be unconstitutional to give him such power.  If that is so, we will remedy the position.  I intend to deal with that matter on the Committee Stage.  Senator Douglas wanted the Bill limited to one year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>Well, this Bill came along in the ordinary course and I was hoping to start off the New Year with it and have it taking effect on January the 1st, if we could.  I see no objection to limiting it if it is necessary but I do not think it is necessary.  Senator O'Dea seemed to think that the onus of proof is on the defendant but what is stated there is that if he can show that an Order was not published, he must be acquitted, the charge must be dismissed. If the Senator looks at Section 3 (3) he will see that if the defendant proves that, at the date of the alleged contravention, notice of the making of the said statutory instrument had not been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, the charge shall be dismissed, unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that at the said date reasonable steps had been taken for the purpose <Col N="1366" /> of bringing the purport of the said instrument to the notice of the public or of persons likely to be affected by it or of the defendant.  I think that puts the onus on the prosecution, surely, and the defendant may adopt the line of defence that that was not done.  If it was not, then it is not that the penalty may be mitigated but the charge must be dismissed.  That was never in these Acts before.  It is a distinct improvement on the existing provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

      <P>The first point I object to is that the defendant must prove it has not been published.  The defendant should never be asked to prove that an Order or regulation had not been published.  It is for the prosecution to prove that it had been published before it becomes effective.</P>

      <P>The prosecution must prove that.  Why do you ask the defendant to prove that?  Before a case is made against him he will have to get into a box, in fact, and prove that he has made a search and that there is no such publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of that regulation.  That seems an absurdity.  Why should the defendant have to go into the box to prove anything unless a case is made against him?  It cannot be made against him under an Order unless it is proved by the prosecution that that Order is effective.</P>

The onus is on the prosecution, as I read out, but the defendant can make the point that that was not published and, if he can show that it was not published, it is a line of defence left open to him.  He is not required to do it but the prosecutor is required to show that reasonable steps were taken to bring the existence of this Order to the notice of persons likely to be affected.  That is the onus on him but the defendant has that line of defence open to him.  That may be a Committee point.</P>

      <P>In regard to Senator O'Dea's point about the printing of the old Orders, we are doing what we can about having them put into a number of volumes.  That has been done and the others from 1939 to 1946 are being printed with an index and we hope to have them annually printed.  In modern times, when the State has to interfere so often in matters that it had not to do, say, 50 years ago, it would be simply impossible for any Government to carry on unless they had some such power, with, of course, the checks that are there.  Some of these Orders are of very local and personal application.</P>
      <P>There are such things as Civil Service examinations that only affect a very limited number of people.  Others only affect certain districts, and so on. I think it will be found that modern Parliaments could not carry on if such powers were not there.  There is some way of checking them.  Certain Orders can be annulled.  Others cannot be annulled.  There is, for instance, the Rule-Making Committee in the courts. They make rules and they do not come here at all and we have no power to upset them.  I think modern society could not carry on unless such powers were there.  About 200 years ago all the Government had to do was to keep order.  Everyone looked after himself so far as business was concerned.  Now the Government are being called on every day to interfere and regulate and, without such powers as these, I do not see how it could be done.  The whole question that was dealt with at length by Senator Duffy and Senator Sir John Keane is one that should be dealt with in relation to the Acts which give the power.  This is merely arranging for publication and to make for the convenience of the public.</P>

    <P>Committee Stage ordered for next sitting day.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Poultry Hatcheries Bill," RHead="1947&mdash;Second Stage">
    <Title>Poultry Hatcheries Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has the twofold object of ensuring, first, that the eggs used for hatching in poultry hatcheries are derived from flocks of suitable type and quality which are free from disease, and, second, that the production and distribution of chicks by hatcheries are carried out under conditions calculated to reduce to a minimum the danger of spreading disease.</P>
      <P>In recent years the older system of hatching eggs on the farm, either by natural means or in incubators, is tending to be replaced by the distribution of day-old chicks from large-scale commercial hatcheries.  Some 24 large commercial hatcheries are already in operation in different parts of the country and the establishment of a good many more in the near future may be expected.  The sale of day-old chicks is also engaged in by a considerable number of poultry-keepers throughout the country who have facilities for artificial incubation.</P>
      <P>Although the establishment of commercial hatcheries is a very desirable development, there is no doubt that the danger of outbreaks of disease on a large scale in poultry flocks will increase as such hatcheries grow in size and number.  There is at present no control over the sources from which the eggs used in hatcheries are obtained or the conditions under which incubation is carried out and chicks are distributed.  The same remark applies to other distributors of chicks, except where these are holders of poultry stations under my Department's poultry stations scheme.  However, hatchery owners or poultry-keepers may exercise no discrimination in the selection of eggs for incubation, in which event the chicks distributed would be of very doubtful quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> It was recommended by the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy that distributors of hatching eggs and day-old chicks should be licensed under conditions to be determined by the Department of Agriculture and that holders of hatchery licences should be prohibited from incubating eggs other than those derived from flocks certified to be blood-tested and free from disease.</P>
    <P>It is provided that, when the Bill is enacted, the Act shall come into operation at such times as may be fixed by Order of the Minister for Agriculture. The present intention is that the Act will be brought into operation in two stages, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>First Stage: This will be taken as soon as practicable after the enactment of the Bill and will include the operation of Parts I, II, IV and Sections 15 to 18 in Part III of the Act.  During this stage, poultry hatcheries, other than those classes that may be excepted, will be prohibited from operating except under licence to be issued each year subject to such conditions as the Minister for Agriculture may think proper.  Provision is made in the Bill for the Minister to make regulations exempting from the licensing requirements hatcheries of certain classes to be defined in such regulations, for example, hatcheries which do not engage in the production of chicks for sale or of which the hatching capacity is less than a specified minimum.  Egg supplies for licensed hatcheries will have to be obtained from farms the owners of which have been granted &ldquo;provisional permits&rdquo; each year to supply eggs to licensed hatcheries.  This &ldquo;provisional permit&rdquo; arrangement is intended to be temporary.  It was devised to get over the initial difficulty presented by the fact that hatcheries are getting eggs from many farms that are not of the standard that will ultimately be required for &ldquo;approved egg supply farms&rdquo;.  Accordingly, so as not to disorganise the working of existing hatcheries, it will be necessary for some time to grant &ldquo;provisional permits&rdquo; to many of these farms and so give them the opportunity to qualify as &ldquo;approved&rdquo; farms.  The provisional permit period will also afford an opportunity <Col N="1370" /> of determining the reliability and honesty of the owners of existing hatching-egg supply farms.</P>
    <P>Second Stage: When this is reached, after the first stage has been developed for some years, licensed hatcheries will not be allowed to purchase eggs for hatching from any farm which has not been &ldquo;approved&rdquo; each year as an egg supply farm.  At this point the system of granting provisional permits will cease.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Minister for Agriculture may authorise persons to be inspectors for the purposes of the Act.  A number of inspectors will have to be appointed on the headquarters staff of the Department of Agriculture and it is also intended to ask the County Committees of Agriculture to consent to having their poultry instructors authorised to be inspectors for the purposes of the Act.  I anticipate that the Committees of Agriculture will, in general, be prepared to agree to that course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With the two-fold aim of this Bill, as outlined by the Minister, I am in entire agreement.  I can visualise the difficulties and dangers that he foresees.  However, with his method of dealing with those dangers, even though it has the backing of the Committee on Post-War Agricultural Policy, I am in entire disagreement. I accept that it is absolutely necessary to provide many of the things not in this Bill but by means of Ministerial regulations. Certain of the lines on which he wishes and on which it is very desirable that poultry hatcheries should operate clearly must vary from time to time and could not be included in a permanent enactment.  Therefore, I am with him to the extent that these requirements should be set down, designated and regulated by Orders and regulations.  Where I differ with him is at that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see why it is not possible to provide that the Minister will be given the power to make regulations to determine the manner in which hatcheries shall operate, so that in their operation they will not increase the dangers to which he has referred, without introducing <Col N="1371" /> a system of licensing.  It seems to me that it should be possible to operate the Bill in such a way as to ensure that there would be regulations and Orders, breaches of which could and should be visited with the strongest possible penalties in the ordinary way.  Instead of that, the Minister&mdash;and I admit quite frankly he is working on the precedent of the committee's report&mdash;is choosing to adopt a system by virtue of which an unnamed executive officer in his Department&mdash;and here I am not casting any aspersion on any official&mdash;hearing only one side of the case, is going to determine whether a man may or may not carry on what is, perhaps, his only means of livelihood, in which he may have sunk a great deal of capital.  It seems to me contrary to the principle of justice and of fair play that that could be provided.</P>
    <P>We can all understand that, during an emergency, a system of licences of that nature may be necessary, but here we are dealing with an enactment which is to be part and parcel of our permanent law.  We have now reached in this Bill a further extension of the power of executive control, by virtue of which a Government Department is to be able to determine whether A shall carry on business and whether B shall not carry on business.  That appears to be undesirable.  It may be dealt with in the way I suggest, by regulations from month to month providing the things the Minister considers desirable and necessary.</P>
    <P>In considering the liberty of the ordinary commercial individual, it does not mean that in the exercise of his own liberty he is entitled to transgress on the liberty of others.  If he is spreading disease, the dangers to which the Minister has rightly referred, it is proper that his liberty should be curtailed; but I suggest that it should be done in the correct way, that the penalty should be imposed in the open.  No matter how well-intentioned any official may be, he is clearly only going to see one side of the picture. We are all human and liable to make mistakes.  One of the reasons why courts as such provide a barrier against <Col N="1372" /> mistakes is that they do their work in the open, in the full light of the public, having to weigh and consider both sides of the evidence.</P>
    <P>I want to say very deliberately that, in the case of this Bill, when a licence is withdrawn there should be a provision by which there would be the right of appeal to the district court or the circuit court.  There should, at any rate, be some appeal board which would be over and above the Minister's Department.  This is not a question that is going to affect any particular Party that happens to be the Government for the time being.  It is a question which affects a person who may be deprived of his livelihood.  He should have the right of explaining the reasons which operated on his mind in a particular set of circumstances.  If there was an appeal board he would have a better chance of explaining that these circumstances were what he alleged and were not what the inspector of the county committee had alleged.  It is difficult to see how, within the framework of this Bill, that important reservation for the right of the individual can be protected except by the setting up of an appeal board.  Personally, I would have preferred the other way in which the Minister would impose stringent penalties, including a penalty such as that in the Road Traffic Act under which a person can be disqualified from driving his car.  I would have preferred something on that line without, however, going as far as that, but I do think it is essential that there should be some appeal board to ensure that a person will not be deprived of his livelihood merely by Executive action.  I am quite prepared to admit that such a thing can be done quite innocently by a Government Department which does not know the full facts.  The individual should have the right to bring the full facts of his case not only to the attention, but to get the decision ultimately, of a person who is above the Executive, because the courts stand between the State on the one hand and the individual on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with everything the last speaker has said.  The principle at issue here is <Col N="1373" /> fundamental.  In this Bill the Minister is taking power to licence an operation that may spread disease.  One does not need a lot of imagination to think of the number of operations that, if carried out wrongly, are calculated to spread disease.  For example, in the case of the bottling of stout, if dirty vessels are used, that may help to spread disease.</P>

      <P>As Senator Sweetman has so well stated there is a fundamental principle at issue in this, and on that basis it should be examined.  I know that this is the totalitarian method of doing business.  It is not the method of a free, democratic State, and there is a fundamental difference between the two.  If the Minister says that he approves of these Soviet and Nazi methods, that is all right, but if, on the other hand, he says that he believes in the liberty of the subject, in Parliamentary control and in the rule of law, then he can never be privy to methods of this kind.  I am worried that these things are so lightly regarded.  Here the Minister comes along and, on a matter that is not of very wide importance perhaps, he gets in the thin edge of the wedge, and before we know where we are it is used as a precedent so that in a short time <Col N="1374" /> a large portion of our national life will be regulated in this way.  That means to say that a Minister can make or unmake you.  He can ruin you and put you out of business.  It is not a question of going to court.</P>
      <P>I need not repeat, although perhaps I had better do so, what was said by Senator Sweetman since the gravity of the principle at stake is so little appreciated by ordinary people and even by members of this House.  Only last week a Senator asked, on another Bill, what was the objection to giving a Minister power to make any regulations he liked.  There is always a very great objection, and the objection is much stronger in the case of this Bill than it was on the one we were discussing last week.  We are told that all that is at stake here is the report of an inspector. That report may result in depriving a person of a business that he has built up, a business in which he has sunk a great deal of capital.</P>
      <P>I notice also that under this Bill the Minister can attach conditions.  They need not be what are called the prescribed conditions, which must be made subject to regulations.  They can be any conditions that the Minister chooses to make.  I do not know if Senator S. O'Donovan is here or not. He said on one occasion that I am always using the word &ldquo;totalitarian&rdquo;. I do not know of any better word to use when dealing with legislation of this kind, legislation which gives the Executive power to make rules that, in fact, supersede the ordinary law.  That is the fundamental objection that I have to this Bill.  There are many details of the Bill that can be discussed on the Committee Stage.  I would like to ask the Minister for an explanation as to whether it is necessary, before I can buy an incubator, to go to him and get an exemption.  That would seem to me to be the position from my reading of the Bill&mdash;that if I want to hatch chickens artificially I have to get an exemption from the Minister.  That shows how this thing of regulation has run mad.  I would like to see this whole matter approached in an entirely different way&mdash;on the lines indicated by the last speaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say very little on this Bill, but to express my amazement at the speech made by Senator Sir John Keane.  If he had in the normal way attacked the Bill, and expressed his disapproval, I suppose nobody would be surprised.  If, as he has done on numerous occasions, he took up the fight for the plain people in this country against people like Paddy Smith, Minister for Agriculture, or any other Minister of the Fianna Fáil Government, none of us would be surprised.  But when he comes along and tells us that he can see no reason why there should be interference in this matter of the poultry industry, any more than there is interference in connection with the dairying industry, or the sale of milk, and matters of that kind, as I understood he meant to convey, the only thing I can say is that I am amazed at his ignorance of conditions, particularly in rural Ireland, and in Ireland as a whole.</P>
      <P>It must be evident to Senator Sir John Keane, as it is to most other people, that there are most stringent regulations regarding the sale of milk, that people cannot supply milk for sale to the public unless their dairies, cowsheds, etc., are approved by the Department of Agriculture.  One would think that this suggestion of licences in connection with the poultry industry was the first step of this kind.  Senator Sir John Keane would describe such a policy as a dictatorial policy of the Department of Agriculture.  One would imagine that it was since the new Minister took charge of the Department of Agriculture that the terrible step had been taken of insisting on licences in any particular industry or in connection with any particular matter over which that Department has control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to refer the Senator to various regulations which have been enforced, not for the past year, not for the past five years, but for the past 20 years in relation to various <Col N="1376" /> matters over which the Department of Agriculture has control.  It is not necessary to go into details, but I should like to remind the Senator that, even to start with sire pigs in the country, they have to be licensed by the Department of Agriculture.  Lest it might take too long to deal with other matters over which the Department of Agriculture has control, I think I am right in suggesting that from the time a pig comes into the world, until it goes into the factory, there is, and has been for years, certain control including actual control in the bacon factory.</P>
    <P>I also find it difficult, as I generally find it difficult, to understand the attitude of Senator Sweetman.  One would imagine that by this time Senator Sweetman would have given up the idea which he obviously had in mind up to one or two years ago, that was, that by some fantastic turn of the wheel of fortune he would some day find himself in the place now occupied by Mr. Paddy Smith, Minister for Agriculture.  God help Ireland if that day ever comes.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman, in his opening remarks, admitted that the Minister, in introducing the Bill, was carrying out the recommendations made by the Committee on Post-War Agricultural Policy.  I could well imagine, and I am sure that most people here could imagine, Senator Sweetman, in his capacity as the protector of the farming community from Paddy Smith, Jim Ryan or any other possible Fianna Fáil Minister, protesting here or at the crossroads that the Minister for Agriculture had neglected to act on the advice given to him by that committee. However, he tries to make the best case he can, but if he thinks he has made a case against this Bill, or has made the successful attack he hoped to make on the Minister for Agriculture, all I can say to him is that he can keep the change.</P>
    <P>With regard to the licensing provision, he set out his objections and said he cannot understand why the Minister could not prevent the spread of disease without bringing in this matter of licensing.  I should like to <Col N="1377" /> ask him why he has not made a suggestion as to how the Minister could prevent the spread of disease otherwise than by the scheme set out in the Bill. It is an old saying that the best hurlers are always on the ditch, but it would be a good job for Senator Sweetman and for the remnants of the Party he represents, if, instead of indulging in destructive criticism, they would put forward a little constructive criticism and would do a little thinking before rushing into this or the other House to criticise the men who are, and have been, doing constructive work for the country.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, quite normal, and quite in keeping with the practice of the Senator to suggest, as an alternative to the method proposed in the Bill for dealing with matters of this kind, that provision should be made for people referring their cases to the courts.  I do not want to suggest that Senator Sweetman had any personal interest in the matter.  Not for a moment would he think that, in the dim and distant future, if he did not have direct control of the Department of Agriculture, which obviously he has given up all hope of having, he might at least be able to appear in court and to have another go at the Minister for Agriculture or the people who stand behind him.  If I know the farming community of this country&mdash;and I yield to no man, Senator Sweetman, Senator Sir John Keane, or anybody else, in my knowledge of rural conditions, or the inhabitants of rural Ireland&mdash;I do not think they are quite so ready to rush into the courts as Senator Sweetman would suggest and that does not apply alone to the people of rural Ireland.  People have rushed into the courts, from time to time, and I think that if many of them were asked what they thought about it, they would say: &ldquo;We did not mean to go to the courts, but circumstances arose in which we could not avoid doing so.&rdquo;  I think that many of the wise people, if there are any wise people amongst the people I have in mind, will not be quite so anxious to rush into the courts again for a while.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that on this Bill, which should not be a controversial <Col N="1378" /> matter, there should be such unfair criticism.  The poultry industry has developed and is at present on a par with many of the other very important items in our agricultural economy. This Bill, in my opinion, will go a long way towards ensuring that an improvement will be brought about in that industry, that various diseases will be eliminated and that poultry generally will be put in a position in which there cannot be any just criticism.  It is quite easy to understand why certain people such as Senator Sweetman make attacks.  It is quite easy to understand the same people being behind the policy of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in producing the imaginary mothers in England, the imaginary Irish mothers over in England who are to march in thousands over to Dublin to tell the Minister for Agriculture here that he must regulate the policy of the British Government.  That is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>I said when I stood up that I did not intend to say very much.  I welcome this Bill and I feel that every reasonable member of the House will join with me in congratulating the Minister for Agriculture on the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. Seán O'Donovan Mr. Seán O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin on the note on which Senator Quirke has finished.  I heartily congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  It is of vital importance to the agricultural community and to the nation as a whole that the poultry industry should be developed to a far greater extent than it is at present.  It is one of the principal adjuncts of our agricultural policy and I feel that the Bill is absolutely necessary in view of the fact that one particular disease is transmitted through the egg to the chicken and that day-old chickens if not produced at these hatcheries from hens which are free from the disease will be in grave danger of dying within a week or a fortnight of going to the purchaser. It is of vital importance to our system that this and other diseases should be controlled.  The question of the system of control has been raised by Senator Sir John Keane and <Col N="1379" /> Senator Sweetman.  In any community which elects responsible Ministers and Departments to look after their affairs, surely it is the Minister for Agriculture and his officials who must supervise and see that conditions are complied with and that these hatcheries are maintained in a satisfactory manner. This can be done through the local authority as it can be done through the central authority.  The Minister can avail of the services of the local poultry instructresses and I appeal to the Minister to avail of their services to the fullest extent and to have additional poultry instructresses to help in the general development of the industry and in the supervision of these hatcheries.  I am very emphatic that you must have local contact by people who are known to the farmers and the wives of the farmers in each district and that these poultry instructresses should be on the spot in so far as they can be on the spot because there is not sufficient of them at the moment.  I believe that it is through the efforts of the local poultry instructresses that the Bill will be a success rather than by the supervision of any inspectors coming from headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am with Sir John Keane possibly to the extent that I believe that the implementation of this Bill will be best effected through a greater number of local poultry instructresses in the country.  I think it is very important to the nation that the provisions of this Bill should be implemented as quickly as possible.  The greater number of eggs we export the greater the price we get.  It is a magnificent opportunity and should be availed of with all possible speed.  Now, Sir John Keane and Senator Sweetman say that everything should go through the courts.  That is all right but it involves considerable delay.  I want to point out that under the Milk and Dairies Act there is a licensing system for designated milks and these licences are issued by the State.  There is registration by the local authority and there is a compulsory clause providing that if there are three convictions the registration must be cancelled.  I mention this in order to point out that <Col N="1380" /> there is not much difference in implementing this Bill through the local authority which is the county committee for agriculture or the central authority which is the Department of Agriculture.  The Department of Agriculture must be the guiding authority. There must be a head authority over the local authorities.  That is the system of government in the State.  I cannot see the force of Senator Sir John Keane's using my name when calling this system totalitarianism.  I say it is not totalitarianism, when the people of this country elect a Government and when subsequently their representatives select Ministers to take charge of the different Departments of State, to say that the officials operating under these Departments throughout the country must be subservient to the Departments.  It is not fair to call it totalitarianism.</P>
    <P>It is merely confusing the issue in the minds of people, especially people outside the country, so that they can use the words that have been used&mdash; that we are &ldquo;the last outpost of totalitarianism in Europe&rdquo;.  The repeated use of this in this ultra-democratic State is wrong and every time Sir John Keane uses it he will bring me to my feet to deny it.  There are several clauses in this Bill which indicate that the Minister does not have the final exercise of his own free-will in connection with a number of matters.  His officers have to take cases to the court. Section 9, sub-section (3) provides that where a poultry hatchery licence-holder does not comply with the conditions attaching to the licence he shall be guilty of an offence and on summary conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding £10.  In Section 10 it is definitely stated that the Minister in his absolute discretion can revoke a poultry hatchery licence.  I have no hesitation in saying that in certain circumstances a person convicted of a breach of the regulations applicable to his licence should have it withdrawn.  The Minister will then naturally withdraw the licence from such a person, but I hope that it is on very rare occasions that such action will have to be taken. There are several other clauses providing for officials going into court. Section 20 sets out four headings under <Col N="1381" /> any of which a person found guilty of such and such an offence shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10.</P>
    <P>Some people, especially lawyers, seem to have great regard for the right to take everything to court and the right to appear before a justice and state a case.  There is adequate provision for that in this Bill and there is also the provision that the Minister has the right to withdraw a licence held under the Bill.  No purpose would be served by taking a man to court week after week, month after month, year after year, if somebody had not the authority to say: &ldquo;Look here; you have offended long enough.  The best thing is for you to get out of this business. I will have to withdraw your licence&rdquo;.  It is only commonsense that that provision should be in the Bill and nobody could call it totalitarianism.  I hope as a result of this Bill to see the poultry industry developed to an extraordinary degree.  There is every opportunity for that.  During the emergency, the only difficulty was in respect of proper feeding stuffs.  Now the poultry industry allows of quicker development than most other branches of our agriculture.  I wish the Bill every success in that respect.</P>
    <P>Blood-testing is a system whereby the carrier of disease will be detected.  An immense amount of blood-testing must be carried out through the official hatcheries and through the approved egg supply farms.  The Minister should take a big view of this and should realise that a far greater number of centres for the examination of blood should be established.  The way to do that, in my opinion, is through the county committees of agriculture.  I understand that at present the blood is sent to the veterinary college in Dublin for test.</P>
    <P>I am with Senator Sir John Keane to this extent that I believe it is impossible to send all the blood specimens collected from Cork to Donegal to the veterinary college in Dublin.  There will have to be a greater number of centres throughout the country so that the work may be expedited.  My idea is that through the county committees of agriculture the local stations can do <Col N="1382" /> this work much more quickly and there will not be a cluttering up of work in one institution in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I mention that because my picture of the development of agriculture generally is that there will be greater help from local poultry instructresses, local agricultural instructors and local veterinary inspectors.  I have said, and I repeat, that we must have a greater number of these.  More money must be spent, and it will be usefully spent, in providing a greater number of poultry instructresses, agricultural advisers and veterinary inspectors to help the farming community in the various branches of their industry.  The agricultural instructor at present cannot possibly contact more than a fraction of the people who would like to see him and whom he would like to see.  The poultry instructress cannot do it.  The veterinary inspector cannot do it. There are not enough of them.  These matters have been referred to in the Post-War Planning Committee's Report and Recommendations and I appeal to the Minister to accept the point of view that this is one of the Bills that supplies machinery by which the poultry industry can be developed to an enormous extent.  The agricultural community are awaiting that development.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take the points of view I have put to him seriously and for other branches of agriculture will take the steps he is taking in this Bill.  As one individual, I heartily commend them to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is very much I require to say in reply to the remarks that have been made on both sides.  The contribution of Senator Sir John Keane reminded me of classes of people for whom I have always had a great deal of sympathy. I will mention one class&mdash;those who do missionary work, preachers of all kinds &mdash;inasmuch as they are called upon to repeat themselves and to make the same sort of case so often.  I have in mind a missioner whom I once knew, who belonged to my own Church.  He was giving a mission in a particular parish and, after he had completed the mission in the first Church, he made <Col N="1383" /> inquiries as to the distance it was to the next Church, fearing that the original congregation would follow him to the second place and knowing he would have the same sort of story to tell.</P>
      <P>I understood his difficulty just as I understand the difficulty of Senator Sir John Keane and others like him who stand up in this House time after time and, searching around for something original to say and not finding it, fall back on: &ldquo;The Minister is seeking power here to make regulations.  The Minister is seeking dictatorial and totalitarian powers&rdquo;.  Since I came here I have wondered if these remarks are directed at me.  Perhaps it is the guilty conscience that I have that makes me think so.</P>

      <P>The Senator has disappointed me.  I was going to make what I thought was a grand point and he has knocked the bottom out of it. Anyhow, I have a notion, from my contacts with members of the Senator's Party, if I am entitled to put it that way or&mdash;if I am not so entitled&mdash;with people in the other House who think along the same lines as the Senator, that they are prone to accuse me personally of being dictatorial.  The Senator's remarks on the last occasion on which I was here conveyed to me that, while he may have had that feeling 20 years ago, he holds it rather more firmly now.  I would not object in the least if that were the case because, what is the position regarding a Minister who has a very responsible task to do?  This office of mine is certainly a full-time job.  Sometimes I am accused of being dictatorial.  Sometimes I am accused of being hard to move.  Sometimes I am accused of being totalitarian.  The peculiar feature of it is that those who accuse me of being all these things are the very people who would accuse me of being in the hands of my officials if I <Col N="1384" /> did not make myself conversant with the work of my Department.  It is not my job to express an opinion as to when a man is a good Minister or what the qualifications are, but I take it that one of the most important qualifications is that he should try to know all that is going on in his Department and that, while he should be prepared to listen to his officials and his advisers and people interested in the particular business outside, he should have a mind of his own and act upon it, having heard all sides of the question.  That might be, to Senator Sir John Keane and some others, indicative of a totalitarian or a dictatorial tendency.  If it is, then I am very glad to possess it up to the hilt.</P>
      <P>Again we have had the expression: &ldquo;This is the thin end of the wedge&rdquo;. Well, it must be a very long wedge, as it is the thin end for a very long time. While I have sympathy with those who have to apply themselves to show some semblance of opposition or criticism on a measure of this kind, and I know the limitations that are imposed upon them, I would like to think that the Senator and his friends would find some other way to put it than the way in which it has been put this evening.</P>
      <P>I am not taking seriously the suggestion that there should be an appeal to the courts, having regard to the fact that the holder of a licence has the right to make representations to me if the licence has been taken away. What interest should I have other than the public good in determining the facts as placed before me?  I am an ordinary lay person, but surely I am as capable as anybody else to determine when the facts are such as to warrant the withdrawal of a licence and surely there is no person more entitled to make that final decision than the person occupying the post of Minister for Agriculture?  My sense of justice surely is as keen as that of any other man and probably I am not more subject to error than any other person, whether legal or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan mentioned that he would be glad to see more instructors and inspectors employed, to bring our people to a fuller understanding of many things they may not <Col N="1385" /> understand now.  In my contacts with county committees, I have tried to bring that point home.  Unfortunately, I am afraid that in this country there is a tendency&mdash;though it is not as firmly rooted as some would have us believe&mdash;not to seek the advice of those who have technical knowledge.  This afternoon it was my privilege to present a cup to a woman from a neighbouring county whose poultry had won an egg-laying competition for the second time.  Her husband made the speech for her and he spoke very highly of the officials who, as he put it, had enabled them to secure the success they had achieved.  He lauded the officials of the county committee and of my Department to the skies.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in flooding the country with officials unless there is a public demand for them.  I wish we could induce our farmers and their wives who are interested in the industry with which we are now dealing and the other branches of agriculture, to seek the advice of those people, in the full knowledge that they are in no way obliged to act on the advice.  If, after getting that advice, they find it is practical and advisable to follow, their neighbours will do likewise; and if, as a result of the spread of that feeling, there should be need for further assistance in that direction, it could be provided.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to get this measure now.  As I said in my opening remarks, we have not completed the discussion with the British Government on this particular industry.  A scheme has been devised to expand production in poultry and eggs and this Bill will, when it becomes an Act, give us the foundation on which to base the scheme which is contemplated.  It will be some years, of course, before we can see the full effect of these provisions.  The Senators who try to understand what is aimed at in this measure should take in alongside that the scheme which we have in mind, to which I have already referred, as well as my own intentions towards helping the poultry-keepers of the country to provide themselves with suitable accommodation for their poultry stocks.  If we had these three <Col N="1386" />&mdash;the Bill, the agreement with the British, and the proposals which I intend shortly to put before the Government&mdash;I think we would be on the road to placing this industry in a good position to advance, provided, of course&mdash; and this is very important&mdash;the food supply position improves.  I do not think it is possible to expand to the extent we would like unless that comes about; but the shortage will not last for ever and we are now making the plans for the expansion we hope will come in a short time when the food supply position changes.</P>

Ina theannta sin, múinteoirí a rachas ar pinsiú fán teora aoise i rith an dá bhlian seo ag teacht beidh síneadh ar an tréimhse seirbhíse i gcóir pinsin a bheas acu ar na scálaí arda.  Iad seo a rachas ar pinsean ar an 31ú lá de Mhí na Nollag, 1949, nó am ar bith ina dhiaidh sin is ar an meán-tuarastal a fuaireadar i rith trí mblian iomlán ar na scálaí nua a haireofar a bpinsean. Marach an socrú atá déanta sa mír seo, ní bhead sin amhlaidh go dtí an lú lá d'Aibreán, 1950.  An t-athrú a nítear ar mhodh áirimh an mheán-tuarastail <Col N="1389" /> bhliantúil rachaidh sé chun tairbhe, freisin, dóibh seo a bhéas i dteideal aisce pósta nó aisce báis.</P>
    <P>Níl aon mhór-thábhacht i Míreanna 12 agus 13 ach ó thaobh riaradh na scéime.</P>
    <P>Fá na scéimeanna atá ann fá láthair ní fulár an pinsiún íoc uair sa mhí ach ba mhaith an rud é dá mb'fhéidir é íoc an trá a measfaí ab fheiliúnaí ina chóir ó am go ham.  Bheirtear cumhacht chuige sin i Mír 14.</P>
    <P>Do hiarradh orm i roinnt cás pinsean a íoc fá dhó sa mí agus mar adúirt nó ar ócáid eile tá sé toilteanach an moladh a bhreithniú ná bheirtear fianaise dhom go bhfuil aon éileamh mór go ndéanfainn amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Chun freastal ar chás fá leith crustain a cuireadh Mír 15 isteach.  Chuir a lán daoine an cás os mo chomhair.  Sé an cás é, ban-mhúinteoir a rugadh sa mbliain 1877, agus a thug seirbhís leanúnach i Scoil Saothair ón mbliain 1913, agus a bhí ag múnadh roimhe sin féin.  Thug Scéim Aoisliúntas na bliana 1942 creidiúint fá chóir pinsin dá leithéid sin i gcás seirbhíse a tugadh go dtí an bhliain 1941, ach, do bhrí nar fheagair an múinteoir áirithe seo don sainmhíniú ar &ldquo;mhúinteoir&rdquo; atá ag gabháil leis an bPríomh-Scéim ní raibh sí i dteideal pinsin.  Cuirfear an scéal ina cheart sa mír seo.  Is éard atá ar intinn a dhéanamh aitheantas mar &ldquo;mhinteoir&rdquo; a thabhairt di go foirmiúil ar feadh tréimhse gairid agus ansin í chur ar pinsean ar an bpointe cuí.</P>
    <P>Ní mheasaim go bhfuil aon ábhair conspóide sna moltaí seo agus iarrain ar an Seanad an rún a rith go foirmiúil ag daingniú na scéime.</P>

      <P>I notice, from the summary of the Minister's speech, that a woman teacher in a reformatory school has had her status improved so that she may qualify for full pension. Another case occurs to me, of which I am sure the Minister must be aware. It is possible that representations have already been made to him about it.  It is that of a schoolteacher in Dublin. He has had 50 years' service, only 19 of which were given under the Department of Education.  He will be <Col N="1390" /> retiring in the near future with the magnificent pension of 31/- or 41/- after his 50 years' service.  I should like to know how he will fare under this scheme?  Will his position be regularised, so that a pension, commensurate with his years of service, may be awarded to him?  There may be other cases of the same kind.  This is one that I know something about myself. As I have said, only 19 years of his service were given under the Department of Education.  He was formerly employed in a Christian Brothers' school.  I should like to know what will happen, generally, to lay teachers who have given long service in, say, Christian Brothers' schools?  What will happen in his case, and in other similar cases, so far as this superannuation scheme is concerned?  I am sure the Minister is aware of this particular case.</P>

      <P>The case to which Senator Foran has referred is known to me.  Lay-assistants in Christian Brothers' schools came under the national system when the Brothers' schools came in in 1925 and they got half credit for their previous service in these schools.  At that time, lay-assistants were not pensionable. Under the 1934 scheme, lay-assistants were made pensionable and were given two-thirds credit for previous recognised and paid services.  That means that lay-assistants in Christian Brothers' schools got two-thirds credit for the 1925 to 1934 period.  It was only in that period that they were recognised and paid.  I agree that they have a case.  We are examining the case at present, and, if it is possible, I hope that we shall be able to get the other authorities concerned to agree that some amelioration will be necessary. If the necessary agreement can be got, I am quite prepared to bring along a further scheme.  This scheme deals merely with matters arising out of the emergency, the question of teachers who served in the forces during the emergency, the regularisation of the position of a small number of teachers who happen to be sub-postmasters, whose pension rights have been <Col N="1391" /> unsettled and certain matters arising out of the teachers' strike, as well as settling the position of teachers in industrial schools, those run by religious orders, who will be paid on a capitation basis.  For both capitation and classification, the two types of schools are being recognised now as national schools and the teachers will be paid in the ordinary way and will be treated equally as having full advantage of the superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>There are other points in connection with superannuation.  The one Senator Foran referred to is one that we are examining at present, and I think it will probably be necessary to introduce further amendments to this scheme.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we could not do it now.  This scheme has been in hands for a considerable time, but, owing to drafting and printing difficulties, it has not been possible to deal <Col N="1392" /> with it until now.  I cannot make any final promise until I get agreement with the Finance authorities about the matter.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I may be out of order in mentioning another matter, but I will not detain the House very long.  There is another class, existing pensioned teachers, several of whom are in a very serious position at present.  I know that the Minister is aware of their position and I believe that he is sympathetic.</P>
