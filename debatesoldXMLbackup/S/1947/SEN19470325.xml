    <Title>Auctioneers and House Agents Bill, 1946&mdash;Recommittal (Resumed); and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>The Seanad went into Committee and resumed consideration of amendment No. 2 by Senator Duffy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 3, Section 6, lines 42-43, to delete the words &ldquo;or by any person authorised by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned on the last occasion, we were discussing amendment No. 2, which proposes the deletion of certain words in sub-section (2) of Section 6.  I need refer only briefly to what is proposed because we discussed the matter at some length on the last occasion and also in Committee.  Sub-section (1) of Section 6 provides that no person shall <Col N="1388" /> hold himself out as an auctioneer except in accordance with a licence to be issued to auctioneers under Section 8 or, as a house agent, except in accordance with a licence under Section 8 or a permit under Section 9.  He must have a licence as an auctioneer, or, for the purpose of dealing with letting transactions, he must have a permit under Section 9.  Certain persons are exempt from these obligations.  The excepted persons may act as auctioneers without being in possession of a licence or they may act as house agents without being in possession of a licence or permit.</P>
      <P>Amongst those who are exempt from the obligation to hold a licence or a permit, are rate collectors.  Some doubt was expressed on the last occasion as to whether a rate collector may lawfully act as an auctioneer.  I am not quite sure if that point was settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was as to whether a rate collector may lawfully appoint a deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the question arose as to whether a rate collector who has seized property may lawfully appoint anyone to act as his deputy.  If he may, this sub-section in paragraph (d) enables that person acting as deputy to carry on a sale or act as a house agent without a licence or permit.  I do not know what is meant by that.  Up to date, the discussion has been as to whether the deputy might be permitted to act as an auctioneer in the case of a seizure, but this section goes further. It contemplates that the deputy may act either as an auctioneer or a house agent without having an auctioneer's licence or a house agent's permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not raising the question in relation to the rate collector himself.  If he must make a seizure and carry on an auction, I am not proposing that he should be required to have an auctioneer's licence, although I do not see why he should be permitted to act as a house agent merely because he is a rate collector.  I suggest, however, that we are going too far, if we say that any person, irrespective of qualifications, appointed as a rate collector's deputy <Col N="1389" /> may act as a house agent or an auctioneer and I am asking the Minister to accept my proposal that these words &ldquo;or by any person authorised by him&rdquo; be omitted from the sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone into this matter since the last day and I am inclined to accept the amendment.  It is not a likely thing to happen, I am informed, and I am prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, Section 6, sub-section (2), to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(j)  an auction by any person of goods belonging solely to that person.</P>
      <P>We had a great deal of discussion on this in connection with the definition in Section 2 and I will not go over it again.  There is a case for a man being allowed to do his own business.  The litigant himself is just as much entitled to go in and plead his case in court as is his solicitor or barrister.  Similarly, in the case of an auction, the man himself should be entitled to act.  I have a sort of idea that the Minister's line of opposition will be that it would be difficult to make the section copper-fastened if this were inserted.  I suggest that that is not the real difficulty. It is not the person who takes a deposit in an isolated case that we are considering, but the person who does it as a regular part of his business.  If this amendment is incorporated, it would be possible in an isolated case for a person to sell as his own goods, say, the goods of Senator Crosbie, but if that happened to any great extent that would be dangerous, it would be so known everywhere that the Revenue Commissioners could not be evaded in respect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that the real basis of this Bill is the protection of the public against people who receive money belonging to the public.  The people cannot receive that money unless it is well known that they are carrying on an auctioneering business and if that is well known there will not <Col N="1390" /> be the slightest difficulty.  There would be no loophole worth considering and there would not be one case in 100,000 that would get away under such an amendment, while the genuine cases would receive protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator seems to make a case, but the people who have to administer this say it would be practically impossible to prevent people availing of that provision to sell other people's goods.  I am satisfied that they have a lot of experience in that way and I do not want to leave the loophole there.  In the case of furniture or works of art, it would be difficult.  I do not want to be unreasonable, and do not think it is worth much of a fight about, but I do not want to put difficulties in the way of those who have to administer the Act by leaving such loopholes.  A person can sell his own goods, of course, but this is a question of an auction.  I admit that the Senator's case is hard to answer, but when it comes to administration it is very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is tied up with the discussion we had and included the question of the old clothes man in the fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have the same people operating this, the Revenue Commissioners, and I am satisfied they will not be unreasonable.  I ask the Senator not to press it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little more in it than that.  I am not suggesting that anyone, even the Revenue Commissioners, will be unreasonable. I dislike immensely&mdash;and I think the Minister will whole-heartedly agree with me&mdash;putting a section into the Bill by virtue of which certain people are going to commit an offence, and then our defence for doing that is that the Revenue Commissioners will not be stringent in their enforcement of the section.  I am not suggesting that they will be stringent in enforcing it, but as the Bill stands at present it is quite clear, from all the discussions we have had, that the hawker in the fair selling clothes will be breaking the law.  I quite agree with the Minister <Col N="1391" /> that he will not be prosecuted by the Revenue Commissioners, unless there is some change in practice, but even on the Minister's own standing, it is a bad thing to have a law there which is being broken in any respect.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that what is going to happen in respect to this is quite clear.  I can stand up and sell goods&mdash;that cannot happen in respect of a house because the title has to be shown&mdash;but I can stand up and sell furniture.  The Minister is worried whether I might be selling my own furniture or selling his.  I want to suggest to him that, though I might get away once with it if I were to attempt to sell somebody else's furniture, there would be no chance of doing so a second or a third time.  It is about the person who receives deposits as a general practice in respect of furniture auctions that the Minister is worried.  I do not think he is very much worried about the person who only sells furniture now and again.  I wonder would I be correct in saying that the real objection set out in the Minister's brief is this: that the Revenue Commissioners might lose some of their licence fees?  I wonder would that be a very unworthy suggestion to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the objection is that which appears on its face value, I do not think the Minister is giving away anything or leaving any loophole by accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Senator's arguments are so good in support of the amendment, I cannot see my way to resist it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that an owner of goods can stand up and auction them because they are his own? If that is so, it is not the law at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear, I think, that if a person were to do that he would very soon have the auctioneers getting after him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point, that <Col N="1392" /> if it is done more than once the people concerned will be after them.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 11 to 14, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 58, and page 8, line 1, Section 15 (1), to delete the words &ldquo;in the course of or in relation to the business of auctioneer or house agent carried on by him&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;as a licensed auctioneer or licensed house agent in relation to the receipt or payment of money or the safe custody of property&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, and the next one, are designed to meet points that were raised on the Committee Stage.  Under the section, as it stood, it might be possible for a person to get a decree in respect of something that had nothing whatever to do with the business of an auctioneer, and have that met out of the deposit.  This amendment makes it clear that that cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of the amendment is that it restricts the deposit purely to the making good of defalcations.  I think that is the right view to take.  I am not quite happy about the words in the amendment, &ldquo;receipt or payment of money&rdquo;.  I understand, of course, that this is in respect of moneys received, but what the significance of the word &ldquo;payment&rdquo; is I do not understand.  Is it to cover a case where an auctioneer purports to vouch his accounts by producing a receipt for a payment made by him while, in fact, that payment was not made at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When the auctioneer receives the money he has to pay it out to somebody.  That is why the word &ldquo;payment&rdquo; is inserted.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 4a:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 8, lines 14 and 15, Section 15 (2), to delete the words &ldquo;in the course of or in relation to the business of auctioneer or house agent carried on by him&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;as a licensed auctioneer <Col N="1393" /> or licensed house agent in relation to the receipt or payment of money or the safe custody of property&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is consequential on the preceding amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 15 to 18, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 4 and 5, Section 19 (1) to delete the words &ldquo;or within the next seven days&rdquo; and in line 6 to insert at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;or within the next seven days, produce and show such a licence or permit to any officer of customs and excise at a customs and excise office to be named by such person at the time when the said request is made&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment makes provision for an auctioneer to show his licence in some place other than where he has held the auction.  The auction may have been held down the country, but he can elect to show it in some place named by himself.  Senator Duffy raised this point on the last occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment, and a later amendment of mine, are closely linked together.  The Minister is meeting in this amendment a point that I raised on the Committee Stage.  Senators will remember that we discussed the case of a revenue officer challenging an auctioneer to produce his licence.  The section, as it then stood, required that the auctioneer should then and there produce it, or, failing to do so, should produce it in that particular place within seven days.  It was pointed out that that would make the administration of the section difficult: that it would be very unfair to an auctioneer who forgot to carry his licence with him if, in such an eventuality, he had to travel from Dublin to Sligo or to Ballyshannon within the seven days, and there produce his licence.  The Minister is meeting that by permitting the auctioneer to produce the licence within seven days at a place named by himself.  The only other point that arises is the <Col N="1394" /> amount of the penalty where these conditions are not complied with.  As I have said, I think the Minister has met the case fairly in this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, Section 19, line 12, to delete the word &ldquo;fifty&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I described on the last amendment what happens if the licence is not produced. This amendment deals with the penalty for failure to produce it. If the licence is not produced within the seven days the auctioneer is liable to a penalty of £50.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of £50 being the maximum penalty.  It is an excise penalty from which there is no departure. I think it is an excessive penalty. I agree that in normal circumstances there is no reason why an auctioneer should not produce his licence within seven days to a revenue officer at a venue named.  I can see circumstances, however, where this may be difficult.  A man, for instance, is conducting an auction in Letterkenny, after travelling down from Dublin.  A snowstorm intervenes and he may not be in the position of being able to get back to Dublin to produce his licence within the seven days.  In this case a penalty of £50 seems to me to be excessive. The answer will be that the Revenue Commissioners will not press for the full £50 but I do not think that we should be put in the position of having to leave it to the mercy of the Revenue Commissioners as to whether they want the £50 or not.  I want to suggest to the Minister that a £10 fine would be adequate punishment in the case.  There is no question of evading the law in so far as a licence is concerned. This section deals with an auctioneer who has got a licence and who fails to produce it when demanded to do so by a revenue officer.  I think that in the circumstances the Minister should be satisfied with the penalty of £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider inserting &ldquo;an excise <Col N="1395" /> penalty not exceeding £50&rdquo;?  The Minister has already taken a line against the Revenue Commissioners this afternoon and perhaps we might persuade him to do the same again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out again that this is a much more moderate provision than in the original Act. The penalty in the original Act was £10 and the person was liable to immediate arrest if he did not pay it. The amendment was inserted in the Dáil.  If the person was able to show that he could not produce it because of a snowstorm I think there would be no doubt about those circumstances being beyond his control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this really not a penalty for not having a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Of course he may have it and not show it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an auctioneer but I do drive a motor car and if I meet a Garda in the country and I have not my licence with me I can produce it at Terenure Garda Barracks within five or six days and I suffer no penalty.  If I am going away for 14 days or so, it does not matter so long as I can produce the licence within the time specified.  Technically, in law, I am supposed to have the licence with me but if I do not have it with me and I produce it at a Garda station within the time specified I suffer no penalty.  This means that if an auctioneer has a licence he should be able to produce it within seven days at a Garda barracks.  Of course, if, by an Act of God, he is held up for 15 days the circumstances are most unusual and they are beyond his control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of wireless licence defaulters, the justice invariably dismisses the cases if the licences are taken out after the persons are brought to court.  In this case, if a man shows that he has got a licence he would not be in the same position as the person who takes out a licence after <Col N="1396" /> he is asked to produce it.  I take it that this section means that if he cannot produce his licence within seven days he has not got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I would not mind making it 14 days if it was necessary. If the court is satisfied that the man could not produce it within the seven days because of circumstances beyond his control that will be the end of it.  It is really not worth fighting about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the words of the particular sub-section a person is authorised to conduct an auction if he has a licence.  Therefore, if an auctioneer has a licence, even though in fact he does not produce it, he cannot be fined at all. Therefore, from the Minister's point of view, this section is entirely defective.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite the same point; it is for failure to display a card.  The first sub-section provided that a person holding an auctioneer's licence shall throughout the auction display in a conspicuous position at the place where the auction is held a placard bearing certain information. <Col N="1397" /> The sub-section, however, will not apply to auctions for which notice has been given, but it is to the penalty that I am addressing myself, an excise penalty of £20 for an auctioneer's failure to display a card.  I wonder is this such a terribly serious offence? Auctioneers in the country have jobs of auctioning meadows and conacre. Usually a notice is stuck up on a telegraph pole or on a farm gate stating that on next Monday at 12 o'clock &ldquo;Mr. So-and-so&rdquo; will hold an auction of meadows.  All the local people know about it and they come to the place where the auction is being held.  The auctioneer may put up no notice whatever and probably never read this Bill or never heard of the penalties.  You find people of this kind.  I noticed only the other day a paragraph in the newspapers stating that a Japanese officer, captured a few days previously, did not know the war was over.  I can quite imagine people in remote areas like Connemara not knowing the provisions of this Bill.  An auctioneer might not understand that by not displaying this notice he is liable to an excise penalty of £20.  I am suggesting that a penalty of £10 would be adequate. I am suggesting that the Minister should tell the Revenue Commissioners that he is not going to make this Bill a vehicle for imposing penalties of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Final Stage of the Bill I want to make a very few remarks.  This Bill has had a very great deal of consideration in this House and it is now about to become an Act.  I am afraid if anybody expects it to do a great deal they are going to be completely disappointed.  It is a Bill that really does very little in the long run. The principle of it&mdash;the deposit concerned&mdash;is not, as I said on the Second Reading and as I want to repeat now, is not the complete safeguard that many people would believe.</P>
      <P>The only safeguard there can ever be is a system of auditing the accounts and separate accounting for clients' moneys as apart from one's own money, a system by virtue of which, before an auctioneer gets a licence, he has to produce a certificate from an auditor that his accounts are in order and which would be satisfactory in my view in respect of all people who hold other people's money.  Certainly it is a regulation to which I would submit gladly in respect of my own business and I think it is a regulation which should be introduced for trust moneys as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself does not confer on the public the complete protection that some people imagine, and in fact it may even do a certain amount of harm because people may be led into believing that because of this deposit there can be nothing wrong.  Of course, in fact, the deposit is only a small fraction in some cases, though in other cases it may be amply substantial.  In so far as country areas are concerned, I think the Minister will agree; everybody knows everybody else and knows the strength of the various auctioneers and they are not likely to be led astray as to whether A or B is travelling well or is in low financial waters.  I would seriously suggest that at some stage or other it should be considered in respect of trust moneys, that these moneys should be compulsorily kept in a trust account and that would be the best method of dealing with the whole problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some things right at the beginning of the discussion on this Bill that would invite question. I noticed in the other House that the general body of opinion seemed to be that all the auctioneers were millionaires and, for very many reasons, I was anxious to advocate what might be looked upon as the agricultural or rural outlook on this Bill.  I notice where Senator Hayes said at the very beginning that he did not like to see many small men or poor men being deprived of a livelihood and where the Minister paid a very great tribute to the fact that so many auctioneers had proved solvent all down along the line. As a matter of fact, my views were well said by Senator Kingsmill Moore when he said the Bill was a step in the right direction.  It is mild, and modest, as it ought to be, but there are items in it that the Minister must not be permitted to overlook.</P>
      <P>I am succeeding to a business where four predecessors and other neighbours adjoining&mdash;or two or three of them within the past 20 years&mdash;have all failed.  They all died insolvent and I was the auctioneer for bankruptcy in, I think, four of them.  Usually it does seem around the city where business brings you into contact with vast figures of £10,000 or £20,000, that 5 per cent. will leave you very happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I grant all that, but it is a different thing where in the country districts you may start with letting lands, say, in October and carry on the lettings round the various headlands of various farms for three months.  It provides cash and capital for the clients for whom you let the land and for every £10,000 or £20,000 worth of land which you let, you get a certain capital sum. Say you had £60,000 worth of land, your commission would come to something over £3,000 but you generally accept liability for the letting of £60,000 worth of land and it means discounting £60,000 worth of bills and most of that £60,000, if not all of it, will be paid out of discounted bills before the bills mature to yourself.  If a shower of rain falls, it falls on £60,000 worth, and the rain that does not fall may prohibit the proper maturing of the bills that go to make up the <Col N="1400" /> £60,000.  Singular to relate, those auctioneers who failed did not fail alone on account of their discounting bills, paying rates and rents, annuities and outgoings and making advances to clients.  The bills that are due are usually well met but the clients for whom you let the land have to live and gradually and by degrees they make inroads and these inroads, especially in bad times, for the education of their families, incomings and outgoings of every sort, mean that the clients for whom you let the lands are the people who usually cause an auctioneer to fall.</P>
    <P>It is to the cream of the country that you let the land.  Very few men will come out to multiply prices three and four times over and without the occasional sale of a farm at 5 per cent. the deficiencies of an auctioneer will eventually bring him down particularly when times are bad.  Hence my words will be directed to cautioning against interfering with the 5 per cent. in rural parts.  Where an auctioneer is discounting a huge number of bills it is serious if he does not get the 5 per cent.  The tendency has grown up for city professional men and solicitors to get considerable luck pennies from the person for whom you dispose of the land.  There is a luck penny to be given to the solicitor who acts in the matter and a luck penny to the solicitor who has carriage of sale and the result is that a very serious situation exists for the auctioneer.  Where you have understanding men, matters are all right.  If you get a sale of a £20,000 farm, I do not say that you should grudge a &ldquo;tenner&rdquo; as a luck penny to a solicitor or anybody else.  I do not say that one should not deal generously with these people but the Minister will understand that, when you are operating in a district where you have already dealt with five or six insolvent estates, you have to realise your responsibilities. You are sent out to &ldquo;foot&rdquo; an estate on which an auctioneer went down and you are going to meet, perhaps, members of the families of the men who lost their money with him.  You may also have to meet the auctioneer's own family.  In one case, a fortune in America was <Col N="1401" /> forthcoming to one of these persons some 11 years after the auctioneer had failed.  Having got it, what did he do? He went around the country looking for the men to whom he had defaulted.</P>
    <P>There are others who, in similar circumstances, would have done the same thing.  But they went to their graves knowing the injustice that had been committed and having had to grin and bear it.  I should like the Minister to receive, at least, a warning in connection with this matter.  The views expressed by Senator Kingsmill Moore agree with mine&mdash;that it is a step in the right direction.  But there should not be too much interference and reduction of small commissions.  An occasional sale has to make up the deficiencies which are involved by occasional lettings.  I do not ask for any decision from the Minister now.  I merely want to warn him of the pitfalls that confront him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be in order in asking the Minister a question? Senator McGee alleged that certain solicitors were demanding that a luck penny should be paid to them by the auctioneer.  That is, of course, a secret commission.  It is illegal and, if the custom exists, it should be stamped out.  Would I be in order in asking the Minister whether he sees any prospect of ensuring that, if such a practice exists, it will be prohibited in a clear and explicit way, so that there can be no doubt whatever in anybody's mind &mdash;as there is at present no doubt in the mind of any decent solicitor&mdash;that such a practice is, to use the proper term, fraudulent and dishonest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I never heard of that custom.  Senator McGee seemed to think that we were interfering with commissions.  We are not making any provision as to the commission which an auctioneer gets.  I agree with Senator Sweetman that this Bill will not achieve a great deal but it will, at least, ensure that persons known to be undesirable will be kept out of the business of auctioneering.  A deposit is provided for to meet, to a certain extent, any defalcations that may occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> Some people may think that it was not necessary to bring in this Bill.  I think that it was necessary.  It is better to have some provision to prevent people of an undesirable type from entering the auctioneering business. I repeat what I said at the beginning that, so far as the courts are concerned, the auctioneers have a very clear record.  There have been only 12 cases of defalcation during the past dozen years.  Of course, there may have been petty cases of which we did not hear.  I think that that is a very good record.  It is no harm to ensure that, so far as possible, that will continue to be the case.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very simple Bill.  In July, 1945, a Supplementary Estimate was passed in the other House which authorised the Minister for Justice to set up a committee to award medals and certificates for deeds of bravery involving risk to a person's life.  The committee was to consist of the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Lord Mayors of Dublin and Cork, the chairman of the General Council of County Councils, the chairman of the Red Cross, and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  A meeting of the committee was held shortly after the Estimate had been passed and the members were unanimous that that was not a satisfactory way to proceed.  They thought that an informal committee of that kind, with no guarantee of continuity and with nothing to prevent some Minister at <Col N="1403" /> some time from interfering with their proceedings, was unsatisfactory and that the committee should be established on a statutory basis.  That is why this Bill was introduced.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in the Bill which did not represent our intention when the Estimate was before the other House.  I resisted the proposal at the time&mdash;that compensation should be paid in proper cases.  On reconsideration, however, we made provision for compensation.  If a person loses, say, a suit, as a result of jumping into the canal or the Liffey, the Minister for Justice may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make an award of compensation.  Medals&mdash;one of bronze and one of gold&mdash;as well as certificates, are provided for.  That will be a matter for the committee but the question of the award will be a matter for the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The question was raised in the other House whether we intended to interfere with the operations of the Royal Humane Society or with the Carnegie Trust Fund.  We do not intend to interfere with them but we thought it proper that we should have an Irish award.  That is what we are providing for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The objects of the Bill are quite sound.  There is a case, as the Minister said, for official recognition of a deed of bravery performed in this country.  The proposal for a committee is a rather elaborate one.  Perhaps, it could not be made any more compact.  As a Dublin man, the Minister may have been afraid not to include the Mayor of Cork.  There can be no doubt that the second view the Minister took &mdash; that compensation should be paid or that some sum should be awarded&mdash;is perfectly sound in certain cases.  That would apply not only in the simple case of the loss of a suit; these deeds of bravery are, perhaps, most frequently performed by people whose livelihood depends on their earnings.  A man who incapacitates himself in this way should receive compensation.  I notice in the Bill that the only power the committee has is to make an award of a medal or a certificate, but the question of a sum <Col N="1404" /> of money by way of compensation is entirely a matter for the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Justice.  One would imagine that the committee should have power to make a recommendation.  I can understand that, no matter what efforts the Minister for Justice might make, the Minister for Finance will stand on his own final power to veto expenditure.  That runs right through the whole scheme.  One would imagine, however, that the committee, which is composed of very responsible people and which will hear all the facts of the case and who make the award of the medal or certificate or both, should have something to do with the amount of money which might be given to the person who performs the deed.</P>
      <P>It is done by way of compensation&mdash; that is the actual word used&mdash;and it is not a question of reward in the financial sense.  However, one has to be thankful for small mercies.  It might be possible to put in an amendment, giving power to the committee to make a recommendation.  I do not think the committee should have power to make a payment&mdash;far from it&mdash;but it seems to me that it is the committee which should initiate the compensation idea. Apart from that, the Bill is an admirable one, and if I were asked to form a committee I might not make a better hand of it.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there should be some connection between the work of this committee and the question of compensation.  I can quite understand that it would not be desirable either, from the point of view of the State or of the committee, that the committee should actually make the award of compensation, but there should be an onus on the committee to draw the attention of the Minister to cases where they consider compensation should be paid.  It should not be left to the person whose bravery is being recognised to ask for compensation. That would be highly undesirable. It is difficult, though I do not say it would be impossible, to visualise the Minister for Finance looking for people in order to compensate them. It would be a new principle.</P>

      <P>The whole object of this Bill would be negatived if there were not some such provision.  It would be a tragic thing if there were a laudable effort to give public tribute to a brave man or a brave woman, by this award of a medal or a certificate, and the person who performed the act of bravery and lost his or her life, left behind dependent persons who were left to suffer as a result of that brave act.</P>
      <P>The award of a medal or certificate would be cold comfort in such cases. We would all like to see provision for the award of a medal or certificate, and in those cases where a family was deprived of a breadwinner this representative committee should be in a position to recommend suitable compensation or to award it.  To my mind, the Bill would be worthless if in such cases a breadwinner lost his life in performing an act of bravery and his family were left to suffer as a result.</P>

If it is suggested that it should be the function of this committee not alone to recommend the award of compensation but to fix the amount, I think that would be most undesirable.</P>

I know that if I were a member of the committee and thought that a person was deserving of honour for some brave deed, I would not hesitate to recommend the payment of compensation by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>If such a person suffers any financial loss through his act of bravery he is surely entitled to compensation.  Such a person may develop rheumatism or some other serious ailment and may be incapacitated for a long time.

      <P>There was a long debate on this in the other House.  I resisted strongly any attempt to link the two things together&mdash;the recognition <Col N="1408" /> for bravery and the payment of compensation.  I think the two should be kept separate.  We had a humorous contribution from Deputy Dillon on that.  He said he could visualise, if the two things were linked together, a queue of old gentlemen on the canal bank waiting to dive in and be pulled out again, at a 1/- a time.  I am not saying that if abuses did occur they would be anything as bad as that.  I do not think that the two things should be linked together.  No doubt people will do brave acts without any thought of compensation.  There ought not to be any idea of putting a cash value on brave acts.  I do not want to be niggardly about this, but I think it would be unwise to have a mercenary idea linked up with any decoration for bravery.  We know, of course, that the Carnegie Trust does give money.  I thought that might have been sufficient, but at the same time we do not want to depend on an outside body.</P>
      <P>After due consideration, we brought in this Bill.  We did not ask that the committee should make recommendations. They might make fantastic recommendations, although I do not think they would.  Senators, of course, are aware that the Minister for Finance has responsibility for all payments in this State.  If the suggestion made here were to be acted upon, the Minister for Justice would have to be an advocate looking for money for the persons concerned.  I do not think it is necessary for the committee to make a recommendation because the person who suffers a loss, or his relatives, will probably take plenty of opportunities of bringing the matter to the notice of the Minister for Justice.  In fact, you might have public meetings held for the purpose.  In the Dáil Deputy Norton talked about a person losing his teeth or his glasses.  If we had to wait until the committee met and made a recommendation, nothing could be done for some time.  I think the section is all right as it stands.  Senators may be quite certain that plenty of opportunities will be availed of to bring to the notice of the Minister for Justice the desirability of providing for the person who has performed a brave deed if he has suffered any loss by so doing.</P>

I do not think the Minister for Justice can do what he suggests&mdash;that is, that he can first get the Minister for Finance to make a sum of money available, and subsequently have the council consider the award of the medal or certificate.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is being introduced mainly to give effect to an amendment of the scope of the National Health Insurance Acts.  At present non-manual workers are not insurable if their rate of remuneration exceeds £250 a year.  When the scheme was first introduced in 1911 the figure adopted was £160 and that figure was increased to the present level in 1920.  As members <Col N="1411" /> of the House know, there have been increases of wages recently and there has been a great change in the value of money.  Numbers of persons have passed out of insurance as a result of increases in wages in the last six months and also through the payment of bonus during the emergency.</P>
      <P>These persons who have passed out of insurance could, if they wanted, become voluntary contributors but our experience has been that very large numbers of them have not taken advantage of the sections in the national health insurance code which permit voluntary contributions, possibly because of delay in making the necessary decisions to become voluntary contributors until some months have elapsed after the end of their compulsory insurance, when they would have to meet in one sum the accumulated arrears of weekly contributions. There has been for some time a feeling in the Dáil and everywhere else that the remuneration limit should be raised.  The Dáil provided for a maximum of £400 and as a result of what was almost universal feeling in the House this was again increased to £500.  The section does not apply to persons employed on non-manual work who, in general, are insurable, irrespective of their rate of remuneration. When we decided to introduce this Bill we thought we would take the opportunity of re-enacting in permanent from the provisions of an Emergency Powers Order made in June of last year.  Parts II, III and IV give effect to that decision.  Part II contains five sections of which the first is designed to cover cases in which contributions were paid irregularly but in good faith in respect of persons who had passed out of insurance, as frequently happened during the emergency, when emergency bonus brought a non-manual worker's remuneration over the insurance limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have provided in this section that such a person shall be treated as if he were an insurable person in the periods in respect of which the contributions were paid, with the usual rights of benefit.  This also has the important effect of continuing the protection <Col N="1412" /> of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts because persons insured under the Health Acts are automatically also insured under the Pensions Act.  Section 3 increases the &ldquo;free&rdquo; period of insurance from one year to 18 months and arises out of the introduction of a yearly, instead of a half-yearly, card.  For the sake of economy in administration and accountancy a yearly card has been introduced.  The remaining three Sections 5, 6 and 7, deal with the insurance of soldiers, particularly those soldiers who enlisted for the duration of the emergency, a type of enlistment which was not visualised when the main provisions in relation to the insurance of soldiers were made in the National Health Insurance Act, 1936.  Up to now such persons had to have at least two years' service.</P>
    <P>Part III gives such effect, as is now necessary, to the merging on 30th September last of the membership engagements and assets of the Military Forces (International Arrangements) Insurance Fund in National Health Society.  The state had been then reached when it was pointless, and wasteful in administration, that this small body, consisting of between 1,000 and 5,000 members, should remain apart from the National Health Insurance Society which dealt with the remainder of the insured population. No former member of the fund will lose in any way by reason of the merger.</P>
    <P>This covers members of the British forces who served in the first World War and who, because of their medical condition, were not considered as good subjects for insurance by the then nonunified insurance societies.  We provide for the continuity of the records through which we negotiate with the British Government on behalf of these people.  Part IV deals with persons who are in receipt of pensions from the British Government in respect of disablement arising out of the recent war. Broadly speaking, former members of the British forces who are in receipt of pensions in respect of 100 per cent. disability will not get sickness or disablement benefit until they re-qualify by engaging in insurable employment for <Col N="1413" /> prescribed periods and persons in receipt of British civil pensions in respect of war disablement will be treated as if the pension was an award under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  The principle of the provisions is sound.  The Acts are framed on the basis of normal incidence of illness and national health insurance funds should be protected against claims for benefit arising directly from war causes, by persons in receipt of pensions in respect of their disabilities.</P>
    <P>Part V is the only part containing new provisions.  The first two sections of that part are mainly accounting. Section 17 provides that in lieu of the present two-ninths State grant on the expenditure of benefits and administration, the sum to be paid in 1947-48 and in subsequent financial years will be such sum as is estimated would be paid under the old provision.</P>
    <P>The amendment arises out of proposals which will be before the Oireachtas when the Estimates are under consideration and is introduced solely in the interests of accounting simplicity.  The National Health Insurance Fund will neither gain nor lose under the arrangement.  Members of the House know that the Government provides a subsidy of two-ninths of the expenditure for the pensions and administration of the National Health Insurance Society, and if we now arrange for an increase in benefits to be paid by the State entirely, that alters the method of calculation and disturbs the previous arrangements whereby two-ninths were paid.  This section is in order to provide for that contingency and avoid a vast amount of complicated accountancy.  Section 18 merely enables the Minister for Finance to invest moneys held for the National Health Insurance Fund in any securities authorised by law for the investment of Savings Bank funds.  It will be recalled that not long ago the Minister for Finance was enabled to invest moneys in any security authorised by law which would include also temporary advances in Exchequer bills.  The remaining section in Part V, Section 19, as already explained, provides the main reason for the Bill.  Members of the House will, therefore, be aware <Col N="1414" /> that a considerable portion of this Bill relates to implementing and passing into permanent law an emergency powers Order and the remainder relates principally to the proposal to increase the maximum remuneration rate for National Health Insurance Society and widows' and orphans' pension purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned this Bill would be regarded as entirely uncontroversial with the possible exception of the change that was introduced in the Dáil at practically no notice.  As far as the rest of the Bill is concerned it seems to be more or less in practice already.  I do not know anything about the accounting changes but I think it is a matter we may leave to the Government without very many questions.</P>
      <P>I have an open mind as to the wisdom of bringing in a large number of persons into the National Health Insurance Society.  I may be wrong, but I think that in general terms, the figure of £400 reinsured persons who had fallen out before, but who were in very much the same position as far as their income was concerned.  That was only a recognition of the change in the value of money and it was not bringing in any very large number of new persons, but when you increase it to £500 you would be bringing in a large number of new persons, and we are given no information in this House at any rate as to any estimate of the number of persons who will be so included. There must have been some good reason why this very wide distinction was made between the manual worker and the non-manual worker. The manual worker has to be insured and the non-manual worker was previously £250.  I think the Minister said in the other House that the £400 will be about the value of the £250.  It may be that there is a very good case for this additional amount but I think there is no case whatever for rushing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a few conversations with people, many of whom are rather against it, and I would suggest that if this was introduced in the Dáil last week and as we only got it here in <Col N="1415" /> the amended form yesterday there should be a few weeks between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage to enable us to consult with business organisations&mdash;in my own case&mdash;and with other bodies and try to find out what the public feeling towards the change is.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the exact effect may be.  A good many non-manual workers between £350 and £500 were in positions in which if they were out sick for a week or two they did not have their salaries deducted.  If we bring them in to a scheme of this kind I do not know what the effect will be, but it is conceivable that they will be much worse off for very little gain to themselves.  I am not sure of these things as the matter has been only sprung on me and I am only putting points forward for consideration.  I know a case in which the head of one business tried to persuade members of the staff, who through emergency bonuses and so on had exceeded the £250, to remain insured and said that the firm would pay the firm's usual contribution and the majority of them declined.  They said that it was not even worth that amount to them.  That is probably unsound, and for my part, I have been advised to the contrary, but I think it is rather the attitude of non-manual workers who do not seem to think they are going to gain very much.</P>
    <P>Assuming the Government did not accept an amendment of this kind without having figures, can the Government estimate the number of new persons who were not previously insured under the scheme and who would be brought into the scheme now?  I would prefer to leave over the Committee Stage for a week or two until this can be considered.</P>
    <P>It is not only because of the point about the £500 but as to whether certain amendments might not be required if the figure is to be £500.  For instance, what would be the position of a man who, as I know&mdash;although I do not know the exact figures which makes my case all the better in that I am not taking an individual case&mdash;is acting as secretary to two or three <Col N="1416" /> organisations and is paid, I think, £250 in one case, £300 in the other and, I think, £100 in the third?  I think, under the insurance code, he will now have to be insured and to stamp his card.  I think that is the kind of case which could be exempted if you were going into the £500 figure.  I am giving an indication of the kind of case that might be considered.  Then you may have quite a few people who have private incomes from part-time or light employment for which they may get £250 or so a year as well as a big salary.  I would be inclined to exempt people of that kind if they can prove that their fixed income does not exceed the maximum.</P>
    <P>I certainly think the change which was introduced into the Dáil should not be pushed here without further consideration.  Before I sit down I would like to ask the Minister a question. I have not all the details but I noticed that a case came before the Labour Court for a claim for increased wages on behalf of the employees of the National Health Insurance Society. It appeared that the Government in making provision for £450 or £500 because of the difference in the value of money, that the case cannot be considered because of a statutory provision&mdash;I think, made in 1924&mdash;which placed the total amount of wage increase at 4/5.</P>
    <P>While I have not sufficient knowledge to express an opinion about the present wages, I certainly think it would be the height of absurdity when a Bill of this kind is going through, to say that the maximum fixed in 1924 should be the maximum now which would prevent an increase if an increase be justified in the present case on the part of the employees of the society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first measure promoted by the Ministry of Social Welfare and there is not one suggestion in it that the Minister intends to maintain incomes for anybody.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has just said, the Bill is concerned very largely with implementing the machinery provisions of an Emergency Powers Order which has been in force for the past two <Col N="1417" /> years and for the purpose of raising the insurable limit from £250 to £500. From that angle, the Bill must be regarded as disappointing and unsatisfactory. As a machinery measure, it is probably unobjectionable, although one finds it difficult, in reading the Bill, to discover whether it has any principle.  In fact, if we are discussing the principle of the Bill on Second Reading, I am in the difficulty that I do not know what its principle is.  It appears to be a document hastily gathering together odds and ends, without any purpose in principle, or any object except tightening up Departmental machinery.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposal to increase the insurable limit from £250 to £500, I think it is safe to say that it was one of those proposals about which there was almost complete unanimity in the Dáil.  It is true that certain employed persons would, probably, object to a proposal to bring them into the health insurance scheme but that has been true from the beginning. It was true in 1911, just as it is true in 1947, that sections who had given the matter no consideration thought they were being imposed upon because they were brought into the health insurance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that to be untrue. What appeals to me most in regard to this proposal is that, by becoming insured under the health insurance scheme, those persons whose income runs between £250 and £500 will come within the widows' and orphans' pension scheme, which will mean a tremendous difference to the widow and the children of a deceased person whose income exceeded £250.  The widow and orphan in this case will now be entitled to a contributory pension without the application of a means test, whereas, under the old legislation, the widow and the orphan would become entitled to a non-contributory pension only when they were able to satisfy a means test. I think that the case for extending the health insurance limit is unanswerable and I think that any person who gives the slightest thought to the question will accept the view that it is very proper to increase the insurable limit <Col N="1418" /> to £500.  To my mind, it was a strange anomaly that the manual worker was insurable, irrespective of his income, notwithstanding this limit in other cases.  A docker might be earning 15/- or 16/- a day.  With overtime, he might be earning £500 a year.  Yet, he was insurable.  There was no question as to his income; it was only in the case of non-manual workers that discrimination was made on the basis of income. That seems to me to have been based on certain old and discredited theories. It was linked up with the discrimination in the case of the Workmen's Compensation Acts and all those other services in respect of which it was thought that the person who had a salary, as distinct from the person with a wage, was able to provide for himself or, alternatively, that the relations between the employer and the employed person were such that there was no need to make any provision by statute or regulation for the protection or safety of himself or his dependents. That theory was unsound at all times, and it has been utterly discredited for many years.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that, in introducing this measure, the first of its kind introduced by the Ministry of Social Welfare, advantage was not taken of the occasion to make provision for higher rates of benefit for the sick, for those who are entitled to invalidity benefit and for the dependents of persons unable to continue in their employment because of illness.  I have in mind, particularly, the case of persons suffering from tuberculosis.  Imagine the case of a workman who is advised by his doctor that he must go into a sanatorium for three months, the penalty for refusal being a lingering death. That man realises that the moment he withdraws from gainful employment, his wife and family will be exposed to hardships.  He tries to avoid those hardships.  He hesitates about entering the sanatorium and tries to struggle on.  In struggling on, he is risking his life and, at the same time, he is spreading the germs of tuberculosis amongst his family and his shop mates.  We should try to avoid that.  I had hoped that that would have been provided against by the Minister for Social Welfare when introducing the first of these <Col N="1419" /> Bills dealing with health insurance.  I regret that the Bill should have come to us without any provision covering a position of that kind.  While we shall agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it is a great advantage to the insured person to have the free period, or what used to be called the &ldquo;free year&rdquo;, extended to 18 months, there is a slight suspicion in my mind that its alteration, unless it has been carefully examined, may have repercussions on the benefit fund of the health insurance society which will not be favourable.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme of the first world war, 1914-18, large numbers of people were kept in insurance by temporary legislation covering previous years.  The result of that legislation was to enable people to maintain themselves in insurance for a meagre contribution of 4/- or 5/- a year.  That enabled an unemployed person to obtain all the benefits of the Health Insurance Acts.  The scheme was entirely uneconomic from the point of view of the approved societies, and was regarded by everybody as imposing a strain on the resources of the societies that they should not be expected to bear.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us, before extending the free period from 12 to 18 months, whether there has been an actuarial valuation in respect to the funds.  Apart from the payment of two-ninths of the cost of administration of benefits, the State is giving nothing whatever to people whose insurance is being extended by 18 months.  The burden is going to fall entirely on the approved health insurance societies.  In other words, the funds of the health insurance society which should be available for additional benefits for those paying full contributions, are going to be mulcted to the extent of the concession under this Bill for those who are normally out of insurance for a period.  I should be glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether the effect of this proposal has been examined closely and, if so, whether any estimate is available as to the amount of burden the proposal <Col N="1420" /> will place on the funds of the health insurance society.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the finances of the society, to which Senator Douglas referred.  The funds of the society are determined by Departmental regulations.  There is no limit in the Acts to the amount of income which may be available to the society.  There is a provision in Section 53 of the Health Insurance Act, 1911, as amended by Section 70 of the Insurance Act, 1918, which enables the Minister to determine the amount of money which should be available to the health insurance society for this purpose.  In the first set of regulations made under the Act of 1911, the Government of the day provided a payment of 3/5 per head of insured members of each society as a fund for administering the approved society.  In 1919 that figure was increased to 4/5 per head, and in 1921 it was again increased to 4/10 per annum per head of insured contributor of the approved society.</P>
    <P>In 1924, the amount was reduced to 4/5.  For what reason?  Not because the cost of administration had been reduced, but because the State decided to grab 5d. per member of the approved society's administration fund for the purpose of setting up a scheme of medical referees.  The fund out of which medical referees are paid is largely a fund built up out of the normal resources of the approved society which, accordingly, are reduced to the extent of 5d. per head of membership per annum.  It is true that when amalgamation took place in 1923 the Government were optimistic that considerable savings in administration costs could be effected.  I think they were unduly optimistic, because they ignored the fact that the old approved societies, of which there were 65, had at their disposal a large amount of voluntary or badly-paid labour.</P>
    <P>Approved societies with 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 members carried on without the services of a single whole-time official.  They were able to do so because some member of the committee, or some active member of the society, particularly if it was a trade union society, was officially interested in <Col N="1421" /> health insurance and carried on the secretarial and office duties in his spare time for an honorarium.  Of course, that lessened the cost of administration and, in the case of a small society, the figure was almost infinitesimal.  In the case of larger societies, many of the staffs were very badly paid.  These staffs were transferred to the new society in a period in which nobody knew very clearly what the cost of administration was going to be.  They were transferred at low rates of remuneration. These rates have continued low ever since, and they continue low because the Department has refused to increase the appropriation available to the society for the cost of administration.</P>
    <P>An application recently come before the Labour Court by the trade union representing the employees of the health insurance society.  At that inquiry it transpired that girl typists are paid 20/- a week in the City of Dublin in this health insurance society.  As far as I can discover the maximum rate which a girl can hope to earn, unless she is promoted to a higher grade, is 53/- a week, and the highest grade a man can earn, unless he is promoted, is 62/- a week.  Some of these men might have ten, 12 or 15 years' service. Some of them might be married.  They are entitled to a wage of 62/- a week, plus an emergency bonus of 16/-.</P>
    <P>When the application came before the Labour Court, it was resisted not by the society but by the officials of the Government.  Two officers of the Government Department appeared before the Labour Court to resist the application of the employees.  The secretary of the society, in fact, while resisting the application so far as it was likely to impose a charge on the society beyond its resources, promised that if the court made an award it would be honoured by the society, and honoured retrospectively.  That, however, was not the attitude of the Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare, who told the court that there was only one of two ways in which the society's funds could be augmented to meet the claims of the staff.  One was, he said, to take money away from the additional <Col N="1422" /> benefits fund&mdash;that, of course, is sheer bunkum.  The other was to increase the weekly contributions&mdash;that also was bunkum.  The only way in which it is necessary to make an adjustment is to increase the appropriation to the society to the figure at which it stood before the 5d. per annum was taken away to provide a fund for the medical referees.</P>
    <P>There are altogether in the employment of the society a clerical staff numbering 270.  Of these, only 20 are earning £5 a week.  There are 35 men in the Grade B group, whose salaries commence at 64/- and reach a maximum of 80/-.  The ages of these men run from 26 to 40 and about half of them are married.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that 80/- inclusive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is 16/- bonus. There are 15 men on Grade C, who start at 80/- and go to 100/-, plus bonus.  There are 118 women clerks on the Grade A scale, who are paid a maximum of 52/- a week plus this emergency bonus.  That is being done at a time when all kinds of organisations in Great Britain are advertising in the Irish papers for clerks and typists and offering £5 to £7 a week.  A young girl whom I know left Dublin last month &mdash;she had got married and her husband was transferred to a position in London&mdash;and in London she saw an advertisement for a typist.  She answered it and was engaged right away at £7 a week.  To-day she would get £3 5s. 0d. or £3 10s. 0d. here. These are the conditions under which we expect people to administer one of our social services.  If the attitude adopted by the Department in relation to the application made on behalf of the staff of the National Health Insurance Society before the Labour Court represents the reflected view of the Government, then the social services in this country are going to become a byword.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge very strongly that the Parliamentary Secretary would convey to the Minister that the gravest dissatisfaction exists because of the manner in which the claims of the staff of the society are being met.  The last increase in wages granted to the staff was at the end of 1939 and the negotiations <Col N="1423" /> for that increase commenced in 1937.  It took two years' negotiations to extract from the society a paltry few shillings a week.  After the termination of the emergency, the staff at this time having become members of a union, the demand was made for an increase of 50 per cent. on the wages payable in 1939.  Now, that is not an outrageous application.  The cost of living has increased by 70 per cent. The staff were looking for 50 per cent. and if they were conceded the whole of the demand, they would still be in a worse position than in 1939.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that, when similar applications were before the Labour Court in respect of comparable employment, advances running as high as 60 per cent. were conceded.  Members of the House are probably familiar with the award made by the Labour Court in the case of the application made by the staff of the Electricity Supply Board.  It amounted to something like this: Anyone who was in receipt of £2 a week or less in 1939 was to get a 60 per cent. advance; those with salaries based on the 1939 figures running between £2 and, I think, £3 were to get 55 per cent. advance; on salaries between £3 and £4 the award was 50 per cent. and on salaries over £4, it was 45 per cent., I think.  Therefore, in asking for a flat rate increase of 50 per cent. on the 1939 standard, the staff of the society were not out of step with their colleagues in other comparable employments.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House with many details, although they are interesting for the purpose of making comparisons with the rates paid in other similar employments.  I think it might be said that, in the case of the Electricity Supply Board in respect of which an award was made recently by the Labour Court, the rates are about double the present standard of the Health Insurance Society.  In fact, it would be very difficult to find any kind of employment in the City of Dublin where the rates are nearly so low as they are in the case of the Health Insurance Society.</P>
    <P>This, as I have already said, is not due to any desire on the part of the <Col N="1424" /> committee of management to maintain a low standard of salaries and earnings for their staff.  It is due to the fact that the appropriations made to the society are insufficient to bear a reasonably decent scale of salaries.  It is true, of course, that there are claims on the society's funds above and beyond the claims of the staff.</P>
    <P>During the past seven or eight years the society has paid out of its reduced appropriation of 4/5 the sum of £200,000 in respect of new buildings, and of superannuations, pensions, and gratuities given to the officials of the old approved societies which were dissolved in 1933 or 1934.  Now, it is easy for the Government to be generous with other people's money, and the Government were rather generous when the 1933 Act was going through both Houses in awarding pensions and compensation to the former officials of the approved societies.  It did not make it clear, however, at the time that every penny of this compensation was to come out of the reduced appropriation made available for the administration of the National Health Insurance Society. I am not in a position to say what this House thought of that at the time, but what I imagine is that the House did not understand when the Bill was going through in 1933 that it was the lowly paid employees of the Health Insurance Society who would eventually be called upon to pay the compensation then made available for the staffs of the old approved societies.</P>
    <P>There is a rather novel proposal in this Bill which I want Senators to note and scrutinise with great care.  It is another financial proposal.  I refer to Section 17 of the Bill, which the Parliamentary Secretary passed over glibly, by saying that it was a simple thing: that it was going to deal with the supplementary sum which will be made-available to pay additional benefits. I do not accept that statement.  At present, the State is required by the Act of 1911, as amended subsequently, to refund to the Health Insurance Society two-ninths of the society's expenditure on benefits and two-ninths of its expenditure on administration.</P>
    <P>That has been the law for 35 years. It is important to bear in mind that the <Col N="1425" /> British Parliament, when enacting this legislation, set down clearly the liability of the State to pay certain sums. It limited the liability within the confines of the Act.  The Minister's proposal in this Bill is to take away all these limitations.  Under Section 17, he proposes that the obligation on the State to provide two-ninths of the benefits and two-ninths of the costs of administration shall be taken away. That obligation will no longer continue if Section 17 is passed in its present form, but instead there will be paid to the society, as from the 1st April, 1947, such sum as the Minister for Finance may think fit.  That is, roughly, what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>This is a case where the Minister for Social Welfare has capitulated and thrown up his hands.  Instead of defending the claims of the society and of the insured persons, he is simply saying: &ldquo;I am going to accept anything which the Department of Finance thinks fit to make available.&rdquo;  I do not think the Oireachtas should pass legislation giving a blank cheque to the Minister for Finance to pay as much, or as little, as he thinks fit in respect of this service.  It has not been the practice heretofore to do that.  The obligations of the Minister in respect of unemployment insurance and of other services are set out clearly in the statute creating these services.  That is so because the House, obviously, must have a means of checking up on what has been done, and so the House wants the Comptroller and Auditor-General to audit the books and the accounts of that Department with regard to its statutory obligations.  Once we pass Section 17 the only thing that the Comptroller and Auditor-General can do is to see that none of the money is stolen.  He will have no function whatever to say that the Minister paid too much or too little, because there is neither an upward limit nor a lower limit so far as this section is concerned. Above all, this House will have no say whatever in respect of national insurance once this Bill becomes law in its present form.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Dáil may, on the appropriate Estimate, raise questions in respect of administration and of the provisions made in the Act.  Their <Col N="1426" /> adequacy, or otherwise, may be challenged in the Dáil, but that function does not rest with this House.  We have no opportunity of discussing the Estimates or of discussing administration because, at least, one Minister has repeatedly said here that he is not responsible to this House for the administration of his Department.  This House should, therefore, be very slow to give its <i>imprimatur</i> to a proposal such as this which sweeps away any pretence to control that Parliament may have over the appropriation of public moneys.  I want to protest as strongly as I can against that proposal. I want Senators, irrespective of the side of the House on which they sit, to take note of what is being done and to ensure that there will be good and sufficient reasons given for a proposal which takes away from Parliament any control over finance: which, in fact, takes away from the Minister responsible for administering this Bill any control over the financial structure of the Bill, and hands that over to the Department of Finance without any guidance, control or check whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirleach, I, like Senator Duffy, welcome this Bill.  It is some years ago since I advocated some of the points brought into the Bill.  I think first of all it would be right for me to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister, when introducing this Bill in the Dáil, made it quite clear that this was but a temporary measure pending the introduction of more comprehensive legislation to cover national health insurance. The Bill is very simple.  The first important change it proposes is the raising of the wage level from £250 to £500.  Anybody associated with-national health insurance in any way, either as a worker or as an employer, realises that this change is absolutely essential.  There has been a number of increases in wages given in recent months and many of the workers found as a result that their salaries having been raised above £250 were not regarded as insurable workers and, consequently, not entitled to benefits. Senator Douglas mentioned cases of workers objecting to the ceiling being raised to £500.  I could well understand <Col N="1427" /> this if this Bill was not introduced, because those people would not be entitled to any national health insurance benefit except those who are entitled to receive widows' and orphans' pensions.  Now, under the new Bill, they will be entitled to all the benefits and I feel that salaried workers of this type will not have any serious objection to becoming insured workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy, in his statement, overlooked a very important part of this Bill, namely, the increase in benefits. Sickness benefit is increased from 15/- to 26/- a week and disablement from 7/6 to 15/- a week and all those increases are going to be borne by the National Health Insurance Fund.  This brings us back to the line taken by Senator Duffy in regard to the old system of grants by the Government. Here we have provisions made for increasing the benefits. There is no provision for increasing the contributions, therefore, in my view, the increased benefits must be met by Government grants which must be sufficiently large to cover the additional benefits for the additional number of people who will be brought in under the Acts.  I welcome the Bill, as I have said, and I want to make this point. Recognising that it is a temporary measure I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department to bear in mind when drafting the more comprehensive and permanent measure, these suggestions.  I feel that greater benefit should be made available for married men with families than for single workers.  While there is an increase in the benefits under this Bill I feel than when the new Bill is being drafted serious consideration should be given to the advisability of increasing the benefits for married men with families.  Senator Duffy did refer to married men suffering from tuberculosis who might have to be sent to sanatoria.  There, again, I understand that under the Public Health Bill provisions will be made for those people but it is in the case of the worker who contracts some illness other than tuberculosis that I am interested at the moment and for whom <Col N="1428" /> I think increased benefits should be made available.  I know it is not possible to do that in this Bill but it will be possible to do it in the more comprehensive measure which will be before the House shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the most that can be said for this National Health Bill is that it is a slight improvement on the Act that it replaces. By raising the figure that brings certain classes of workers within the provisions of the Acts, from £250 to £500, great numbers of workers not now covered by national health insurance will be brought within the purview of the present Act.  I agree with Senator Hawkins that even though increases in sickness benefit are provided for by this Bill, increases from 15/- to 22/6 a week, this is not enough in the case of married persons.  In the new Bill which is to follow I hope, with Senator Hawkins, that this point will not be overlooked by the Minister.  Much greater increased benefits for a man with family responsibilities who happens to be sick should be provided.  It is a pity in a scheme of national health insurance that in certain eventualities beneficiaries will have to have recourse to poor law or home assistance.  Take the case of a married man.  Even though he will be provided with 22/6 a week under this Bill he will not have enough to maintain his family and he must apply for home assistance to supplement the national health benefit. There is another aspect in which this Bill is at fault and that is it does not provide for free medical assistance.  In the event of a sick beneficiary having to request the services of a doctor, unless he is able to pay the doctor for his services, he will have to apply for a red ticket.  This means that we still have the old poor law assistance supplementing this scheme of national health benefit.  I feel that a more comprehensive Bill is necessary and that if the Minister could wait until the Public Health Bill becomes law, a more comprehensive measure could be provided. As I have said, this Bill is just a slight improvement on the existing system and I feel that even though it is not mentioned here, beneficiaries in certain eventualities may have to apply <Col N="1429" /> for home assistance to supplement their benefits and where the services of a doctor are required, they will have to go to an assistance officer or to a warden for a red ticket.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Earl of Longford</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all recognise the necessity for the Parliamentary Secretary's promoting this Bill.  I think we all wish to see better benefits for the sick and better conditions for the workers all round.  I do agree, however, with Senator Douglas that there are certain cases where this Bill may have rather surprising results.  I am referring particularly to the most important clause, the sting in the tail of the Bill, which raises the limit from £250 to £500 a year.  I want to talk for the moment about a class of people of whom, I am sure, Senators know very little&mdash;the members of the theatrical profession. The greater numbers of the actors in Dublin with the exception of the beginners get salaries of between £5 and £10 a week.  It does arise in the case of my own company, the Gate Theatre, that there are a round dozen of them &mdash;practically all&mdash;who get salaries of this amount, and the bringing in of this measure will be a very serious increase in the weekly bill of a concern which is carrying on under great difficulty and I think the same applies to most of the other concerns in Dublin. We might gladly pass this if we were quite convinced that it was going to be of any practical value.  Actually, I am quite certain that the actors themselves would hotly deny that it was of any benefit at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a practice which was probably quite illegal carried on up to a couple of years ago under which, in Dublin at any rate, actors were tacitly exempted from national health insurance. The employment of actors is exceedingly irregular&mdash;a man may work for a week or two and then perhaps not work again for months.  That is quite common in the profession and they were tacitly exempted.  I am not saying that was a good thing.  In fact in the case of some actors, I think it was a bad thing.  Then, suddenly, I think, certain actors applied to be put under the scheme and the scheme was enforced.  We, the managers of the <Col N="1430" /> Dublin theatres, tried to find out from the National Health Society whether or not actors were included under the scheme.  For two years we were not given any answer at all.  Then, suddenly, we were informed that we were liable for arrears.  That matter was fixed up not very satisfactorily but in some way or another, and the scheme was then enforced in a most extraordinary way.  There are a number of people about the stage and you would not call them actors.  They appear in small parts, and in many theatres they are not paid at all.  It is the custom in our theatre to pay them a guinea a week.  It is not meant to be a wage but to cover their expenses.  Then, you are now asked to pay a contribution for them.  That all means an increased expenditure in the case of a business where the majority of the employees get between £5 and £10 a week and are irregularly employed and many of them will not go on with it for their lives.</P>
    <P>I would point out one other thing: many of the regular employees get benefits from the company far exceeding anything that will be paid under this scheme.  Very often you will find that actors who are sick for weeks are paid their full salary, getting £6 or £7 a week.  As Senator Douglas suggested, this sort of thing can hardly continue if they are brought under the new scheme.  There are a number of anomalies which do arise and I can see why it tacitly but illegally happened that they were exempted from the national health scheme.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this matter.  I am sure there are many other professions in which the scheme is a hardship rather than a benefit for the workers.  I want to see the workers well-treated and getting every benefit which they possibly can get and I want to see everything being done for their good but I do not want to see hardship inflicted either on myself or anybody else.  I would like to be assured that the worker is going to benefit in all cases by the raising of this exemption figure from £250 to £400.  I agree with Senator Douglas that the matter should be very carefully considered.  So far as the workers who are to benefit are concerned, I do <Col N="1431" /> not want to stand in their way but let us be sure they are really going to benefit before anything rash is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Senator Lord Longford that according to the works of Shakespeare, if his suggestion were adopted, there would be no one at all insured.  I think it was Shakespeare who said, &ldquo;Men and women are merely players.&rdquo;  If we apply that generally no one would be insured.  Actors are a comparatively small section of the community and the number involved in the new arrangement would be comparatively small. The hardship would not be great.  As to the people who are working for a guinea a week, that is only pin money. Therefore, I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary would be very much concerned about that matter.</P>
      <P>I want to say I am very disappointed that the new Minister for Social Welfare did not consider it worth while to come into the House for this Bill. There were a lot of things I wanted to say.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry to hear the Minister is not well.  I am not in any way disparaging the Parliamentary Secretary.  We had Parliamentary Secretaries on this job before and we did not care a lot about them.  The point here is that this national health insurance is a very serious and very important part of our national life and up to now it has not got anything like the consideration or the encouragement that it is entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present National Health Insurance Society was originally organised by the man who is now President of Ireland and apparently he picked his team very well&mdash;too well for some <Col N="1432" /> people, I believe.  He chose Dr. Dignan as chairman and with nearly ten years' experience of Dr. Dignan I am perfectly satisfied that a more competent or a more earnest chairman never presided over the national health insurance business.  I say that with very long and varied experience of people controlling the business of institutions.  I see the chairman looking at me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult for me to speak when I know what is going on behind the scenes in the management and control of the National Health Insurance Society.  I want to say that during the chairmanship of Dr. Dignan the funds of this society went up enormously and at one time we were told that we could not pay additional benefits until the reserve fund was in or about £12,000,000.  This was a matter of contention between the committee of that time and the Department. We could make no impression whatever on them.  That did not lead to harmonious working.  For that and other reasons, when Dr. Rowlette, one of the trustees of the society, died, he was replaced by a civil servant.  In my opinion, the idea behind this appointment was to put the committee of the National Health Insurance Society in much the same position as the committee of Cork Street Hospital&mdash;to label them spendthrifts and incompetent people.  Fortunately, in this case, a very competent and very able man was appointed.  He was also a very conscientious man.  After a thorough investigation into the management and control of the society, he certified that it had been run in a most efficient and economic manner&mdash;that it could not be run more economically. The excuse for getting rid of certain people on the committee was, accordingly, lost.  But another means was found.  The chairman had the audacity to publish proposals for a much better and more comprehensive scheme of social insurance than that of the National Health Insurance Society. For that, he was cast into oblivion.</P>

      <P>I shall try, but I claim as much latitude as previous speakers received and I hope I shall get it.  I shall keep myself within the rules of debate&mdash;a job which is difficult enough. What is the position now?  Some two years ago, those proposals by Dr. Dignan were published.  We were told that they were not worth while, that the Government had a more comprehensive and a better scheme to put before the people.  We are still waiting for the Government's proposals.  So far as we know, nothing is being done. Every organised body which has spoken on this matter has declared in favour of a comprehensive social insurance scheme.  When are we to get it?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary in a position to tell us when we may expect a a comprehensive social insurance scheme?  This measure is very insignificant when compared with a complete scheme of social insurance.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with the proposal to increase the insurable limit for non-manual workers to £500.  These people should have been insured long ago. Remember, they are coming into a perfectly solvent insurance society, well able to cover their contributions.  In three years they will be in a position to enjoy the additional benefits&mdash; dental, optical, hospital treatment, and so on&mdash;which are very substantial. They will certainly be in a position to get value for their money.  In addition, they will help the other members of the society and I hope that, in the future, when we have this all-embracing measure which we have been promised&mdash;a measure better than anybody else has suggested, better even than the Beveridge scheme&mdash;people having £1,000 per annum will be insured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Health Insurance Society gives an opportunity for employment to the workman's son and <Col N="1434" /> daughter.  The standard for the examination is the leaving certificate of the primary schools.  Consequently, the ordinary national schoolboy or schoolgirl has an opportunity of getting what ought to be fairly good employment. One of the speakers mentioned that the minimum wage was 30/-.  At the time I left, it was 35/-.  When the committee took over, it was 22/6 a week. The committee were extremely economical and ran the insurance society on the lowest possible figure.  It has already been mentioned that the amount allocated for administration, generally, plus payment of compensation in connection with the amalgamation, plus payment for all the buildings, had to come out of the 4/5 allowance. That has not been increased and, consequently, the employees in this institution have wages much lower than those in similar employment elsewhere. Mention may be made of the Electricity Supply Board and others.  I do not know what standard of education is required for entrance to the Electricity Supply Board, but I suggest that the people employed in this society are very efficient and very competent. In saying that, I speak from experience.  They are not paid the wages they should be paid.</P>
    <P>In connection with the recent approach to the Labour Court, mention was made of an increase in wages which took place in 1940.  That increase had been the subject of negotiation for nearly two years.  Ultimately, when conceded, the committee, feeling that the employees were so badly treated, granted them two annual increments to compensate for the long period during which they were denied this increase in salary.  When the matter was before the Labour Court, this was taken as a war increase, plus the emergency or war bonus of 16/-, and it would appear then that these people had not got such a raw deal.  That was shrewd work on the part of the representatives of what I might call the new Ministry.  The position to-day is that these people are being paid salaries that are not comparable with what is paid in private employment.  The Parliamentary Secretary can put me right if it is not a fact that the 4/5 could be increased by Ministerial Order.  The 4/5 is entirely <Col N="1435" /> inadequate to meet the commitments necessary to pay salaries that the staff should get which would keep them in ordinary frugal comfort.  I tell the Parliamentary Secretary that he may have very serious trouble on hands in the near future, if he does not give these people some assurance as to when their grievance is likely to be remedied, or when their position will be brought somewhat on a par with similar employees, not only in the City of Dublin but all over Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, through the Parliamentary Secretary, will give the matter serious attention.  Nobody wants trouble.  Certainly from what I know of the staff of the National Health Insurance Society they are not anxious for it.  But there is a limit to human endurance and they certainly have an outstanding grievance as regards salaries.  The matter has been going on for a long time.  They have been looking forward to some improvement.  As far as they know there is to be no improvement in their position.  I tell the Parliamentary Secretary that something should be done at once concerning the 4/5 allocated for administration.  It simply cannot be done on that amount.  The claims on the 4/5 are so great that the reserve funds have been used up. There is going to be an increase in income from £170,000 or £175,000 to £250,000.  That was hardly ever contemplated by ordinary contributors to the society.  There might be an opportunity now to do something for those who have to administer the society.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take serious notice of the position he is faced with there, and that he will see that any comprehensive scheme here will compare with that in countries in the immediate neighbourhood.  If the social services here remain so much behind those of neighbouring countries the barrier created will be hard to get rid of.  That is all I wish to say on this Bill now.  Otherwise, I might say something that might not be in accordance with its terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with this Bill oh a rather different basis.  I <Col N="1436" /> agree that it is a temporary Bill.  It is also a Bill that was prepared in great haste, prepared apparently without much thought.  I have seen a great many Bills, but I have never seen a Bill drafted like this.  Having been drafted we are told that it is wanted before the end of the financial year.  This is March 25th, next week is Holy Week, and next Tuesday is April 1st.  The position is really extraordinary.  The Bill is not a comprehensive one.  I hope when a comprehensive Bill is about to be brought in, that the promise given on one occasion to a member of this House, that when Bills of this kind, which are of a non-political nature, are brought in, a White Paper will be tabled to give an opportunity of discussing them.  I hope that there will be an opportunity of discussing national health and social insurance.</P>
      <P>The position of the staff of the unified society has been mentioned.  I repeat the question that Senator Foran asked. Is it not the case that the Minister for Social Services can by Order increase the 4/5 per person out of which the cost of administration comes.  If he can, he certainly should do so, because the salaries paid are not good or even passable in comparison with other salaries.</P>
      <P>Another point is that when this Bill was originally introduced in the Dáil it raised the figure for compulsory insurance to £400.  The Minister's line was that £250 in 1939 corresponds roughly to £400 now, and in the Dáil, rather light-heartedly and without any consideration, he made the figure £500. Having made the figure £500 we are now invited to pass this Bill.  While I agree with Senator Foran that in certain circumstances the figure might be made £1,000, these circumstances have not arisen.  When you are going to make an important change of this kind you should start off by hearing what the persons concerned think about it. At first flush I would be entirely in favour of giving benefit to people who got no national health benefit.  There are more sides to the story than one. A great many people who will pay will never receive any benefit at all.  I agree that that is not a very bad thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me look at it from another <Col N="1437" /> aspect.  Why is this Bill wanted in a hurry?  It consists of 19 sections.  On Section 11, Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15 and 16, are retrospective. Eleven sections end with a different date like Section 3, which consists of two sub-sections.  Sub-section (2) of Section 3 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (1) of this section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the 14th day of June, 1946.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is so about 11 sections what is the hurry?  Section 17 is the one to which Senator Duffy objected because of the Minister's power to make any grant he felt inclined&mdash;not necessarily two-ninths&mdash;as from the 1st April, 1947. If we pass this Bill on April 15th or May 15th that section could be amended so as to be ante-dated to the 1st April, 1947.  Section 19 is the one which raises the limit to £500 and is to come into operation on a day to be fixed by the Minister.  Therefore, I am baffled to understand why there is any hurry about this Bill.  There is no hurry that I can see.  There has been some suggestion that the Minister for Social Welfare has to estimate but the Estimate can be passed without passing this Bill, and most emphatically the benefits purported to be given can be ante-dated as they are in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is not a political matter.  It is one in which we are all interested.  We are all interested in seeing social services properly conducted and proper benefits provided.  We must be also interested in public discussion.  This is a Bill that must be discussed when a decision has been reached to make an important change, such as raising the limit to £500, and making the Minister liable to pay such sum as he might determine.  That may be good or bad.  Certainly we should not rush a Bill of this kind.  There is no case whatever for asking us to pass the Bill to-night or to-morrow.  If there is a case, the Parliamentary Secretary will have to make it in greater detail and for a greater contingency than we have heard of so far.  I know there are things in the Bill which are good, such as increased benefits, but the Bill is a temporary one and is not a comprehensive Bill.  It is a stop-gap Bill and <Col N="1438" /> there is no reason in the world why such a Bill should contain very important provisions and be rushed through on grounds which seem to me to have no reality at all in them.</P>

There has been some suggestion that we are trying to put something across the House.  The Bill, apart from certain enactments which are to be put in permanent form on the Statute Book, is essential in order that the plans of the Minister for Social Welfare, for increasing widows' and orphans' pensions rates and national health insurance benefits on a temporary basis, can be put into effect in a manner which is equitable and which will suit the workers of the country.  The financial year begins on April 1st and the Estimate will be moved in the Dáil before that date.  Unless this Bill is passed, the State will continue to pay a two-ninths proportion towards the administration and benefit expenses of the National Health Insurance Society. It is desirable, therefore, that the Bill be passed, in order to pay, in addition to the two-ninths which will continue to be paid, an extra sum representing the cost of the increased allowances.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we have been made aware that very large numbers of persons have been going or will go out of insurance, consequent on recent increases in wages awarded as a result of negotiations between employers and trade unions.  Senator Douglas raised the general question as to why we increased the maximum remuneration for national health insurance and widows' and orphans' pensions from £400 to £500.  The answer is quite simple.  We did it at the unanimous. request of the members of the Dáil and did it because of representations made to us on every side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be unnecessary for me to go into the general question as to why social insurance is established and what <Col N="1439" /> classes of workers it should cover.  The members of the House are as well aware of the sociological and philosophical principles underlying social insurance as I am or the Minister.  The general basis is one of providing collective responsibility by the community at large for the interests of those who suffer from sickness or through loss of the breadwinner.  If the State makes a contribution towards such insurance schemes, the less well-paid section of the community will benefit thereby and there will be a greater sense of security among that section of the community who have very little of a surplus with which to counter the effect of sickness or widowhood.</P>
    <P>The £400 limit originally proposed was arrived at in this way.  A calculation was made as to what the salary of a worker who, in 1939, was receiving £5 per week was likely to be in 1947, allowing for normal increments, for the bonuses that have been paid since that date, and the awards recently made by the Labour Court or through negotiation. The salary estimated was, roughly, something less than £400.  That is a very approximate calculation.  One could argue about it and suggest that it was a most difficult calculation, but, as I say, it is only approximate.  I think that in general the tendency is to include a larger and larger section of the community in social insurance schemes.  Members of the House will not disagree with me when I say that people who have an income of in or about £500, and who have family responsibilities, are no longer in the position of persons who can provide entirely for both sickness benefit and for widowhood by means of voluntary insurance.  It has been found, in fact, that private insurance companies so far have not suffered in any way from the growth of social insurance directed by the State.  In fact, it has become more and more necessary to insure a larger group of workers in this way.  I myself think that if I had been Minister for Social Welfare I might have suggested the figure of £400, with the very definite idea in my mind that I would increase it if there was any pressure brought to bear on me in that direction. I think the figure of £500 is <Col N="1440" /> reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances. The number of persons who will be affected will be between 40,000 and 45,000.  The number of workers insured as a whole is over ten times that number.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins referred to the desirability of increasing the benefits for married men with children.  The Minister for Social Welfare, in the course of his Second Reading speech in the Dáil, said that he was considering a system of comprehensive social insurance to cover all types of benefit, including all income and maintenance services, and that he hoped to increase the contributory factor.  He said that he would certainly consider the question of children when examining the whole of our social insurance legislation. The members of the House are aware of the very great task confronting the Minister.  There are so many codes in which the statutory benefits, the duration of benefit, the time-lag between the cesser of insurance and its recommencement differ, and in which the systems of inspection differ, that it will be some considerable time before the Minister can bring forward a scheme for consideration.  In the meantime, the Minister for Social Welfare has lost no time in considering what could be done in the interval.  It is because he desires to provide temporary increases at the earliest date possible that he is asking the indulgence of the House to have this measure passed as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran spoke about disputes that have taken place in the past in regard to national health insurance with the Minister for Local Government.  I do not intend to discuss that matter.  I would, however, like to make it clear that the present Government yields to no one in its claim to consider the needs of social insurance in this country.  The present Government inaugurated widows' and orphans' pensions and children's allowances.  It unified the national health insurance societies.  It agreed to certain additional benefits being paid to national health insurance contributors, and it agreed to an alteration in the manner in which the reserves were considered from the <Col N="1441" /> standpoint of the National Health Insurance Society.  In connection with a great deal of social insurance legislation and social service legislation in general, the present Government yields to no one.  In fact it has been in advance of many countries in Europe. During the war, we had other matters to consider.  Some other nations of the world have adopted principles of social service and social insurance that are as elaborate as ours.  The proposals in this Bill are part of the Government's policy to continue and improve social insurance, and to see that everything is done to increase the security of the worker.</P>
    <P>Senator Ruane mentioned the question of medical assistance.  The Minister for Social Welfare made it quite clear that the question of health services is being kept separate from income maintenance services.  They are part of a different code.  Senator Lord Longford referred to the position of actors and the members of the theatrical profession in Dublin.  There may be a number of other professions similarly affected where contributions in connection with pensions may seem to be burdensome.  The actual contribution of 8d. per week amounts to 34/- per year in the case of each person and even in the case of those who, as Senator Foran says, are paid pin-money of a guinea or so a week, for taking part on the stage, it should not be beyond the genius and capacity of the Senator's fellow-workers to find a solution. Senator Duffy referred to the question of whether the health insurance fund would be adversely affected by increasing the free period from a year to 18 months.  The Minister is satisfied that this burden can be borne for the short time that will be involved pending the enactment of social legislation of a permanent and comprehensive kind.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy and Senator Foran too, referred to the question of the wages paid to the employees of the National Health Insurance Society. I do not propose to discuss this matter at the present time.  I think it would be most inadvisable to do so.  The question of wages is one for the management of the society and the <Col N="1442" /> workers concerned.  The Minister's duties are those of ensuring that the relation between expenditure and administration of the benefits is reasonable and wisely conceived.  I would like, however, to make one point clear and it is this: from the year 1939 to the year 1946 salaries and wages expenditure of the National Health Insurance Society increased from £80,000 to £120,000&mdash;by 50 per cent. Suggestions have been made to the contrary.  One Senator, at least, gave the impression there had been no such increase.  I am just mentioning this now.  As I said before, it would be most inadvisable for me to say more about this question of wages at the present time.</P>

      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether the Minister is satisfied that the present figure of 4/5 is a just figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Senator, the question of 4/5 is a matter which would naturally come under consideration.  In view of the increases that have taken place it would be most unnatural for the Minister in exercising general supervision, so to speak, over these contributions and the administration and expenses, to limit the rate in an inequitable manner.  I say it is a matter largely for the management of the insurance society and the workers to decide what the equitable wages should be.  Senator Hayes referred to the desirability of issuing a White Paper when matters of this kind are being discussed.  Senator Hayes received two White Papers, one on national health insurance and one on widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary misunderstood me. What I did say, I think, was that when we come to discuss the general question of reorganising public health and social services we hoped to get the opportunity of discussing a White Paper, first of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already stated that an elaborate White Paper will be available for the more comprehensive measure.  Senator Duffy has some fear that the State guarantee <Col N="1443" /> of two-ninths contribution might, in some way, be affected by the section of the Bill which provides for increased benefit.  That is not the case.  The two-ninths contribution will remain under present national health legislation. The status of the National Health Insurance Society and the contribution it receives from the State are in no way prejudiced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat what I have already stated, that the Minister proposes to pay the increased benefits and the Estimate will come before the Dáil.  It is desirable that all those who come in under the Bill and the contributions made on their behalf should be known before the beginning of the financial year.  It would be impossible for the Minister to introduce the Estimate to-morrow unless the Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary really in earnest in telling me that?  I know a little about Estimates but this is a new one on me. Does he seriously think that the Minister cannot estimate the contribution by the State?  Suppose you passed the Bill on the 16th April you could put in an amendment to Section 17 to say this comes into operation on the 1st.  There is not anything in it really.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Estimate, this Bill is mentioned and unless the Bill is passed the Estimate will have to be withdrawn.  It is most undesirable to have the increases in benefits and the changed status of the workers not altered within the financial year.  I can assure the Senators that there is no special motive.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in this at all.  If we met on the 16th April and passed this Bill we would know when we were discussing it in Committee what the people would think of certain things in it.  If we gave him all stages of this Bill on the 16th April, he could do his Estimate on the 17th. I am not a betting man but I would not mind making a wager that he would not do the Estimate a moment earlier than that.  Apart from this question of the Estimates it is most undesirable that at the end of a session a rather big Bill which is full of references to other Acts is brought along and the Seanad asked to pass it in one night. Even if I agreed with all of the Bill&mdash; and I do agree with most of it&mdash;I would like to consult certain people about it and have certain views on it.  But now we get no opportunity.  I think if the Minister got the Bill on the 16th April he would not be damnified.</P>

That was done, I would say, to expedite the passing of the Bill because the ceiling at that time was £400.  I do not see any good reason why, when we are here in agreement with the general principle of the Bill and when we have the assurance of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a comprehensive Bill coming along&mdash;I do not see why we should not facilitate the Minister, by at least passing the Bill this week, so that the provisions of the Bill may be implemented by the 1st of April.</P>

Let us be consistent, whether we like it or not; on all sides of this House, we have got certain responsible duties to carry through.  We were sent here to do a job of work and that job is to consider legislation that is put before us.  If we are not to consider it, then the sooner we get out of this House the better.  It is utterly fantastic and farcical to suggest that the Bill of some 19 sections is going to be seriously considered between 5.30 and 10 o'clock on a Tuesday night and go through all the stages at that.  Let us be honest with ourselves and if we are going to treat legislation like that let us not delude the people that we are doing our duty. Let us tell them that we are just rubber-stamping everything that is brought in here.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the Committee Stage or other stages being taken to-morrow, but I have repeatedly protested in this House against all stages of a Bill being taken at the one sitting.  I think it is desirable that having heard the explanations on the Second Reading there should be an opportunity for members to consider what amendments they should put down and what lines they should take in regard to them.  I think there should be an interval between. I have no personal objection to the Committee Stage being taken to-morrow, and if the Committee Stage is <Col N="1447" /> passed, no objection to the remaining stages.  My objection is that the Bill should not go through all its stages at one sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask for the co-operation of the House to a greater degree.  The Minister is very anxious that these benefits and increases should be paid as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is working against time to improve the social services of the country.  He does not want the increases and the benefits of national health insurance deferred for what might be a month.  It is his earnest wish that they should be paid as soon as possible, at the beginning of the financial year, and that is why we have suggested that the Bill should pass all its stages to-night.  I should have thought the House would be sympathetic to the Minister's idea and anxious to co-operate.  Part of this legislation, as I have said, is only temporary. The Minister is considering comprehensive social insurance and should any undesirable effects arise from the increase in the maximum remuneration margin to £500, those could be discussed when the comprehensive scheme is introduced.  The only section in the Bill which is not retrospective in character is that which deals with the two-ninths contribution and the section re the insurability limit. That is a very important section of the Bill and relates to the Estimate.  I would ask the indulgence of the House on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike the kind of approach the Parliamentary Secretary has just made to this.  We are as anxious as the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister that these benefits should be made available but what we want is that they should be made available in the ordinary way through legislation which we have a fair opportunity to study.  We do not want to fix something in legislation even though we are told that it may be only temporary without an opportunity of <Col N="1448" /> knowing the people's reactions to this. If the only way to make benefits available to some, is to do something to other people that may be unpleasant or disagreeable for them, we ought at least know that.  I cannot yet get clear as to what the Parliamentary Secretary means by the Minister wanting to have this Estimate passed.  I do not understand that.</P>
      <P>I must say that I am at a loss to know why it is necessary for the Minister to get the Bill to-night.  By means of the Bill, you can make provision for these payments in such a way that the people concerned will not have their benefits curtailed by reason of the fact that sufficient time has been given to the study of the measure.  Senator Hawkins will admit that every Minister is facilitated here, not alone from the point of view of being shown consideration but also by the fact that a considerable amount of labour is put into the tasks of this House by rather a limited number of persons.  Account should be taken of that.  I beg those who will support the Government by vote to take that into account.  If there be a certain number of persons here who leave their mark on the legislation of the Oireachtas, they ought to have a reasonable opportunity for considering what step they will take next. We do not want to handicap the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary. We do plead that they should have an appreciation of the fact that we are in a certain position.  We should like to know through what gap we are being pulled or pushed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter, we are asked to be indulgent to the Minister. As it happens, the present Minister for Social Welfare is a Minister whose relations with this House have always been peculiarly happy.  I have no objection to facilitating him or to facilitating the Parliamentary Secretary, for that matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary will himself realise that the argument he uses to-night is an argument that can always be used regarding this type of Bill.  When the Government bring in legislation which is going to help somebody and when they ask to have it passed in haste, they can always say: &ldquo;If you do not pass this <Col N="1449" /> Bill to-night, Paddy Murphy will not get his benefit on the 1st April, 1st August or 1st November, as the case may be.&rdquo;  That is a specious argument and the Parliamentary Secretary knows that.  It is specious in that it applies to all sorts of Bills, irrespective of their merits, provided somebody is to get something out of them.  We do not object to people getting increased benefits but we do object to this House being made a mockery.  This is a Bill of 19 sections.  Eleven of them are retrospective, one of them is important, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, and all contain references to other Acts which are difficult to follow.  We are told that the Minister for Social Welfare is only beginning and that this is a temporary Bill.  But the Parliamentary Secretary who is in charge of the Bill to-night has been there all the time and, if the matter had been thought out, the Bill could have been introduced long ago.  Therefore, there is no excuse for this haste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no difference between discussing the provisions of this Bill in Committee to-night and discussing them to-morrow.  I am not basing my objection to these provisions being discussed now in Committee on any kind of technicality or on Parliamentary usage but on practical grounds and on principle as well&mdash;namely, that we should discuss intelligently and intelligibly the measures which are put before us and that we cannot discuss the sections of this Bill to-night or to-morrow afternoon on that basis.  There is no reason for haste.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will accept an amendment from me, that the Committee Stage be taken on the 16th April, he can get his Estimate passed the following day&mdash;17th April&mdash;and he can pay the benefits from the 1st April.  Of that, there can be no doubt whatever.  There is no difficulty in passing an Estimate on the 17th April, payment under which may begin on the 1st April.  Nobody will have got the payment earlier, if I know anything about this matter.  I can refer to only one example.  A maid in my house had appendicitis.  She went into hospital. She was in hospital for 11 days.  On coming out, she stayed a week in my place and then went home to Kerry. When she came back from Kerry, she <Col N="1450" /> received her insurance benefit.  That is a fair example.  If anybody is to get benefits as from the 1st April, the Minister for Social Welfare is just as well off with an Estimate passed on the 17th April as he would be with one passed on 26th March.  The Minister is ill and will not be able to have his Estimate passed, in any event.  We are not asking the Parliamentary Secretary to do anything that is unreasonable and we are not preventing anybody from getting increased benefits.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that the increased benefits were to be paid out on Thursday morning.  The increased benefits cannot become payable until the Estimate is passed and the date for payment fixed.  That should be fixed in the Estimate.  The number of persons who will actually have come into benefit and who will require to be paid retrospectively will be very small, indeed.  For that reason, there is every argument for delaying the further consideration of the measure and there is no administrative case to be met. There is no administrative difficulty in getting what is required done.  The argument which the Parliamentary Secretary puts up is one that could be used in the case of every Bill.  I have said over and over again that that argument is not peculiar to this Government. It is a type of argument which was used before by other people and will be used again by other people. I heard it in the Dáil and in the Seanad and in my office when I was Ceann Comhairle.  The Minister concerned always regarded his Bill as all-important and urged that he wanted it immediately.</P>
    <P>I should like to move as an amendment, that the Committee Stage of this Bill be taken on 16th April.  On that date, I shall be breast high for giving the Minister all the other stages and no harm will have been done to anybody.</P>

      <P>Under this Bill, I take it that it is only cases reported after the 1st April which will come into benefit.  Insured persons do not get insurance benefit for the first three days of their illness or perhaps, for a week, at most.  Therefore, the question <Col N="1451" /> will not arise during the first week of April.  You will have your Bill passed and your Estimate ready before these people can come into benefit.</P>

      <P>If the Minister's intention is to increase the benefits by 50 per cent., it is not just so easy to make out a case for deferring the further stages of the Bill.  The old claimants would receive benefit on the 1st April. If we were unduly to delay the measure, it would be contended that the Seanad was responsible for keeping claimants under the national health insurance out of 50 per cent. of their benefit.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept Senator Hayes' amendment.  This Bill has been described as a stop-gap and as a temporary measure.  Under Section 19, it is proposed to take a very big step and that step requires consideration. That section proposes to bring, as the Parliamentary Secretary has admitted, about 45,000 additional persons into national health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose we cannot inquire as to the feelings of those people who are being forced into the scheme but we should like to know whether the machinery of national health insurance, as it exists, is fitted for dealing with this greatly increased number.  The statutory benefits are to be increased by 50 per cent.  I am concerned about the additional benefits.  When the right of those new entrants to the additional benefits matures&mdash;I suppose in three years&mdash;the period for actuarial purposes will still be running.  We used to have to put a stop to additional benefits for a certain period.  I should like to know, in respect of those 45,000 persons whom we are taking in by the hair of the head without asking them their view and without considering the implications of our action, whether there will be full provision for them and whether they will get some good out of national health insurance.  To a man with £500 a year, the statutory benefits, sickness benefit and disablement benefit, would not be very satisfactory. We were hoping that, when the promised Social Insurance Bill came along, <Col N="1452" /> the needs of different classes would be considered.  We must see that when the additional benefits mature they will be available.  Will the additional hospitalisation be available?  Are we hurrying on the provision of hospitalisation so that when the benefits accrue people will get them?  These are matters for consideration.  We cannot bring 45,000 people into this scheme in half an hour without consideration. That is why I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will accept the amendment of Senator Hayes and give more time to consider the matter.</P>

      <P>If this Bill passes to-night there will have to be an interregnun before it is presented to the President for signature, and I suggest that it cannot be presented before Saturday next.  This House will rise on Thursday or Friday and no Estimate will be presented before April 16th when the Dáil meets again.  Accordingly it does not matter whether the Bill is passed to-night or not.  There will be an Act before Easter.  There will be no Estimate until there is an Act and there will be no additional money until the Estimate is passed.  Actually we were misled when told that somebody would be deprived of benefit on April 1st if the Bill was not passed to-night.</P>

The insurance benefit year commences in July, and the insurance contribution year in January.  Would additional benefits be payable before the next insurance year?  They cannot be payable on 1st April.  I believe they cannot be payable before July 6th.</P>

It is absolutely true to say that the Minister has been going at tremendous speed in regard to this legislation, but I think that is natural on his part, in order to pay the additional benefits at as early a date as possible.  There are 23,000 widows' pensions books ready for issue, and we are very anxious that the increased benefits should commence, if possible, by 1st April.  I think the Minister believes he could get the Bill signed by the President in time.  We hope to conclude the Estimate in the Dáil this week.</P>

I think he understands that he is arguing a bad case and when you are arguing a bad case you argue badly unless you are peculiarly skilful. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary is not peculiarly skilful in arguing a bad case.  No case has been made to convince anybody who knows anything about law or Parliamentary procedure that anyone will lose one farthing by postponing this Bill until 16th April. Nobody is going to lose.  I should like to go further, and say that it is low politics to suggest otherwise, and it has no relation to truth to say that if the Bill is not passed someone will lose something.  As regards passing the Bill, if I were going to give it I would like to give it to-night, but if we are going to be hanged we might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.  There is no case whatever for taking this Bill before 16th April.  No case has been made for doing so and nobody will lose a farthing.  The Widows and Orphans Bill can be taken through all stages to-night.</P>

      <P>At the end of Section 11, page 6, line 41, to add the words &ldquo;but no further or otherwise&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that this section seems to me to be a very doubtful one.  It enables the Minister to make such adjustments in the funds, relating to national health insurance, which are under his control as may seem to him necessary.  The Minister is assuming wide powers in this.  He is doing so consequent on the transfer of certain engagements and assets of the fund to the society.  I want to limit his powers, and my amendment is directed towards that end.  The Minister is seeking the power I speak of, and the House is being asked to give him authority to make these adjustments in the fund of the society.  I have the gravest doubts as to how this section will operate.  I have seen a most extraordinary incident occur in relation to funds under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  There I saw an Order, one of these regulations made under statute, requiring the Minister concerned to make an examination annually of the accounts of the fund and to certify if there was in the fund more money than was required for the purposes of the provision.  Then, I noticed that the Order was revoked after a period of 21 years.  A member of the Dáil put a question to the Minister to ask him when, last, the Department made the return that they were required to make under this regulation. The reply was that they never made a return, not once in 21 years.  In other words during these 21 years the State took from the insurance society money which did not belong to them.  In certain circumstances, I want to protect the insured persons from any encroachment on their rights other than is authorised by the Oireachtas.  I want to make sure that the Minister's powers will be confined to the powers mentioned in the section.</P>

You can only make adjustments that are necessary, whatever the reason for the adjustments may be.

When the Comptroller and Auditor-General makes a report that report is examined by a Committee of the Dáil, a Committee that is entitled to invite officials of the Department to answer any question it thinks fit to ask regarding the administration of the Department and its accounts.  I was hopeful of the House inserting these words so that the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts would be drawn to the limits that the <Col N="1460" /> House intends to place on the Minister in regard to this administration.  I am not going to argue with Senator Ryan or Senator Hayes who, also, I believe, has some remote association with the Bar that my interpretation is a better one, but I do think that the advantage to be derived from inserting those words would be that we would be emphasising the interpretation that we intend to be placed on it.</P>

      <P>On the section, I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain to us what adjustments were made in the Order: whether these adjustments are still being made under the Order mentioned and if it is the purpose of this section to merely ratify existing steps that have been taken.  As I read the section it is purely a machinery section consequent upon the fact that the Emergency Powers Order ceases to be operative when the Bill takes its place.</P>

The section in question deals with persons who have been serving in the British forces and who returned to this country and who were formerly eligible as members of a separate fund which is now being merged in the National Health Insurance Society.  It is necessary to examine the records of these people and identify persons who have transferred their residence to Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Sub-section (1) of this section shall remain in force until the 31st day of March, 1949, and shall then expire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a new section and so Senator Sweetman need not ask will the same consideration of urgency apply in this section as in the previous Section 16. This is urgent.  This is the section which enables the Minister to interfere with the arrangements under which two-ninths of the cost of administration and two-ninths of the benefits provided by statute are refunded by the State to the society.  Now if this were a temporary arrangement as suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary I could understand and accept that.  All the arguments used by the Parliamentary Secretary in support of this Bill are centred round the one <Col N="1462" /> word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.  In order to meet the point that it is of temporary duration I want to limit the period during which this section will operate to the 31st March, 1949.  That means that we propose to agree that the Minister should have a free hand in operating this section for a period of two years and that if the authority given in the section is not renewed in a period of two years it will cease.  I urge the House having regard to the assurance that it is a temporary measure to insist on the insertion of this limitation&mdash;the limitation to two years of the discretion of the Minister.  This of course reads: &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Minister for Social Welfare&rdquo;.</P>

Under Section 3 of the 1911 Act as amended, the State is required to provide two-ninths of the society's expenditure on benefits including additional benefits and two-ninths of the expenditure on administration.  That section is operated up to the present. What is provided here is that in lieu of this sum of two-ninths another provision <Col N="1463" /> shall apply.  To me it is incomprehensible.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is a difficult one to understand.  I want to explain to the House as well as I can what it means.  Section 3 of the National Health Insurance Act as amended provides for the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas and the State of a grant of two-ninths of the expenditure incurred for benefits and for administration.  The remaining seven-ninths is payable out of contributions. Temporary supplements are now to be paid to recipients of sickness and disablement benefit, the full cost to be an Exchequer charge. The supplements, except in the case of persons on full benefit, will not be a fixed proportion of the amount of the benefit and accordingly if Section 3 of the 1911 Act continues to operate it will be necessary to break each payment into two elements, benefit and supplement. The work involved in such segregation is apparent when it is remembered that over 1,000,000 separate payments are made annually. To avoid the work and expense involved in such segregation which would be made solely for the purpose of fitting the scheme into the financial framework of Section 3 of the 1911 Act and to rationalise the accountancy procedure for the grant and supplements, it is proposed to pay in each financial year henceforth, instead of the two-ninths grant, the sum which in the opinion of <Col N="1464" /> the Minister and the Minister for Finance would be payable if the two-ninths grant system continued.  I hope I have made that clear.  The amount is capable of fairly accurate estimation and it is unlikely that the Exchequer or the fund will lose or gain.  It seems inadvisable therefore to accept Senator Duffy's amendment.  The whole point is that the amount should be paid and we hope that the temporary increased allowances will be replaced by a permanent comprehensive administration before 1949.  I think the section should stand in its present form and when new legislation comes before the Oireachtas, the House can consider this on its merits.  It would be most undesirable that the Bill should be passed with a limiting date attached to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I started out with one interpretation of this section.  I have failed to see whether I am right or wrong.  As I see the position, the National Health Insurance Society pays certain benefits.  The method which the Government are adopting to increase these benefits is to increase the State contribution to the society. If the increased benefits were incorporated in this section of the Bill, I could have understood the point of view taken but, as I understand, the National Health Insurance Society are being told by the Government, notwithstanding the former restriction by only two-ninths being granted by the State, they are to get for 1947-48 a grant from the State of £xy.  That grant is to be based on the estimate made that benefits can be increased in certain ways.  I think that this is the interpretation of the section. Senator Hawkins knows more about this Bill than I do.  I see him nodding and I can only take it that he agrees with my interpretation.  If that is correct, I am amazed at the performance we had earlier to-night, because there is absolutely no reason why the National Health Insurance Society should be told that to-night any more than on the 15th April.  If that is not the interpretation of the section, I should be glad if somebody would tell what the section does mean.</P>

      <P>In the ordinary way, the benefits already arranged will be carried on and the Government will provide two-ninths for them.  In their wisdom, they have decided to increase the ordinary benefits, in some cases by 50 per cent. and in some cases by 100 per cent.  Whatever the increase, the Minister for Finance, as I understand, is making himself liable for the entire amount.  The two-ninths will be continued for the ordinary benefits already provided while the entire additional <Col N="1466" /> benefits will be a charge on the national Exchequer.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The State will continue to contribute the two-ninths that they would have contributed to the ordinary benefits that were there already and, in addition, the State will contribute all the supplementary amount, whatever it may be, so that the fund will not be a penny worse off at the end of this coming financial year as a result of the supplementary allowances being paid.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the section, I have been trying to unravel this sub-section and I have found some difficulty in doing so.  I have before me the National Insurance Act, 1911, and from Section 3 of that Act, as amended by the Act of 1920, it would appear, to put it in plain language, that the expense of administration was to be deferred as to seven-ninths from contributions, and two-ninths from the Exchequer with money voted by Parliament.  I cannot understand why the section should contain the following words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...such sum as, in the opinion of the Minister and of the Minister for Finance, would be payable in respect of such year under the said Section 3, as so amended, if this sub-section had not been so enacted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why there should be scope for the opinion of the Minister for Finance as to the amount that would be payable under Section 3 of the Act of 1911 as would be payable under the Act of 1920.  There is no room for opinion.  It is a definite and precise figure.  The expense of administration of the benefits is what I might call a liquidated sum. The two-ninths is a liquidated sum and the other portion is a liquidated sum.  Therefore, it is not what the Minister thinks or what the Minister for Finance may think.  It is a question of accountancy, a question of calculation, in other words, a question of arithmetic.  That is why I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to enlighten me.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In lieu of the grant payable, under Section 3 of the Act of 1911, as amended by sub-section (4) of Section 1 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1920, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, there shall, in respect of the Financial year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1947, and of every succeeding financial year, be paid into the National Health Insurance Fund, out of <Col N="1469" /> moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such sum as, in the opinion of the Minister and of the Minister for Finance, would be payable in respect of such year under the said Section 3, as so amended, if this sub-section had not been enacted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that the grant is equal in amount to two-ninths of the expense of administration of the entire benefits for men and women.  I cannot see where the scope for the operation of the opinion of the Minister or the Minister for Finance comes in.  Section 3 of the Act of 1911, as amended by the Act of 1920, merely provides that two-ninths of the actual expense of administration of the benefits should be paid out of moneys voted by Parliament. If this section had not been enacted at all I take it that Section 3 of the Act of 1911, as amended by sub-section 4 (1) of the National Insurance Act of 1920, will continue in operation and two-ninths would continue to be payable.  As far as I know there was never any scope either in Section 3 of the Act of 1911, or sub-section 4 (1) of the Act of 1920 for the opinion of the Minister for Finance.  The only variation that this section makes in procedure is that whatever sum is payable in respect of any financial year might be payable as the Minister for Finance shall determine.  That is a machinery section.  It does not affect the total amount paid in respect of any financial year.  That is why I was trying to make sense out of this section.  I may not have particular knowledge of the procedure but I am relying upon the section in the Act.  I can only see the exact sum, two-ninths of the expense of administration, to be voted by Parliament.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain why the opinion of any Minister comes into it, seeing that it is a question of accountancy and reimbursing the actual amount.</P>

      <P>I might explain again that the Minister has to forecast what would be required in the coming year for national health insurance benefits and increased allowances, the sickness likely to take place and the number of contributors.  He forecasts what he thinks would be required for the forthcoming year, first in respect of contributions, before the new allowances are paid.  These are contributed in the form of two-ninths by the State and seven-ninths by the society.  He also forecasts what will be required to pay supplementary allowances.</P>

      <P>Provided that the date so fixed shall not be later than the commencement of the contribution year in 1948.</P>
      <P>This section is one in relation to which urgency might be urged.  It is one by which the insurance limit is raised from £250 to £500.  I am endeavouring to ensure that the Order which the Minister will make will be brought into effect not later than the commencement of the contribution year 1948, that is, in January of next year.  I am not rushing the Parliamentary Secretary in this matter.  If the Bill is urgent, if it is going to confer benefits next Thursday, as we have been told by a number of people, it is not unreasonable to insert a provision that it will certainly operate not later than the first contribution week in 1948.  I urge the House to insert that provision.  As it stands, all we are told is that the section shall come into operation on such a day as the Minister shall by Order fix for that purpose.</P>

      <P>The Bill is to come into operation on a day which the Minister fixes by Order for that purpose.  We cannot say what day he is going to fix. Some opportunity should be given, between the passing of this Bill and the coming into operation of this particular raising of the level to £500, for people who are going to be swept into this insurance compulsorily to consider it. Some 40,000 or 50,000 people will be brought into this insurance scheme, willy-nilly, as a stop-gap arrangement and not as part of a general arrangement, which has been explained and which people understand and which may, in fact, put the level of insurable income up beyond £500.  It would be advisable that there should be delay before that compulsion takes place, and a fixed period of delay, rather than leaving it to the opinion of the Minister. Senator Duffy was right in saying that the Bill could hardly be delayed beyond the 1st of July, 1947. If it could not, perhaps he would put this in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment, which has been circulated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.&mdash;This Act shall remain in force until the 31st July, 1947, and shall then expire.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to provide that the House will have an opportunity of reconsidering this Bill in adequate time.  Before I say anything about that, I want to make one comment.  It has been given to me to be in this House for about only three years.  Never before have I been so ashamed of anything that has happened here, or anything I have seen happen, sitting as a stranger in any gallery of the Oireachtas, than I have been as a result of the dishonest tactics &mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; avowedly in respect of those tactics&mdash; that were used in regard to this Bill this evening.  We had an allegation that it was necessary and that its urgency was overwhelming, that there were sections which could not wait a month.  We went through the Bill section by section in Committee and we were told, in respect of each of the first 16 sections, that each and every one of them was in operation already under an Emergency Powers Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary did not tell us that when he was making his case for the urgency of the Bill.  We were told that it was absolutely vital, that it had to be got through and, on that assurance alone, <Col N="1474" /> certain members of this House were influenced to give honest expression to the urgent need that they felt in regard to this Bill.  It is an unfortunate thing that tactics of that sort should be used to decry and to destroy Parliament. If those tactics are used to rush Bills through without proper consideration, if no argument is put up from the Minister's chair and if the House is unable to know whether that argument is not, in another Bill, to prove to be false, without foundation, without any justification in truth or in anything else, it means we will have to sift every argument which is put forward every time the argument comes that a Bill is urgent and necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins earlier to-night very fairly gave expression to the manner in which we have made every effort from this side of the House to assist and help the Government in getting through their business.  We feel we have a duty imposed on us to consider legislation in a proper and clear way. Without in any way trying to pat our own backs, the fact that very frequently amendments to Bills proposed from this side of the House are accepted by Ministers&mdash;as they were accepted earlier this afternoon&mdash;shows that the consideration which is given to those Bills is not valueless and has been worth while.  In respect of this Bill, we were quite deliberately prevented from giving it any proper or adequate thought, care or consideration, and from ascertaining the views of the people outside.  We were asked to be merely a rubber stamp and to give effect to the wishes and desires of the Executive.  In the whole of the discussion, there was hung over our heads the threat that, if we did not pass this Bill to-night, the increased benefits could not be paid, yet it became perfectly clear in the discussion on Section 17 that that was untrue &mdash;untrue in substance, untrue in detail, untrue in fact&mdash;and that all that was necessary was that there should be a Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>All that was necessary was to make available in the Central Fund Bill, passed by the House last week, a sum of £80,000 to carry on this service until when?  The 16th April which was what <Col N="1475" /> we requested.  Apart from that, no new service is provided so that an original Estimate was not needed.  All that was necessary was the extension of an additional service, and there is the machinery of Supplementary Estimates in the Dáil to meet that situation. There was no justification either for Section 17.</P>
    <P>The only apparent urgency that arises is in respect of Section 19, on which we had certain arguments from both sides of the House.  We were not told early in the debate about the urgency in relation to this section, but at any rate it is the only section which now appears to be urgent, and about which two views are held in the city amongst employers and workers.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas adverted to the fact that certain employees, known to him, have an objection to being taken into the scheme.  In my own small tin-pot way I have come across similar objections. Personally, I am inclined to think they are wrong.  The point, however, is that when there is such a feeling abroad it should be considered, and a true and proper value put upon it. For that reason I am moving this amendment.</P>
    <P>The exact position in relation to this Bill was detailed to me on the Committee Stage by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He told me section after section that this was merely a reenactment of existing statutory rules and orders.  He can, under my amendment, have his Bill for three months or four months, and if he is not then in a position to bring in the comprehensive codified measure of which he spoke at the end of that period mentioned he can, at least, give the Oireachtas the opportunity of considering whether this Bill had got the care, consideration and thought that it is desirable a measure of this kind should get in this House.  It would have got that if it were not for the methods that were adopted, methods which, as I have said already, are based on something that is untrue.  Untrue is the only word that can be used in respect of these methods.  I am sorry that during my short period as a member of the <Col N="1476" /> House, I should have seen such methods employed here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Sweetman, I must confess that our experience this evening has been a rather rare one in this House.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a rare visitor&mdash;a rare bird who is, perhaps, the herald of spring. I hope that the spring will be sweeter and brighter than the atmosphere which the Parliamentary Secretary has created here.  I think it will be conceded that although he used the word &ldquo;ill-will&rdquo; early this evening there was no such atmosphere here at all in relation to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Despite what Senator Hawkins and other members of the House who agree with him may think, we have here a certain number of Senators with some appreciation of their functions and of their responsibilities towards Parliamentary institutions.  If one were to accept the views expressed earlier by Senator Hawkins it would appear that people like Senator Hayes, Senator Sweetman, Senator Douglas and one or two other Senators have no function here whatever, and that the sooner we get to the other side of the House and sit behind Senator Hawkins the better.</P>

      <P>The Senator supported the view of the Parliamentary Secretary that we could get through all stages of this Bill this afternoon.  Our view was that the Bill required examination. I do not know what examination it got in the other House.  Some Senators may have time to read the Dáil Debates.  Frankly, I must confess that I am not able to keep <i>au fait</i>, through reading the debates, with all that goes on in the other House.  The fact is that no matter what type of examination the Bill was subjected to in the other House does not divest us of our responsibilities.  We listened to the Parliamentary Secretary this afternoon making a case for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all respect to him, may I say that it seemed to me he was very poorly prepared, or perhaps I should <Col N="1477" /> say poorly briefed?  He was certainly not able to enlighten the House on the matters on which we needed enlightenment&mdash;the opportunity to study the Bill in relation to the previous Acts. The House was pressed into giving a decision.  I hope that some of the members who supported the original decision are quite happy in their consciences about what they did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be prepared to take a ruling on order from Senator Foran when he is the Leas-Chathaoirleach, but he is not that yet.  Senator Sweetman, in his amendment, proposes that this Act shall remain in force until the 31st July, 1947, and shall then expire. We here are satisfied from what we have elicited, or from what we have failed to elicit, that this Bill, with all its implications, is not understood in the country.  I think the implications of Section 19 were a revelation to some members.  The position is that we are making 40,000 additional people become insured members.  We are doing that without consulting them and without knowing whether they desire it or not.  This sort of thing is really making a farce of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time there is a great deal of talk about democracy.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his speeches up and down the country, especially when he goes down to address his own constituents, or the constituents of other members of his Party, seems to have some appreciation of the meaning of that word.  I would imagine that people who talk about democracy would be anxious to give some study to the obligations which this section proposes to impose upon certain classes of people.  That is not done.  We are not quarrelling with what is in the Bill, but we are quarrelling with the case which <Col N="1478" /> was made by the Parliamentary Secretary for the Bill.  His case was that he had to get every section of it this evening, and yet we find that every section of it, with the exception of the last three, is the law at present.  We suggest that these last three sections could be implemented in another way.  Why should the Parliamentary Secretary come in and make such a case?  I have no doubt that there are a great many people who are going to be dissatisfied with this Bill.  They will be dissatisfied because the Oireachtas is imposing obligations on them without consulting them.  I strongly support Senator Sweetman's amendment.  The Parliamentary Secretary has created an atmosphere in relation to this Bill that is not the sort of atmosphere which this House is accustomed to.</P>

      <P>I can scarcely believe that Senator Sweetman has intended that this amendment should be taken seriously because it is really what I might describe as a wrecking amendment and would seem out of place altogether in relation to the other sections in the Bill.  In Section 19 it is provided that persons having incomes of £500 should be brought into National Health Insurance and sub-section (2) of Section 19 provides that the section shall come into operation on such day as the Minister shall, by Order, fix for this purpose. If this Bill is passed into law within the next week or ten days, the Minister may, within the next fortnight, make an Order bringing in all those people.  If Senator Sweetman's amendment is made part of the Bill it will mean that all those people will walk out again next July after all the expense and trouble incurred in bringing them in.  It is an amendment which, to my mind, cannot be taken seriously.  I have never seen an amendment like it.</P>

I am not <Col N="1479" /> at white heat in connection with this Bill.  It is true that certain sections of the Bill are contained in Emergency Powers Orders.  Even if they are and even if this Bill is being rushed, as it has been rushed to-night, there is no justification for this amendment.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Baxter mentioned that Section 19 was a very serious section. That is so.  The position could have been dealt with by voting against that section or by protesting against it. But so far as I am aware, the section went through without a dissenting voice.  I shall certainly vote against this amendment because I am not going to stultify myself, having passed the foregoing 19 sections, by voting for an amendment which would negative all the work done in connection with the Bill.  That would make us a laughing stock even though we may not have acted perfectly this evening in connection with the procedure of this Bill. This amendment would make us ludicrous if it were accepted, and I, certainly, will vote against it.</P>

I still think it is one of Senator Sweetman's jokes although he has spoken very seriously on the matter.

The Estimate, if the amendment is accepted, will refer to a Bill which is to remain in force only until July 31st next.  The position is idiotic and Senator Sweetman knows that perfectly <Col N="1480" /> well.  If we pass the Bill in this manner we will be, in fact, repealing it in three months' time.  Everyone who votes for such an amendment will stultify himself and make himself the laughing stock of the House.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been abused.  I think it is hard on him. The Minister fell ill and he has had to come in here and take up the cudgels and handle this Bill when he has not had the opportunity of giving careful consideration to it.  It is hard lines on him having to do that.  Senator Sweetman made very scathing remarks about the fact that we were re-enacting Emergency Powers Orders.  I thought we were all hoping that this would be done.  On previous occasions we referred here to the fact that it was difficult to get these Orders or to understand them and we spoke about the great advantage it would be if they were incorporated in Acts of Parliament.</P>

It is a definite advantage to have these Orders in an Act.  Nobody knows that better than solicitors and barristers who have to ascertain the law contained in Emergency Powers Orders.  It will be much easier to understand the law when it is in this form.  Although Senator Sweetman criticised the Bill very severely he is, I am sure, very glad that these Emergency Powers Orders will go by the board and that they will now be in the form of an Act so that they can be seen and read by those who have to advise upon them.</P>

      <P>I want to ask Senator Sweetman to stop being Punch for the Parliamentary Secretary's Judy.  We have had a ridiculous performance here <Col N="1481" /> this night and I think Senator Sweetman's amendment excels in this connection. How he can honestly ask a House of the importance of this House to accept an amendment such as this is beyond me.  Senator Baxter has been handing out credit to certain people in the House.  I do not happen to be one of them and I have no desire to get encomiums from Senator Baxter, but I think we would be making ourselves extremely ridiculous if we seriously considered this amendment any further. I could say a lot on it, but I do not propose to do so.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that in my opinion this debate has been one of the most unfortunate that has ever taken place in this House.  Heretofore, there had been many battles fought in this House on legislation and amendments to legislation but certain standards have been established on both sides of the House and we have always endeavoured to meet Ministers as far as possible and accept their assurances. It has been, therefore, a great disservice to this House that the Parliamentary Secretary should come here and deliberately mislead us.</P>
      <P>I think, therefore, that despite the remarks and the apology of Senator Ryan on the amendment this amendment is perfectly justified because it is inserted for the purpose of ensuring that this Bill which we have been deliberately misled into passing as an urgent measure, shall receive in three months' time further and more proper consideration. I therefore see nothing ridiculous about the amendment, and I am prepared to support it.</P>

      <P>Senator Sweetman, Senator Baxter and the other speakers have referred on many occasions to-night to the manner in which this Bill was received and treated in the House and to the manner in which business was conducted generally this evening. Let us examine this.  We find that the Bill was circulated and with it was circulated an explanatory leaflet or memorandum.  The Senators and Deputies had copies of that, and had ample time to consider the various sections of the Bill.  What was the procedure?  The Bill was introduced <Col N="1482" /> by the Parliamentary Secretary, acting for the Minister for Public Health and Social Welfare, who explained to the House that the passing of the Bill was urgent.  A certain number of the members of this House accepted that assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;that it was important this Bill should be passed through all its stages to-night.</P>
      <P>Is it wrong procedure for Parliament or a House of Parliament to agree to this where the majority of the members accept the statement of the Minister responsible for the passing of the Bill through Parliament and for the enactment of the Act later on?  If the Opposition have an obligation, they have an obligation to act, not so much as opposing as to help, as they have helped, I must say, on every occasion here with a few exceptions.  It is an extraordinary thing that to-night's discussion takes my mind back to one we had on a similar type of Bill and that was on the only other occasion on which there did seem to be disagreement in this House.  On both occasions it related to social services.  I remember some time before Christmas there was a Bill before the House to establish this particular Ministry.  I hope I am not going to connect to-night's procedure with that.  Senator Sweetman cannot be serious in asking the House to accept this amendment.  He cannot be serious in asking the House, which has passed the Bill in all its stages&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, having passed all sections, to limit the scope of this Bill to the 31st July.  Senator Baxter referred to the 15,000 new workers who would be brought in under the new Bill.  Surely if Senator Baxter is going to vote that this Bill remain in force until the 31st July, he must understand the organisation that it is going to take to get these 15,000 people enrolled a contributors in the national health insurance.  I think the object of this amendment, if the House is foolish enough to accept it, is to nullify the whole purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid, perhaps because of the hour and the circumstances in which this debate arose, that some people have not listened to what I said.  I said the whole purpose of this amendment was to enable the Government to bring in a Bill that would have an opportunity of having more considered consideration than this Bill got.  I am only some three years in this House, but even in those three years I have seen frequent occasions on which there have been amendments put down to various Bills shortening their lives solely for the purpose of getting the proper consideration of the Bill within a certain fixed and limited time.  The whole argument of the Parliamentary Secretary was that this was only a very temporary and transitional matter, a stop-gap provision.</P>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary says that four months is not sufficiently long to remedy the stop-gap, if four months are not sufficiently long to have a considered Bill, then I am perfectly satisfied to have any other reasonable time. But I do want this.  I urge it very strongly&mdash;that in some definite, limited time there should be before this House and before the Houses of the Oireachtas a Bill which would get proper consideration which this Bill did not get this evening, and could not have got in the circumstances.  If the Parliamentary Secretary says four months is not long enough I am quite happy with six or eight, or even 12, but I want a time limit in which the Oireachtas will put on its records something that has been properly considered and something which it can afterwards stand up and defend, and not a Bill, 18 sections of which are merely machinery sections which could have been produced at any time and which would have been far better if produced in an atmosphere other than the atmosphere created this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to argue this question any further, and I consider that Senator Sweetman's amendment merely defeats the whole purpose of the Bill.  When other plans are made later on in the way of comprehensive scheme of social insurance <Col N="1484" /> it is quite certain that raising the insurability limit will have been found to be justified.  The memorandum was sent out some time ago to members of the Seanad.  The Dáil has given full consideration to the matter.  The Minister for Social Welfare has not, I understand, received any representations in regard to it.  It has not been indicated that Section 19&mdash;the main section of the Bill&mdash;is in any way undesirable in its social or economic aspects.  Senator Sweetman, when he reads the Official Report of this debate, will find that I clearly indicated that the important sections were those dealing with the insurability limit and the method of financing supplementary allowances.  I clearly mentioned early this evening that the remaining sections related to permanent enactment of Emergency Powers Orders, and there was no need for Senator Sweetman to reiterate that they were not of an urgent character. They were added to this Bill, so that we might incorporate them in legislation in relation to national health insurance&mdash;legislation which was overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there had been any practical objection to the raising of the insurability limit we should have heard of it by now.  The professional associations which are very active in matters of this kind would have protested and the trade unions, if they felt their members were adversely affected, would have sent hurried letters to the Minister, since the Bill was circulated, which, I think, was the week before March 19th.  Apart from the argument as to what is or is not urgent legislation, the whole tone of this debate has become exaggerated.  Having listened to this debate I think we are quite justified in enacting Section 19 of the Bill at short notice because no one has given any sort of concrete objection to it.  They have said there may be objections. Certain Senators have suggested there are pros and cons as regards the desirability of Section 19 but there has been no general objection and no suggestion that it would be wrong to extend the general scope of insurance in this country.  There is nothing wrong in suggesting that having regard to <Col N="1485" /> the needs of our economic life we should extend compulsory insurance and extend State services for the protection of certain classes of workers who up to now have not been included and maintain others where insurance status is jeopardised.</P>
    <P>I feel, therefore, that there has been a great deal of exaggeration in the comment on the urgency of this Bill. It would be quite impossible for us to accept Senator Sweetman's amendment which, in effect, would wreck the Bill. Naturally, there are people who object to having to pay contributions.  In any social insurance scheme of which contributions by employers and employees form part, there are bound to be objections.  There are people who do not see the necessity for insuring themselves.  Some of those who need protection most, through social insurance, fail to see the necessity for it and do not attempt to make a modest provision for themselves such as they might be able to afford from their own earnings.  Therefore, I think that the Bill should go through in its present form.  There has been a great deal of exaggeration in regard to the possible fundamental objection to Section 19.</P>

      <P>We have succeeded in a rather peculiar way in discussing this Bill without very much reference to its merits.  That is one of the results that always flow from failure to give proper time for consideration of measures. One of the worst possible results of trying to rush a Bill is that it hardly ever gets fair consideration in these circumstances.  The prestige of Parliamentary institutions depends on the people in those institutions and we stultify ourselves when we do not get proper time to do our work properly. Senator Hawkins is absolutely right when he says that the majority can decide when they are going to take a Bill.  It is because the majority can do so many things that the majority ought to hesitate before it does them. A Parliamentary majority can reduce Parliamentary government to a farce. Nothing can be more farcical than rushing through Bills, discussing amendments not properly thought out, or listening to explanations which are not explanations at all.  A case was made for urgency to-night.  I say, quite honestly and sincerely and with a fair knowledge of Estimates and financial procedure, that I still do not understand what the urgency was. However, that is past now and the less said about it the better.  We did succeed in discussing the Bill without any regard to its merits.

      <P>This Bill is in nearly all respects the counterpart in relation to widows' and orphans' pensions, of the National Health Insurance Bill and follows the same pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II re-enacts, with certain minor modifications, the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 382) Order, 1946, made on 14th June last.  The Part consists of only four sections.  The first of these sections, Section 4, makes in relation to excepted persons provision similar to that made in Section 3 of the National Health Insurance Bill in relation to persons insured under the National Health Insurance Acts. Broadly speaking, excepted persons are non-manual employees of the State, local authorities and certain statutory companies earning less than £250 a year, and the section provides that in their case, where sums purporting to be contributions under the Pensions Acts have been paid in good faith after the person has ceased to be insurable under the Acts, such sums will be <Col N="1488" /> accepted as contributions and confer on the person concerned the same rights in regard to insurance as if they were, in fact, contributions.  The next section extends the &ldquo;free&rdquo; insurance period in the case of excepted persons from 12 to 18 months, as in the case of persons insured under the National Health Insurance Acts.  Section 6 deals with the insurance of soldiers.  Section 7 relates to persons who left or may leave this country on or after the 3rd September, 1939, and who die or return before a date to be fixed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and provides that, if certain conditions are satisfied in relation to contributions under the Pensions Acts before such persons left the State, the period of their absence will be disregarded for the purpose of determining their qualifications for pension purposes.  In that way, a man who went, say, to Great Britain during the emergency to work there, and who died before he acquired rights under the British Widows' Pensions Acts, will have his Irish pensions insurance safeguarded. The number of cases involved is not, and is not likely to be, large, but the section removes grave hardship in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains only one section, Section 8, which extends the power of the Minister for Finance in the matter of investment of funds held by him for the pensions investment account to include all securities for which the trustees are for the time being authorised by law to invest trust funds.</P>

      <P>In lines 30 onwards there is a definition of &ldquo;Reserve Force&rdquo;.  In the Bill we have just passed, there is an entirely different definition.  I cannot understand the necessity for a different definition in each Bill.

      <P>Certain employees of Government Departments, local authorities and statutory companies (e.g., railway and insurance companies) receiving not more than £250 per annum are excepted from the provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts but are insurable under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts.  Contributions in respect of these employees cease to be payable when the rate of remuneration exceeds £250 per annum. For a period (called the free insurance period) of 18 months after the date on which contributions cease to be payable, these employees remain insured under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts and within that period are entitled, subject to certain conditions, to apply to become voluntary contributors under the National Health Insurance and Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts.  If they die within the &ldquo;free&rdquo; period, they are insured at death and title to pension is not lost.</P>
