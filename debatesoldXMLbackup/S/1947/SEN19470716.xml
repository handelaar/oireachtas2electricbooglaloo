      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That sub-section (2) be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation is aimed at deleting sub-section (2) of Section 3. Its effect would be to leave the allowances paid to Senators at their present figure.  I do not want to repeat what <Col N="378" /> I said on the Second Stage, but whatever may be said with regard to members of the Dáil and their allowances it seems to me, with all my own experience and all our experience generally, over a number of years past, that there can hardly be any doubt that there is no case for an increase in Senators' allowances.  There is a question of principle with regard to the working of a democracy involved, namely, whether people should have made up to them their out-of-pocket expenses for acting as members of Parliament or whether they should receive remuneration for their services.  If they receive remuneration for their services then, clearly, their remuneration should be subject to income-tax with, perhaps, some additions to the instructions to the Revenue Commissioners in a Finance Bill to allow the kind of expenses which a Deputy or a Senator properly may incur.  However, this particular recommendation deals specifically with the Seanad.  I do not want to deal with the Dáil on the recommendation.</P>
    <P>Whatever case there may be for having a member of the Dáil paid for his services and for working full-time it seems to me that the Second House should very emphatically consist of people who are working in Parliament but who expect to get nothing out of Parliament except their out-of-pocket expenses.  I recognise that there is a very substantial difference between the position of the Dublin resident and the position of the country resident and, very particularly, the position of the person who lives in a remote part of the country.  Undoubtedly that person incurs greater expenses than the Dublin resident.  I think he should be paid as at present.  He should be provided with transport&mdash;I agree with Section 2 which has improved the position with regard to transport.  He should also get expenses for his maintenance while he is in Dublin, and an arrangement should be made by which he certainly would not be out of pocket. However, to adopt a rule-of-thumb system to pay every Senator precisely the same amount and to say that because he was paid precisely the same in 1937 it should now be increased by 30 per cent. seems to be adopting <Col N="379" /> an untenable and irrational method. It would be much better if the whole problem were examined.  I do not say that it is easy to find a solution because I am aware that the problem exists in more places than here.  I think, however, with regard to the Second House, that it should consist of people who have a contribution to make.  It should not provide a living for any person.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the categories of Senators which were made out by a speaker on the last occasion, on the Second Stage.  He said there were people who could afford to give their services free, those who could afford to take the out-of-pocket expenses only, and, thirdly, people who required more than that.  If they require more than that, I do not think they should be in a Second House, which is a revising Chamber.  A revising Chamber should consist of people who, in their own trade, profession or occupation, have succeeded in making good&mdash;no matter in what particular line, but in some line&mdash;and they should only receive for their services their out-of-pocket expenses.  A scheme of that kind should be devised.  The present idea of adding to the allowance already given is a bad one.  I want to draw attention to the general position, as that general position and, particularly, the position of the country resident as compared with the Dublin resident, should be examined; and for that reason I move this recommendation.</P>
    <P>It should not be beyond the wit of this House to devise a scheme whereby the persistent non-worker in the Seanad could be dealt with.  On the last occasion, the Minister in a rather jocular mood drew a picture of himself as Minister for Finance checking up on Senators' attendances.  This House has the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, drawn from different groups, and in the last ten years it never disagreed and never had a division. The committee always succeeded in coming to its conclusions unanimously, after the most lively or the mildest form of discussion.  That committee could devise a scheme whereby the Senator who did no work would get no expenses.  My scheme is that the <Col N="380" /> expenses should be paid only to persons who certify that they have been incurred&mdash;and that would be an improvement. This recommendation will have the effect of leaving the allowance as it is at present and will enable us later on to discuss what precise type of allowance Senators should get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one thing on which every Senator should have his mind made up, it is on this proposition. I do not know about the people who are absent: it would be very interesting to know what is in their minds.  We must concern ourselves with the portion of it which applies to ourselves.  My approach may differ from that of my colleagues or other Senators in certain respects.  This is not a new problem, but one which I have heard under discussion for quite a long time.  I feel that the institutions of this State are not yet so firmly established that any of us could take any decision which might imperil their stability in the future.  There are threats to our existing institutions in various ways.  Members of the Oireachtas themselves may have made their contribution to slighting those institutions, making them less worthy, less responsible and less respected than they ought to be if they are to stand the test of time and be improved on by us or by our successors.  It must be obvious to all concerned about the nation's well-being that there are attacks from different angles upon our institutions.  I do not propose to go into an examination of the motives for those attacks, but I am convinced that all who have the welfare of the nation at heart must meet those attacks, eradicate the causes of them as far as possible and strengthen our institutions as they are to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment of members of the Oireachtas has been subject to a good deal of criticism over a very long time, and perhaps that is not unnatural.  We have collected into the Oireachtas all types of people, both in mind and outlook and from every conceivable calling. There may be justification for criticism about the competence and fitness of many of us to speak on behalf of the nation and justification for criticism of <Col N="381" /> the manner in which we do our work.  We are as God made us&mdash;some are elected and some nominated.  If we are not more worthy, it is due in no small measure to the unworthiness of the people who elect us, but whatever the causes are, it is important for us to realise the amount of criticism that is going around.  Senator Hayes proposes to eliminate from this Bill the increase in the allowance to Senators.  Whatever the ideas of the men who originally framed the proposition to pay the members of the Dáil and Seanad, naturally they had not much experience.  I have not troubled to look up the collection which was got together in those days&mdash;and cannot call the names to mind now, though I know them&mdash;to study the proposal for payments to members of the Oireachtas, but the fact remains that a flat rate of compensation or expenses was decided upon.  In those days there was no measuring stick by which alternative methods could be used.  Quite clearly, we have the experience now.  There can be no question in equity that the plan decided on then does not fit into the scheme of life to-day and that it demands immediate examination and considerable alteration.  When I was in the other House, in 1925 or 1926, I remember stating frankly that I saw no justification whatever that those members of the Dáil who could return to their own homes after each sitting should receive the same allowance as those who came 50 to 200 miles to attend meetings of the Dáil.  But that plan and that principle has continued and will continue under this legislation. I do not know what is the Minister's defence of it and I should like to hear it.</P>
    <P>If the proposal in the Bill is to compensate members of the Oireachtas, especially members of the Seanad, for the expenditure involved by their membership of this House, if that remuneration is to be equitable, it must bear some relation to the actual cost to members in attending to their duties as Senators.  I do not know the position as regards other Senators but as far as I am personally concerned, I cannot attend meetings at less than 30/- a day out-of-pocket expenses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> Consider the attendance in this House to-day.  When a division is challenged we will probably discover that half the members are here and the other half are absent.  That position must be faced up to.  Public respect cannot be maintained for an institution in which the members take so little interest that they cannot find time to attend.  I am sure a number of Senators have very good reasons for their absence but people will become impatient with that scheme of things when they discover that those who stay away, whether they reside in the city or in the country, receive the same allowance at the end of the month as those who attend every meeting.  My view is that that must be examined. Senator Hayes has rightly put it that the position of the Senator in Dublin is very different from the position of the country Senator.  Unless we are prepared to do something about the position, the status of the Seanad will suffer.</P>
    <P>There is an even wider issue in regard to this whole matter.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to study with his colleagues the general tendency with regard to the use that is made of public representatives in this State to-day.  It simply cannot continue.  There are probably few members of this House, in a way, whose services are called upon to a less extent than mine but I have no hesitation in saying that the point of view of the public now is that no Act of the Oireachtas can be administered otherwise than through the intercession of the elected representatives. The homes of members of the Dáil and Seanad are continually visited by people asking them to make pleas on their behalf for every conceivable thing.  The idea permeates the life of this State to-day that no matter what the law is, nothing can be done, no right can be won or enjoyed by the citizen other than through the intercession of a member of the Oireachtas. Let any member challenge the truth of that statement.  It is my personal experience, and I know the way in which members of the other House, on all sides, are plagued.  The thing is carried further.  The impression is created that the only way to get anything <Col N="383" /> is to belong to the Government Party.  Let that be challenged.  I do not say it is true but it is the belief and it is a belief that there is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Senator is going rather wide of the subject of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to relate the responsibilities of members of the House to the way in which they are remunerated. I want an examination of this because it is all bound up with the question of the allowances.  If the Minister accepts that that is an obligation and that it ought to be an obligation of members of the Oireachtas in future to do all this sort of work&mdash;I do not know how to describe it but the members know very well what I mean &mdash;you have almost to be a penny boy for everyone in your constituency&mdash;the Minister probably is justified in his proposition but if we are going to make another approach as to the duties of members, both now and in the future, we ought to examine the drift of Government policy, Government methods and legislation and administration generally.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely convinced that that drift is terribly unhealthy, that you are going to bring about a decadence from the point of view of the worthiness of public representation and from the point of view of the type of person you will have to go into the legislative Assembly.  The legislative Assembly cannot be higher or nobler or better educated or more powerful in intellect than the people who are elected to it and if they are to be elected on the basis of their service to their constituents from the point of view of the part they play as a cog in the administrative machine, as legislators they will be quite hopeless.  We are tending to develop a most unhealthy condition of things.  I feel strongly about this. I have argued with groups of our own people that this drift is something that ought to be grappled with now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot refrain from putting this aspect of the case to the House.  I am supporting the amendment because I feel the approach to the problem of the <Col N="384" /> allowances made to legislators is entirely false.  It is not based on a proper concept of the functions of legislators. The whole situation requires examination.  I have studied the membership of this House.  I do not know how many others have troubled to do so.  There is this unhealthy drift that, out of the total membership, very close to half reside in the City of Dublin where there is a population of 500,000 and the other half come from the rest of the country with its almost 2,500,000 population.  The more we continue on that basis the sooner we will come to the situation that no man worth his salt will be found in the country to interest himself in public affairs.  The country will be completely governed by the mind made in the City of Dublin. No one has greater respect than I for the competence and ability of the members of this House who come from the City of Dublin but I am indicating the drift, the sort of fatalism as far as the country is concerned and the attitude of the people of the country to representation in the Oireachtas.  On Second Reading Senator Summerfield was dubbed Conservative by Senator Sam Kyle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not had time in this country.  If some of our people get a little time we will be able to build up an aristocracy of wealth&mdash;whether it would be an aristocracy of intellect is another matter.  At present the great bulk of our people are so busy trying to live that very few have time to give to public service.  I do not know what the experience of others is but I can say from my own observation that there are fewer and fewer people every day who are prepared to give one half-hour for nothing in the public service.  Everybody to-day wants to be paid for whatever service he gives.  That is the general attitude now, locally.  There are not many people who can afford to take hours or days away from their profession or labours and as that will be the situation <Col N="385" /> for a very long time, allowances must be made for the time which representatives are prepared to take from their own professions.</P>
      <P>Now, I pointed out earlier that almost half the representation in this House is from the City of Dublin.  I do not know what the members of the Government Party are finding, but I have no hesitation in saying that, as far as other Parties are concerned, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get the right sort of person to come into the public life of the country and give his services in the spirit in which a great many of us have been giving it since we entered public life 20 or 30 years ago.  When that is the position I have great fears that we are going to drift along until, eventually, 90 per cent. of the Oireachtas will be composed of people residing within what is now styled greater Dublin, where, at the moment, you have a population of roughly 500,000 people.  What is going to happen to the rest of the country when you arrive at that stage?  There may be people who feel that that is quite a healthy state of affairs, but those who are concerned with the great body of this nation cannot feel other than terribly unhappy about that drift. I believe myself that there are very much bigger issues involved in this section of the Bill, and in the amendment moved by Senator Hayes than would appear from a superficial examination. As far as I am concerned personally, I can only express a degree of unhappiness about the matter which urges me to say what I have been trying to say.  I feel that the whole situation requires an examination of a kind which has not been given to it in the past.  I would like, when it is examined again, that the bulk of the people who are going to examine it will somehow or other be drawn from a type of mind that is available in the country&mdash;by people whose services have not been called upon in the past.  I hope that the House will accept our point of view on this amendment, so as to force the Government to have an examination of the situation.  The problem is one that requires urgent examination, but it has not yet got that examination from any body in power.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The main difference between the discussion to-day and the discussion last week seems to me to be this, that if the ground itself has not been shifted then the emphasis has been shifted.  On the last occasion it seemed to me that the general tenor of the debate was that members of the Seanad were paid too much, while to-day it seems that the main objection is that Senators who do not attend to their duties as regularly as we think they ought should not get as much as those other Senators who believe that they themselves do attend to their duties as fully as the nation expects them.  It has been indicated that something in the nature of differential payment would meet the case.  It has been indicated that the main purpose of putting down this recommendation is to urge on the Government the necessity for an examination of the system under which allowances are paid to members of the Oireachtas.  I am all in favour of the general principle of differential payments. <Col N="387" /> I would like to think that the trade unions and others with regard to employment generally would subscribe to the same view.  But while it might be easy to arrive at a basis for differential payment in ordinary workaday affairs, it is quite obvious to anybody who has given any thought to it that the devising of such a system in connection with the work of members of the Oireachtas is one that is likely to surpass the wit of man.</P>
    <P>We ought first to consider what is the aim of the section in question in the Bill.  It seeks to make an adjustment in the allowances made to members of the Seanad.  I do not take it as seeking to increase the allowances to members of the Seanad; its aim is rather to adjust the allowances to something like what they were when these allowances were fixed.  It does not even go as far as that.</P>
    <P>As I said before, some members of the Seanad would seem to indicate that the allowances are too generous.  If they are too generous to-day they were still more generous in the years that have passed since 1938.  Some people who have been speaking here would seem to indicate that their consciences are pricking them in that regard.  It follows from that, that if these people feel in the way that their words would lead one to believe, then they are, in all conscience, bound to make very considerable restitution to the Minister for Finance, because they must have got very much more over the years that have since elapsed than they believed they were deserving of.  I do not believe that they intend to make that restitution.  It was never their intention, and I believe, in consequence, that they are not sincere in what they have been saying with regard to the content of this particular section which they are seeking to amend.</P>

      <P>I now come to the main point to which I intend to refer, and it arises out of an oblique reference on the part of Senator Hayes to a speaker who, on the last occasion, mentioned the possibility of classifying Senators with regard to this matter of allowances. He did not, of course, name me when making that reference, but I am the person who did make the suggestion. I was very careful when I was mooting the suggestion to say that I thought it was a foolish one, that I thought it was one which would not work.  The suggestion I had in mind is reported in column 247 of the Official Report of July 9th.  I suggested that if we were to act in the way that Senators on the other side think we ought to act, that if justice is to be done, then people who are of independent means ought not to get any allowance whatever. There might be another section who would not be completely independent in the matter of means and that to them travelling allowances only might be allowed.  I referred to the third category, which is the category in which I am mainly interested, those who could not possibly accept membership of the Seanad unless they got a reasonable allowance.  Senator Hayes, from his remarks to-day, would seem to be of the opinion that there is not very much room for people of that kind in the Seanad.  &ldquo;If they have not made good,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;then there is <Col N="389" /> no place here for them.&rdquo;  What exactly does &ldquo;making good&rdquo; mean?</P>
      <P>Supposing some young tradesman down the country wishes to enter the lists for membership of the Seanad. Supposing the people consider that he is a suitable person.  If that young man cannot get adequate allowances how is he to attend?  His employment will not be kept open for him.  We know, of course, that it has been impossible for some people, tradesmen and business people, to carry on membership of the Oireachtas unless they got adequate compensation or allowances from some source.  I think in the Dáil there is a case of one Deputy who had to give up his employment altogether because he could not carry on.  If we do not pay reasonable allowances to members of that kind, I think we will do a very grave injustice to a considerable section of the community and a very grave injustice to the nation by depriving the nation of the services of valuable public representatives.  If you agree that the Seanad ought to be open to such people, it follows that adequate provision ought to be made to enable such people to become members.</P>
      <P>We come back to the question, then: if you are to provide for them, are you going to provide for this question of differential allowances?  I hold that you cannot do it.  You must try to strike an average.  That is all that I think has been sought from the very first day when allowances were introduced&mdash; to strike an average.  Supposing it does happen that members of the Seanad find when that average is struck that they are still receiving too much.  Surely these people will find a way, after having calculated what their necessary and essential expenses are, of returning whatever they get over and above those expenses to the State. If they are sincere about it, that is the way they will approach it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not speak on the last occasion and, therefore, in one sense I could not be affected by what Senator Ó Buachalla said.  It was precisely for that reason that I have got to my feet.  I intend to support this amendment as far as it possibly can be supported, because I am quite <Col N="390" /> satisfied that the existing allowances are quite adequate and that the law as it exists had to be obeyed, had to be carried out, and should be carried out. The method that Senator Ó Buachalla suggests, that people should spurn and cast aside the law enacted by the Oireachtas, is a method which I candidly thought and hoped the Senator and his Party had long since left behind.  The fact remains that the law is there and that it is the sincere duty of any person who feels that the law should be altered to do his best to alter it when he gets the opportunity. In one respect I feel as Senator Baxter feels, that we are travelling a very bad road in that public representatives have become more and more penny messenger boys of the people in the various areas.  That is not the right way to approach public representation.  It is not the right way to approach the consideration of legislation in this House or for that matter, in the other House.  I have one Senator particularly in my mind who I am perfectly satisfied works extraordinarily hard at a particular type of public work.  I think that Senator is doing that absolutely sincerely and according to his conscience, but I think he is entirely and absolutely mistaken as to what the function of such a public representative is.  It is not the function of a public representative to spend his entire public time writing letters or interviewing Government Departments so that A, B, or C can get some particular thing.  The function of a public representative is to criticise, to amend, to suggest the broad general principles of law and the broad general principles of public administration upon which that law should be administered and not to interfere in the detailed day-to-day decisions taken in that administration. It is an unfortunate fact that our public representatives have rather tended towards that in recent years. Ultimately, it is a trend that will very seriously affect the quality of the representation and the quality of the consideration that can be given to legislation as it passes through the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that I consider the present allowances are adequate; but I want <Col N="391" /> to make the further point that, in my view, whether the present allowances are adequate or not, there is unfortunately abroad such a distrust of public representatives that I think it is essential for us to make a firm decision to allay that suspicion and distrust. There is unfortunately abroad a suspicion that people are in public life for what they can get out of it, and if we pass this amendment we will at least have shown that so far as this House is concerned the public have no justification for that suspicion.  We will have travelled, in my view, a long way on the road to allay the suspicion in the mind of the public and to bring them back to a consideration of what a representative in public life is doing and should do.  For these reasons, I purpose to vote for the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in sympathy with a great deal of what has been said by the mover of the amendment and by subsequent speakers and yet, for various reasons, I must oppose the amendment.  My principal reason is that this amendment, if adopted, will automatically exclude from the service of the House all those less fortunate citizens who must depend in the main on their remuneration as Senators while serving as Senators.  There are, perhaps, actual, and certainly potential, Senators who must sacrifice their other means of livelihood in order to serve as Senators, and therefore we cannot, in justice to that particular section, adopt a principle which will automatically exclude them from service and, in fact, will confine membership of the Seanad to members of the more fortunate classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much to be said against the particular method and principle by which allowances are paid to members of both House and much to be said in favour of a consideration of the whole matter afresh and without allowing ourselves to be influenced too much by the decisions taken in 1938; but I am not convinced that by adopting this amendment the House will make any real contribution towards ensuring that <Col N="392" /> very desirable reconsideration.  It might just happen that the amendment might be passed and the Dáil might say: &ldquo;Very well; Senators think they are worth only £360 a year in terms of the present depreciated value of money. That is all we will give them, and we will do nothing about it.&rdquo;  What guarantee have we that, if we adopt the amendment, the Dáil will initiate legislation which will have the effect of putting the whole matter on a more rational and defensible basis?  In other words, the amendment does not meet the real objections which there are to the present method and principle of paying remuneration to Deputies and Senators.  I do not propose to go over again the ground over which I travelled on Second Reading, but there are such real objections and it is very desirable that the whole matter should be considered afresh and without prejudice.</P>
    <P>Whatever remuneration is paid to Senators, the same amount must be paid to all Senators.  One objection to the present method of payment is that that equality of remuneration leads to a serious inequality of reward, as I pointed out on a former occasion, for to pay £360 a year to a person whose family circumstances are such that he is not liable for income-tax, is the same thing as paying £500 a year or so to other persons whose family circumstances are such that they are paying income-tax on the rest of their income at the full rate.  In other words, £360 all round free of tax is equivalent to about £500 a year subject to tax from the point of view of those Senators who are paying income-tax at the highest rate and the proposed change in the present law will not in any way affect that situation.  It will merely substitute a different arithmetical quantity for the purposes of that calculation. Yet the Government have to fix some figure and to fix the same figure for everybody and the only factor which can determine what that figure is is the minimum amount which would enable a person who must sacrifice other means of livelihood to serve in the Seanad without incurring unfair loss or making an unfair sacrifice in doing so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> In the conditions which existed in 1938, the figure of £360 was arrived at. Now it is proposed to pay £468, equally free of tax.  It is perfectly true that, on the basis of the present and prospective value of money, £468 in 1947 £'s is about the equivalent of £300 in 1938 £'s, so that we are in fact being asked to agree to a substantially smaller real remuneration for our services in 1947 than was considered right and proper in 1938.  Whatever figure is arrived at, it must be the same figure for all, and yet there is the uncomfortable thought that a figure which is only just enough to enable certain Senators to serve at all does afford a comfortable surplus to certain others, especially those who have the advantage of living in the immediate neighbourhood of Dublin and who have not to incur heavy expenses on subsistence and maintenance in Dublin during sessions of the House.  That is the real problem and one which I think ought to be seriously considered and legislated about in such a way perhaps as to depart from the whole principle of the legislation enacted in 1938; but, while we are committed to the policy of that 1938 legislation, I do not think it right that we should get out of step now in a small matter like this unless we can be quite certain that, by doing so, we ensure a reconsideration of the whole matter in the light of the principles which should govern it.</P>
    <P>I suggested in my former remarks that the Minister should apply the mechanism of income-tax so as to ensure that rewards would be in some way proportioned to the financial circumstances of individual Senators, and I suggested also that expenses which were wholly, exclusively and necessarily due to service in the House should be allowed to be free of income-tax. The Minister in his reply said, quite rightly, I think, that it would be wholly objectionable to have Senators making their case to civil servants for such and such as a justifiable item of Senatorial expenditure and having to be sat in judgment upon by the Revenue Commissioners in the matter. That might be and would be rather humiliating and undesirable in every way, and yet I think something ought to be done about it.  The fairest thing <Col N="394" /> would be not to prejudice the position now by getting out of step with what will probably be enacted with reference to the allowances of Deputies, but to maintain for the present the principle of the 1938 legislation with the proportionate increase in Senatorial allowances, but that, as soon as possible, the Minister should try to bring about legislation which would put the whole matter on a more defensible basis.</P>
    <P>In order to get the data on which such legislation should be based, I suggest that Senators and Deputies should be asked to keep in the course of the next 12 months private records of all the expenditure they incur which they would not have had to incur if they had not been Deputies or Senators, and to give the Minister, in confidence, the aggregate of these items, added up to a certain total.  No doubt the figures would add up to very different totals in the case of different Senators and Deputies, but nevertheless they would give the Minister some rough idea of what the average amount of expenditure and loss involved in service in either House amounted to, and, have ing got that information, he could then bring about legislation which would take the form of setting out that a certain proportion of the remuneration of Senators and Deputies shall be regarded as allowances and free of income-tax and the rest of it as payment for expert services and subject to income-tax like any other form of salary.  I cannot tell you what that proportion ought to be.  It might be £100, £150 or £200, but the Minister, if he had that data before him, would be able to make some kind of rough calculation as to a fair amount that could be regarded as free of income-tax and then legislate that the rest of the remuneration of Senators and Deputies should be regarded as payment for services and should be subject to income-tax.</P>
    <P>In a matter of this kind the Government must take the primary responsibility of arriving at a decision and must incur whatever unpopularity may be involved in arriving at a decision which is capable of being represented in a somewhat unpleasant light in the eyes of public opinion.  I am quite willing <Col N="395" /> to share the unpopularity, but I know we cannot be responsible for the final decision.  I urge that we should do nothing to prejudice the position established in 1938, but the whole principle of the legislation then established should be reconsidered and we should arrive at some more equitable and defensible method of paying for the services of Senators and Deputies.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnston said that in settling the allowance to be given to a Senator we should fix it at such an amount as would not exclude a person with no other means from coming forward, being elected and carrying out his duties as a Senator That is a principle we have to keep in mind in all discussions on what allowance we will fix for Senators and members of the Dáil.  The main point is that any person in this democratic country should be able to go to the people and say: &ldquo;I am prepared to represent you in the Dáil or Seanad, provided you elect me, and will be able to carry out the duties I promise to fulfil because there is an adequate allowance for that purpose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The last day, and for some portion of to-day, we have had a discussion as to whether we should depart from that particular principle and pay by results. The Senators who spoke about payment by results have had a long number of years in which to consider that question and, even though they may, in the course of the discussion, suddenly think they have a solution of the problem&mdash;even if that system were adopted&mdash;if they think more about it they will find they have not got a solution and what might at first blush appear to be a happy and an equitable solution could result in evils of another description.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes spoke at length the last day on this question of payment by results.  Senator Hayes has been in public life for a long time and I never heard him putting forward that particular method of payment of Senators' or Deputies' allowances before.</P>

      <P>When the Senator came to framing an amendment, he submitted one which would have the result of paying Senators by the rule-of-thumb method which he condemned to-day. He said it was indefensible and irrational to pay Senators by any rule-of-thumb method.  But his amendment suggests the rule-of-thumb method; he suggests that we should have a flat rate of allowances for every Senator at the existing level.  That is a rule-of-thumb method.  Senator Hayes said he had no doubt as to the adequancy of the existing allowance.  I must say that if the allowance is adequate to-day, then the allowance paid from 1923 until 1939 was over-adequate.</P>
      <P>This matter has been discussed on many occasions in the Dáil and Seanad over the past 24 or 25 years and, although various Senators and Deputies threw out suggestions, the only one that was ever put in the form of an amendment was one to the effect that the allowances should be subject to income-tax.  If we made Senators' allowances subject to income-tax it would mean setting up the Revenue Commissioners and their officials as the judges of Senatorial conduct in regard to expenses and allowances.  I believe it would be a bad thing to have the Revenue Commissioners and their officials putting Senators on proof in regard to their expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are bound to be disputes between the Revenue Commissioners and Senators as to whether certain expenses were justified, whether a Deputy or Senator should have refrained from giving a subscription, whether he should have stayed at home instead of attending some particular function.  It is an inescapable part of <Col N="397" /> the Revenue Commissioners' duty to treat with Senators, Deputies, Ministers and others in relation to the personal part of their income.  They have plenty of precedents and they make allowances that are well within the precedents that have been established. If we started now to say to the Revenue Commissioners: &ldquo;Well, these allowances will be subject to income-tax. Treat Senators as professional men and, if there are expenses wholly and necessarily connected with the carrying out of their duties as Senators, we will allow those as free from income-tax,&rdquo; that is setting up the Revenue Commissioners as judges of what Senators should do and should not do in the line of expenses.  I do not believe in it.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Senators that there is one reason why there is another section in this Bill in regard to travelling facilities.  The reason is that I do not want civil servants to be involved in disputes in regard to the use of motor cars with Deputies and Senators. There was a certain number of such disputes and they finally came to me for adjudication.  I do not want to be in the position, either, of having to adjudicate upon them.  As Senators know, the system in operation heretofore, which is being abolished under a section of this Bill, was that if a train was reasonably available to a Senator or a Deputy and if he used his car, instead of getting a mileage allowance for his car he would get only first-class train fare.  That led to all sorts of difficulties in regard to the question of whether a Deputy should not have travelled the night before when a train was available or whether he should not have waited over-night in Dublin and have taken the train on the following morning rather than have used his car. I decided that we should put that particular cause of dispute between Senators and Deputies and civil servants out of the way.  Even if Senators had put forward a recommendation to that effect, I would not recommend the Dáil to accept a situation in which we would set up the Revenue Commissioners and their officials as judges as to what a Senator should or should not do with the allowance for expenses given to him by the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> The allowance which Senators have at the moment was fixed in 1922 or 1923 at £360 a year.  In 1938 it was decided by the Dáil and the Seanad, that Senators should continue to draw the same allowance, £360 a year, but that the allowance of Deputies should go up by £120 to £480.  I take it that at that time when the matter was discussed, after the 16 years or so during which the Oireachtas had been in being, it was finally concluded that it would be inequitable, or at least that it would not be necessary, to continue to pay Deputies and Senators at the same standard rate of £360 a year or £30 a month.  In 1938, therefore, while it was agreed that the allowance of Senators should remain at £360, the allowance of Deputies was increased to £480 a year.</P>
    <P>We have come now to a period after the war in which inevitable adjustments in salaries and wage levels have had to be made.  Last year we abolished the Standstill Order in regard to wages and salaries outside the State services.  In the ensuing months, I spent very many long hours debating with civil servants, from the highest to the lowest, in regard to what adjustment we should make in 1947 to meet the new cost of living or the change in the value of money.  I pointed out here the last day that if we were to compensate Senators for the decrease in the value of money to the same extent as we compensated civil servants, the proposal in this Bill, instead of being one to increase Senators' allowances by 30 per cent, would be one to increase them by 41 per cent., and that in fact, when we come to consider the matter closely, the proposal in this Bill is not to increase the effective salary of Senators in relation to 1938 £'s but to decrease in terms of 1938 £'s the allowance then granted to Senators.</P>
    <P>I think that from 1938 onwards Senators made no particular point that their allowances were too large.  It may be that in certain cases Senators would have been willing&mdash;I am perfectly certain a number of them would &mdash;to do with less but in these matters, remembering the world in which we are living, we cannot hope to evolve an <Col N="399" /> absolutely ideal way of dealing with the problems that affect a variety of human individuals.  We can only in this matter look at the circumstances of 1938 when it was commonly agreed by the Dáil and Seanad&mdash;there was only one dissentient in the Seanad from the 1938 level of allowances for Senators&mdash;that £360 a year was a reasonable allowance for Senators. That scale was agreed to by the people in the various general elections that have taken place since then.  We had an election in 1938, one in 1943 and one in 1944 as far as I remember.  We had three elections and, by and large, we may take it as agreed that the 1938 scale of allowances was a fair and proper one in relation to the 1938 standard of values.</P>
    <P>Standards of value have changed since then.  No one can deny that a Senator's expenses, if he is performing the same sort of duties in 1947 as he discharged in 1938, have gone up by more than 30 per cent.  We are proposing only that the number of pounds should be increased by 30 per cent., not that Senators' allowances should have the same purchasing power as they had in 1938.  I can understand a certain amount of diffidence on the part of Senators in discussing a matter of this kind and their saying in a self-depreciating way: &ldquo;We are not really worth the money&rdquo; but they would not say that if it was any other type of debate that was going on.  When I look round at what is happening in the world and within the State services, when I realise the importance of having a Second Chamber, representative of the people, that can carry out work in a reasonable fashion, and when I compare what I am proposing in this Bill to give members of that Chamber with what I am giving clerical officers, I get a bit of a shock.  I do not think that any Senator would say that his work is of less value to the people than that of, say, a clerical officer.  There are many clerical officers who, in my opinion, are better than some Senators and do very useful work but I do not think that the majority of Senators&mdash; even Senators who say that they should not get more than £360&mdash;would claim that their services are of less value to <Col N="400" /> the State than those of a clerical officer.  The fact is that we pay a married clerical officer, with a few children, much more than we are proposing to give to Senators.  I hope that Senators will not press this recommendation.  We have had it thrashed out for some days and, by and large, we thrashed it out in a fairly good spirit, though it could have been done in a different spirit.  The people will understand fairly well that, if they want to have representatives in the Dáil and Seanad, the minimum they should be paid is what would enable a man or woman with no other means to carry out his or her duties.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that what we are proposing for Senators&mdash;the Teachtaí Dála are not under discussion now&mdash;is unreasonable, particularly when one remembers that a highly-paid artisan would earn as much in a year.  Many artisans are earning a larger sum.  A very junior grade in the Civil Service, even if it is an important grade and includes very valuable people, commands higher remuneration, in the case of a married officer with a few children, than that of Senators.  I do not think that anybody would urge that a Senator with no other means should be denied the standard of life of an artisan.  If Senators think that the people will not understand the position, I think they are making a mistake. If the matter were put as a single issue to the people, I do not think that they would agree with those who say that, although they did not consider £360 too much in 1938, they consider £468 too much to-day.  I trust that Senators will agree with the procedure adopted in 1938 when, after full discussion, the measure went through without amendment.</P>

      <P>If we accepted a compromise of that description, it would be open to a Senator to go to the Revenue Commissioners, in relation to <Col N="401" /> the other £268, and say: &ldquo;£200 was not sufficient to cover my expenses. My expenses are set out on this long list and they tot up to more than £200.&rdquo;  In that way, we should come back to the same point.  I do not care what they are doing in other countries; it would be a bad thing to force the Revenue Commissioners into a position in which they would have disputes with Senators and Deputies as to what was a proper expense and what was not. In this matter, we have taken a rough average.  Nobody, without other means, will make any money out of the allowance of £468 and, at the same time, do any work for the Seanad.  If a Senator does not fulfil the functions and duties which he undertook to perform, it is up to his constituents to get rid of him at the next election.  If you make the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners the authority to keep Senators in order, you will have a completely different system of government from what we have.  I do not think that any of us would want the system of government to which the proposition which has been made would lead.</P>

      <P>I did not speak on the Second Reading of this Bill.  At the same time, I have been considering the amendment which is now before us.  I have reached the conclusion that the amendment is misconceived and is derogatory to democratic and representative government.  Underlying the speeches in favour of the amendment are suggestions that a cancer has recently crept into the public life of the country in the shape of allowances to members of the Oireachtas.  Anybody who has studied history knows that the payment of members of Parliament is as old as representative government, as we know it.  In 1295, which is some time ago, there was in England what was known as the Model Parliament. That was in the time of Edward I. To that Parliament were summoned two knights from each shire, two citizens from each state and two burgesses <Col N="402" /> from each borough.  From the very beginning, these representatives of the shires, or counties, and the cities or boroughs were paid wages by their constituents.  In the time of Edward II, who reigned from 1307 to 1327, their wages were fixed.  Each knight of a shire, or member for a county, was paid 4/- per day and each citizen and each member for a borough was paid 2/- per day.  These were the wages paid in the 14th century.  In addition, they were allowed wages for the days spent in coming to and going from Parliament. That rate of pay for members of the British House of Commons continued down to 1686.  When our Anglo-Irish Parliament was set up in this country after the English had come here the members of the old Irish House of Commons were also paid wages, but their rates of wages were higher in the time of Elizabeth&mdash;a knight of the shire in Ireland, namely a member for a county, was paid 13/4 a day and a member of a borough or city was paid 10/- a day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is this and it is set out in books and histories&mdash;that the representatives of the county, the knights of the shire, were of a higher social standing and had, therefore, a higher position to maintain.  In addition, in the time of Elizabeth, the members of Parliament were paid for the time they spent in travelling to and from their homes to their Parliament&mdash; 13/4 per day was paid in the case of a member for a county.  They were, however, paid different rates for winter and for summer&mdash;they were paid at the rate of 20 miles travel in winter and 30 miles in the summer, so that a member would receive less pay for travelling from his home to his Parliament in the summer than in the winter.  In the time of James I the rate of pay was 13/4 for a knight of a shire, 10/- for a citizen and 5/- for a burgess.  They were allowed payment for ten days before and after the Prorogation.  As time went on the constituents, so to speak, made bargains with their representatives. The representatives said to the constituents: &ldquo;We will not ask <Col N="403" /> you for any pay: we will take the job for nothing.&rdquo;  Therefore, in the course of time, the payment of members died out.  The last payment that was made in Ireland was up to the 27th September, 1662.  The last payment that was made in England was in 1686.  The reason why the payment of members died out was that instead of being paid, the would-be members brought their seats in Parliament.</P>

      <P>The Government of the time created enfranchised boroughs, commonly known as &ldquo;pocket boroughs&rdquo; in order that the Parliament might be flooded with place men who were paid for their votes by the Government of the day.  That is why in the 18th century we had so much Parliamentary corruption.  That was exemplified in our own country when the Act of Union was passed because, when the 84 boroughs were disenfranchised, the representatives of those boroughs were paid £1,260,000 by way of compensation.  Those gentlemen, therefore, who offered their services free, gratis and for nothing to their constituents got a magnificent return in the shape of compensation through the Government of the day whether in the form of bribes or by way of compensation for the disenfranchisement of their constituencies.  Therefore, it can be seen that the abolition of the payment of members was replaced by wholesale Parliamentary corruption.  It took some time to right that state of affairs.  In 1830 a Bill was introduced in the British House of Commons to provide for the payment of members but it did not get very far&mdash;in fact, it did not pass at all.  In 1893 and 1895 resolutions were passed by the British House of Commons in favour of the payment of members but these resolutions were not accepted by the House of Lords so that in 1911 the British House of Commons took the matter into its own hands and on the 10th August, 1911, it passed a resolution declaring that each member of the House of Commons should be paid a salary of £400 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> That is the beginning of the payment of Parliamentary representatives in modern times as far as Great Britain and Ireland are concerned. Therefore, from 1911 members of the British House of Commons were in receipt of a salary of £400 a year.  That salary was not free from income-tax and it could be attached to answer debts.  That was the position when the Free State was set up here.  The framers of the Constitution of 1922 recognising that, inserted an Article in the Constitution.  Article 23 of the Constitution of 1922 provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas shall make provision for the payment of its members and may in addition provide them with free travelling facilities in any part of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In order to implement that Article of the Constitution a committee was set up by Seanad Eireann in 1922 to make a report as to the amount, amongst other things, of the payment which each member of the Seanad should receive.  That Committee reported that a sum of £30 a month would be a fair amount to pay.  When it came before Seanad Eireann the Seanad resolved on the 10th January, 1923, that the remuneration payable to members of Seanad Eireann should be the same as might be fixed by Dáil Eireann for its members and that first-class vouchers or season tickets to and from the homes of Senators should be provided.  It will be seen, therefore, that our predecessors in 1923 had no small appreciation of their own value because they unanimously passed a resolution that they should be paid at the same rate or receive the same rate of allowance as members of Dáil Eireann.  It did not say what the allowances should be.  Subsequently, on the 24th January, Seanad Eireann resolved that each of its members should be allowed a sum of £30 a month; that is, when the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923, was passed in June, 1923, it contained a Preamble setting out those resolutions of the Seanad and of the Dáil.  Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann came under that Act and the members of Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann <Col N="405" /> received the same allowance&mdash;£30 a month.</P>
    <P>I was reading the debates on this matter in Volume I of the Seanad Debates.  There was a slight difference of opinion in the Seanad at the time. Some members of the Seanad were in favour of no allowance for Senators but, ultimately, it was carried by 23 votes to 9 in Committee.  Further, as the Bill was about to pass through the Seanad, a Senator, who appeared to have been perturbed as to whether or not the £30 would be free from income-tax, endeavoured to get an expression of opinion from the then Minister for Finance as to whether or not the £30 per month would be free from income-tax, and a rather indecisive answer was given, because, of course, the Minister could not speak for the Revenue Commissioners. Further, it soon became apparent that the £30 per month was not free from income-tax.  In 1925 an amending Act was introduced, entitled Oireachtas (Payment of Members) (Amendment) Act, 1925, No. 29 of 1925, and sub-section (1) of Section 1 of that Act enacts as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The allowances payable to members of the Oireachtas under sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923 (No. 18 of 1923) shall be and shall be deemed always to have been exempt from income-tax (including supertax) and shall not be reckoned in computing income for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Act enacted retrospective legislation, as it declared that from 1923 the allowances to members should be free from income-tax.  I am sure that, if that Act of 1925 were introduced here as a Bill to-day, there would be a great protest from some people, but it is remarkable that in 1925&mdash;and I have read the records of the Seanad Debates &mdash;there was not a dissenting voice. There was some desultory discussion between three or four Senators concerning the abstention of certain members who failed to turn up to earn their allowances, but there was not one word, not even a scintilla of protest against the freeing from income-tax of that £30 a month.  If that was not <Col N="406" /> increasing the salaries of Senators, I should be amazed.  I looked up the discussion: that Bill occupied only three or four columns in the Official Seanad Debates, Volume V.  It received a Second Reading and went through Committee and Report Stages all in one day, so our predecessors in 1925 were either very sensible men or very selfish men.  All this discussion about these allowances being subject to income-tax is merely beating the air. The Oireachtas in 1925 decided that the allowances should be free, and I think it would take almost a revolution to repeal that Act.</P>
    <P>We come, then, to 1937, when the new Constitution was enacted.  It provided for the payment of members, in Article 15 (15) :&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas may make provision by law for the payment of allowances to the members of each House thereof in respect of their duties as public representatives and for the grant to them of free travelling and such other facilities (if any) in connection with those duties as the Oireachtas may determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It does not say to the members of &ldquo;either&rdquo; House, but to the members of &ldquo;each&rdquo; House.  To implement that Article, we have the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938.  I have read the debates and I find that, when that Bill was passing through the Seanad, there were some acrimonious speeches, but no voting.  There was no amendment put to the House to reduce the £30 or do away with payment of members.  There was a lot of talk, but the Bill went through.</P>
    <P>Now we come to this Bill.  When we look around in other countries, we see that every democratic country has made provision for the payment of its representatives. Good government requires that the legislators should be men capable of doing the work allotted to them and of carrying out their public duties. They should be free from any financial worry as far as possible, in order that they may discharge their duties properly. I do not agree with some Senators who say: &ldquo;We quite agree that the members of Dáil Eireann should get an increase, as they have so <Col N="407" /> much work to do for their constituents and so many letters to write&rdquo;.  In my opinion, that is not part of their duties at all and it is not for those purposes that an allowance was given.  Their duty is to represent the people in the Legislature, not to interfere with the administration of the State.  I quite agree that democratic government does lend itself to interference in executive matters by members of the Legislature and while I say that it is not the function of members of the Oireachtas to act as intermediaries between their constituents and the executive Government, I feel that the system has come to stay.  It is not peculiar to this country.  I believe it obtains fully in England and that members of Parliament there are just as active on behalf of individual constituents as are the members of Dáil Eireann here.  However that may be, all the activity is for the personal benefit of the representative concerned.  He can do his Parliamentary duties quite adequately and may be an excellent Parliamentarian, but he may not be elected unless he is able to perform favours for his constituents. That, unfortunately, is a flaw in our present system of democratic government.  The allowance which he should get would be for his duties as a legislator.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that the members of the Dáil have longer hours as legislators than we have and, if their services are to be measured in £'s, shillings and pence compared with the services of Senators, then undoubtedly the Deputies are entitled to a higher allowance than members of the Seanad. That does not mean that they should be entitled to a disproportionate allowance.  Senators have their responsibilities and duties in respect of legislation just as much as the members of the Dáil.  This is one of the two Houses of the Oireachtas and it has its own responsibility and functions.  Senators are just as much entitled to an adequate allowance in respect of their public duties as are Deputies.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there is a good deal of false public spirit abroad in connection with this recommendation.  Senators are, perhaps, too timid, too much afraid <Col N="408" /> of ill-informed or even prejudiced criticism.  If we are to keep our place in the system of government in this country, we should take the view which reasonable people would take when the matter is explained to them.  We should not scurry before the crossroad criticism of people who are well able to feather their own nests in other directions.  This Bill is a Bill which has been initiated by the Government of the day.  I was reading the debate on the Bill of 1938 and I saw in that debate a speech made by Senator Douglas who said that responsibility for the allowances to members should be the responsibility of the Executive Government of the day.  The Executive Government of to-day have taken upon themselves the responsibility of introducing this Bill providing for increased allowances to the members of Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann and that is the responsibility of the Government. It is not the responsibility, I say, of the members of Seanad Eireann or of Dáil Eireann.  Of course, I do not say that either the members of Dáil Éaireann or Seanad Eireann should abrogate their rights as legislators but members of Dáil Eireann and members of Seanad Eireann, I respectfully say, are not&mdash;I would say &ldquo;competent&rdquo; in one sense&mdash;are not the proper persons to fix their own allowances.  These allowances as far as the Seanad and Dáil Eireann are concerned have been fixed by the Government. As far as Seanad Eireann is concerned, we have no member of the Government in this House and therefore as far as we are concerned this increased allowance has been fixed by an authority outside the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas also said in his speech that if any allowance should be granted at all it should be an adequate allowance.  I quite agree with that, that any allowance should be adequate. Now, in this case, the Government has seen fit to give an increased allowance of 30 per cent.  The Minister for Finance has said that on the value of the 1938 £1 it should be at least a 41 per cent. increase and, therefore, the allowance to members of the Seanad, in terms of pounds, is not even as great as it was in 1938.  I would like to know how the increased remuneration of <Col N="409" /> £468 a year in the case of Senators would compare with £360 a year in the year 1923 and I would also like to know how it would compare with the 4/- a day that the Knight of the Shire received in about the year 1300.</P>
    <P>After all, it is a very small matter. A great number of the members of this House could live without the allowance at all.  They have other means of livelihood, but it is, I say, the essence of democratic government that Parliamentary institutions should be available to all parties, to all persons, no matter what their financial circumstances may be.  It is, of course, a difficult matter and it would be an invidious matter to analyse the particular financial circumstances of any legislator and, therefore, we must take a rule of thumb method, that is, give the same to every legislator, no matter what his financial circumstances may be.  We must also give him the same amount no matter how much work he may do in the House or how little work he may do.  It is, therefore, impossible to reduce everything to what I may call a basis of accountancy and it is impossible to reduce the position of a Senator to the position of a worker in a factory who punches a clock going in in the morning and going out in the evening.</P>
    <P>Now, having considered all those matters, I do feel that the members of this House would gain the respect of the country, would gain the respect of people who think and who know what the right thing is, if they would not run away and hide themselves behind this amendment.</P>

      <P>May I offer a suggestion?  It is that if the Oireachtas is going to call on a generous and grateful population to, if you like, increase our allowances or, if you like, raise them to the 1938 level, that Oireachtas ought to give us some more work to do. By more work I do not mean more debating.  Heaven forbid.  I yield to nobody in my admiration for the inexhaustible eloquence of my countrymen, its versatility and its powers of endurance but I do feel that as a body of more or less expert people there is a good deal of committee work that we <Col N="410" /> ought to be able to do and there is a good deal of advisory work.  There are a great many things quite outside this general Chamber of debating and I think we are quite prepared to do them and I feel that we should let it be known that we are prepared to do a good deal more work.</P>

      <P>I challenge the accuracy of that observation, Sir.  However, I do not think this is the occasion to challenge it but the issue seems to be irritating my friend opposite.  Here is one question: What is a Senator worth?  I do not believe we can decide that.  It ranges from infinity to zero. Were it arranged or agreed that Senators would be paid nothing, I am quite sure it would be possible from our country to construct a House here of representatives just as when a certain professor offered his services to a college for nothing it would have been possible to have got his services for nothing but many would have agreed that those services would have been well worth nothing.  There is the danger that if you do not pay people you will only get a certain type of person.  On the other hand, supposing the allowances were raised to £1,000 a year, well, money talks.  For many of us it generally says good-bye but the clarion would be heard in all quarters of the country and you would get, no doubt, a different type of citizen.  For your £1 a day you will get a certain type of man and I feel what the Oireachtas has to decide is, what work is the £1 a day man expected to do.  He does a certain amount of work in this House.  He does a certain amount of work outside the House.  For the benefit of those people who measure our services only by our exact attendances, he does a certain amount of work in learning how the whole <Col N="411" /> business is run, gradually learning his trade.  I think we have to look at the other side of the question: we are getting a certain amount of money. What value are we giving for that money?  If it is thought that we are not giving enough value for the money, give us some more work to do.  For that reason, I respectfully suggest, if the allowance be increased or, if you like, stabilised at the 1938 level, that we be asked to do some more work outside the actual debating in the House.</P>
      <P>I, perhaps, have not attended as regularly as some people, partly because I find that sitting for an hour or two hearing certain people making 100 words do the work of ten, gets a bit tiresome.  If I train and get into condition, eventually I may hope to be able to attend quite regularly and so satisfy some of my friends opposite.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew it was inevitable that all sorts of matters relating to this Bill, but not directly concerned with it, would be debated on it.  I did not know, however, that we were going to go back a few thousand years. I am much more interested in what was said a few years ago than I am in what Senator Ryan has said.  The Minister quoted me as saying some years ago that I believed the amount proposed was the responsibility of the Executive.  I have not changed my mind one tiny bit on that.  I still think it is the responsibility of the Executive, and that it would be highly undesirable if a committee of the Seanad was to get together and decide how much we consider we are worth.  We would have even more opinions on that, I think, than we have on most other subjects.  Personally, I think I am worth a lot more than £468, and I am enormously encouraged in that belief by the Minister's speech&mdash;much more than I have ever been by any other speech that I have heard from him.  I still believe that the responsibility for a proposal of this sort is that of the Executive, but I want to say that, when such a proposal comes before us, we have the right to express <Col N="412" /> our opinion on it, provided we do not propose an increase.</P>
      <P>There is one definite reason why I am in favour of the amendment, and it is that I do not think this is the time when increased allowances should be made to members of this House.  My reason for so thinking is not because I doubt anything which the Minister has said as to the relation of the 30 per cent, or the 41 per cent. to the allowances fixed in 1938.  I think that if we were to go on a strict basis the increase would be more than 41 per cent.  My reason for thinking that this is not the time to make this increase is because only a very small section of our people can get such an increase in our present state of wealth.  If a general increase of 30 per cent could be made in the remuneration paid to or received by, the people of this country, then I think we should get it. It is because I am of opinion that is not likely to happen during the next two or three years, that we should express our opinions on this and say that, as members of the Seanad, we can do without the increase.  To say that is not to make an attack on the Government.  It is not to say even that the Government should not have made the proposal.  I suppose it was more or less inevitable that it should come before us since it also deals with the other House.  I do not see this proposal as a Party issue at all.  Neither do I see anything derogatory in it.  I would hate to be derogatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this should be regarded by us, as it can be regarded by most people in the country, as a simple matter, namely, was it necessary?  Senator Johnston said that it was necessary, and that if this increase was not made there were certain members of the House who could not attend, and therefore, that would make this more or less a class House.  If I believed that, I would vote for the increase.  It is because I do not believe it that I am opposed to it.  I do not believe that to leave this matter over for a couple of years, until we see the extent to which we are going to have permanent inflation, would mean that any member of the House would be unable to attend, or would suffer any more hardships than people <Col N="413" /> similarly circumstanced are suffering throughout the country.  These are the main grounds on which I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to vote for this recommendation if it is put to the House, but I want to make it clear that I am not voting for it because of the reasons given by those who agree with the recommendation.  My main reason for suggesting that the increased remuneration should not be given in either House at this stage&mdash;I expressed this view on the last occasion&mdash;is due entirely to the fact that, if we in Parliament are unable to make proper provision for the very poorest sections in the community, we should hesitate before making better provision for ourselves than has been made already.  I do not want to enter into a discussion as to what the amount should be, nor do I want to go over any of the ground covered by other speakers.  I do want to draw attention to the fact that Senator Ryan, in giving us the history of payment to Parliamentarians over a period of, I think, 650 years, omitted one very important point.  He omitted to quote from the report of the committee set up by the Government in 1937 to advise them as to what should be the remuneration of members of both Houses.  The significant thing to remember is that, knowing that the members of Seanad Eireann were being paid £360 a year from 1922 onwards, the committee in 1937 reported and recommended that in future the members of Seanad Eireann should be paid £200 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so&mdash;£20 a month, and £30 for members of the Dáil.  I hate to think that Senator Ryan, in making the submissions that he did, refrained deliberately from referring to that report.  It is unfortunate that the impression should have been left on members' minds that there was no suggestion from an outside body that the £30 a month is too much, because, bear in mind, the committee which reported in 1937 was a non-Parliamentary committee. The members of the Dáil who <Col N="414" /> sat on the committee originally to report in respect of Ministers' salaries withdrew from the committee when it commenced to inquire into the allowances which should be paid to members of both Houses.  I also want to make this point, that I signed that report in 1937 because I believed it was a reasonable proposition.  I have found nothing in the intervening years to cause me to change my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fearon raised a question which has been uppermost in my mind for a long time.  I have referred to it already in this discussion, and that is the hesitancy of members of this House to do work which I think they could do, and which, I believe, they should do.  I agree with him that intervention in debate, although important at times, is not the most important job that falls to our lot.  The important work, in my opinion, for Senators is to keep track of legislation, to help, so far as we can by pooling our knowledge and our intelligence, such as it is, in the making of that legislation and to endeavour to carry out the intentions expressed by members of both Houses when it is being enacted.  Now, one of the important jobs which this House could do in furtherance of that objective is to appoint, as I have suggested on occasion they should do, a committee whose job it would be to keep track of the regulations and orders which are placed on the Table of the House and which the House is entitled to annul.  We will have more on that subject during the present sitting.  At the moment I want to say that that seems to me the really important work that should be done by this House.  I was very much disappointed, when I endeavoured to get a committee appointed some years ago, that the person who led the main criticism of the proposal was Senator Hayes.  He complained that out of 60 members we could not get ten members who would pay sufficient attention to their business to act on a committee of that kind. If that is the position, as unfortunately the votes of the House show it is the view of the majority, I do not think there is any case for an increase.  But I am not against the increase for any other reason than these two which I mentioned: (1) the undesirability of <Col N="415" /> voting money to ourselves at a time when we cannot vote it to others who need it far more; and (2) increasing the allowances in respect of members of the Seanad at a time when the members have failed or refused to do the work which I believe they are intended to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unavoidably absent from the Second Reading, and have not spoken on this matter before. Personally, my views are not very strong one way or the other.  But there is an old saying that the strength of a chain is measured by its weakest link. From this amendment it would appear that the strength of the chain is measured by a few of its strongest links and that the position of a few members of the House is to govern the other members of the House.  Looking at both sides of the House here, it is easy to observe that we are a plain, democratic people with small incomes, and for those of us who come from the country, particularly, it is a very expensive position.  I know it is a very easy thing and very nice to be a member of this House or the other House if you are resident in or near Dublin.  I remember on one occasion, for instance, when there was a meeting called for the purpose of passing some formal resolution which took exactly four minutes.  My position and the position of other members from the South and West was that that meeting, which lasted four minutes, kept us away from our homes for three days and two nights, while members living in the neighbourhood of Dublin could get home in half-an-hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to know what is the proper remuneration for a Senator.  I am sure, as somebody suggested, that if a member could keep an accurate account of his expenditure in connection with his services as a Senator at the end of a year he would find that he would have overdrawn his account so far as the allowance is concerned. It would be entirely undemocratic if good men, especially from the country, should be prevented from coming here and representing their particular areas just because they could not afford to do it.  That certainly would not be for <Col N="416" /> the good of the State or the good of the country.  As has been stated by Senator Baxter, we might come to the position that the entire representation of this House would come from Dublin and its precincts and that there would be no representation from the country. From that point of view, it is not unreasonable that the allowances of members of this House or the other House should be increased to a certain extent in proportion to the increase in the cost of living generally and the cost of travelling.  While I am sure that no member of this House would go to the Minister and ask him for an increase, I am sure that there is a good deal of relief felt by those who are not in a financially strong position that this recommendation has been made by the Government.  I know members who are engaged in farming and whose whole business has been sadly neglected owing to their attendance here.  There are others engaged in business whose business has been neglected.  There is nothing like the personal touch.  There is no member of this House who would not be more usefully and economically employed at home.  There are people employed in other professions who have to employ a substitute while they are away.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that it is not right or proper, because a few Senators can afford to come here without any inconvenience, that the other members of the House should be governed by their position.  I am sure that everyone of us could find a man in our own particular area who would be glad to be sent here without any remuneration. But that would not be democratic and might not be for the good of the country because, although they would come here without remuneration, they might not be worth the value of the light that would be consumed.  I am sure that this little show which has been made by certain members is all a nice bit of window-dressing and does not really mean anything, that the view of the Minister in increasing the allowances will be accepted, and that the increase will be acceptable to the majority of the members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKeogh" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many of those who have already spoken, I feel that the <Col N="417" /> tone and the technique of this debate, with perhaps some exceptions, was on a high level.  I cannot help thinking, however, that there is something very unreal, not to say fantastic, about the debate.  I cannot help thinking that there has been, shall I say, a slight suggestion of propaganda about it.  I cannot help thinking&mdash;it is due, perhaps, to my rather suspicious temperament&mdash;that behind this debate there is the idea that those who are sponsoring these amendments may at some future time be able to come before the country as potential saviours of the country and of its financial resources. At the risk of being tiresome, I should like to stress that, if the allowances of ten or 15 years ago were deemed right and just and adequate, the increase which is now proposed is only, as the Minister has very clearly and lucidly pointed out, equivalent to the ordinary rise in the cost of living.  This is by no means a grant or an act of generosity, but simply an act of simple justice.  I have not heard that questioned to-day.  If it is not open to question, then what is all the pother about?</P>
      <P>The proposers of the amendment probably know that it will be defeated and that they can go before the country as saviours of the country and checkers of the financial strain imposed on the country by the expenditure of this £30,000.  There are members on these benches, and I am sure on the opposite benches, to whom this salary, allowance, stipend&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;is of some importance.  Othervise, if this is to be made a plea for privilege, it certainly is a contradiction of democratic principles.  That cannot be denied.  Is membership of this House to be confined to those who enjoy the possession of comfortable incomes and who can come here without feeling any strain on their financial resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy spoke well, as is his wont.  I could not help feeling, however, that some of the speeches from the opposite benches might be summed up as so much jargon.  There are members of Senator Duffy's Party, eminent and worthy men, who, I think, could not come to this House were it not for the salary.  Are they <Col N="418" /> not entitled to do that?  If they are not, I cannot make out what the salary is for.  Out-of-pocket expenses&mdash;what causes those expenses?  How can one possibly keep track of these expenses, as has been suggested?  How can you put down every little item of expense incurred by being a member of the Seanad?  How could you possibly keep such an account?</P>
    <P>We are told that the function of Senators is to expound and a whole lot of similar jargon.  I think the function of Senators is to do, within reasonable limits, what the T.D's. are doing&mdash; helping their constituents in every way, consistent, of course, with doing their duty in the House.  If Senators are mute&mdash;not necessarily of malice&mdash;in this House or elsewhere, it does not follow that they are not doing their duty by the country.  We have it on record that they also serve who only stand and wait, and, if there are some mute, inglorious Miltons in the House, it does not follow that they are not doing their duty to the country.  Their reputation may rest on something higher than mere volubility.  The truth of the matter is that this whole debate is very unreal, even in an Assembly like this Seanad or any other senate where unrealities sometimes become the order of the day.  Those proposing these amendments know in advance that this Bill has been sponsored and passed by the Government in the Dáil, that all we can do is to delay the Bill or revise it, as is the function of the Seanad, and those who come here&mdash;in good faith, I have no doubt up to a point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should not like to call them Pecksniffs, or stooges, either, because these would savour of a certain amount of obloquy and I would not dream of going that far, but it is not easy to see how they can come here and put forward their propositions in face of all the arguments the Minister has indubitably advanced and in face of the fact that money now has not the purchasing power it had 15 years ago. If Senators were worth £360 ten or 15 <Col N="419" /> years ago&mdash;if they were entitled to £360 15 years ago, I grant you that the point could be argued&mdash;surely they are worth the equivalent of £360 now?</P>
      <P>To relate this to other things, to suggest that we are voting money for ourselves is not correct.  The Government of the day have put forward this Bill for all the political sections of the community&mdash;whether they are Labour, Fine Gael, or Fianna Fáil does not matter.  It is put forward in good faith, and to a certain extent it is an unpopular measure inasmuch as people can go down the country and say airily: &ldquo;There they are, voting increases to themselves and letting the poor go by&rdquo;, but that comparison is entirely false.  In any case, there is an old saying that every tub should stand on its own bottom, and this measure must be discussed in its own light.  If Senators 15 years ago were worth £360, which apparently was the case because it was passed and harped upon by all sections, they are surely worth it still, and that is all they are getting.  In fact, they are not getting even that, as the Minister has pointed out.  I am trying to get away from sentiment and to look at this matter from the purely factual point of view and hence I say that the arguments of the Opposition&mdash;perhaps I should not say &ldquo;Opposition&rdquo;, because I recognise that we are all as one in this House&mdash;in favour of the amendment are unreal and fantastic.  Bearing in mind the present purchasing power of money and the fact that the passing of these amendments might possibly militate against the poorer section of our Senatorial party, I think the opposition is ill-founded and, I am afraid, a little hypocritical.</P>

      <P>I liked Senator Honan's speech.  I always like Senator Honan's speeches.  Senator Kehoe reminded me of those people with whom chairmen become very familiar who say: &ldquo;I do not want to be offensive, but...&rdquo;  He adopted very trite and well-worn methods of being offensive.  He did not say very much about the Bill, except to repeat what the Minister said.  They also serve who only stand and wait&mdash; they also serve, I suppose, who only <Col N="420" /> sit and vote.  I should like to say this, however, about the amendment.  I know that there is ignorant criticism in the country of what Senators and Deputies do and ignorant criticism of what Ministers get and what Ministers deserve.  Few people have been as steadfast in their opposition to that kind of criticism of both Houses as I have been and I think that Senators who have given any thought to the matter know that.  I am not at all influenced in putting this amendment down by that kind of ignorant criticism at which the Party to which Senators Kehoe belongs were adepts and experts over a period of years.</P>
      <P>I am not at all influenced by it, as I say, nor am I influenced by what Senator Ryan apparently wants to convince the House of&mdash;that, because something was done in 1923, it is absolutely sacrosanct and nobody must change it.  That is a most foolish point of view.  Senator Ryan purports to give us an impartial history, but, as Senator Duffy pointed out, he omitted a very vital point.  He omitted another point, because the allowances to Deputies and Senators were never subject to income-tax.  They were always paid free of income-tax.  It was put into the Act in 1925&mdash;there is some Latin tag in that connection which I forget&mdash;for the purpose of greater precaution. My motive in putting the amendment down is to get a good kind of discussion on this whole matter, because I have grown up since 1923 and have seen a great many things happen and a great many changes take place since 1923.  Since then I have had a great deal of experience and have done for myself a considerable amount of reflection on this whole business, and because I have done that, it seems to me that the matter is well worth discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think, for example&mdash;I was not in a position to say anything about it&mdash;that Senators were entitled to the same allowance as Deputies.  I was not very clear about it, but that is one change which has been made and nobody objects to it now.  As the Minister pointed out, in 1938, it was decided that Deputies should get a bigger allowance than Senators.  Every argument for a uniform allowance made in <Col N="421" /> the House to-day could be made in the name of democracy, of patriotism and of poverty for the two Houses, just as they have been made for this House; but there has been a certain progress, a certain kind of experience, and we should benefit by it.  One of the things quite clear about these allowances is that they were always paid free of income-tax and the theory underlying that is that they are to recoup members of this House for their expenses necessarily incurred in doing the business of the House and, at once, and quite freely, I agree that you may do something as a Senator without being present in the House.  There are a great many duties which Senators undertake outside the House but the whole fundamental basis of the allowance is that it is an allowance, not subject to income-tax, for expenses.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with my statement that the Seanad should not give a living to anybody?  The Dáil may have professional politicians.  If it has and if they are to be remunerated for their services, they should get considerably more than they are getting now.  So far as this House is concerned, it is quite clear from the intention of the Constitution that members of this House should get only the expenses they necessarily incur in the performance of their duties.  I cannot find that the expenses of even country Senators have to some extent increased, and this does not seem to me to be the time to increase the allowance and to increase it by this particular method.  For that reason, I never argued that members were getting too much and I never said anything about my conscience.  It was stated by a Senator on Second Reading that he would be glad to see people serving for nothing.  I do not want to see people serving for nothing, but I think we could form a Seanad which would be more effective than this House, and in which the members would serve for the expenses they necessarily incurred in performing their duties.  If you adopt that principle, <Col N="422" /> you would have no case for increasing this allowance without some kind of inquiry into what people do and what kind of expenses they incur.</P>
    <P>It has been charged that this amendment means that poor people could not get into the Seanad.  There are very few people here who ought to have as great a sympathy with the efforts of the poor man to get into Parliament as I had and have.  I do not indulge in the kind of lip sympathy in which some people indulge.  I do agree that everybody should be free to become members of the Seanad, but am I to be told that somebody should make a profession of attending the Seanad and should get a remuneration which would be a living for him?  I do not think he should, to be quite frank about it.  Whatever about the other House, they certainly should not in this House.  For people who cannot attend or do not attend there could be a scheme provided whereby they would not get the allowance&mdash;apart from ill-health, or other causes which we all recognise.</P>
    <P>There is the further argument put by Senator Douglas which, I think, is sound.  A great many people, and these not the very poorest classes&mdash; people in what might be called the white-collared classes, including a considerable number in the Civil Service&mdash; have not been able to get an increase commensurate with the increase in the cost of living&mdash;have not been able to get an adequate increase&mdash;and as far as this House is concerned, it should not, in the light of what it does, agree to an increase in the remuneration of its own members without an inquiry into the fundamental principles upon which the remuneration is based and without determining that the remuneration is actually deserved.  I agree with Senator Kehoe that until he began to speak the level of the debate was good.</P>

    <P>Section 3 agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That before Section 4 a new section be inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;That sub-section (5) of Section 3 of the Principal Act be deleted.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this recommendation is perhaps not completely clear from the wording of it because it is an example, if you like, of legislation by reference. The position is that, in the Principal Act, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938, a provision was inserted which really in my view&mdash;and I think the Minister will agree with me&mdash;is more properly applicable to the Ministers and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938.  The provision in the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act of 1938 is that any person who holds what is termed an appointed office, that is to say any Minister, Parliamentary Secretary, Ceann Comhairle, Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach, shall take into account the proportion of his Parliamentary allowance in the computation of his salary for income-tax purposes.  The effect is that such proportion is paid to him tax free and is not computed for the purposes of income-tax and surtax.  I suggest that that arrangement should be changed and that in lieu thereof, persons holding appointed offices should pay a tax upon the whole of their salaries.</P>
      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that while the recommendation is put forward in respect of this Bill I am not suggesting it as a recommendation in reference to the amount of the salary. If the recommendation is passed here in respect to this Bill it may be necessary for the Minister to insert a further recommendation in the Ministerial and Parliamentary Officers Bill, grossing up, so to speak, the salaries that are paid to the appropriate amount after making allowances for the due and proper deduction of income-tax and surtax at the various rates.  I am not raising this matter on the question of the amount of salary paid to Ministers.  I want it to be perfectly clear that it is purely a question of the principle of whether a Minister or any other person holding an appointed office should be assessable for income-tax and surtax at the ordinary proper rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill I <Col N="425" /> referred to this matter in detail and the Minister in his reply did not deal with it at all.  The matter was referred to at some length in the Shanley Report and in that report made in 1937 there was a strong recommendation, as I said on the last occasion&mdash;it was I think the only recommendation that was underlined in that report&mdash;to the effect that holders of appointed offices should be liable for income-tax and surtax in exactly the same way on all of their salaries as any ordinary citizen.  On the last occasion I gave the House the reasons why I considered that necessary. I considered it necessary because a Minister does not have to bear any of the clerical expenses that ordinary members of the Dáil or Seanad have to bear.  The Minister has provided for him, and quite properly provided for him, a private secretary who does not merely Departmental work but also the political work of that Minister.  Again the Minister has not to incur, as an ordinary Deputy or Senator has to incur, expenses in telephoning in regard to his public business.  The Minister does not, unlike an ordinary Deputy or Senator, have to bear the cost of postage in regard to his public business. A Minister necessarily lives in Dublin and he has not to bear the cost, such as Deputies and Senators have to bear, of living in Dublin during the week and staying at a hotel while the Oireachtas is in session or while he is engaged here on public business.  We have certain very definite distinctions indeed between the case for having Deputies and Senators' allowances paid free of income-tax and the case to be made for Ministers in that respect.  I use the word &ldquo;Ministers&rdquo; as a short term for persons holding appointed offices.</P>
    <P>I think that it is highly desirable too that persons who have the power of fixing rates of surtax and income-tax should be persons who have to pay these rates in regard to the whole of their salaries.  The position under the present Bill is that, after the deduction of the Deputies' allowance, a Minister's salary will stand at the figure of £1,501 so that his liability for surtax in respect of his salary will be 6d.  It is undesirable, I suggest, that Ministers, who are fixing the rate of surtax, should be put in the position themselves <Col N="426" /> of not having to pay such surtax as is fixed on the whole of their salaries.  I do not think that there can be any real argument that the total emoluments paid to a Minister for the work he is doing whole-time do not consist entirely of salary and that the tax levied on these emoluments should not be entirely on a salary basis.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this recommendation, therefore, is to make the whole of the emoluments subject to income-tax or surtax at the proper rate, after having all the allowances provided for under the income-tax code for an ordinary citizen deducted.  As I said at the beginning, I accept at once that if this recommendation is given effect to, there must be a compensatory recommendation produced by the Minister on the other Bill, which compensatory recommendation I shall support.  I do not think it would be open to any private individual to make it and that is why I did not put it down as it is part of what I consider a composite scheme dealing with both Bills.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the purpose of this amendment is at all. It would have been a good thing if Senator Sweetman had read out sub-section (3) of the section of the Act of 1938 to which he referred: &ldquo;The salary for the time being payable to any member of the Oireachtas by virtue of his holding any appointed office shall be deemed to include the allowance payable to such member under this Act and, accordingly, no member of the Oireachtas shall, while he is in receipt of the salary in respect of any such office, be entitled to any further allowance under this Act.&rdquo;  Surely if a Minister gives up his salary as T.D.&mdash; now £600 a year&mdash;the least which might be done is to allow him the expenses he would have been allowed if he had been a T.D.</P>

      <P>I never previously heard this comparison made between the position of Ministers and Deputies and Senators in the matter of allowances. When I heard Senator Sweetman's speech last week, I felt that he had made an unanswerable case.  I do not think that the Minister will for a moment contend that Ministers have <Col N="427" /> expenses comparable with those for which an allowance is made to Deputies and Senators.  Senator Sweetman has dealt completely with that point.  If this amendment be carried, there will be no reduction in the emoluments of Ministers.  We shall merely have a true picture of their total emoluments. This is simply a proposal to bring Ministers' emoluments into line with those of any other citizen.  It is most important that no privilege should attach to the tax position of Ministers.  I am sure that Ministers would not ask for any such privilege.  The only object of this amendment is to put Ministers' emoluments on all fours with those of other citizens and to secure that they pay the same tax as other citizens.</P>

      <P>No.  Local calls are free, as they are free to Senators and Deputies, simply because they could not be accounted for.

      <P>If I telephone to a friend in Dundalk, I pay for the call.  If I telephone officially to Dundalk or to Cork, the State pays for the call.  The same applies to letters.  I give my personal letters to my private secretary and they are stamped and paid for in the ordinary way.  I come back to the main point of this discussion&mdash;whether it is right that that portion of a Minister's <Col N="428" /> salary which represents his allowance as a Deputy or Senator should be free of income-tax.  In 1923, when the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Bill was going through, the then President of the Executive Council indicated that these allowances would be free of income-tax.  Between 1923 and 1925, however, the Revenue Commissioners held that, while the allowance of a Deputy or Senator who did not hold an appointed office was free of income-tax, the allowance of a Minister was not free.  They proceeded to assess and get paid the income-tax on the portion of a Minister's salary which was appropriate to his position as a Deputy&mdash;I think that no Senators were members of the Government then.</P>
      <P>That caused trouble between the Ministers and the Revenue Commissioners. As I understand, the position was most unsatisfactory.  There were disputes between Ministers and the Revenue Commissioners as to what should be properly allowed as an expense, because Ministers who had been charged income-tax proceeded to claim exemption for that portion of their total salary which was necessarily and inevitably connected with their positions as Teachtaí Dála.  It was decided by the Executive of the day to put an end to that.  A Bill was brought forward in the Dáil in 1925.  Senator Ryan gave the date of its introduction and I have a copy of the Bill here, if anybody desires to see it.  It provided that, after that date, that portion of a Minister's salary which represented his allowance as a Deputy or Senator&mdash;the allowances were then the same for both&mdash;should be free of income-tax.  It went further and set out that it should be deemed always to have been free of income-tax.  No effort had been made by the Revenue Commissioners to collect income-tax from Deputies or Senators in respect of their allowances but it had been made in the case of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the sole question at issue in 1925.  The matter was debated in the Dáil at some length and a number of Ministers intervened.  I do not want to quote the speeches now but, if Senators are interested, they can look <Col N="429" /> up the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill on 24th June, 1925.  The Committee Stage took place a few days afterwards.  The question was debated as to whether it was proper that a Minister should be free of income-tax in respect of that portion of his salary represented by his Dáil allowance. It was held very strongly by the then Ministers that they should be in no worse position in regard to that portion of their salary than a T.D. was. The arguments adduced convinced the Dáil.  When the Bill came to the Seanad, all the stages were passed in five minutes.  Senators did not raise even the usual objection to retrospective legislation.</P>

      <P>I have had some experience of civil servants examining Deputies' accounts.  Even though the civil servants concerned tried to be absolutely just and to follow precedents laid down there were objections to it. However, I do not want to bring the Revenue Commissioners into this at the moment.  No Minister claims for the expenses of his office.  If this amendment were to go through and if Ministers started to claim for the expenses of their offices it might very well be that they would be allowed by the Revenue Commissioners more than the sum represented by the allowance to the member of the Dáil or to the member of the Seanad.  I have no doubt that in some cases it probably would.  I have no doubt, also, that the same situation would arise again as brought about the 1925 amendment&mdash; that the matters would be disputed between the Revenue Commissioners and Ministers.  I do not think it is proper to leave a source of dispute <Col N="430" /> between the Revenue Commissioners and the Ministers.  I think the Government of the day in 1925 who faced the situation and got rid of that system did right, and I think we would be very foolish now if we started to open that source of dispute between Ministers and the Revenue Commissioners again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the passage of the Finance Bill in the Seanad, Senators Sir John Keane, Ryan and Baxter raised the question of the effect on the residence agreement of the provisions of Section 52 of the British Finance (No. 2) Act, 1945; they asked to be informed of the attitude of the Government to this legislation as affecting the residence agreement.  I am taking advantage of the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill in order to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The residence agreement made with the British Government on the 14th April, 1926 (as amended by a further agreement made on the 25th April, 1928) secures, <i>inter alia</i>, that a person residing in this country and not residing in Britain shall be exempt from British income-tax in respect of British income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of a double taxation convention made between the British Government and the Government of the United States of America in 1945, and of similar agreements subsequently concluded with Canada, South Africa, Australia and other countries, the British Government now limits its income-tax charge on incomes derived by British companies from these countries to the excess, if any, of British tax at the standard rate over the rate of tax paid on such income in these countries. The method thus employed for the avoidance of double taxation of trading profits, etc., is, I understand, based on the credit principle recommended <Col N="431" /> by the Fiscal Committee of the League of Nations.</P>
    <P>In the case of a British company which now, by reason of double taxation relief (or tax credit), pays British tax on its profits at a reduced rate, Section 52 of the British Finance (No. 2) Act, 1945, while authorising deduction of British income-tax at the standard rate from dividends paid out of these profits, restricts the rate of tax at which repayment may be made in respect of such dividends to the reduced rate in question.</P>
    <P>The Government is about to conclude with the British Government an amending agreement which will recognise as from 1948-49 the restriction referred to as applying to claims by Irish shareholders, under the residence agreement for repayment of British income tax in respect of dividends received from companies affected by the British legislation.</P>
    <P>The question may be asked whether Irish shareholders will suffer a hardship by reason of the fact that they will not receive in repayment the full British tax deducted from the dividends in question.  This aspect of the matter has been fully considered and I am satisfied that no hardship should in fact arise to Irish holders of ordinary shares in the companies referred to. These companies have now received a benefit by way of double taxation relief which they may utilise either in increasing the ordinary dividend or in expanding the companies' business; in either case it is the ordinary shareholders who benefit.</P>
    <P>In the case of preference shares Irish shareholders will in future receive a diminished return, but in this respect they will be in precisely the same position as exempt shareholders in Britain. Prior to 1945 all the burden of foreign or British Dominion tax fell upon the ordinary shareholders, but under the recent British legislation preference shareholders will suffer the foreign or British Dominion tax applicable to the fraction of the gross profits utilised for the payment of their dividends.  The position will, therefore, be that while British income-tax at the standard rate will be deducted from preference dividends, <Col N="432" /> repayment of British income-tax cannot be made at a rate greater than that received by the British Exchequer in respect of the profits out of which dividends are in fact paid.  Our shareholders could not, of course, expect to receive indefinitely repayment of British income-tax at a rate in excess of that received by the British Exchequer.  As preference shareholders are entitled only to a fixed rate of dividend the company cannot make good their loss by increasing the gross dividend.</P>
    <P>The alteration in the British law would point to the conclusion that this type of preference shares may have no further attraction for Irish investors after the financial year 1947-48.  I understand that the British authorities will repay to Irish residents the full amount of the tax deducted from their dividends upto and including 1947-48, but as accounting arrangements are difficult it may take some time before repayments are effected.</P>
    <P>I should add that the charge to Irish tax will not exceed the amount of the net dividends received from the companies together with the amounts of the British repayments and that the amending agreement will not result in any loss of revenue to the Irish Exchequer.</P>
    <P>After signature the agreement will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and will, of course, be subject to ratification.  The necessary legislation confirming the agreement will be introduced in due course.</P>

      <P>I am sure that every member of the House will be glad to know that an agreement has been reached.  I doubt if many Senators, following the Minister, will be able to grasp exactly the significance of what he said.  He did not tell us in plain English whether he regarded it as fully satisfactory or not.  At a quick glance, it would seem to be, not perhaps wholly satisfactory, but very much better than the present condition. It is extremely difficult to follow a complicated document of that kind and most of us will feel it cannot be debated now.  As the Minister has pointed out, it cannot be ratified without legislation, so it will have to come <Col N="433" /> before both Houses at a time when it can be fully debated and understood.</P>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill provides the only occasion when Senators can deal with general subjects affecting administration. We take advantage of the Bill in order to debate many matters which might not come before us in legislation.  It is tempting to deal with a very large number of subjects, but I personally propose to confine myself to one or two matters which were debated on the Estimates in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that Ireland was invited to take part in the conference in Paris on what is usually called the Marshall plan.  In their efforts to co-operate in plans for European economic recovery, our representatives in Paris have behind them the goodwill and best wishes of the majority of the people at home, irrespective of their political or Party opinions.  I think it is important that when political opponents of the Government approve of its external relations policy they should express that approval in public. We in Ireland know quite well that a change of Government, if and when it does occur, will not affect in any way our desire for close relationship with the States of Europe, and with the United States of America, but this may not be widely appreciated outside the country.  Now that we are getting a higher place in international affairs, it should be made clear when we are unitedly behind the Government in these matters.</P>
      <P>I doubt if it is realised as widely as it should be that we are a European nation, and that our economy is closely linked with that of other European nations.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was right when he said in Paris that to neglect the chances of an all-European plan would have been inexcusable on mere grounds of political consideration.  I also agreed with him when he pointed out that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the repercussions of economic decline in other countries are particularly felt by small nations, who cannot solve their problem by temporary patching up of their own economies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> I am quoting from the report in the <i>Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>I am personally glad that the Government applied on behalf of the State for membership of the United Nations Organisation and that our application still stands.  We regret that it was not immediately successful, but I do not think it did us any harm and even if it is not successful later, I do not think it will do us any harm either.</P>
    <P>The subject of Partition was amongst those discussed in the Dáil on the Estimates. I was glad that the Taoiseach once again repeated his statement that there could be no question of attempting to coerce the people of the Six Counties to unite with us.  Every thinking person will agree that the use of force by us or with our approval against our fellow-countrymen in the north-eastern counties is unthinkable, but if force is ruled out the only alternative is persuasion.</P>
    <P>Persuasion will take time, and it will succeed only if it is continuous and is the result of a united and well-thoughtout policy.  I do not believe that the majority of the people in the Six Counties will ever be convinced of the desirability of a United Ireland by the present policy, which seems to me to consist solely in talking about the wrong of a divided Ireland and explaining that England is largely to blame for it.  As a historical fact, this may be true, but simply stating it will not get us anywhere.  It only aggravates the English people, who are not interested in the past, and who believe that the only reason why Ireland is partitioned is that the majority in the Six Counties want to stay out.  I may be wrong, but I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to keep on saying that our relationships with Great Britain can never be as friendly as they should be until Partition is ended.  I do not doubt that it contains an element of truth, but it is not always wise to keep on making a statement that can be misunderstood simply because it happens largely to be true.</P>
    <P>All Parties in this State are convinced that Partition is a bad thing; all are desirous of ending it, but there is no united policy, except a policy of <Col N="435" /> talk, which seems to me to have no effect whatsoever on the majority in the Six Counties&mdash;or, if it has any effect, it only makes them more hostile. In my opinion, we should stop talking about the Border and commence an active policy of conciliation and co-operation, especially in economic affairs.</P>
    <P>The first step towards persuading another person to your point of view is to understand his mind and outlook, however much you may disagree with it.  To understand the mind and outlook of another person, you must meet him and, if possible, work with him. We already co-operate with our fellow-countrymen of the north-east in many ways.  None of the Churches or religious denominations in Ireland has been partitioned.  This is a fact of more importance than is generally recognised. In the field of sport, there is much co-operation also, and even if this is not perfect, the position is fairly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>If we are at some future date to persuade&mdash;I want to emphasise the word &ldquo;persuade&rdquo; as I am advocating a policy of persuasion&mdash;it being agreed that you cannot force the people of the Six Counties to join us except of their own free will, we should seek active co-operation with them in all matters, including politics and economics, and the first steps should come from this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Take the realm of economics first&mdash;I think we should aim at removing any cause of irritation which can be removed by unilateral action on our part.  First of all, I would like to see an announcement by the Government that it will not encourage any industrial development in the Twenty-Six Counties which would seriously compete with any industry in the Six Counties.  Where there happens to be an industry in the Six Counties which, either alone or together with the present production in the Twenty-Six Counties, could supply the whole of Ireland, I think it would be foolish to protect any new industry here which would compete and which might therefore create a new economic interest in the maintenance of the Border.  I do <Col N="436" /> not, of course, suggest that we should interfere with private enterprise.  If anyone wants to start a new industry here, they know, or at least they ought to know, that some day the Border will disappear, and if that does not interest them from an economic point of view it is their own look-out but it is a very different matter from the Government encouraging such action or protecting such industries.</P>
    <P>Next, I think that where there is a protective duty on goods imported into this country, we should provide a special preferential tariff for goods which are certified to have been manufactured in the Six Counties.  The more trade we do with the north-east, the more they will understand us and we them.  I recognise that this proposal might involve an adjustment or amendment of our trade agreements with Great Britain and possibly Canada, but I do not believe that either of these countries would create serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>Our Control of Manufactures Acts should be amended so as to make it easy for citizens of the Six Counties to take part in industrial development on this side of the Border.  The more money they have invested here, the more they will be interested in our prosperity and the less they will like the Border.</P>
    <P>It has always seemed to me strange and somewhat absurd that we should state in our Constitution that our national territory is the whole of Ireland, and then proceed by legislation to provide that residents in one part of Ireland are not to be regarded as Irish nationals when they invest their money in another part of the national territory.  That is the present position.  I also think that co-operation between manufacturers in the Six Counties and in the Twenty-Six should be encouraged actively where it is possible.  I think if goods have to be finished that are made here they should be sent there in preference to Great Britain, if it can be done, etc. I need not go into the details.</P>
    <P>In the realm of politics as distinct from economics, it is not so easy to propose or to suggest unilateral action, but we might at least actively seek cooperation. <Col N="437" /> At first our advances may be coldly received or may even be ignored, but if our deliberate and considered policy is one of persuasion we need not be discouraged and should keep on trying.</P>
    <P>I would like to see our Government approaching the Government of Northern Ireland as it is called, and saying in effect&mdash;&ldquo;You know our attitude towards the Border and we know yours.  As we have agreed that there can be no question of the use of force against you, is there any reason why we should not consult on matters of common interest without prejudice to our opinions on the question of the Border?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister for Agriculture, for instance, inviting the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland to a conference every year for the purpose of consultation and seeing how far agricultural policy in the whole of Ireland might be coordinated and made uniform where agreement is possible.</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Education and Health might seek similar conferences, and if and when these began to meet with some success, as I believe after a time they would, the idea might be extended to almost every Department of Government.</P>
    <P>I will probably be told that this is impracticable and would never work.  I do not think so, and surely it is worth trying if we are sincere about a policy of persuasion.  It may be that the present Government in the Six Counties would refuse at first, but if we repeated our invitations every year in friendly terms I believe the effect on the people of the Six Counties would be considerable, especially on the younger generation.  And remember that just as the generation which is now grown up is not much interested in who was out in 1916 or what happened 25 years ago, not nearly as much interested in it as we of an older generation are, so in the Six Counties and amongst what we call the majority there, I know perfectly well that the younger people &mdash;and I know quite a number of them and have relatives amongst them&mdash;are not a bit interested in the time when &ldquo;No Surrender&rdquo; was almost the only <Col N="438" /> thing which one talked about.  That may still be used for Orange meetings on the 12th but it does not cut much ice with the younger generation.</P>
    <P>I agree very strongly with the Taoiseach when he said that the opinion of the people of Great Britain in relation to Partition is important. It might well be that repeated efforts at co-operation, even if repulsed, might have a very great effect on the people of England and convince them, as they could be convinced in no other way, of our sincerity in desiring the unity of our country.</P>
    <P>It may be objected that this would mean the full recognition of the Government of Northern Ireland at least as a <i>de facto</i> Government, and that it would mean at least a tacit acquiescence in Partition.  I admit there may be something in that argument, but I would point out that in fact we do recognise Partition by our customs posts on the Border and in many other ways just as theoretically objectionable. We put up notices on our roads by which visitors think they are entering Eire when they cross the Border, when in fact we claim that Eire is the whole of Ireland.  While Partition continues it will be impossible to be consistent, and we may as well face this fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government was reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> to have issued an invitation to the people of Northern Ireland to cross the Border and enter a free Ireland.  I find it difficult to believe that he was correctly reported, but if he did say this I disagree with him.  I would say to our friends in the Six Counties: &ldquo;Stay where you are and help us to develop a prosperous and contented Ireland, both North and South, and ultimately to abolish the Border by mutual consent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I had my way I would go much further in an active policy to end Partition. I would like to see a Bill introduced amending the Constitution so as to enlarge the Dáil and provide that every elected member of the Northern Parliament who had taken his seat would be allowed also to attend the Dáil as a full member and take part in the Government of the <Col N="439" /> Twenty-Six Counties.  This would in effect be to say to the people of the Six Counties: &ldquo;You are part of our national territory&mdash;we cannot force you to let us share in the Government of your area because of the partition of our country but because we wish to create a situation when no one will want Partition we are willing to let your elected representatives share in the government of the Twenty-Six Counties.  If you do not like what we do, come and tell us why&mdash;there is free speech in our Parliament and you will be welcome.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the arguments that can be advanced against this suggestion. Theoretically it is all wrong to allow people to vote on legislation which will not immediately apply to them or their constituents.  It is probably theoretically more objectionable still to allow people to vote on expenditure which their constituents may not have to pay for.  I honestly believe, however, that it would be worth overriding these objections, and that if we admitted Six-County representatives to our Parliament as part of an active policy of conciliation and persuasion, it would ultimately result in the abolition of the Border by common consent.</P>
    <P>I would not allow elected members of the Northern Parliament to take their seats in the Dáil unless and until they had taken their seats in the Northern Parliament.  Unless they had done so, they would be of little value in a policy of conciliation.  The ultimate aim would be to secure a majority in the Northern Parliament of members who had also taken their seats in the Dáil, so as to make it possible to have uniform legislation passed for the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>How would this idea work if it were adopted and a Constitution Bill was introduced and passed by referendum? I think that at first only a few members of the Northern Parliament would take their seats in the Dáil, but at the first election thereafter it would become a question for the electors.  Candidates would, I believe, be found who would fight the elections in every constituency on a pledge that if elected they would take their seats in both Parliaments, <Col N="440" /> and it would very soon be the people and not the present Party leaders who would decide the issue.</P>
    <P>I believe that every election in the Six Counties would increase the number of members who would sit in the Dáil and in the Northern House of Commons.  If I am right in this we would very soon see that it would be impossible for members of the Northern Parliament to sit in the Dáil without making personal friends amongst members representing constituencies on this side of the Border.  The value of such friendships would be much greater than years of talking about the evil of Partition.  We know perfectly well that although we have amongst us very strong and sometimes violent differences of opinion, personal friendships are in no way confined to Parties.  I have heard it said that the only real political enemies one is likely to meet are to be found in one's own Party.  We do know that you can have the closest friendships even though there may be disagreements on many matters.  That could operate to a very great extent if you only got a small number of representatives of the Six Counties to join with us here.  Personally, I would be surprised if, after a very short time, you did not have all Parties in the North divided on the issue as to whether or not they should take their seats in both Parliaments, provided, of course, there was no question of being coerced and no threat of force.</P>
    <P>The suggestions I have made may not be practicable in the near future. They could not be carried out unless adopted by the Government and supported by a considerable volume of public opinion.  I put them forward here in the hope that they may be discussed by members of all Parties, and that some day a Government on this side of the Border will think out and adopt a policy of active friendship towards the people in the Six Counties as part of a plan for the ending of Partition by persuasion and consent.</P>
    <P>I do not, of course, suggest that we should cease to criticise things in the Six Counties, of which we disapprove, or pretend that we do not differ from the majority there on many issues beside that of Partition.  I do, however, suggest that the rejection of force as a <Col N="441" /> method of ending the Border and the adoption of a policy of persuasion means that our criticism should be friendly as well as frank, and should, where possible, be done in conference between Ministers from each side of the Border.</P>
    <P>A few days ago I was reading through some personal letters I received from Michael Collins in 1922. Some documents and papers belonging to the White Cross, of which I was the treasurer, had been seized in St. Mary's Hall, Belfast, by the then Craig Government.  I asked Michael Collins to see if there was anything he could do about getting the papers back.  He promised to get in touch with Sir James Craig, as he was then, and in the letter which I still have, Michael Collins informed me that he had received a promise from Sir James Craig that the papers would be handed over to the White Cross.</P>
    <P>If it was possible to have a delicate matter like that put right in 1922 by personal contact between the head of the then Irish Government and the head of the Government of the Six Counties&mdash;is it unreasonable to hope that in 1947 similar methods might not produce similar results?  Persuasion, if it is to succeed, will mean not only patience and perseverance, but also a considerable amount of Christian forbearance.</P>
    <P>When asked by the Apostle Peter: &ldquo;How oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him&mdash;until seven times?&rdquo;, Our Lord replied: &ldquo;Until seventy times seven.&rdquo;  The advice given by Our Lord might very well be adopted on both sides of the Border.  It should be remembered that if we think we have been sinned against by the Six-County Government in the treatment of minorities and in their determination to continue the partition of our country, they are equally convinced that we have sinned against them by rejecting many things which they hold dear such, for instance, as retaining the King for external purposes only.  I understood from reading&mdash;I thought carefully&mdash; the speech made by the Taoiseach in the Dáil recently that he would not favour any further constitutional or <Col N="442" /> legal changes in our relationships with the King or with the Commonwealth unless and until such changes could be made by a united Ireland.  However anomolous and open to theoretic criticism the present position may be, I felt that the decision of the Taoiseach was a wise one&mdash;to leave well alone.  I was, therefore, somewhat astonished to read in yesterday's <i>Irish Press</i> that President O'Kelly told the Ballina branch of the Gaelic League that: &ldquo;Every man and woman of them could play their part to put an end to the last link of the British Empire within our land.&rdquo;  Most people I think will assume that this statement was made on the advice of or with the knowledge of the Government.  Without some further explanation it may be regarded, perhaps, as a reversal of the policy announced by the Taoiseach. All the suggestions I have made to-day are on the assumption that that is not the case, and that the policy of the Government is to continue such links as do now exist with the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>I hate the term &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo;&mdash; and I always did&mdash;but I believe that, as far as this country both North and South is concerned, the old British Empire died and was buried when the Statute of Westminster became law. The representatives of this country played quite a considerable part in the killing and also, I think, in the decent burial of it.</P>
    <P>It is my considered opinion, based on a fair amount of contact with people in the Six Counties, that there are a large number of persons in the Six Counties more or less supporters of the majority party there, who would be ready to co-operate with us in the building of a prosperous Ireland if they could do so without feeling that they were sacrificing opinions which they hold honestly and sincerely.  But they will not do so if their actions can be taken as helping to put an end to the last link with the British Empire or the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>If we really hope to end Partition some day by &ldquo;persuasion&rdquo;, this kind of talk by responsible persons should cease.  Instead of talking about ending the last link, we <Col N="443" /> should say to the people of the north-east counties: &ldquo;We are now recognised by the world as an independent State and are free to act as we think right.  It is our interest as well as yours that we should have the friendliest possible relations with Great Britain and the Commonwealth.  If we had your co-operation, we believe the relationships could be put on a more permanent and satisfactory basis. Why not help us to do this?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to come down to commonplace subjects after the speech of Senator Douglas; but I very rarely take any part in high politics.  Agriculture and the cattle trade are my only consideration.  Senator Sir John Keane thought that in discussing these Money Bills we should have a free-for-all discussion.  I find that on all Money Bills in this House consideration is given to income-tax, supertax, excess profits tax and import duties tax.  No consideration is given to the adverse trade balance which this country is piling up and how the money is to be found to meet that adverse trade balance, a matter which is so essential in order to maintain the standard of living of our people.  Our adverse trade balance in 1946 was over £33,000,000.  I saw in the newspapers a few days ago that the value of our imports for the month of March was two and a half times higher than the value of our exports for that month. I feel that that is a serious matter when last year we were only able to import a quarter of the goods we require&mdash;if we could get them&mdash;and our adverse trade balance was £33,000,000. What would the adverse trade balance be if we could get all the goods which it is necessary to import?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ninety per cent. of our exports consist of live stock and live-stock products. These exports are decreasing to an alarming extent.  When the cattle trade draw the attention of the Government to that fact, the Minister for Agriculture says that our statements are only half-truths, but official returns prove that our statements are whole truths.  We have pointed out that calves were <Col N="444" /> slaughtered by the thousand and that, if something was not done to encourage farmers to rear more calves, in a very short time beef would become as scarce in this country as bacon and be sold from under the counter.  We pointed out that it was wrong policy to allow the creameries to sell their separated milk for manufacturing purposes, for making chocolates, cheese and dried milk.  We recommended very strongly that the separated milk should be given back to the farmers for the rearing of calves, pigs and poultry.  No notice was taken of that recommendation.</P>
    <P>We pointed out that the cattle population of the world has very much decreased and that calves were slaughtered in Great Britain and Northern Ireland as well as in our own country; that the number of calves killed in Northern Ireland had risen from 500 in 1945 to 32,000 in 1946; that the cattle, sheep and pig population of England and Wales was down this year by 1,343,000, and that the position in Scotland did not show any improvement on that.  Although all those figures were taken from official returns, the Minister still contended that they were only half truths.</P>
    <P>Farmers outside the dairying districts are now anxious to get calves to rear, but they cannot get them. Because of the slaughter of calves, a calf which a month ago could be bought for a few shillings in the dairying districts is now costing £5.  The Minister for Agriculture says our dairy cattle are bred on the wrong lines.  I suppose he is out to scrap the Hogan Live-Stock Breeding Act.  If he does that, he is out to ruin our live-stock trade.  He believes that by introducing Friesians, Jerseys and other milk breeds he will transport our dairy farmers to the Milky Way.  I think he will be supported in that proposal by his countyman, Senator Baxter, and some members of the I.A.O.S. who have also their eye on these constellations.</P>
    <P>We produce in this country the best cattle in the world and I believe that the milk yield could be increased to the standard of either the Friesians or the Jerseys if the farmers had money to do <Col N="445" /> it and got some encouragement and advice from the Department of Agriculture and the I.A.O.S., which was definitely proved at the last Royal Dublin Society's Spring Show.  The best cow in that Spring Show was a non-pedigree dairy Shorthorn.  She produced one gallon of milk more in 24 hours than the Friesians and the little miniature Kerry produced only one pound of milk less than the famous Ayrshire.  That shows that if any attention was given to the matter, the breed of cattle in this country at present could be improved to the standard of these foreign breeds which are so much praised in this country.  When I hear some people in this House talking about what they are doing in Holland, New Zealand and Denmark, I am reminded of tales like that I used to hear in my native county of Kerry. There was an old friend of mine who always quashed the discussion by saying: &ldquo;Bíonn adharca fada ar na buaibh thar lear.&rdquo;  I think that would be very appropriate to those people who praise what other countries are doing.</P>

      <P>If Senator Sir John Keane, who is a descendant of Conn of the Hundred Battles, asked me something with regard to banking or currency or the cattle trade, I would advise him and enlighten him; I think that Senator Sir John Keane has as good a right to know Irish as I have, and if his illustrious progenitor knew of his asking such question in an Irish Parliament he would turn in his grave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in a recent statement in the Dáil, said that, for the purpose of facilitating the early marriage of farmers' sons, he favoured dower houses.  He was very pleased that he got a farmer Deputy to agree with him in that proposal and I should be glad if the Minister would tell the Taoiseach that there is a farmers' representative in this House who also agrees with him.  Dower houses are nothing new in this country.  They were in existence long before the British invasion, I understand. There were always dower houses, but they were the property of landed proprietors.  Since the late Mr. Paddy Hogan's Act, we are all <Col N="446" /> landed proprietors, and it would be well for the Taoiseach, if he is serious about it, to call a conference to consider the whole question.  That conference might also consider the possibility of having our land entailed.  It would be a good policy to have the land of the larger farmers entailed, so as to make certain that the heir at law, the farmer's son, would come into the property and would not be dependent on the whim of, perhaps, a contrary father who might cut him completely out.  If the Taoiseach wants dower houses, there are a great many factors from the farming point of view to be considered.  I think it a very wise and sound policy, and, if the Taoiseach is anxious about it and calls the conference I suggest, I am sure he will get the support of the farmers for it.</P>
    <P>I want to make one final point, because I know that the cattle trade is not a very pleasant subject for professors and many of the people here.</P>

      <P>During the 1914-18 war, farmers made some money.  The banks shovelled out to them all the money they wanted.  At that time, the rate of interest was 5 per cent. and it was possible for us to pay the interest on £100 with two barrels of barley.  As soon as the depression came, the rate went up, after 1920, to 5¼ per cent.  It rose within the six months to 5½ per cent., and, in the following year, to 6 per cent. and later to 6½ per cent. The greater the depression amongst the farmers, the higher the banks raised the rate, until finally, in 1925, when we went off the gold standard and our money was deflated to an enormous extent, they raised the rate to 8 per cent.</P>

      <P>Farmers had not got such a lot of deposits.  They were concerned with paying the interest on their enormous overdrafts.  I do not want to have any slap at the banks, but I think they were very foolish in doing that.  The greater the depression <Col N="447" /> in the agricultural industry, the higher the banks raised the interest rate, instead of saying with regard to the thousands of pounds they had given out to the farmers: &ldquo;You can have this money at 2½, 3 or 4 per cent&rdquo;, or at the rate at which they had borrowed it.  Instead of doing that, they raised the rate to 8 per cent. in 1925.  I notice that Senator Sir John Keane agrees with that.</P>

      <P>I know what I am talking about&mdash;I paid it.  These are facts.  The farmers now have got back a little money after the recent war. They did not get it back on the tillage business, but any farmer who had some cattle grazing got some money back.  If the banks, however, now adopt the policy they adopted after the 1914-18 war, when they cleaned out every form of working capital the farmers had and left them with nothing to carry on with &mdash;they paid up to the last until they found they could pay no more&mdash;they will find that, as in the case of the 1914-18 war, there will be a loss to the banks.  The banks were paying dividents of 12 and 15 per cent. and putting thousands to reserve at that time. They apparently felt that to pay more than 12 per cent. to the shareholders would look bad, so they put thousands to their reserve fund.  I do not know whether the Minister has power under the Central Bank Act to regulate interest rates, but, if he has not, he should take power to see that the banks do not fleece the farmers as they did after the 1914-18 war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan was unusually versatile this evening.  He claimed that it was not his intention to ascend to the plane to which Senator Douglas raised the debate, but I think he had flights of fancy which rather tickled the House.  The difficulty for the House and for the Minister is that the possibilities of this debate are so wide and the opportunities for the House to survey Government policy so few that one is tempted to address oneself to a great many issues at the same time and perhaps suffer a handicap as a consequence. I should like to hear from the <Col N="448" /> Minister some statement with regard to the position in which this country finds itself now after the fateful date, 15th July, when the Washington Ageement becomes operative.  There has been no public indication of what the results of the coming into operation of that agreement will be for us.</P>
      <P>I think the public are entitled to know, and I hope the Minister will, however briefly, address himself to that situation.  The consequences for the nation are very considerable.  This is really a vital matter.  It is very important that we should know what the policy of the Government is.  We know that agreements have been entered into, some of them of a temporary nature.  A statement was made yesterday with regard to the holding over of the operation of agreements in the case of some European countries. Where do we come in?  Has any agreement been made between this country and Britain in regard to this matter? I hope the Minister will enlighten us.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas addressed himself to the representation of this nation at the recent talks in Paris.  We were all gratified that our country was represented there by An Tánaiste.  So far as we can gather from Press reports and radio broadcasts, we have no reason to be dissatisfied with the results.  I suggest, however, that in international conferences of this nature it is of the greatest importance that the Government should give consideration to broadening the basis of our representation. I have no desire to be critical of the manner in which we were represented, or the competence of our spokesmen and their advisers, but it must be noticed that next in command to the British Foreign Secretary in the British delegation was an economist from Oxford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that, small as this country is, it has a very vital part to play in these conferences and it would be quite competent to play that part if we made a selection from the talent available to us.  I believe that the prestige of our nation could be raised among the nations and carefully selected representatives would give our leaders great assistance and great encouragement.  They would be much <Col N="449" /> better informed.  I am satisfied from recent experiences I have had, that that is a most important factor.</P>
    <P>At the Paris conference we were definitely at a disadvantage with regard to any statements that might be made about our agricultural plans or the possibilities of our agricultural production.  I have again to express my disappointment that we have not yet any clear indication of the policy to be pursued here in agricultural matters.  I recognise there is a short-term and a long-term policy.  I hope the experience gained by our Minister for Agriculture&mdash;for him a new experience&mdash;from foreign contacts, the experience of learning what other nations are doing from some of their leading spokesmen, will bring home to him some appreciation of the necessity in this country of facing up to agricultural problems in a way which we have not so far attempted.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will feel that I am harping too much on this matter. If I were satisfied, I would not speak of it.  No member of the House would be more willing than I to subscribe to something that is progressive.  I have done it in the case of other Ministers. I have to confess, however, that as regards agriculture we are behind Europe.  We are definitely behind the people in the Six Counties, and in that connection I challenge the Minister, who knows the conditions as well as I do, to contradict me.  I have some experience of the conditions there and so has he.  I will point to the report issued by the Minister of Agriculture in Northern Ireland recently and I ask Senators to compare the survey made by the Northern people with the report recently produced for us by a number of competent people.  When one measures the dimensions of the Northern survey with the restrictive survey, the narrow approach, made in the Twenty-Six Counties, one must recognise that there is something lacking here in drive and initiative.</P>
    <P>There is definitely something that is holding us back.  I do not know whether it is the responsibility of the Government as a whole or the Minister, or where the weakness really lies, but as a farming community it is <Col N="450" /> beyond all question that we are not doing anything comparable to what we might do if our plans were more soundly laid.  I do not want to dwell on this matter unduly, but I deplore the fact that a long-term agricultural policy is being so long delayed.</P>
    <P>We know quite well that the best we were able to do during the war years was to maintain our production at the pre-war level.  Measure our production against the production of other countries, such as the Six Counties, England, Scotland and Wales or any of the Americas, especially those portions that were doing battle at the same time as they were working their land, and you will find that our seat is a very backward seat indeed.  That is due to a variety of causes.</P>
    <P>I said on the Finance Bill the other day I was very disappointed with the expenditure in the Department of Agriculture.  I do not see our Minister for Agriculture doing anything new.  I am a member of the committee of agriculture in my own county.  I recollect what was being done by the agricultural instructor there 20 years ago and the man who occupies that position to-day is doing hardly anything new. Let us admit that is the situation and let us try to get on from that.  If the Minister for Agriculture appreciates that fact and makes an effort to progress he will get the enthusiastic backing of all farmers, irrespective of Party.  There is nothing more depressing for intelligent farmers than the knowledge that our agricultural production is low and our methods are far behind those of progressive countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan has left the Chamber, but he has fired his shots.  He referred to our live-stock industry.  I think he was speaking for the cattle trade more than for the cattle producers. He talked about breeds of cattle and about a beast at the recent Ballsbridge Show.  I was on a small farm in Holland not very long ago. There were 18 cows there and the average yield for the 18 cows was over 1,000 gallons of milk per year.  At a shilling a gallon that meant £50 for each cow.  That was on a 100-acre farm. I was on another farm and the farmer there had a silo filled with grass.  He was making silage on the A.I.V. <Col N="451" /> method.  These are factors that have made a tremendous impression on the economic lives of many European countries.  We have been blind to them and it has been rather disastrous for us.</P>
    <P>I am not going to hold the House much longer but I should like to hear the Minister on one or two matters.  I do not know what the experience of other country Senators is but, without being an alarmist, quite frankly I am rather frightened at the prospects for this season.  I suggest to the Minister that unless a very great miracle happens, fuel stocks and fuel supplies will not this year be anything like adequate to our needs.  In my own county, where the local authority has been attempting to provide fuel for the county institutions, the grass is growing over the footings of turf in the bogs.  I do not know what conditions are like elsewhere but that is the position in regard to fuel supplies in my county. Other Senators can speak for their own areas.  I believe that it is a prospect about which there should be genuine alarm.  I do not know what the Ministry are doing about it, but I definitely feel that they must do something and they must do it quickly.  I know they cannot improve the weather and you cannot dry turf in bad weather, but if you are not going to have turf you must do something to build up reserves of other fuel.</P>
    <P>Some of the southern farmers tell me that the crops in their areas are looking well.  I came by train from my own home town yesterday through portion of my own county, Monaghan, Louth and portion of County Dublin.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about conditions in his own constituency but in my observations, I saw many poor, ragged, miserable potato crops.  The condition of the potato crop in County Louth is much worse than ever I have seen it in my life.  In many fields the stalks are only just coming over the soil.  The oat crop is standing still, not doing a thing.  With a prospect like that, I think we should not blind ourselves to the facts and the dangers ahead.  It behoves us accordingly to face up to that situation and to know what <Col N="452" /> Government policy is in the circumstances. Miracles happen, the weather clears up and we forget our troubles but in a variety of ways the output from our bogs and our fields this year as far as one can see will not be anything like adequate to our needs or anything like what we were able to reach last year.  In a situation like that a serious responsibility devolves on the Government to meet the crisis. We may be facing a crisis and it is important that we should hear from the Minister what the Government's view of the position is and what steps are being taken by them to meet the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>So many things are in order for discussion on a Bill like this that one is tempted to say quite a lot about a number of very different topics.  I should like to refer quite briefly to some of the matters that have been mentioned by former speakers.  If I did so in the order in which I noted them down, the result would be probably somewhat incoherent, but if I attempted to deal with them in their logical order, I should probably miss some of the things to which I should like to refer.  I should like first of all cordially to approve of the idea recommended by the Taoiseach and by Senator Counihan that some serious attempt should be made to finance the provision of dower houses on all but the very small farms throughout the country in order to facilitate the release of our agriculture from the dead hand of ageing people and to encourage the young to get married and to take effective control of these farms while they are still young and enterprising.  I am not quite so sure about the Senator's other suggestion about entailing property, especially of the larger farms.  It might have results which would not be desired by Senator Counihan.  It would certainly tend to undermine the value of a holding as a possible source of mortgage credit.  Whether that is something which the Senator would desire I do not know.  If the idea is worthy of consideration, as it probably is, I hope it will receive such consideration from people who are competent to judge of its feasibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> I should like to say that I, too, was very glad that our Government was able to take part in the recent European conferences.  I am sure that the part our representatives played there is disproportionally more influential than the size and the population of our country would appear to justify. I know that we are only a small country but we have a contribution to make to the various international problems which now threaten the safety of the world.  It is only right and proper that we should approach these problems with a desire to co-operate, to contribute as well as to receive.  We can contribute to the solution of such problems with profit to ourselves, both morally and economically. We may even draw a greater measure of profit from them than we can contribute to the needs of others.</P>
    <P>It is tempting to make some remarks about the very large issue which was raised by the first speaker, Senator Douglas, on the somewhat thorny problem of Partition.  It is easy to say something in that connection which might do more harm than good and I should hate to be the person guilty of any such crime.  But I think it is only fair to say that there is at present a good deal of <i>de facto</i> friendly co-operation going on between North and South, between officials of the Government of Northern Ireland and officials of the Government in Eire and even a good deal of friendly personal intercourse at a high level between prominent political personalities associated with our Government and prominent political personalities associated with the Government of Northern Ireland.  That is altogether as it should be and it is very desirable that it should take place.  If I have any criticism to make, it is that in this matter we appear to be rather ashamed of our virtues.  We do not hear enough about these friendly contacts that take place between prominent personalities North and South and we do not take enough credit for the fact that it is our policy to work in a friendly atmosphere to arrive at a solution of the various problems common to both areas.  That is not to say that that degree of friendly co-operation <Col N="454" /> is not capable of improvement.</P>
    <P>One suggestion that occurs to me is that there might be an exchange of Blue Books about problems which are in fact common to both areas.  We lately produced a report on post-emergency agricultural policy.  I have no doubt that that report was studied by the people who were investigating a similar problem in Northern Ireland. They have lately produced a report which has been very highly spoken of I have no doubt that that report could be studied with profit by us but it would be, I think, altogether preferable if there was an arrangement between both Governments that they should automatically circulate to members of Parliament both North and South Blue Books and reports of that kind which relate to problems which, though technically confined to one area, are in fact of common interest in both areas. I make that suggestion for what it is worth in the hope that some arrangement along these lines will be adopted. To mention some of the matters in which there is <i>de facto</i> co-operation between North and South, we have here in Dublin a veterinary college which caters for students from North and South as well as perhaps for a limited number of students from other parts of the world.  I think that it is Government policy that we should continue to educate students from Northern Ireland in our veterinary college.  Certainly, the people up there have not found themselves under any necessity to establish a veterinary college of their own.  That the veterinary college is common to all Ireland ought to be a source of profound satisfaction to us all, for not only is it evidence of an existing desirable relationship between North and South but it is a guarantee of co-operation in education dealing with veterinary diseases.</P>
    <P>Any public policy concerned with the elimination of tuberculosis or the various other diseases to which cattle are liable must treat the Border as simply non-existent because disease germs have no respect for customs posts and are quite capable of crossing the Border in either direction.  Consequently, any effective, long-term policy <Col N="455" /> for the elimination of veterinary diseases in Ireland must be one that is common to all Ireland.  The fact that the veterinary college is already common to all Ireland is a guarantee that such a policy will have nation-wide application.</P>
    <P>Then, we have the well-known fact that our Government contemplate the harnessing of the River Erne for the provision of hydro-electric energy, and the fact that co-operation with the North was sought and was forthcoming for that very desirable object to such an extent that a Bill was promoted in the British House of Commons to make it possible for the Northern Government to co-operate with us in that project.  The fact that that was done, and is going to be done on that scale, is a thing which we might very well regard as highly satisfactory and one about which the Government should be very proud and pleased.  The difficulties between North and South do not concern the personal relations between high-level personalities, either political or administrative, in that area and in this area but belong to a lower stratum of society in Northern Ireland. I happen to have been born and brought up in that part of the country and only a person who really knows the tough characters that exist in that part of the island can have any conception of the kind of human problem you are up against in trying to educate the whole of my co-religionists in Northern Ireland into a more tolerant outlook on the national ideal.  I might, in a sense, describe myself as having been born in the strictest sect of the Pharisees but that would not mean that I was born in an Orange atmosphere.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, my particular environment was one which had inherited a great deal of the Ulster liberal tradition and, in particular, the tradition of association with our Roman Catholic countrymen in opposition to the old landlordism.  Yet, I was perfectly conscious of the influence of the more extreme form of Orange mentality some 40 or 50 years ago.  Although, in the environment in which I found myself, it was considered not quite respectable to belong to the Orange Order, nevertheless, the ideas associated <Col N="456" /> with the Orange Order were even then very influential.  I regret to say that in the decades which have passed since then the tide of that ideology has risen and practically submerged the whole of Protestant Ulster, so that I do not know to what extent the particular strand of Protestant community I belong to can still be regarded as having retained its tolerant outlook on things religious and political.  The people who are the real difficulty in the Northern Ireland situation are not the leaders.  They are the ordinary people in factory and field who regard their Roman Catholic countrymen in all parts of the country as one of the most regrettable mistakes of the Almighty. I just do not see what we can do to change that beyond leaving them to the slow processes of time and to the developing educational effect of local self-government and gradually-increasing contracts with their countrymen, both in North and South.  That will take time.  It will be a slow business to get those people to take a more Irish outlook on things.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, if their leaders were to take a step in the direction of closer friendship and political co-operation with the rest of the country, they would probably find themselves deserted by their followers and would lose their function as leaders, because these northerners are extremely independent and, if the leaders behaved as they consider a certain Colonel Lundy behaved on a certain occasion, they would have no hesitation in changing those leaders and finding other leaders more to their liking.  I do not know whether or not that is an accurate description of the present state of feeling in Protestant Ulster.  It was, probably, true enough 10 or 20 years ago and, if it is not quite so accurate now, I should be glad to know that that is the case.  I think that the real problem in dealing with the North is not leaders but followers. Neither Senator Douglas nor I can be regarded in any sense as typical Northern Protestants.  We both have a liberal tradition, a liberal outlook on life and are not in any way influenced by the kind of ideology that is all too prevalent amongst the majority of our co-religionists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> That brings me more closely into contact with the subject-matter of the Appropriation Bill.  As to that, there are a couple of points which I should like to discuss.  I notice that the Minister has made provision for subsidising the provision of greenhouses in the Gaeltacht with a view to the cultivation of tomatoes and the like in that area.  I should like to give my strongest possible support to the general idea underlying that proposition.  More money can be made in a few square yards of tomatoes in the Gaeltacht than can be otherwise made in many square acres of the poor land most of these people happen to possess.  Tomato culture is ideally suited to the conditions of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>To be really profitable, it is desirable that the greenhouses should be heated during certain seasons of the year. They do not require a great deal of heat but it is highly desirable that the temperature should be prevented from falling below 55 degrees Fahrenheit.  If you can achieve that result, you can have early tomatoes for which you can command highly attractive prices, as at present.  We have difficulties in Dublin in heating greenhouses.  I myself was overcome by these difficulties when I attempted to provide heat in my greenhouse in the early part of the year.  All the fuel I could raise in any legitimate way was required for other purposes.  The people of the Gaeltacht suffer from no such disability because they have quantities of turf available all around which can be had for the labour of digging.  It has not to be transported any great distance.  It is perfectly feasible to heat a greenhouse or, at all events, a small greenhouse by using peat mould&mdash;that by product of turf which cannot be burned in ordinary grates and which is frequently thrown out and wasted.  I know, because I myself built a kind of fireplace in my own greenhouse which quite efficiently burns peat mould and which can be kept alive night and day. A final stoking about bedtime will keep it alive until the morning and in that way the temperature can be prevented from falling below the critical minimum.  Of course, there may be better methods for the utilisation of peat mould than the stove which I myself <Col N="458" /> constructed.  I know, for instance, that there is a kind of slow combustion stove, made of metal, which costs about £4 or £5 and which will burn peat mould quite efficiently and keep alive all night and prevent the temperature from falling too low.  For these reasons the Gaeltacht is ideally situated with a view to the large-scale production of tomatoes.  The more the people of that area can be encouraged to grow tomatoes and to heat the greenhouses in which they grow them the better for themselves and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Strawberry culture, also, is something which is entirely appropriate to the climate and soil of the Gaeltacht or, at all events to the County Mayo. I understand that strawberry plants in any other part of these islands are liable to a virus disease which sooner or later destroys them and the stocks have to be replaced.  The climate of County Mayo is such that the insect or whatever brings the disease cannot survive in that climate.  Consequently the strawberries of County Mayo are free from virus disease.  Elsewhere in these islands strawberry stocks have to be renewed and plants have frequently to be got from County Mayo.  That being so, obviously, strawberry culture is another economic activity that should be encouraged by every method of Government policy and persuasion that can be brought to bear on the people of that area, not only for the provision of fresh strawberries but also for the provision of strawberry plants to be exported to other countries. Again, I will say that there is more money in a few square yards of strawberries in County Mayo than might well be found in a few square acres of otherwise very indifferent agricultural land.</P>
    <P>Controversy exists with regard to the doing of things through the medium of Irish.  I can see no objection to the cultivation of tomatoes or strawberries through the medium of Irish. I would like to know if it is possible for a County Mayo man or for any other person who speaks and thinks in Irish naturally to acquire a leaflet in the Irish language telling him how to grow tomatoes and strawberries.  I would like to know if Department leaflets <Col N="459" /> are printed in Irish for circulation in the Gaeltacht which tell the inhabitant of the Gaeltacht how to go about the cultivation of tomatoes and strawberries and, if not, why not?  I speak without knowledge, but for the purpose of acquiring information.  The policy implied in this tomato-house business and I hope also in the encouragement of the growing of strawberries is one with a larger application than, perhaps, appeared to the Minister at the time.  It may have spiritual and cultural aspects as well as merely material aspects.  If a genuine economic foundation can be put underneath the people of the Gaeltacht thus making it possible for them to flourish in that environment more will be done for the preservation of the Irish language and the particular type of culture associated with that language than anything we can do by way of purely intellectual activity in the schools.</P>
    <P>I think also it would be well to approach the Gaelic question from the point of view of whether Gaelic can become a bond of union between the North and South and between the various elements in this country as a whole on this side of the Border rather than a source of division.  In that connection I recall again certain ancient memories.  I remember the time when the Gaelic League was founded.  I remember that even in the atmosphere in which I then lived in the County Tyrone it was a thrill to come across the first volume of O'Growney and to discover that there was actually spoken by people in the same island a language which had many points of interest even for us in the &ldquo;Black North&rdquo;.  We were, naturally, interested in the names of places.  It was quite interesting to us to be able to translate the names of different places into something that had a meaning.  That is only one aspect of the appeal which some knowledge of Irish makes even to people completely lacking in any direct contact with the Gaelic tradition.  The fact that the Gaelic League set out to preserve the knowledge of Irish in the country was not without awakening a sympathetic reaction even in the most unexpected quarters in Northern Ireland. <Col N="460" /> Whatever may be the matters of controversy&mdash;and I want to ignore them completely in this connection&mdash;I think one might emphasise that there are perfectly good reasons of a cultural character why we should desire that the Irish language should continue to be spoken in the Gaeltacht and even that the frontiers of the Gaeltacht should, if possible, expand. The Irish language is the repository of a folklore and a tradition which goes back not only to the beginning of Irish history but right back beyond the times of Roman invasion in European history and even to pre-Christian times too&mdash;right back to the dim recesses of the very beginning of human civilisation on this continent.</P>
    <P>The fact that Ireland escaped the conquest and invasion of the Roman Empire gives that particular tradition a value which it would not otherwise possess and makes it an object of profound interest to scholars, who are interested in these matters, from the most diverse countries in Europe.  We are, or we ought to be, familiar with the fact that scholars of European fame come over here to study Irish in the Blasket Islands and elsewhere.  They have very good cultural and archaelogical reasons for that interest.  It would be a disaster, not only from a national point of view but from a European point of view, and from the point of view of human civilisation in general, if the Irish language ceased to be the spoken language of the people of the Gaeltacht.  Therefore, I personally hope that that language will continue to be spoken in that particular area and even in a wider area than the present Gaeltacht.  Yet I see the immense difficulties that are about to confront that language if any attempt is made to spread the knowledge of the spoken language throughout the whole of Ireland.  It might be possible to secure substantial agreement about the ideal of establishing or preserving a geographically bilingual civilisation in much the same way as in Canada where you have French-speaking Canada and English-speaking Canada, or in South Africa, where you have Dutch-speaking South Africa and English-speaking South Africa, and between the two there is more or less a <Col N="461" /> perfect state of social and political equilibrium.</P>
    <P>The real danger is that Gaelic will disappear completely from the parts of the country where it is the natural and inherited language of the people.  If that happens, it will be a poor substitute if the rest of the country, once the link with the past is broken, could establish some kind of spurious modern Gaelic based only on the learning of the schools.  We ought to concentrate on preserving the language in the Gaeltacht and if that policy is pursued with success&mdash;and the provision of economic assistance for the Gaeltacht is an essential feature of the policy&mdash;you will do quite a lot to develop an interest in and a desire to learn the language on the part of the people living in the Galltacht, as they would naturally desire to be able to hold social intercourse with their fellow-countrymen in the Irish-speaking regions.  The more important the Gaeltacht can become from that point of view and the more vitalised it can be, from the point of view of the part it plays in the life of the nation as a whole, the greater the desire of the people in the Galltacht to acquire that knowledge because of their natural desire to use it in intercourse with their fellow-countrymen when paying a visit to the west.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Gaeltacht does contain a language and civilisation so different from the rest of the country and, indeed, so different from anything else in Europe, is one of the attractions of this country to the best kind of visitor and tourist.  I have often come across a most interesting type of English tourist in the most outlying parts of Donegal or the West of Ireland quite different from the kind of &ldquo;trippery&rdquo; person you might meet any day in Skerries or Bray.  The fact that the West has this traditional Irish culture, as well as other attractions of scenery and so on, is something which appeals to that particular type of tourist and visitor and one would like to continue to encourage them.</P>
    <P>As I see it, then, the real problem is to preserve the Gaeltacht in an economic and cultural sense and to <Col N="462" /> concentrate on that particular kind of policy which ought to arouse no controversy in any part of the country, on this side of the Border or the other. Let the problems that agitate us so frequently, and which arouse such acute controversy, await a solution in the course of the next decade or two, when we will be in a better position, if we are still alive, to solve those problems.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to follow the previous speaker very closely, but I would like to congratulate the Minister on this dual taxation agreement which has been reached.  I do not pretend to understand it in detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I do it with due reservation.  Anyhow, it has this aspect&mdash;that there is no longer any suggestion of a breach of agreement; whatever is done now is agreed between the two Governments.  I understand that any taxation which has been deducted hitherto, up to the present, will be made good.  Am I wrong?  That is the result of my cursory examination of this statement the Minister has made.  I must await further examination before I put forward any considered conclusion.</P>
      <P>I hope I am on safer ground when I congratulate the Government on being so prompt in accepting the invitations to the Paris Conference.  It is very gratifying to feel that we are associated in world affairs through our presence at that conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested and somewhat startled to hear the proposals made by Senator Douglas regarding closer union with the North.  I was in complete agreement with him in regard to his economic proposals and I think it would be very satisfactory if, before we protected any industries here, we should see whether there is any similar industry in the North that might serve the whole of Ireland and come to a reciprocal agreement on those lines. <Col N="463" /> With regard to the proposal that members of the Northern Ireland Parliament should be eligible to sit in the Dáil, I can see very serious repercussions. Fancy the Government being turned out of office by the vote of the Northern members.  It would raise a curious constitutional position.  I am all for the exercise of the utmost imagination in political developments, but I think the practical application of the doctrine of the Sermon on the Mount to politics might have curious results.  In any case, it would necessitate a complete revision of our own Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the right approach is to be calling constantly on our Government to improve our agriculture. There is a lot the farmers might do by their own association and initiative. The co-operative movement has largely developed agriculture in Denmark and we have here to a gratifying extent a co-operative movement, the extension of which is the most important step that could be taken in the revival of our agriculture.  There is a great danger in the Government coming along and holding people's hands when they do not understand what is being done.  There is a tendency to rely on the Government and exploit the Government. These grants the farmers are getting at cheap rates are very often not appreciated and do more harm than good.  There is an old saying: &ldquo;If you get money for nothing, you will get nothing for money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to separated milk, Senator Counihan seemed to think the Government should intervene to direct the farmer what to do with it. Surely the co-operative people are free agents and can be trusted to do the best thing?  If they choose to sell it for chocolate or other by-products, it is not the business of the Government to interfere.  Education is the real solution of the farmers' problem.  High on the priorities is a practical demonstration of an economic farm.  Ever since I have been in public life, I have implored the Government to encourage demonstration farms on a proper profit and loss basis, where the farmer could see in his own district a farm <Col N="464" /> somewhat similar in size to what he works himself, with a balance sheet showing the amount of profit on capital. That would be better education and a better thing for agriculture than any of the spoon-feeding which seems to be called for from all quarters.</P>
    <P>There is one small parochial matter I would ask the Government to consider, that is, to use all their influence to preserve the amenities of our cities. The Government gives grants to local authorities and I think it is to be deplored that, in Dublin, one of the city's greatest charms, the verges of grass on the canal banks, has been swept away.  Long lines of concrete are being put in their place.  There is no attempt in many cases to replace trees. Certain of the modern frontages in our city, surrounded by Georgian architecture, are deplorable.  As the Minister may know, an atrocity has been perpetrated in the form of an enclosure on the canal bank in the region of Harcourt Terrace.  Some 80 yards in length of the canal bank have been enclosed by ugly, old corrugated sheeting. Formerly the public had access to the canal bank where there is now this horrible enclosure.  These are outrages on the amenities of our city. I do not know who is responsible. Apparently, in the case of that enclosure there is divided responsibility between the canal authority and the corporation.  I am not going to pursue the matter but I do think that the Government should be concerned to preserve in any way it can the amenities of our city.</P>

      <P>Is mór an sásamh teacht isteach go dtí an díospóireacht seo agus a bheith ag éisteacht leis na hiarrachtaí atá déanta ag na Seanadóirí ar chabhair éigin a thabhairt don Aire Airgeadais.  Is mór an chúis sásaimh é sin i gcomórtas leis na hiarrachtaí a rinneadh sa Teach eile le dímheas do chaitheamh ar a chuid oibre agus gan cabhair ar bith a thabhairt dó.  Im thaobh féin de, nil mórán le rá agam ach amháin mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire Airgeadais go speisialta as ucht an méid suime atá léirithe aige i gcúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus as ucht an méid <Col N="465" /> atá déanta aige agus atá beartaithe aige le cuidiú leis na daoine sna dúthaí sin.  Ba mhaith liom go háirithe a chur in iúl dó chomh mór agus atá muintir na Gaeltachta faoi chomaoin aige, mar is aige atá siad faoi chomaoin, mar gheall ar an scéim a bhí i gceist ag an Seanadóir Mac Eoin anois beag, scéim na dtithe gloine.  Is fada daoine ag caint ar an nGaeltacht agus is ró-fhada go leor againn ag caint agus gan aon mholadh cinnte indéanta dá léiriú againn ach sa gcás seo, maraon le cásanna eile, ní caint atá déanta ag an Aire ach gníomh.</P>
      <P>An méid adúirt an Seanadóir Mac Eoin mar gheall ar thábhacht na scéime, aontaím leis agus ní dóigh liom gur gá dom aon ní a chur leis. Tá muinín mhór agam as muintir na Galltachta agus mura n-éiríonn leis an scéim ní horthu a bheas an milleán.</P>
      <P>An méid a luaigh an Seanadóir Mac Eoin i dtaobh sú talún a chur ag fás sa nGaeltacht, tá mórán brí ann, dar liom.  Blianta fada ó shoin a chuir ceann de na comhluchta sú i mBaile Atha Cliath, Muintir Lambe, sílim, triail ar bun sna ceantair mhóna féachaint an bhfeilfeadh dúiche mhóna do bharr mar sú talún agus ba é toradh na trialla sin gur fheil an talamh an cheantair sin níos fearr ná aon talamh eile ina chóir.  Agus b'fhéidir go mbfiú dhúinn agus sinn ag smaoineamh ar sheift eile a thiubhras cabhair do mhuintir na Gaeltachta cuimhniú ar an moladh a rinne an tSeanadóir Mac Eoin i dtaobh na sú talún.  Is barr an-luachmhar é agus b'fhéidir, mar adúirt seisean, go bhféadfaí bhfad níos mó airgid a dhéanamh as cúpla slat cearnach den talamh sin ná d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh as na mílte cearnacha agus é úsáid i chun críche eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin a rá chomh mór agus atá orm mar gheall ar na tionscail nua atá bunaithe le gairid, i ndeisceart Chonamara, tionscail déantóireachta bréagán luaidhe. An té adéarfadh bliain ó shoin go bhfeilfeadh an tionscail sin don Ghaeltacht, cheapfaí nár thuig sé an scéal. An duine adéarfadh go bhféadfadh muintir óg na Gaeltachta a bheith comh stuama agus chomh ceardúil in obair mar sin, bliain ó shoin, ní chreidfeadh <Col N="466" /> mórán é.  Ach ina dhiaidh sin, tá an tionscail ar bun le sé mhí anois. Tá stróinséar, Sualainneach, i bhfeighil na hoibre mar chomhairleoir.  Tá tuiscint aige ar an tionscail céanna ina lán áiteacha i gcéin.  Ina dhiaidh sin, is é an bharúil atá aige nár casadh air oibrithe chomh cliste nó chomh stuama leis na hoibrithe na atá faighte aige i measc mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Is mór is fiú an moladh sin.  Is mór is fiú do dhaoine lucht gnótha sa tír a mbeadh fúthu tionscail nua, tionscail éadroma go háirithe a bhunú cuimhniú ar an nGaeltacht, thuaidh, thiar agus theas, mar ionad le haghaidh na dtionscal sin.  Is mór, mar adeirim, is céart dúinn a bheith buíoch den Aire mar isé, is dóigh liom, sa chéad áit ba údar le smaoineamh ar a leithéid seo de thionscail a chur go dtí an Gaeltacht agus iad do chur chun cinn ann.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin tagairt a dhéanamh do mholadh eile atá le chur i bhfeidhm i mbliana agus sé an moladh é sin go ndéanfar iarracht ar níos mó caidhrimh a bhunú agus a chothú idir muintir na hEireann sa mbaile agus muintir na hEireann i gcéin.  Is dóigh liom gurb shin é ceann de na molta is tábhachtaí agus ceann de na molta is tráthúla dar cuireadh os comhair an Oireachtais nó os comhair na tíre le fada an lá.  Nuair a smaoiníos duine ar an méid Eireannach atá i gcéin nil aon amhras go mbeidh íonadh air go bhféadfadh sé a bheith amhlaidh níos mó do mhuintir na hEireann a bheith ina gcónaí i gcéin ná mar atá ina gcónaí sa mbaile.  Ach sin í an fhirinne. Tráchtamuid go minic ar thábhacht na hEireannach i stair na dtiortha éagsúla agus níl aon amhras ná gur mór an pháirt a bhí ag Eireannaigh ina gcúrsaí síud.  I ngach tír agus i ngach brainse oibre agus léinn agus i ngach gairm beatha is mór an tairbheach an bhaint a bhí ag na hEireannaigh leofa. D'fhéadfaí a rá gur mór atá an domhan faoi chomaoin ag Eireannaigh.  Ach ina dhiaidh sin is fíor é le blianta anuas ná fuil, dar liomsa ar chor ar bith, an oiread spéise á chur ag muintir na hEireann sa tír máthrach agus ba mhaith linn.  Tá fáth leis sin. D'éirigh an saol i gcéin an-achrannach le blianta.  Thairis sin, tá cúrsaí móra polaitíochta ionann is socraithe in <Col N="467" /> Eirinn.  Mar a bé scéal na Sé gContaethe, is ar éigin go bhfuil anois aon cheist mhór pholaitíochta le réiteach againne a measfadh ár muintir i gcéin gur ghá dhóibh aon spéis mhór a chur inti.  Ar an abhar sin, ní mór dúinn sa mbaile iarracht faoi leith a dhéanamh leis an gcaidreamh a chothú agus a chur chun cinn idir muid fhéin agus ár muintir i gcéin.  Is ar an abhar sin go bhfuil áthas faoi leith orm gur cheap an Rialtas go mba cheart an iarracht a dhéanamh ar an gcaidreamh sin a neartú.  D'fhéadfadh Eire a lán a dhéanamh i gcúrsaí eadarnáisiúnta i gcúis an chultúra agus i gcúis an charadais agus an tsíochána go háirithe.  Tá mórán slí ann i gcúrsaí eadarnáisiúnta ina bhféadfadh Eireannaigh an dea-thionchur a chur i bhfeidhm agus cruth níos fearr a chur ar chúrsaí agus ar imeachta sibhialtachta. Is ar éigin atá aon tír ann is feiliúnaí chuige sin ná an tír seo.</P>
    <P>Ach ní éireoidh linn mar is cóir go dtí go mbeidh dlúth-cheangal idir clanna na hEireann gach áit agus iad ag obair as lamha a chéile chun an chuspóra sin.  Ar an abhar sin amháin, ba cheart dúinn a bheith riméadach go bhfuil an moladh seo ceaptha amach ag an Rialtas, agus tá súil agam, nuair cuirfear i bhfeidhm é go mbeidh an rath sin air ba cheart a bheith.  O tharla go bhfuil sé socraithe go bhfágfar ceapadh na scéime faoi choiste speisialta a cuirfear le chéile chuige, is dóigh liom nach ceart dom féin aon rud a rá anseo faoi cén chaoi ba cheart an moladh féin a chur i ngniomh.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin eile a bhaineas leis an mBille atá os ár gcomhair; baineann sé le scéal na Gaeilge agus arís is scéal é a thugas an-tsásamh dom.  Scéal é sin go bhfuil scéim faoi leith beartaithe, agus le cur i ngníomh i mbliana, le go mbeidh scoláireachtaí fiúntachta le fáil ag cuid mhaith daoine óga chun dul go dtí na coláistí Ollscoile sa tír agus a gcuid cúrsaí léinn a dhéanamh i nGaeilge.  Nuair bhí mé ag caint anseo tamall ó shoin, luaigh mé leis an Seanad nár thaithnigh liom ceann de na moltaí a bhí déanta nuair a bhí airgead dá chur ar fáil do na Coláistí Ollscoile, go <Col N="468" /> n-ardófaí na taillí ar na daoine a bheadh a freastail ar an Coláistí Ollscoile i nGaillimh agus ag déanamh a gcúrsaí i Gaeilge ann.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a admháil nach raibh eolas agam, nach raibh tuigsint agam, nuair a bhí mé ag caint an uair sin, ar comh mór leathan agus a bhí na moltaí i dtaobh cur ar aghaidh na Gaeilge san Ollscoil in san am.  Ní amháin go mbeidh na scoláireachtaí luachmhara le fáil ag daoine óga as an nGaeltacht ach beidh siad le fáil ag daoine óga ón nGalltacht agus, ina theannta sin beidh duais luachmhar le fáil ag mic léinn in aon cheann de na Coláistí Ollscoile a shásós lucht ceannais na hOllscoile go bhfuil siad ábalta ar scrúdú a sheasamh agus a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh i nGaeilge.  Feicthear dom anois gur fearr na moltaí nua seo ná aon scéim dá raibh ann roimhe.</P>
    <P>Anois, leis an taobh sin den scéal, scéal na Gaeltachta, scéal na Gaeilge agus scéal na cultúra, d'fhagaint im dhiaidh, níl le rá agam ach go raibh áthas orm a chloisteáil ón Seanadóir Baicstear go bhfuil muinín mhór aige as an síláiste le cabhair a thabhairt don tionscail talmhaíochta sa tír.  Tá ceist ba mhaith liom cur air maidir le sin agus cuirim an cheist anois d'ainneoin nach bhfuil sé is lathair.  Céard eile a d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh sa tír le cúrsaí síláiste a chur cinn thar mar tá déanta go dtí seo?  Tá ar fud na tíre, i ngach condae foirgintí móra síláiste tógtha ag an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus tá siad sin ann mar shampla do na feilméaraí i ngach condae, ar cén chaoi iad a thógáil agus ar cén chaoi iad a líonadh, ar cén chaoi an síláiste a dhéanamh agus a shabháil.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá deontas&mdash;deontas réasúnta, is dóigh liom&mdash;le fáil ón Roinn Talmhaíochta a chuireas ar a chumas feilméara ar bith an &ldquo;silo&rdquo; féin a dhéanamh, agus na foirgintí féin is furasta do na feilméaraí a ndéanamh má tá stuaim iontú, as an airgead a gheibheann siad.  Sin rud ba mhaith liom eolas a fháil air céard eile d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh, thairis sin, le cuidiú le feilméaraí na tíre na buntáistí atá ag baint leis an saghas seo oibre a sholáthar dóibh féin?  Céard eile d'féadfaí a dhéanamh thar an méid atá déanta cheana?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> Tá ceist amháin eile go mba mhaith liom do chur ar an Seanadóir Baicstear, go háirithe, ó tharla go bhfuil baint aige go speisialta leis an tionscail déiríochta.  Cén fáth nach bhféachann an cumann a bhfuil baint aige leis le rud éigin a dhéanamh chun feabhas a chur ar an modh atá ag na huachtarlanna an bainne a chruinniú ó na feilméaraí? Is dóigh liom nach bhfuil aon tsompla ann is fearr ar bhásta agus ar mhí éifeacht tionscail ná an modh ar a gcruinnítear faoi láthair an bainne i gcóir na n-uachtarlann, sé sin, na feilméaraí iad féin teacht go dtí an t-uachtarlan gach maidin.  Cuireann sin am agus saothar na bhfeilméaraí amú.  Cuireann sé a lán de thairbhe capall agus trucall amú freisin. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé ceart go leor do na feilméaraí a chónaíos i bhfoigseacht cúpla míle féin don uachtarlann, ach má bhíonn ar an bhfeilméar ceithre mhíle&mdash;agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil cuid mhór feilméaraí ann a chaitheas 5, 6 agus suas le 7 míle a chur díobh gach maidin go dtí an t-uachtarlann&mdash; is dóigh liom gur mór an bhásta é sin agus gurb é ceann de na rudaí is mó atá ag cur cúl le éifeacht an tionscail déiríochta.  Is é ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Seanadóir Baicstear, ó tharla gur ionadaí é anseo ón gcumann is mó sa tír atá ag freastal ar lucht na déiríochta, go scrúdófaí an scéal sin agus go ndéanfaí iarracht ar scéim níos rathúla a ceapadh agus do chur i bhfeidhm, thar mar atá ann faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Ó Dubhghlas, níor chuala mé ar fad é mar bhí moill orm ag teacht isteach, ach maidir le caidhreamh idir an pháirt seo den tír agus na Sé Condaethe, sé an rud a bhí ag rith trí m'aigne le cupla seachtain ná ceist a chur ar an Aire ar bhfiú dó rud éigin do dhéanamh le cose do chur leis an oiread sin daoine ag teacht isteach anseo ó na Sé Condaethe. Maidir le daoine a theacht isteach anseo ó na Sé Condaethe, tagann siad go líonmhar, ró-líonmhar bh'féidir. Bhíos thíos i nDáilcheantar an Aire féin le gairid agus d'innsigh duine de na Gárdaí dom go dtagann suas le céad no céad go leith busanna speisialta isteach anseo ó na Sé <Col N="470" /> Condaethe gach deireadh seachtaine. Ach do réir mar thuigim, tagann anchuid busanna speisialta isteach gach lá sa tseachtain gan trácht ar na mílte daoine a thagas ar na traentacha. Cheapfá go raibh caidreamh go leor ar an mbealach sin agus ceapfaí go mbeadh tuigsint mhaith ag na daoine údain ar an aigne atá againn ina dtaobh agus ar an saghas saol atá againn.  Ba chóir fios a bheith acu gur mian linn a bheith cairdiúil leo agus go bhfuilmuid sásta dul as ar mbealach le cuidiú leo.</P>
    <P>Is cosúil go dtaithníonn sinne leo agus is cosúil go bhfuil meas acu ar an saol atá againn.  Is cosúil nach bhfuil an saol anseo chomh dona agus a deirtear amannta.  Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Counihan, &ldquo;is glas iad cnoic i gcéin&rdquo;, ach mar a dúirt fear eile ina dhiaidh sin, &ldquo;ach na féarach&rdquo;. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an scéal chomhhíontach in sna Sé Condaethe nó in áiteanna eile agus adeir daoine áirithe. Bíodh sin mar atá, tá mé go láidir ar aon aigne leis an Seanadóir Ó Dubhghlas mar gheall ar an oiread seo caidrimh agus cairdeasa a chur chun cinn idir na daoine anseo agus muintir na Sé Condaethe, ach níor mhiste, má abraim an méid seo, gur truaighe nach bhfuil an dúil ceanna le tabhairt faoi deara ar an taobh eile agus atá orainn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and the House to the extreme scarcity of feeding stuffs for the feeding of pigs and poultry.  The bad harvest of 1946 is now telling its tale.  The farmers cannot get feeding of any kind from the shops or the mills.  The situation is very serious.  I cannot make any constructive proposal as to how that situation is to be remedied.  Perhaps somebody may devise some scheme whereby we may get in some feeding stuffs from outside.  That may or may not be possible.  They are very necessary if they can be got.  Senator Baxter contrasted the position of Irish agriculture with continental agriculture and said that we were very much behind the times.  I agree with him on that.  It has to be remembered, however, that they were growing beet on the Continent 150 years ago.  We started <Col N="471" /> to grow it in a small way in 1925.  That, I think, represents the position generally with regard to agriculture here and in continental countries.  The people in those countries were forging ahead at the time that the people of this country were engaged in fighting rack rents and bad landlords.  Agricultural education did not begin in this country until within the last 40 or 50 years, whereas they were progressing in it in Continental countries 150 or 200 years ago.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan referred to the question of separated milk, and suggested, I think, that he would compel farmers to take it back from the creameries to feed it to calves and pigs. It would be desirable, of course, to have big stocks of cattle and pigs in the country, but I object entirely to the principle of compelling the farmer to be the fool of the family and to be what he has been for many years, the pack-horse of the community.  I think that the farmer should be allowed to sell his produce wherever he can get the most money for it and I am sure everybody will agree with that.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan referred to Shorthorn cattle, and said that the yield of the Shorthorn cow, as seen at the Ballsbridge Show, was a gallon of milk per day more than out of any other breed.  Senator Baxter referred to the Friesian breed of cattle that he saw in Holland.  It looked as if we might have a battle of the breeds here between the two Senators.  I think a good deal can be said for both breeds of cattle.  Personally, I am inclined to favour the development of the native breed, and I do so from the practical and commonsense point of view.  The Minister for Agriculture is now to have the advice of a consultative council on agriculture. I am sure that the members of that council will deal with the question of the breed of cattle and that the Minister will get very good advice from them.  I think that our cattle are fairly all right if only we could get more milk from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has announced a new policy for the growing of tomatoes in glass houses in the Gaeltacht areas which are generally <Col N="472" /> referred to as the West of Ireland.  I do not know whether that is strictly accurate or not.  My view is that we have a milder climate in the south, and that experiments in the growing of tomatoes in the southern areas would be likely to be more successful than in the western areas.  I am informed that in Jersey tomatoes are grown out door all over the island.  I think there are some places on our coast where that could be done with equal success.  It is a matter on which expert opinion might be got.  The Minister's idea is an excellent one, and I congratulate him on it.  I am sure that this scheme will mean increased activity so far as horticulture generally is concerned.  I have no doubt that the scheme outlined in connection with the glass houses will be successful.  I am certain, however, that if it were tried in some of the southern areas there is a chance that it would be even more successful.  I do not want to say anything against the West because, I want to see this scheme a success, and I prophesy that it will be a great success.  I congratulate the Minister on having thought of the idea.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to dower houses.  That is a matter to which the Taoiseach has made reference on many occasions.  He said in the Dáil that, when he urged something on that line some years ago, people laughed at him. I believe that up to quite recently people laughed at him when he mentioned it, but a big change in regard to that matter has since taken place, and I think everybody agrees with the Taoiseach now that if the proposal he referred to were taken up that it would be a step in the right direction.  The greatest need in carrying out a scheme of that sort would be of course to find the money required.</P>
    <P>I may say in that connection that there is a great need in the matter of providing more houses in the rural districts. It is the greatest need that we have.  There is no labour problem in those districts in the country where there are cottages and workers' houses, but in those districts where there are no such houses the labour shortage is very acute.  There is an urgent necessity to build more houses in the rural <Col N="473" /> areas.  I think that if we had more houses it would help to settle the rural labour problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter also referred to the making of silage, and referred to the fact that on some farms in Holland he had seen as many as eight silos.  The making if silage has been a great problem in this country for many years.  I think that if the weather we had during the present season will not succeed in getting our farmers to make silage well then nothing will ever make them make it.</P>
    <P>The fuel position is a very serious one.  The people who live near the bogs say that the situation is very bad.  I am afraid that the position in the coming winter is going to be very serious, and that people will have to rely on supplies of firewood.  If that should happen, then it will mean that all the firewood in the country will have to be cut down.  If the Minister could do anything about the weather he would be doing a good day's work for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, from the last Senator's speech, down in Cork they always feel that people in glass houses should not throw stones, because I saw that the Senator was getting some very nearly dirty looks from Senator O'Dea on the subject of the west and the south.  I do not propose to follow on that line but, having interrupted Senator Sir John Keane so rudely on the question of the double income-tax agreement which the Minister announced, I feel I must say a few sentences on the subject.  As I understand the position, it is far from being as satisfactory as Senator Sir John Keane would think.  The position is that on the 5th April we will have three financial years to which these provisions will apply&mdash;1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48, which is at present current. As I understand the announcement that the Minister has made, the effect of the agreement is that as from 6th April, 1945, he accepts the British contention that their Section 52 of the 1945 Act was not in any way a breach of the double taxation agreement operative since 1926 between us.  In respect of preference shares that is a <Col N="474" /> small temporary alleviation for the purpose perhaps, as the Minister indicates in his memorandum, of enabling those preference shareholders to get out of the shares in which they are at present interested.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to argue at any great length whether the 1945 British Act did or did not infringe the 1926 agreement; but I do think that there was certainly an argumentative case for suggesting that it did, for suggesting that it was, at any rate, desirable that there should have been in respect of ordinary shareholders and ordinary dividends the same opportunity for the three years mentioned to enable them to adjust the position so that they would not suffer.  It is unfortunate that the Minister has not been able to achieve that, and it is, perhaps, unfortunate also that the relief in respect of preference shareholding has only been so temporary as he has indicated.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to whether the Minister meant the second last paragraph of his memorandum to refer exclusively to preference dividends or to refer to preference and ordinary dividends, where he said that the charge to Irish tax will not exceed the amount of the net dividends.  The Minister did not indicate in his speech whether in any way this was to be retroactive. The situation has been since 6th April, 1945, that British dividends received in that year were liable to assessment in the 1946-47 year and that for 1946-47 there was in respect of those dividends an assessment to Irish tax on an income that was in fact not received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangement which the Minister is proposing in respect of his own revenue is a very proper one.  I suggest to him, however, that in fairness it should operate as from the first year in which these dividends came into Irish assessment, which would be the 1946-47 year in the case of any ordinary person and only up to the 1945-46 year in the case of a person who was liable to be assessed on British or other untaxed interest for the first time during that year.  No doubt, as the Minister indicated, we will have a very much detailed opportunity of considering the <Col N="475" /> whole question when the legislation is introduced, but, having rather rudely interrupted Senator Sir John Keane, I do think it was reasonable that I should make that comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's comment is inaccurate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>From my knowledge of the Minister, there is nothing that he would like better than to be able to knock down something which is inaccurate, because he is very fond of suggesting that something has been said which has not been said and then knocking that ninepin down.  I am delighted if I have given him the opportunity of knocking down a correct ninepin on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Curiously enough, the next thing I wish to refer to is something that, in my view, is probably inaccurate. Senator Sir John Keane congratulated the Government on the manner in which they so promptly accepted the invitation to the Paris Conference and I reiterate the congratulation.  There appeared in last Sunday's paper a statement attributed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is the senior of the two Irish representatives there, that I feel quite certain is inaccurate. I mention it now for the purpose of asking the Minister to make certain that his colleague when he returns will take an early opportunity of contradicting the report that was put out.</P>

    <P>Notwithstanding all the things I say about the Government from time to time, I do not think that the Government would have subscribed to the principles that were ascribed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I do not think the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Government would have made, by inference or in any other way, the suggestion that was put in the mouth of the Minister that they were, so to speak, supporting any case against that conference that was made from Moscow.  I do not believe for a moment that that is true, and I think it is intensely desirable in the national interest that the very moment an opportunity arises there should be a contradiction by the <Col N="476" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce. I mention the matter to-night so that the Minister we have here can ensure that his colleague deals with it in that way as soon as possible.  It was, of course, a report which was not furnished by any newsagency or newspaper in this country.  It was a report supplied by a foreign newsagency in the ordinary way of business and no blame should attach to any paper here.  But I hope, and I believe, that it was inaccurate and for that reason I feel that it should be contradicted.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill on which members of the House get an opportunity of dealing with various small points of Government administration that may arise from time to time.  It is sometimes, perhaps, dealt with in a more detailed way than it has been this evening.  I do not want to delay the House very long on it, but there are a couple of matters which I think are absolutely essential to be dealt with. One is a matter that appertains to the Minister's own Department, or a section of it, namely, the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>There is at present a necessity, owing to shortages, to ensure that people coming to this country do not take out of this country goods which are in short supply.  The Revenue Commissioners have seen that there are at various ports of arrival appropriate notices setting out lists of banned goods, etc. Notwithstanding that, it is the practice, unfortunately, in certain establishments in the country, that visitors are advised that they are able to purchase and bring out goods without licence and with perfect freedom.  The result is that when they are leaving and they arrive at the port of embarkation, the goods in question are confiscated.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this matter should be approached from a slightly different angle, from an angle of which I had personal experience when I had to go to Switzerland recently.  The angle from which it is approached there is that as every visitor arrives in the country, he is given a small, official pamphlet, about half the size of an Order Paper which sets out specifically, <Col N="477" /> not what we do here&mdash;&ldquo;You cannot bring out X, Y and Z,&rdquo; giving a huge list of banned things&mdash;but that you can bring nothing out of Switzerland except a few items, which are named. In the existing situation, with so many things short, that is more or less the position we are bound to be in here and that method puts a visitor in a more understanding position than if you present him with a very long list of banned articles which, quite frankly, few people will ever read.</P>
    <P>I suggest there should be a similar method adopted here.  When you file into the customs shed in Switzerland you are given an authoritative, Governmental slip indicating that you are not entitled to bring out anything except the items named and that for everything else you must get a licence. The same thing could be done here without much expense or difficulty.  It would mean that there would be much less trouble for visitors here who are, perhaps, persuaded by establishments anxious to consider their own profits into purchasing articles, and when they try to take those things away, they find they are not permitted by the regulations to do so.  I want it to be quite clear that I am not making any suggestions against the Revenue Commissioners.  The shortages are there, the law is there and it is being carried out.  It is purely a matter of the method of approach.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion I will make to the Minister, and which I hope he will convey to his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, is that there should be, at an early date, a considerable change in our housing regulations.  I came across a case the other day which, I understand from the local official concerned, is somewhat common in the country, and represents a position which will have to be remedied sooner or later.  The regulation relating to houses built by local authorities and which have received the subsidy is so rigid that it is almost unworkable.  The case I have in mind is that of a tenant of a county council cottage.  She was evicted under a court order because she was grossly in arrears with her rent. <Col N="478" /> When the county council took the cottage over they found that it had been damaged considerably.  The timber in the cottage had been used as firewood and the house generally was broken up in a most wanton and destructive fashion.  The tenant was put out and about a fortnight afterwards another house in the neighbourhood became vacant.</P>
    <P>The tenant meanwhile had moved into quarters that were grossly overcrowded. She had a family and, under the regulation, the county medical officer of health had no option but to recommend that the tenant who had just been put out of one cottage should be put into the cottage that had fallen vacant, because he had, on health grounds and under the subsidy regulation, to rule that she was the most deserving case, because of the circumstances in which she was residing. That appears to me to be a type of case that was not envisaged at the time the regulation was made and, if the regulation is correctly interpreted, I think everyone will agree that it is one that should be changed as soon as possible and there should be more elasticity so as to enable the local authority to differentiate between one case and another.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of rumours in the city and references in the newspapers with regard to petrol rationing.  This does not come under the Minister's Department, but the responsible Minister is away and perhaps the Minister for Finance will be able to make some statement as to whether those rumours are correct or not.  Many people are at the moment making arrangements in respect of holidays next month and, as they may have very substantially to alter these arrangements if there is to be any alteration in the petrol rationing, it will be very much appreciated if the Minister would make some statement. Any alteration in relation to the supply of such an essential commodity as petrol is a matter of very great importance from the point of view of the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>Bhíos ag éisteacht leis an Seanadóir Mac Eoin <Col N="479" /> ag caint faoin nGaeltacht agus an chabhair is féidir a thabhairt don Ghaeltacht.  Is é an imní atá orm ná go mbainfí mar bhrí as na cainteanna a bhí ar siúl ag daoine anseo gur chóir do lucht na Gaeltachta an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo.  Molaimse an chomhairle agus an teagase sin, dar ndoigh, agus molann lucht na Gaeltachta an teagasc céanna Ach ba mhaith liom go dtuigfeadh an tAire agus gach aoinne go ndéanfar sin sa Ghaeltacht má thuigeann an Ghaeltacht go bhfuil an chuid eile den tír dáiríribh faoin chuspóir cheanna.</P>
      <P>Níor cheart dúinn bheith i gcomhnaí á iarraidh go ndéanfadh muintir na Gaeltachta beart laochta ar son na teangan, má braitheann siad an chuid eile den tír ag tréigint na teangan sin.  Tá sé riachtanach cabhrú leis an nGaeltacht, le tionscail, le scoláireachtaí, le moladh, le dea-mhéinn, chomh mór agus is féidir don Rialtas é dhéanamh. Tá rud eile riachtanach agus is é sin, é a chur ina luí ar an nGaeltacht go bhfuil Baile Atha Cliath agus an Ghalltacht agus an Rialtas agus lucht ceannais na hEaglaise agus lucht ceannais agus cumhachtaí an náisiúin ar fad i ndáiríribh sa cheist seo; agus ná fuilimíd á fhágaint mar dhualgas ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta amháin agus ag ligint dúinn fhéin greadadh ar aghaidh chomh Gallda agus riamh.  Tá muintir na Gaeltachta istigh i gceantair bhochta anacracha, gan tionscail mhóra iontu, agus ní féidir leo maireachtaint ar a gcuid dea-mhéinn don Ghaoluinn.</P>
      <P>Molaimse an Rialtas ar son an méid a thuigeann siad gur chóir cabhair a thabhairt sna ceantair sin.  Tá aigne bheo acu ar an scéal agus tá méadú ar na beartanna ar aigne acu.  Is abhar misnigh dom fhéin agus do na daoine eile a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeltacht go bhfuil an Rialtas ag déanamh an méid seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an méid adúirt an Seanadóir Mac Eoin, níor cheart go n-abróimis gur orthu féin sa Ghealtacht atá sé mar dhualgas an teanga a chothú, i dtreo is go mbeadh áit againn chun dul ann ar laethe saoire, go mbeadh a fhios againn go bhfuil cultúr ar leith ann agus teanga ar <Col N="480" /> leith acu&mdash;ach nár chóir dúinn ligint do na rudaí sin cur isteach orainn fhéin ná ar na daoine Gallda sa chuid eile den tír.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith le tionscail nua a chur ar bun, béidir nár mhiste iarraidh ar an Rialtas cúram a thabhairt do thionscail atá cheana ann, agus i leith an scéil sin, tá rud a bhaineann go cruinn díreach le tionscail sa Ghaeltacht. Le 4 nó 5 mí, tá an ceantar Gaelach, Corca Dhuibhne, gan traen ar bith agus tá baol ann go mbeidh sé amhlaidh feasta mura gcuirfidh an Rialtas ina luí ar Chóras Iompair Eireann gur cheart dóibh freastal ar Chorca Dhuibhne, príomh-Ghaeltacht Dheiscirt na tíre.  Sin rud is féidir leis an Aire a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge amáireach, más fonn leis é.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam nach é an tIarthar amháin áta i gceist faoi scéim na dtrátaí.  Tá scéim na trátaí triallta cheana fhéin ag daoine priomháideacha in áit nó dhó sa Ghaeltacht i gCiarraidhe agus tá éirithe leis.  Is dóigh liom gur cheart go leathfaí na nithe sin&mdash;ceann san Iarthar agus ceann nó dhó sa Deisceart agus bheith cinnte go bhfuil an t-eolas iomlán ag na daoine a bheith i mbun na h-oibre.  Measaim go mbraitheann toradh na scéime ar éifeacht na ndaoine sin.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir don Rialtas feidhm a bhaint as an sluagh mór Gaeilgeoirí atá glactha isteach sa Stát-Sheirbhís le cúig bliana déag.  Tá an Stát-Sheirbhís lán de Ghaeilgeoirí faoi láthair.  Tá siad le fáil go mór mhór imeasc an dreama óig sa tSeirbhís, ach ní tuigtear domsa go bhfuil feidhm á bhaint as Ghaeilge na ndaoine sin laistigh den tSeirbhís, ná sa chuid sin den tSeirbhís a bhfuil baint aige leis an bpobal taobh amuigh nó an cuid a bhíonn i bhfeighil an phobail.  Ba mhaith liom go dtiocfadh an lá go ndéanfaidh Roinn éigin den tSeirbhís a fhógairt &ldquo;go ndéanfar an gnó anseo feasta i nGaeilge amháin.&rdquo;  Is chuige sin atá ciall le bheith ag toghadh Gaeilgeoirí ina gcéadtaí gach bhan don tSeirbhís phoiblí.  Caithfidh an lá teacht go mbainfear feidhm as mar sin, agus sílim go bhfuil an lá sin druidte linn. Ba cheart don Rialtas tosnú in áit <Col N="481" /> éigin agus a rá: &ldquo;Ó Lá Fhéile Pádraig sa bhiian seo chugainn, ní raghaidh aon chomhfhreagarthas nó aon litreacha amach ón Roinn seo ach i nGaeilge amháin.&rdquo;  Ba mhaith liom go dtosnófaí air sin i Roinn an Aire féin, mar sin é an Roinn mháistriúil agus dá dtosnófaí úsáid na Gaeilge amháin laistigh den tSeirbhís sa tslí sin, bheadh toradh torthúil ar fad ar dhaoine sa tSeirbhís agus dheimhneodh sé don Ghaeltacht go bhfuilimidne anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath i ndáiríribh.</P>
    <P>Fógraíodh cúpla lá ó shoin i dtaobh scoláireachtaí nua i gcoir lucht meánscol go dtí na hOllscoileanna, Molaim na scoláireachtaí sin agus is dóigh liom go mbeidh tionchur ana-fhónta orthu. An bhfuil aon tsocrú déanta nó á bheartú chun go bhfreagróidh na Coláistí Ollscoile don rud fónta sin?  I gcás na nOllscoileanna in nGaillimh, i gCorcaigh, i Mághnuadhat, i mBaile Atha Cliath, i gColáiste na Tríonóide, beidh tuairim 50 scoláire ag dul isteach gach bliain.  Is é an gnáth-chúrsa ná trí bliaina agus sin 150 sa tríú bliain. An amhlaidh a bheidh an scéal sa chuid is mó de na hOllscoileanna, go mbeidh iachall ar na scoláirí suí síos agus Béarla d'fhoghlaim, chun glacadh leis na leachtaí agus an oideachas?  Ní dóigh liom gur ceart é sin ar chor ar bith, agus ba mhaith liom tuille eolais d'fháil ón Aire faoin bpointe sin.</P>

      <P>If all the Senators who participated in the debate did not keep too closely to the subject, the discussion at least has had a fair share of idealism, if punctuated at times by surprises.  One of the surprises, so far as I am concerned, was the rôle which Senator Douglas adopted.  Before he spoke I did not know that he was the official spokesman in this House of Clann na Poblachta but evidently he is, because I noticed that he argued the case for the admission to this House of the public representatives elected to the Six County Parliament. Probably there is nothing wrong with that but coming from Senator Douglas it was one of the surprises of the debate.  I must admit, too, that when I heard Senator Johnston professing a desire that we should Gaelicise the West Britons I got a bit of a shock.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the Senator wanted to Gaelicise the West Britons of the hinterland of Dublin so that when they go to Mayo and Donegal on holidays they would be able to converse with Gaelic speakers there.  Perhaps the Senator will, on another occasion, elaborate the difference between my interpretation of his speech and what he actually said but that is the way it appeared to me.</P>
      <P>Another surprise in the debate was the suggestion of Senator Sir John Keane which must have shocked the Minister.  His suggestion was that if we were to bring the Sermon on the Mount into our politics we must scrap the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the correction but I think still that the suggestion underlying the Senator's statement must be embarrassing for the Minister&mdash;not for me, of course.</P>
      <P>I must say, too, now that Senator Counihan has returned, that his speech, I thought, was delightfully realistic. Senator Counihan has his mind firmly fixed on the cattle trade and he does not miss many opportunities to tell us of its trials and tribulations.  As a matter of fact when he was speaking my mind went back to a prayer which was attributed to a member of the British House of Parliament in the early days of the 18th century.  The prayer ran something like this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Oh Lord, Thou knowest I have nine houses in the City of London and that I have lately purchased an estate in fee simple in Essex.  Therefore, I beseech Thee, Oh Lord, to preserve the two counties of Middle-sex <Col N="483" /> and Essex from fire and earthquakes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan, I am sure, will ask me to give him a copy of the prayer which he can suitably alter to suit the circumstances of the cattle trade.  I shall be glad to help him.</P>
    <P>I was also wondering whether, if I had delayed my intervention, we might not have completed the circle if Senator Mrs. Concannon were to intervene to give us a dissertation on the <i>Old Orange Flute</i> and perhaps Senator Lord Longford might give us another dissertation on <i>The Sins of Society.</i>  Had we got that far we probably might have considered that no matter was too irrelevant to debate because at least we would have been translated to <i>Tir na nOg.</i></P>
    <P>I am very sorry that I do not feel at all qualified to participate effectively in a debate on this idealistic level because I want to talk mainly about mundane things, things that affect the lives of very many simple humble people.  I am just wondering at this moment whether, in fact, my theme is related to the motion for the Second Reading <Col N="484" /> of the Appropriation Bill.  If, however, I happen to be out of order I submit I am not the first offender to-night.  It is no disparagement of the Chair, in fact I think it is a tribute to the benignity of the Chair, that we can be all so delightfully irrelevant without raising the suspicions of the Cathaoirleach or causing him to lose his temper.</P>
    <P>I was going to suggest that perhaps one of the things that is of very great concern to a large body of people is the price we are asked to pay for ordinary commodities that enter every humble home.  I have a feeling that I may be permitted to refer to this subject because there appears to be an amount of money in the Appropriation Bill for administration referring to prices including subsidies and all these other devices which are adopted so ineffectively to stabilise or control prices and which I think have completely failed in their purpose.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until Thursday, 17th July, 1947, at 3 p.m.</P>
